CAFÉ MINAMDANG

00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,081
EPISODE 3

3
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,203
What is this place?

4
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,542
What does he think he is? A cult leader?

5
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,709
Jeez.

6
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,005
Oh, gosh!

7
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,220
Shoot.

8
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,013
That gave me a shock.

9
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,000
It'll make things difficult for both of us
if you record this,

10
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,543
so please hand over your phone.

11
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,721
I'll put mine in too.

12
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,818
COPYING DATA

13
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,529
Stall for time until we finish
copying data from her phone.

14
00:03:17,196 --> 00:03:20,909
I know it was you who tampered with
the evidence for my husband's murder case.

15
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,871
Hand over the evidence before the general
stockholders' meeting is held.

16
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,795
So you're going to use it as a weapon
to oust the vice-chairman at the meeting?

17
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,382
Well, if that's your goal,
you're going to have to pay me more.

18
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,302
I want ten times what you offered.

19
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,054
You darn…

20
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,931
-Jeez, that idiot.
-Jeez, that idiot.

21
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,893
Why the heck would you interject?

22
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,269
Sorry.

23
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,107
The data's been copied.

24
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,985
We've got nothing to lose from this.

25
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,112
Tell him we'll give him whatever he wants.

26
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,199
But tell him he's dead
if he doesn't hand it over.

27
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,450
Fine, you can have it.

28
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,285
But if you don't hand it over,

29
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,412
you're dead.

30
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,914
Jeez, hey.

31
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:10,124
Come on, you can tell him that directly.

32
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,461
Let me check the evidence first.

33
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,380
My people will be going, so follow me.

34
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,965
-All done?
-Yes.

35
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,889
Good job. You can come back now.

36
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,268
Here.

37
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,321
The person you have dialed
cannot be reached--

38
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,199
Darn it.

39
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,642
Why are they back already?

40
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,312
-Darn it.
-Wipe that smirk off your face.

41
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,855
Stop it.

42
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,593
Oh, gosh.

43
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,898
PROSECUTOR CHA DO-WON

44
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,947
What was that?

45
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,783
Is it you, Looney?

46
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,330
Come out.

47
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,663
Han-jun.

48
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:55,331
Han-jun.

49
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,208
Hey, what are you doing?

50
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:58,960
Han-jun.

51
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,838
Why is he sleeping
in this weird coquettish pose?

52
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,257
-Wake up.
-Jeez. Hey.

53
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:05,842
Hey.

54
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,218
Wake up.

55
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,261
Hey…

56
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,680
Did you buy cheonggukjang?

57
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,603
Han-jun, wake up.
You'll freeze if you sleep here.

58
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:21,065
-Gosh, this is embarrassing.
-Jeez. What's with the overreaction?

59
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,733
-Hey, is it that bad?
-What is?

60
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,990
Maybe it's time I took a shower.

61
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,170
Jeez, I thought I was going to get caught.

62
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,842
PROSECUTOR CHA DO-WON

63
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,221
Hello, sir.

64
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:58,686
I was going to call you back,
but I got distracted and forgot.

65
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,649
You're calling about
the Shin Gyeong-ho case, right?

66
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,692
Yes.

67
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,573
I was worried that you were drinking
your frustration away on your own.

68
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,075
How did you know?

69
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:17,205
I'm going to have just one can of beer
and catch him again.

70
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,419
I plan on making Shin Gyeong-ho pay
until he begs for mercy, so don't worry.

71
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:28,799
Shin Gyeong-ho would better
get ready if you're this determined.

72
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:32,637
Call me if you need anything any time.

73
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,932
You'll have my full back-up
for your revenge,

74
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,726
no holds barred.

75
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,853
Thank you.

76
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:44,649
I feel like you're always doing me favors.

77
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,527
-Buy me dinner sometimes then.
-Okay.

78
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,488
Dinner's on me when the case is over.

79
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,507
VICTIM: HAN JAE-JEONG
ACCOMPLICE: SHIN GYEONG-HO

80
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,221
SHIN GYEONG-HO

81
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,184
It was definitely a relationship chart.

82
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:25,022
What does Shin Gyeong-ho have
to do with my brother's case?

83
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,406
Jeez.

84
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,742
If my head is hurting this badly,

85
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,452
Han-jun must be…

86
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,622
He's not dead, is he?

87
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,004
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

88
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:56,846
Jeez. Why isn't Nam Han-jun here?

89
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,032
Detective Na?

90
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,076
What? Ma'am.

91
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,205
What brings you here, Detective Na?

92
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,207
I didn't want to come.

93
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,294
I made a reservation before I joined
the team, and they just got back to me.

94
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,755
-A reservation?
-Yes.

95
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:34,550
This place is so popular that
you have to wait at least three months.

96
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,927
I know I shouldn't have come now
I know about him,

97
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,429
but I already paid the deposit.

98
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,057
That's it. I swear.

99
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,808
So you're

100
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:46,312
meeting the Nam Han-jun today, right?

101
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,483
-Take me with you.
-But what about my privacy?

102
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,443
I can't go to a shaman with my boss.

103
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,111
I can't, not even if it's you.

104
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,114
I've been looking for him.

105
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,452
There was something
I really wanted to ask him,

106
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,245
but he suddenly disappeared
and I never got to.

107
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:08,417
-I've found him again after three years--
-You mean you and Mr. Shaman were…

108
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,422
I never forgot him, not even for a moment.

109
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,591
Wait. Did you have a crush on him?

110
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,719
-What? No way.
-Okay. You can come with me.

111
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,763
You can use this opportunity
to get over him!

112
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,723
Hey, wait. That's not true!

113
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:23,933
Hey!

114
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,946
Na-dan, can you get me a cup of coffee?

115
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,679
Gosh, he's so handsome.

116
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,182
-Did you just see?
-He's so handsome.

117
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,360
Stand up.

118
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,112
Come on.

119
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,125
What's going on?

120
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,215
Gosh, you startled me.

121
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,219
Of course.

122
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,140
What is it?

123
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,740
No way.

124
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,533
Ms. Little Police?

125
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,077
Damn it.

126
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:52,081
So when will I get a girlfriend?

127
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,999
No, you won't.

128
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,294
-Why?
-You're clueless and obsessive.

129
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,171
Women hate that.

130
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,299
If you want to get a girlfriend,

131
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,301
fix your personality first.

132
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:11,767
I'm sure that's not all
you were wondering about.

133
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,768
Actually…

134
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,564
I was going to ask you if I should go
to the Major Crimes Division, but…

135
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,940
You've already been assigned.

136
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,443
You're screwed now.

137
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,571
I've already been screwed over once,
thanks to somebody.

138
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:28,200
You're clueless, sensitive,
and have delicate sensibilities.

139
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,785
You and Major Crimes Division?

140
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,995
Really?

141
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,666
The gates will soon open before you.

142
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,294
-What door?
-The gates of hell.

143
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,714
A gate to hatred.

144
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,346
You'll think you did your best,

145
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,016
but people will continue to criticize
and hate you.

146
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,643
It's not your fault the crime happened,

147
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,980
but it's your fault
you couldn't catch the culprit.

148
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,984
It really sucks, it does.

149
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,446
See?

150
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,448
You're screwed.

151
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,704
Is that why you ran away?

152
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:17,333
You're a profiler, not a shaman.

153
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,043
Are you sure you have powers?

154
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,880
Aren't you just fooling people
using your skills as a profiler

155
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,548
while pretending to be a shaman?

156
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,433
Of course, not.
Then I'll be punished by the heavens.

157
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,731
You served time three years ago
for tampering with evidence.

158
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,735
Did you get your powers
while you were serving time?

159
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,619
TWO YEARS AGO

160
00:15:54,119 --> 00:16:00,918
CHEONUN PENITENTIARY

161
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,433
Darn it, this is a new low.

162
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:18,852
This is not cool at all.

163
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,412
Or maybe not.

164
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,123
Jeez, it's tiring being so popular.

165
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,338
Where are you going?

166
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,261
I'd be kicking the sheets at night
with embarrassment if I were you.

167
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,846
Hey, you…

168
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,682
Darn it, this is so embarrassing.

169
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:57,975
Hey, where are you going?

170
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,651
-Hey, you.
-What?

171
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,070
Aren't you supposed to be in Singapore?
And what's with this car?

172
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:11,113
I got fired from the NIS.

173
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,366
This is where my severance pay went.

174
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,036
Did you do something crazy again?

175
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,247
Get in.

176
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,458
You idiot.

177
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,128
-Where are you going?
-Shut up.

178
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:29,506
Hey, just pull up the top.
I'll get dust in my nostrils.

179
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,135
This is so freaking embarrassing.

180
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,555
Hey, let's go home first so I can change.

181
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,982
There. Yongho Detective Agency.

182
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,610
Are you sure this is it?

183
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,029
It looks like they went out of business.

184
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,156
"Former police detective."

185
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:55,783
Just get off already.

186
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,911
What a joke. Damn it.

187
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,128
TEMPLE OF SHAMANKA

188
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,006
Wait here. Let me get something to drink.

189
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,926
Hey, just get us some alcohol.

190
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,470
Let's commemorate the end
of their business now that we're here.

191
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,141
"Former police detective?" That's a laugh.

192
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,435
No.

193
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,562
He hasn't come back.

194
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,149
Yes. I reported him missing to the police,

195
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:32,444
but they told me to wait,
saying it looks like a plain runaway case.

196
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,613
Jeez, I could just throttle him.

197
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,575
He took off with my bankbook and my seal.

198
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,619
The CSAT is just around the corner!

199
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,081
What do I do with him?

200
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,125
Hey, what are you doing?

201
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,084
Come in.

202
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,043
Okay.

203
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,550
I've never seen anything like this before.

204
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,636
So he's finally managing on his own.

205
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,848
He doesn't even have a place of his own.

206
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,310
CONFIDENTIALITY ENSURED
TEMPLE OF SHAMANKA

207
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:06,645
What?

208
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,112
They even share the same customer base.

209
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,490
Jeez.

210
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:30,836
What's this?

211
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,546
Gosh.

212
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,550
Gosh, that startled me!

213
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,684
Who's there?

214
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,524
Han-jun!

215
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,026
Hey, stop.

216
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,364
Is that you, Su-cheol?

217
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,117
It's me!

218
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,953
-Put that down first.
-Okay.

219
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:08,582
Hey!

220
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,668
-Darn it!
-Han-jun!

221
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:16,423
Are you okay?

222
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,304
Hey, you look like crap.

223
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,597
Come in.

224
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,598
Hey, here.

225
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,183
What's this?

226
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,019
Oh, you didn't have to.

227
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,939
What's wrong with your agency?

228
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:36,026
I bought the office next door
and took down the wall,

229
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,694
but I'm not getting any business.

230
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,780
You know, the economy is
in a terrible place.

231
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,615
Not with these around.

232
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,827
I was going to clean up and decorate
the place when I made some money,

233
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,372
but I don't have any.

234
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,708
It's true that you need more
than just willpower to run a business.

235
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,044
-Hey, let's open the windows.
-Okay. I'll take that for you.

236
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,803
Hey. Why won't this open?

237
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,097
The window doesn't work either.

238
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:11,895
So you're now an ex-convict
and soon to unemployed?

239
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,897
Hey, so are you.
And he's a business owner.

240
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:16,316
-Right!
-Yes, he's going out of business soon.

241
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,443
Oh, he already did.

242
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,530
No!

243
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,324
I'm ruined again.

244
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,452
Excuse me.

245
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,413
Is this…

246
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,206
It's a customer.

247
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,165
Smile.

248
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,170
Sorry. I think I have the wrong place.

249
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:41,049
They told me to wait,
saying it looks like a plain runaway case.

250
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,970
He took off with my bankbook and my seal.

251
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,346
Your son ran away!

252
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,391
You're here to find him.

253
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:57,357
"Mi, nam, dang."

254
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,070
Oh, Mr. Shaman.

255
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,822
Shaman?

256
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,532
How did you know right away?

257
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,749
You're so good.

258
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,625
I'm sorry, ma'am, but…

259
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:18,545
Mr. Shaman, please find my son.

260
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,797
I'm not a shaman…

261
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,966
My son didn't even go to school yesterday.

262
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:26,762
His phone was off too. He's never
done anything like this before.

263
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,680
All he ever does is go to school
then come back home.

264
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,140
He's got nowhere else to go.

265
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,851
Ma'am, you can't just do this.
This isn't--

266
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,854
Please help me.

267
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,399
After my husband died,
my son is all I have.

268
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,485
If something happens to him too,

269
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,820
I couldn't go on living.

270
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,447
Jeez.

271
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,699
Please.

272
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,003
I understand
what you're going through, ma'am.

273
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:06,051
When my sister ran away from home,

274
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,470
my mother was devastated too.

275
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,390
How could I ignore you when I know that.

276
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,600
Thank you, Mr. Shaman.

277
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,185
Oh, thank you.

278
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,686
If you can find my son,

279
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,272
I'll pay whatever price you ask!

280
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,232
Pay me?

281
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,863
Your son took your bankbook
and seal, right?

282
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,156
How do you know that?

283
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,117
He hasn't withdrawn money yet?

284
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,661
Oh gosh, yes, right!

285
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,122
Tell us his phone number before you go

286
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,249
and head over to a nearby
community service center.

287
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,416
A community service center?

288
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,001
He should have gotten a seal certificate.

289
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,213
-Go check and call us right away.
-What?

290
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,507
Go on. We need to find him quickly.

291
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,009
-Before he gets into worse trouble.
-Okay, sir.

292
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:50,971
Okay.

293
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,151
There are only two chat rooms.

294
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,694
Doesn't he have any friends?

295
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,990
A PIG LIKE YOU SHOULDN'T EAT
EAT SHIT

296
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:11,199
YOU ONLY NEED A SEAL CERTIFICATE

297
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,743
So he was cyberbullied for a long time.

298
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,829
It's just as I thought.

299
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:19,541
Those assholes are making Gyeong-jun
take out an illegal loan.

300
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,209
Kids nowadays are pretty scary.

301
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:24,212
He must have called the loan shark.
Find out his location.

302
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,965
Oh, please.
You think you can snap your fingers

303
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,134
and find out someone's location
just like that?

304
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:32,470
-You should be thankful you have me.
-Hey, what's going on?

305
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,514
Why won't you tell me?

306
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,100
Hold on tight.
If the electricity goes out, you're dead.

307
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:41,104
Damn it. If this isn't bullying,
I don't know what is.

308
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,692
Hello, ma'am.

309
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:46,860
Did you check?

310
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,029
Yes, you were right.

311
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:52,324
He came in for a seal certificate
and a family relation certificate today.

312
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,742
I have a terrible feeling about this.

313
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:57,704
You should go home now.
I'll call you when we find him.

314
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,751
I got the sons of bitches.

315
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:04,669
JH LOANS

316
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,216
Jeez.

317
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,550
Darn it…

318
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:14,846
Darn it!

319
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,182
JH LOANS

320
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,893
-Thank you.
-Of course.

321
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,269
Put them there.

322
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,520
Thank you.

323
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,899
Hey, Gyeong-jun. Thanks.

324
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,736
We were nice enough
to be friends with a loser like you.

325
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,238
How dare you do that?

326
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,074
Thanks for being friends
with a loser like me, you asshole!

327
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,662
Go get him!

328
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,416
We have proof of illegal loans.

329
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,255
Who the hell are you?

330
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:50,465
Jeez, you lowlives.

331
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,634
How could you do that to these kids?

332
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,553
How good are you with your fists?

333
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,890
I bet I'm better than you are.

334
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:00,850
True.

335
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,936
Su-cheol!

336
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:06,940
What?

337
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,027
Kong Su-cheol!

338
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,380
So I hear you're good.

339
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,970
Now smile.

340
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,305
There.

341
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,725
-Smile.
-What?

342
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,439
Yes, that's nice.

343
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:53,445
Damn it.

344
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,655
Do you know who my dad is?

345
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,825
Why? So you can have your awesome dad

346
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,703
pay back all the money
you've taken from the others?

347
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,998
Well, that doesn't seem fair.

348
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:10,462
If you do that, you'll go viral
on social media.

349
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,966
-What the fuck do you want me to do then?
-Su-cheol, he's cursing.

350
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,051
Okay.

351
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,470
You'll have to work
to pay it off yourself, got it?

352
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,931
-Okay.
-Good.

353
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:25,852
You be good, all of you. Don't curse.

354
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,729
-Okay.
-Okay.

355
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:28,980
-Let's go.
-Okay.

356
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,067
Well, excuse me.

357
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,779
You guys are so cool.

358
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,406
Please let me be your assistant!

359
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,076
-What?
-What are you going to do?

360
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,996
-Do you want a baby sibling?
-No, Hye-jun's more than enough.

361
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,920
Where did you pick him up?

362
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,089
Come on, we have to feed him
before sending him away.

363
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,884
Here. Take this and study hard.

364
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:03,264
I might not have good grades…

365
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,475
AWARD

366
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,853
…but I'm the best inventor in the country.
Can part-time here?

367
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,356
Mr. Edison. Go someplace else
if you want to make money.

368
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,315
This place is bust.

369
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,319
No!

370
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,365
This is it.

371
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,285
"Minamdang."

372
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,081
And Minamdang's

373
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,417
handsome shaman, Nam Han-jun.

374
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:36,172
I bet it'll be even more successful
than a detective agency.

375
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,465
-Bye.
-Bye.

376
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,842
You guys were awesome today.

377
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,677
-Bye.
-Jo Na-dan. You're hired.

378
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,972
-I am?
-Yes, because you're handsome.

379
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,807
Because I'm handsome?

380
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,017
I'm hired!

381
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:51,312
Wait, you said you'd get the guy
who killed Prosecutor Han.

382
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,982
-Is money more important to you?
-Please!

383
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,736
What if we starve to death
before we catch him?

384
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:01,281
He framed the both of us,
two police officers, to get rid of us.

385
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:05,076
He must be rich and powerful.

386
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,578
If we want to take him on,

387
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,455
we need a lot of money too!

388
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:11,583
-Right, we need money for fried chicken.
-Let's make a lot of money.

389
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,543
-Okay!
-Let's get amazingly famous!

390
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,502
Okay!

391
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:17,922
That makes so much sense!

392
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,466
You can totally do it!

393
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:23,678
But that means you'll have to work
as a shaman. Can you do it?

394
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,638
It won't be that hard.

395
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,182
You'll have to tell fortune

396
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:31,186
and perform an exorcism
to drive away ghosts too.

397
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,979
-Ghosts?
-Yes.

398
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:36,691
Or you could die dancing on blades
in colorful hanbok.

399
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,361
Oh, I don't know if I can pull
that hanbok off.

400
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,739
Hanbok is the one
he's the most worried about?

401
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,657
This is Nam Han-jun we're talking about.

402
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,542
Jeez, that's scary.

403
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,568
What's that?

404
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,616
It's a gopuri knot.

405
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:28,660
You undo the knot

406
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:31,287
and say "gopuri"
when you're performing an exorcism.

407
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,498
You use it

408
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,543
to comfort the dead
so they can leave in peace.

409
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,130
Gopuri, the bastard.

410
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,966
So what about it?

411
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,053
Right.

412
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,391
The culprit was holding this
when Jae-jeong died.

413
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:53,226
He killed someone using that?

414
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,394
Yes.

415
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,605
The culprit's either a shaman

416
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,109
or someone fascinated with shamanism.

417
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:04,153
You'll be looking for a shaman
with a burn scar, then.

418
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,114
What if he's just really into shamanism?

419
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,198
Right.

420
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,787
If you make it as a shaman,
Gopuri might come to you.

421
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:17,667
Are you insane? So you're going to
open a fortune-telling shop?

422
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,254
I don't see why not.

423
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,173
I can pretend to be a shaman
only if I could catch that jerk.

424
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,384
I can even pretend to be a shamanka.

425
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,719
Still…

426
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,598
I don't think we can pull it off
with just the two of us.

427
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,602
No.

428
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:42,692
I'll talk to your mother
and let you move out of her place.

429
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,278
You'll make money and be free.
You can do anything you want.

430
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,905
What do you think?

431
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:49,032
No nagging.

432
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,491
Do you have a death wish?

433
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,493
Okay, fine. Then I'm going to say no too.

434
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,787
Your nagging is as bad as Mom's.

435
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,501
Fine.

436
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:04,047
No interfering in my personal life.
Never come into my room.

437
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,965
No cleaning, no curfew,
no interrupting dates,

438
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,842
and no butting in among many others.

439
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,802
Absolutely no getting on my nerves, and…

440
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:13,556
You can't breathe next to me.
Do you agree?

441
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,350
She'd win against the devil himself.

442
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,685
Yes. I accept your terms.

443
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,271
-Then I'm in!
-Okay, my terms are--

444
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:23,858
I'm forbidding your hairstyle, the beard,
the clothes, and your entire style!

445
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,985
No, my terms, they're--

446
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,529
Wait. I think you're
all forgetting something.

447
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,992
Deaconess Park, I mean.

448
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,661
-Mom?
-Yes.

449
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:37,497
If she finds out we were
running a fortune teller's shop,

450
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,875
she'll get an even bigger shock
than when her son went to prison.

451
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,425
We're not going to be fortune-tellers.

452
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,261
Then what are we doing?

453
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,263
We're opening a café.

454
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,266
"Café Minamdang."

455
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,425
Here.

456
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:37,056
Follow me.

457
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,365
Hey, you better do a thorough job
with the cleaning, okay?

458
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:56,826
Coffee.

459
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:00,997
Coffee?

460
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:02,874
Good, very nice.

461
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,005
Hey!

462
00:34:09,088 --> 00:34:11,466
I cut school just so I could see you.

463
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,134
You're so handsome!

464
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,011
Su-cheol will be the barista.

465
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,306
Na-dan will be the server.

466
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:27,815
And Han-jun, the boss, will solve
the clients' problems in the VIP room.

467
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,070
Think it through and…

468
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:35,865
That will be Café Minamdang!

469
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,700
Go. Come on, hurry up.

470
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,078
But isn't that fraud?

471
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,413
What do you mean fraud?

472
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:45,833
We find exactly what our clients need
and solve their problems.

473
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,753
We'll even offer great customer service.
How can that be fraud?

474
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:52,799
We utilize our strengths to make sure
our clients' lives go smoothly

475
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,008
It's philanthropy.

476
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,764
We do good and make a lot of money.

477
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:01,057
It's philanthropy.

478
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,568
Why did you fabricate the evidence?

479
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,657
Was it really you who helped
Choi Yeong-seop get away?

480
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,036
Am I being interrogated?

481
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:27,416
Go read the ruling if you're curious.

482
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,459
I already did.

483
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,755
The ruling isn't everything, though.

484
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:39,637
So I'm giving you one last chance
to explain what you did.

485
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:52,316
You'll give me a chance

486
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,569
to explain what I did?

487
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:59,740
Let's say I'm giving you
a chance to repent.

488
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:03,911
It's not too late to admit to
what you did and ask for forgiveness--

489
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,832
Who are you to assume that I'm the culprit
and tell me to beg for forgiveness?

490
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:12,461
That ditz who just left will suffer
if he becomes a detective.

491
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,380
But you…

492
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,175
You shouldn't be a detective at all.

493
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,136
-What?
-A detective must keep an open mind

494
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,513
to all possibilities when investigating.

495
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:26,142
Nothing is out of bounds, and nothing
is impossible. Do not assume.

496
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:27,810
Isn't that the fundamentals of
investigating?

497
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,606
But look at you.
You are blinded by your prejudices.

498
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,985
If you're just going to believe
what you want, quit being a detective.

499
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,196
You'll end up ruining people's lives.

500
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,617
You aren't qualified for the job.

501
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,744
Qualified?

502
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,538
You're talking to me about qualifications?

503
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,000
You're the one who isn't qualified.
Because of your mistake…

504
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,217
Prosecutor Han Jae-jeong was murdered.

505
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:06,390
Have you ever properly apologized to
Prosecutor Han or his family?

506
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,392
Are you even sorry?

507
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:16,150
I always am.

508
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,112
I'm wracked by guilt every night.

509
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,450
But I never made a mistake.

510
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:29,413
Would you say that to
the victim's family too?

511
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,791
I would apologize and tell them
it was my fault.

512
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:33,793
So you'd apologize to the family

513
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,837
but won't admit to your mistake?

514
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:39,966
Not all acts of justice lead to good.

515
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,846
Thanks for clearing that up.

516
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:56,399
You'd better take care from now on.

517
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,197
No matter what sorts of tricks you play,

518
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,950
I swear I will catch you.

519
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,462
Jeez.

520
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,840
My gosh.

521
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,093
This is so tiring.

522
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:31,350
Maybe it's because she's a detective,
but this new stalker knows everything.

523
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:33,019
How frightening.

524
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,896
I'd better not get involved
with her anymore.

525
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,232
I didn't even get to have coffee
because of them.

526
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:43,154
Darn it. I'm just going to lie down
for a bit before I go.

527
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:58,836
What?

528
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,422
He's never made a mistake?

529
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,508
How on earth is he so brazen?

530
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,108
You just wait.

531
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,944
I'm going to catch Choi Yeong-seop myself

532
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:27,573
and prove that Nam Han-jun was wrong.

533
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,452
And then I'll reveal that
I'm Jae-jeong's sister.

534
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,871
Let's see what face he makes.

535
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,544
ACTIVE POLICE OFFICER TAMPERED
WITH EVIDENCE AND ACCEPTED BRIBES

536
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,880
POLICE OFFICER ARRESTED FOR TAMPERING
WITH EVIDENCE FOR CHOI YEONG-SEOP CASE

537
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,718
CHOI YEONG-SEOP'S REVENGE KILLING
VIDEO TAKEN ON DAUGHTER'S PHONE

538
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:59,438
SENTENCED TO A YEAR AND 2 MONTHS
AT CHEONGUN PENITENTIARY

539
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,153
Prosecutor Han Jae-jeong was murdered.

540
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:10,408
Have you ever properly apologized to
Prosecutor Han or his family?

541
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,076
Are you even sorry?

542
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,469
SUSPECT: GOPURI
M.O.: GOPURI, ARSON, SHAMANISM

543
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,687
How can I apologize to them
when I haven't caught him yet?

544
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,445
I swear I'm going to catch you…

545
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,571
no matter what.

546
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,214
LIEUTENANT HAN JAE-HUI

547
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,095
Lieutenant Han.

548
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,223
I heard you were disciplined.
Are you okay?

549
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,310
Well…

550
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,020
Did something happen?

551
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,941
Actually, I found Nam Han-jun.

552
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:26,859
You…

553
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,613
-You found Inspector Nam Han-jun?
-Yes.

554
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,161
Let's talk face to face.

555
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,121
Where are you right now?

556
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,503
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

557
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,680
I'm sorry I made you come
all the way here.

558
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,183
It's nice. I get to see your face,
Inspector Han.

559
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:02,144
If Mr. Nam is around here, where is he?

560
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,065
There.

561
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,108
"Minamdang"?

562
00:42:09,818 --> 00:42:12,530
The name of the café
feels pretty narcissistic.

563
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,158
Oh, does Mr. Nam run that café now?

564
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,077
That wouldn't have been so shocking.

565
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:23,874
Shin Gyeong-ho's hit-and-run
was reported by Nam Han-jun.

566
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:26,377
It was also Nam Han-jun
who gave us the evidence to

567
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,128
have Shin Gyeong-ho released.

568
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,968
-Why would Mr. Nam do that?
-I don't know.

569
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,638
I think it has something to do
with my brother's case.

570
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,099
But I'm not sure at the moment.

571
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,609
Ms. Lee met with Chief Jung because--

572
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,486
-Hey.
-Sir?

573
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,489
-Why are you reporting this only now?
-I'm sorry, sir.

574
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,325
-I couldn't get in touch with you--
-Damn it!

575
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,911
-Get Chief Jung on the phone right now.
-Yes, sir.

576
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,582
CHIEF JUNG CHEONG-GI

577
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,585
-Speak.
-Oh, okay.

578
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:13,716
Well, Ms. Lee offered me
quite a large sum.

579
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,676
So are you happy?

580
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:19,346
I'm asking you if you're happy,
you bastard!

581
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:23,517
How long have you been seeing her?

582
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:29,231
Money's great,
but how dare you seduce my wife?

583
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:31,317
What?

584
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,736
This is totally sick!

585
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,363
Isn't it?
It can be great to do sick things.

586
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:38,991
-It's exciting and exhilarating, right?
-Wait.

587
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,659
What makes him think that?

588
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:44,038
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

589
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,165
It's not like that.

590
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:51,712
Ms. Lee asked me to give her the evidence
for the murder you committed.

591
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,339
And…

592
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:57,926
I think she's preparing to oust you
at the shareholder's meeting.

593
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,056
I'd rather

594
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,642
she cheated.

595
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:05,809
That little…

596
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:06,810
Never mind.

597
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:10,105
You know I'm as batshit crazy
as I'm rich, right?

598
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,816
I'm pissed off right now
and might kill you,

599
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,818
so come right away
with the evidence you have.

600
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,738
-Now!
-Wait, sir.

601
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:23,869
YUNNAM-RI, 25 SAN, CHOHYEON-EUP,
HYANGJU, GYEONGGI-DO

602
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,582
There we go!

603
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,209
It's going according to my plan.

604
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:32,378
But if things are going
according to your plan,

605
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:33,671
isn't Chief Jung in danger right now?

606
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,259
-He is.
-Right.

607
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,719
Jeez.

608
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,180
Never mind.
Let's prepare the necessary equipment.

609
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,891
You keep us updated
on Jung Cheong-gi's location.

610
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,643
Will the two of you be enough?

611
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:48,727
Why don't we go together?

612
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,854
-Two's enough.
-Yes.

613
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,358
Fucker.

614
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:56,860
Let's go!

615
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,655
-Hey, don't go overboard again.
-I'm not stupid.

616
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:07,913
What?

617
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,082
What's this hopeless duo doing here?

618
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,418
No. You're underage, Na-dan.

619
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,170
Not anymore.

620
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,464
Really? But you still can't go.

621
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,551
You said you'd let me tag along
when I got my resident registration card!

622
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:23,595
Come on, let me join you guys. Please!

623
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,265
-Please!
-Come on, just let him tag along.

624
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,684
We'll need someone to run
to the police if things go wrong.

625
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:31,562
-Should I do it?
-Of course, you will. Do you think I will?

626
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,982
-Keep talking if you want to die.
-I'm a fast runner too.

627
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,109
I've worked hard for this day!

628
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,112
By the way, where are we going?

629
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:42,948
Don't even try to find out.
You only just got that card.

630
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,491
You'd better get out right now.

631
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,702
Let's go already.
Jung Cheong-gi's already on his way.

632
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,329
-Okay, let's go.
-Right.

633
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,332
Don't you take one step outside this car,
or you're dead. Got it?

634
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,503
Please. You better not beg me
to save your lives.

635
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:08,348
I would have had Shin Gyeong-ho
if it weren't for you.

636
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:09,641
Darn it…

637
00:46:10,767 --> 00:46:12,269
Where on earth are they going?

638
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,063
Prosecutor Cha?

639
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:16,523
You startled me.

640
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,276
By the way, where are we going?

641
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,528
Oh, sorry. I had to follow them.

642
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,490
You must be busy. Shall I drop you off?

643
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,575
No, it's fine.

644
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,202
I'm totally free.

645
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,704
I'd worry if you went on your own.
Let's go together.

646
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,749
Oh. Okay.

647
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,084
-I'll get right on their tail, then.
-Okay.

648
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,503
Hold on tight.

649
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,171
All right.

650
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,174
Are you kidding me?

651
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,217
Hey!

652
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,889
Are you crazy? Jeez.

653
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,933
Wait. Stop hitting me for a second.

654
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,935
Oh, gosh. I'm about to poop my pants.

655
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,104
Where do you think they're going?

656
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,565
I can't tell either.

657
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,010
SHIN GYEONG-HO

658
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,934
Okay. What do we do now?

659
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:19,313
Get the tools. We'll follow them
and watch what happens.

660
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,314
Okay.

661
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,650
You listen to the tap
and let us know if something happens.

662
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,693
All right.

663
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,781
-Wait. We got the wrong equipment.
-What?

664
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:33,201
Hey, what are we supposed
to do with these?

665
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:37,039
Well, you said
we were going on a work trip,

666
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,708
so I thought we were going to
perform an exorcism.

667
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,669
Jeez, you've really gotten used to
working for a shaman.

668
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,422
Nice job. There will be thugs there.
I'm sure of it.

669
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:47,132
So how do we fight using these?

670
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:50,010
Oh, I know.

671
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,387
Let's pray that they drop dead.

672
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,056
-Okay.
-What do you mean okay?

673
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,766
Get it together, you.

674
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:57,684
Sir.

675
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,855
You could use my invention instead.

676
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,111
I could just kill the lot of you!

677
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:10,530
They're being like this
because you aren't paying attention!

678
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:13,200
We need to round them all up
and hand them over to the detective

679
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,534
so she won't get punished!

680
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:15,869
Is that why we're here?

681
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:18,246
Hey. What are you doing here?

682
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:24,961
When did that happen?

683
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:30,425
Jung Cheong-gi and Shin Gyeong-ho
both arrived.

684
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,427
-Oh, they did.
-So they did.

685
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:34,846
We need to take care of this first.

686
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,266
What is going on?

687
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:42,646
Why are we about to get caught?

688
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,537
This is the original and the evidence.

689
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,456
Hey, what about the copies?

690
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,874
Never mind, damn it.

691
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,085
He won't be able to use them any longer.

692
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,461
He'll be dead soon.

693
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:09,506
What?

694
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,049
No, please…

695
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,140
Hey.

696
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:26,189
-I suppose we only have one option left.
-What?

697
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:29,609
Operation Beethoven.

698
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:34,072
Wait. Am I the only one who didn't get it?
What's Operation Beethoven?

699
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:37,492
-We leave it up to fate.
-Fate?

700
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,661
Okay.

701
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:42,581
On the count of three.

702
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:45,625
Okay!

703
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:47,878
One!

704
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,921
-Two!
-Two!

705
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:52,674
Three!

706
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:53,633
Let's do it!

707
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:10,567
Han-jun, please.

708
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,569
Come on, Han-jun!

709
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:15,071
Han-jun!

710
00:51:15,155 --> 00:51:16,865
Please, Han-jun!

711
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:23,538
Damn it.

712
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,706
Fine, come here.

713
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,874
-Hey.
-What's going on?

714
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:27,793
You little…

715
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,711
What? Come on.

716
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,130
All right. You?

717
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:33,173
Come here!

718
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:38,011
Jeez, come on!

719
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:39,846
Su-cheol. You're doing great.

720
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,348
Oh, gosh.

721
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,183
Look at him go!

722
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:45,602
Leg split!

723
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,073
Oh, come on.

724
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:01,785
It's one against many and you're using
a baton? Isn't that kind of low?

725
00:52:01,868 --> 00:52:04,204
Hey, that guy is making a call.
Go check right now.

726
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,914
-What do I do?
-What do you mean? Get out of the car!

727
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,917
Right, I can do this.

728
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,585
Hey, you.

729
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,379
Come here.

730
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,715
The phone!

731
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,178
Take that, you scum!

732
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,431
Are you angry?

733
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,183
Let go.

734
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,667
Nam Han-jun. You just wait.

735
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:55,547
Kong Su-cheol, you're awesome.
Kong Su-cheol!

736
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,798
Kong Su-cheol!

737
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:01,303
I told you not to come out.

738
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,848
-You said the two met already, right?
-Yes.

739
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,933
Let's go and check
and come back to the car.

740
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,351
Come on, what about me?

741
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,604
Hurry.

742
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,524
You son of a bitch!

743
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:19,404
How dare you threaten me!

744
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,617
Die, you bastard!

745
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:36,212
Sir. Don't kill me.
Please forgive me, just this once.

746
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,881
I'll never…

747
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,549
Please forgive me, just this once.

748
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,551
I'm sorry.

749
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:44,930
-Take him away and get rid of him.
-No, please. Sir! Please…

750
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,182
Sir. I…

751
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:49,309
Please don't kill me!

752
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,435
Sir!

753
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,145
Sir, please, don't kill me…

754
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:53,855
DNA TEST RESULTS

755
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,775
No, let go of me!

756
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:33,103
Jeez, that startled me.

757
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,867
Stop rustling around!

758
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:53,832
I told you to stay put in the car.
Why did you have to come?

759
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:55,208
Be quiet.

760
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,585
I found something pretty useful.

761
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:01,381
So what are we going to do now?

762
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,263
-You two.
-Yes, sir.

763
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:11,266
Hide here and call me
when Shin Gyeong-ho comes out.

764
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,143
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

765
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:14,728
Okay. Good luck!

766
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:15,645
Okay!

767
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:19,941
It's that way.

768
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:31,161
It is Mr. Nam's car.

769
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:36,291
But what is this place?

770
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:39,294
I don't know.
I think they followed someone here.

771
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,338
What is he scheming?

772
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:47,719
Yes, sir.

773
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:48,887
Hey.

774
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,972
Someone's here

775
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:55,602
and they're saying
they have to talk to you and not me.

776
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,604
You talk to her, okay?

777
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,323
Detective Han?

778
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,533
This is Min Yu-seon.

779
00:56:11,284 --> 00:56:12,327
Ms. Min?

780
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:16,498
I've never stood witness or reported
anything before, so I'm not sure,

781
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,124
but what do I do?

782
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,503
Just relax and tell us what happened.

783
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,546
Take a seat.

784
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:25,673
Oh. Right.

785
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,264
That day…

786
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:37,644
That day,

787
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,522
Gyeong-ho was driving
and he hit the motorcycle.

788
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:42,816
He thought the guy was dead
and threw his body away somewhere.

789
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:54,285
He's doing drugs in his villa right now,

790
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,621
so go there if you want to catch him.

791
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,668
This is how I do it, right?

792
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,630
Where's the villa Shin Gyeong-ho's in?

793
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:06,965
Chohyeon-eup, Hyangju, Gyeonggi-do.

794
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:12,011
Yunnam-ri, 25 San?

795
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:13,138
What?

796
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,140
That's where his villa is!

797
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,267
I've been there. Yes, that's it.

798
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:21,563
I'm there right now with Prosecutor Cha,
so come as soon as you can.

799
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,192
Lieutenant Cha, wait.

800
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:30,530
I know you're in a hurry, but I think
you'd better get a warrant first.

801
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,699
You can't let them
use that against you again.

802
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,538
Hello?

803
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,834
Wait. Where are we going?

804
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,252
Hurry up.

805
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:01,394
Jeez.

806
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:05,190
By the way, I've been meaning to ask this.
What's with this?

807
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,149
Oh, right.

808
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:10,069
It's a sort of tactical weapon.

809
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:13,239
What a load of bull.

810
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,493
Where are you taking me?

811
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:18,328
I don't want to go!

812
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,663
Hey!

813
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:33,009
Oh, god.

814
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:35,803
-What are you doing? Bury him.
-Please don't kill me.

815
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,764
-Do it.
-No, please!

816
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,767
Don't come any closer! Let go of me!

817
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,268
Let go of me!

818
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:47,982
Oh, my back.

819
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,652
Jeez, you're being ridiculous.

820
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:56,199
Don't kill me, please.

821
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:57,408
Gosh.

822
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,428
We got the warrant.

823
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:31,818
What was that sound?

824
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,949
-Let's go.
-Okay.

825
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:35,089
Nam Han-jun!

826
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:40,219
What are you doing there?

827
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:07,872
EPILOGUE

828
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,293
3 YEARS AGO

829
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,921
LIEUTENANT NAM HAN-JUN

830
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:21,636
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD
CHOI YEONG-SEOP

831
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:39,487
What are you doing?

832
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:43,366
Hello.

833
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,285
We're from the Internal Inspection office.

834
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:48,663
JUNG CHEONG-GI

835
01:01:48,746 --> 01:01:49,706
I found it.

836
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:57,463
Lieutenant Nam Han-jun.

837
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:00,633
You'll need to come with us.

838
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,845
Come on, that makes no sense.

839
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:06,973
I want to catch the culprit more
than anyone else. Why would I…

840
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:08,933
It's because a prosecutor was murdered

841
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:11,436
because of your profiling.

842
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,849
Who dares disturb me in my prayers
and invite misfortune?

843
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:51,684
-My gosh.
-Can we talk?

844
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,853
-Nam Han-jun?
-We know everything.

845
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:55,688
There's no way you're getting out of this.

846
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:58,107
Arrest me?

847
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,360
He acts like he's the king of the world
with this arrogant look on his face.

848
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:02,779
Needle marks?

849
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,655
Someone made it look
as if he had died from shock.

850
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,699
It's unlikely someone broke in
from outside.

851
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:10,161
So, you gave the testimony and the report
because Nam Han-jun told you to?

852
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:11,621
-Let's see…
-Let him go.

853
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:14,665
-Let go of me, will you?
-We were looking for a ghost.

854
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:19,754
