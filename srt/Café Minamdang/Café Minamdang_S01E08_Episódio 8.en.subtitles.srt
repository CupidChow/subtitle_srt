00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,123
EPISODE 8

2
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,386
Why won't it come off?

3
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,536
A second audition? We're in?

4
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,371
What crap are you trying to pull?

5
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,210
If anyone's trying to pull something,
I think that's you.

6
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,295
Also, this is the men's bathroom.

7
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:29,589
I'm wrking undercover--

8
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,636
What? Is someone here?

9
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,305
Do you want everyone to know
who you really are?

10
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,949
Your shoes. They can see your shoes
on the floor.

11
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,867
-Put your feet up, come on.
-Oh, gosh.

12
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,126
OCCUPIED

13
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,719
I've got a bad feeling about that guy.

14
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,390
He's fixated on me somehow.

15
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,810
You're still so full of yourself.

16
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,399
You're so heavy.

17
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,652
Don't come closer.

18
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:46,166
He definitely knew I was here, but he was
still on guard when he came in.

19
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,586
He acts polite
but has an insulting look in his eyes.

20
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,630
His suit is top of the line,
but his skin is rough.

21
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:56,175
He's suspicious on a lot of fronts.

22
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,638
How do you call yourself a cop

23
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,765
when you can't even notice these things?

24
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,101
Just tell me why you're here

25
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:06,978
and start cooperating.

26
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,356
This seems more like a threat.

27
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,986
If you share your information
and cooperate,

28
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,613
then I'll do the same.

29
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,908
Park Jin-sang of Joyce Entertainment

30
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,076
may be related to the Kang Eun-hye case.

31
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,163
So I tried to see if he has a scar
on his wrist,

32
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,498
but he was wearing a pain relief patch.

33
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,335
What about you?

34
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,467
Kang Eun-hye's friend sent her a strange
message to her social media account,

35
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,427
so I'm here to find that person.

36
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,304
They feigned ignorance out of fear?

37
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,060
I'll find that friend for you.

38
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,436
In return, help me.

39
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,189
What? How can I help you?

40
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,364
Didn't you say you wanted to be an idol?

41
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,449
Yes. I did.

42
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:05,119
But he recommended
that I audition to become an action star.

43
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,790
The spirit

44
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:14,420
tells me that she has the potential
to become one.

45
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,297
She has a sturdy frame,

46
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:20,301
and most of all,
she has the face of an athlete.

47
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:24,597
"An action superstar
discovered by Joyce Entertainment."

48
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:28,393
I think I smell big money.

49
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,520
Money's good.

50
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:33,147
Well, let's take a look.

51
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,165
Goodness.

52
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,054
Damn it.

53
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,809
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry!

54
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,436
I'm sorry!

55
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,770
Come on!

56
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,106
I thought you said
this plan was infallible!

57
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:18,943
You should have aimed for his wrist
and checked if he had a burn scar.

58
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:21,195
How am I supposed to do that with a kick?

59
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,115
-I can't believe you messed this up.
-Unbelievable!

60
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,783
Never mind, I'll go change.

61
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,165
Goodness!

62
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,835
Call 911. Hurry.

63
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,798
I told him he had a misfortune coming
and he should be careful.

64
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,309
Mr. Shaman. You were right.

65
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,562
The misfortune…

66
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,647
Hey, wake up!

67
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,067
Hey!

68
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,954
Yes, Mr. Cha.

69
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,083
Director Park Jin-sang
of Joyce Entertainment…

70
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,584
He has an alibi for the day.

71
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,711
Mr. Shaman…

72
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,840
-What's going on?
-It's okay.

73
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,884
You're not going to die.
It's not your time yet.

74
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:25,968
It isn't, right?

75
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:28,971
Are you with Mr. Nam right now?

76
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,933
-Poor thing.
-What happened is…

77
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,935
-I ran into him at Joyce Entertainment.
-I'll put in a prayer for you.

78
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:37,355
Mr. Cha, I'm a bit busy now,
so I'll call you right back.

79
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:38,689
Wait.

80
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,446
-Mr. Cha.
-Yes?

81
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,824
Here's the data on Joyce's cash flow
that you requested.

82
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,367
PROSECUTOR CHA DO-WON

83
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,452
I'm sorry,

84
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,330
but I'll take a look at it
after I come back.

85
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,376
You two can head home first. Bye.

86
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,754
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE

87
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:07,468
All that fuss and we didn't even

88
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,262
-find Eun-hye's friend…
-I know.

89
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:12,390
This is all because of your terrible aim.

90
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:16,769
You're making it sound like
it was some grand operation.

91
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,064
You're picking a fight with me again.

92
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,232
What?

93
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,568
You two are fighting again.

94
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,070
How are we going
to work together like this?

95
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,781
-I'm not working with this fraud!
-I'm not working with Grumpy!

96
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,371
Hey, you are…

97
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,793
She's the one who sent the DM.

98
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,463
I think she saw something.

99
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,047
Stop fighting and come hear her out.

100
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,054
"Lee Ji-eun, 18 years old."

101
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,223
She's a Korean Dance major
at an arts high school.

102
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,226
She joined the company when she
auditioned with Kang Eun-hye.

103
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,105
I heard you and Eun-hye
were at the same audition.

104
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,818
Can you really see Eun-hye?

105
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:10,114
Eun-hye says that you looked pretty
like a bird when you danced.

106
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,782
She wanted to be friends with you.

107
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,619
She's sorry that she didn't
take the first step.

108
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,582
You really are
Minamdang's Shaman Nam Han-jun.

109
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:23,211
I am pretty popular with teenagers.

110
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,632
She's asking you to tell us the truth
about what you saw

111
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,550
so her grudge can be settled.

112
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:32,595
She doesn't remember much.

113
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,263
It must have been hard on her.

114
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,058
Well…

115
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,270
Something weird happened
before Eun-hye stopped

116
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,439
coming to practices.

117
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:50,613
I went back to the studio
because I forgot my wallet…

118
00:08:55,535 --> 00:09:00,164
and Eun-hye was dancing
in front of some people.

119
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,376
I thought she was secretly getting
one-on-one lessons,

120
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:06,504
so I hid and filmed it.

121
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,215
But the woman said something
after she finished dancing,

122
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,593
and Eun-hye cried.

123
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,264
She cried?

124
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,266
Why?

125
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,394
Well, the thing is…

126
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,188
It's okay. You can tell us.

127
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,485
Eun-hye…

128
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,239
-took off her clothes.
-These scumbags.

129
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,992
She took off her clothes?

130
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,702
Yes.

131
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,163
So I sneaked out right away.

132
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,916
I thought they might make me
do it too if they found me.

133
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,838
But now that I know Eun-hye's dead…

134
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,925
You don't have to tell us anything else
if you don't feel up to it.

135
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,679
But do you still have that video?

136
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,099
I was so scared that I deleted it

137
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,394
and sold my phone.

138
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,771
Do you remember the bastards--

139
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,774
I mean, the people who were there?

140
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,694
-Do you know who they are?
-No.

141
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,697
I'd never seen any of them before.

142
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,449
Who bought your phone?

143
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:20,286
Tell us who you sold it to,
and we'll take care of the rest.

144
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:24,832
Yes. We need to catch
whoever did this to Eun-hye.

145
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,260
Here's their number.

146
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,971
Thank you for stepping forward.

147
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,849
I'm sure Eun-hye's grateful too.

148
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,730
But could you please tell Eun-hye

149
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,025
that I'm sorry that I pretended

150
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,028
not to see it?

151
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,868
Come on, it's okay.

152
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,412
Eun-hye thanks you

153
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,414
and says not to
let it weigh on you anymore.

154
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,334
Poor thing.

155
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,720
I found where the buyer is.

156
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:25,226
But he's somewhere warm
down south on an island.

157
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,186
An island? What island?

158
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:29,438
I'll text you their location
and a picture.

159
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,858
-Bring me some sashimi and roasted clams.
-Cut the crap and get over here.

160
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,319
Why? I don't want to! I have a date.

161
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,823
Before I send a picture of your face
without makeup to your new boyfriend.

162
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,534
We need someone
to run forensics on the phone.

163
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,371
That son of a bitch…

164
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,464
Hey, the thing is

165
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,842
the Chief made such a fuss
that I had to send

166
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:01,220
Sang-hyeop and Gwang-tae to
the illegal election activities division.

167
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,348
That can't be helped. Let's go
before Nam Han-jun gets the phone.

168
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:08,477
But I did call for backup.

169
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,319
Mr. Cha, what are you doing here?

170
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,740
He said you were going
to an island with Mr. Nam.

171
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:25,703
It'll be a good cover story
if the Chief finds out.

172
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:27,037
-What?
-Come on already.

173
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,708
I'll do my best to assist you.

174
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:33,878
After you.

175
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,678
Hurry up and step on it.
We have to get there first no matter what.

176
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:46,140
-I'll be over the speed limit then.
-We have to get the phone first.

177
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:47,141
If Grumpy gets it,

178
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,685
she'll make all sorts of excuses
not to show it to us.

179
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,353
You shouldn't have been so mean to her.

180
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:53,856
Didn't you just see?

181
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,609
I used my acting skills
to pretend not to be interested,

182
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,694
so we just need to get on the boat first.

183
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,279
-Then it'll be game over!
-Okay.

184
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,405
Good.

185
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,659
-Step on it!
-There's a traffic camera.

186
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,204
We should respect that.

187
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,747
-That's what's right.
-Yes.

188
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,172
You're really here, Mr. Nam.

189
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,217
-I'm just as offended.
-Whatever.

190
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,643
I also have to…

191
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,729
I grew up quite sheltered…

192
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,898
Jeez, youngsters nowadays…

193
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,539
-That hurts.
-It hurts.

194
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,290
-Come on, jeez.
-My gosh.

195
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,127
-I'll double it.
-What?

196
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,255
I'll pay you one million won.

197
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,965
You bought it for 500,000 won,

198
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,551
so it won't be a loss for you.

199
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,136
If you sell it to him,
you could get into trouble later.

200
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,723
This phone might hold
evidence to a murder.

201
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,433
You're not a suspect.

202
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,852
You don't have to cooperate
with the police.

203
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,606
Phones turned in when there's no
warrant are hard to get back later.

204
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,692
A warrant? Did you just say "warrant"?

205
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,111
Cooperate with us before we get a warrant.

206
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:26,115
-I'll give you plenty of compensation--
-I can't believe what I'm hearing.

207
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,868
Sir, you've never even seen
that video, have you?

208
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,955
Right? It's better if you sell it to us
before the headache begins.

209
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:33,873
Sir.

210
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,710
-Make the right choice.
-Goodness, how ghastly.

211
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,086
That's so dirty.

212
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,089
Wait, how much did I bring?

213
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,258
Who cares? Two million!

214
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,635
-Two million? That's too much…
-No, it's fine.

215
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,470
I'll give you two million won.

216
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,098
Whether I submit it to the police
or if they confiscate it,

217
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,725
I'll take full responsibility.

218
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,772
I'm going to…

219
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,155
sell it to him.

220
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,078
Here it is.

221
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,706
Look what we've got.

222
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,125
Mr. Cha, run!

223
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,044
-Get him! Get him!
-Don't you move.

224
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,922
-Hey, Jo Na-dan, get Cha Do-won!
-Stay still.

225
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,216
-Get him.
-Gosh.

226
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,344
Out of my way!

227
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,554
-Hey.
-Hey, you!

228
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,696
-Get out of my way!
-Give it back!

229
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,822
Hey, let go!

230
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,199
Mr. Jang!

231
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,742
Grab it, Su-cheol!

232
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:53,827
I'll be off.

233
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,704
Come on, get off!

234
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,291
-No.
-Hey, you! Hey!

235
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,711
Jeez, I don't know why they're doing this.

236
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,296
It must be tiring.

237
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,675
Come on, why are we doing this?
We can all look together.

238
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,260
What are you saying?
She'll just do whatever she wants.

239
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,638
Get lost, you fraud!

240
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,931
Give it here.

241
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,975
-Hey! No!
-Come on, give it to me!

242
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,686
-Mr. Jang!
-Hurry. Give it.

243
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,654
Where do you think you're going?

244
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,197
Stay still.

245
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,245
-You.
-Damn it, what are you doing?

246
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:38,789
Gosh.

247
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,210
Damn it. Time out!

248
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,339
What?

249
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,758
-You wanted to look at it together.
-You said no.

250
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:50,884
Don't be so cheap.

251
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,595
What should I do with him?

252
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,976
-Hey, look over there.
-Please.

253
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,936
Do you think I'm going to fall for that?

254
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,062
No, look.

255
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,315
Crap.

256
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,111
What the hell?

257
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,529
I can't believe he hit me.

258
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,704
-Hey, let go!
-Give it!

259
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,375
I'm an officer of the law.
There's no way I'm losing to you!

260
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:29,048
Let go. I said, let go!

261
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,053
You freaking perverts.

262
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,308
-Jeez. What a bunch of idiots.
-I said, let go.

263
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:40,642
Let go.

264
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,479
Hey, my hair.

265
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,315
-Let go.
-Get off me.

266
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,025
Goodness.

267
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:51,236
-Gosh, my hair!
-I said, let go!

268
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,197
It's over, so why don't we just go eat?

269
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,284
The last ship of the day left.

270
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,745
We have to stay the night here anyway.

271
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,539
Wouldn't you rather have me
run the forensics and share it with you?

272
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,377
Do you want to fight some more?

273
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:12,091
Damn it, why did you wait till now
to tell us that?

274
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,635
Let's eat.

275
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:18,013
I haven't run on the beach
in such a long time. I'm starving.

276
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,310
Kong Su-cheol's pants ripped.

277
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,647
-No, don't.
-What?

278
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:28,649
Stop it!

279
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,569
All right.

280
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,783
-Hurry up. I'm hungry!
-It's done.

281
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:38,867
Okay.

282
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,203
-The food is here.
-Good.

283
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,580
My gosh!

284
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,748
Open up.

285
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:48,836
We worked hard today.
Why don't we have a drink?

286
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,713
-Yes, let's. We have a common goal.
-Okay.

287
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,090
All right.

288
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,510
Here you go, sir.
It's been a tough day, right?

289
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,100
Han-jun.

290
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,643
Come over here.

291
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:08,105
Gosh. You look just like a local.

292
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,731
It's as if you were born here.

293
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:15,571
There aren't any clothes
that I can't pull off.

294
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,030
Right.

295
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,575
Ta-da!

296
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,202
It's pretty comfortable, I like it.

297
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:25,247
You look great in everything, Mr. Cha.

298
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,460
You still have a terrible eye for fashion.

299
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,546
People don't change.

300
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:34,590
What are you glaring at?

301
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:39,636
Think of it as a team dinner. Drink up.

302
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,929
Yes. Eat up.

303
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,264
Pour it down.

304
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,601
-To the death!
-To the death!

305
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,353
Come on, you're being too loud.

306
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,356
Look how lame she is.
Gosh, she's no fun at all.

307
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,524
Party pooper.

308
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,361
Hey, I got it.

309
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,548
Who's that?

310
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,758
Is that the guy from before?

311
00:20:18,425 --> 00:20:22,846
Looking at the way she's seated,
she seems to be ranked higher.

312
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,016
I don't recall seeing her on
the Joyce Entertainment employee list.

313
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,030
Wait.

314
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,994
Curly hair and a large birthmark…

315
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,539
I should find out who he is first.

316
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:53,627
-Unbelievable.
-Those perverted bastards.

317
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,088
Just you wait, I'm going to kill you
once I find you.

318
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,547
Those sons of bitches…

319
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,925
I know. These fuckers…

320
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,386
We should bash their faces in,
rip their eyes out,

321
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,429
and flay them afterward.

322
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:08,684
Sir, we have to get that bastard.

323
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,645
Right, we should. Yes.

324
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,399
Why don't we all put
our hands together and cheer

325
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,484
-for a resolution of this case?
-Okay.

326
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,236
You cops do that on your own.

327
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,073
But wait.

328
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,993
It seems like we have
a bit in common. Can you fight?

329
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,120
You too?

330
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,247
Cheers.

331
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,042
That son of a bitch.

332
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,674
Those goddamn sons of a bitches.

333
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,277
What are you doing out when it's cold?
You look pathetic.

334
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,113
What are you doing out, Mr. Nam?

335
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,450
Did you follow me?

336
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,453
Gosh, don't you think that's a stretch?

337
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,079
Whatever.

338
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,378
Sit down if you're cold.

339
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:24,134
I'm coughing because of the smoke,
but seeing as you offered, I suppose…

340
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,179
I'll sit for a moment.

341
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,727
This reminds me of my childhood.

342
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,272
We used to go camping a lot
because my brother liked it.

343
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,941
I don't really care for camping.

344
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,445
I went once because
my friend wouldn't stop badgering me,

345
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,821
but it wasn't for me.

346
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:46,948
Why go through
all that trouble voluntarily?

347
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,787
But I guess it's not that bad
once in a while. It's nice and warm.

348
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,336
I thought you'd have given up already.

349
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,215
Can I ask why you're so determined
to solve this case?

350
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,095
Why is that?

351
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,682
Because I caught Choi Yeong-seop,
yet some stupid cop let him go?

352
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:17,813
What about you? Why are you so sure
the killer is someone else?

353
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,398
You said you didn't even see their face.

354
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,110
I didn't see his face,

355
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,905
but I definitely saw
that he had a burn scar on his arm.

356
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,327
And Choi Yeong-seop didn't have
a burn scar three years ago.

357
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,624
Is that why you checked
Park Jin-sang's wrist?

358
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:45,590
What about you?
Why are you so fixated on this case?

359
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,094
The day Choi Yeong-seop was released,

360
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,429
I followed him.

361
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:55,100
I saw him retrieve the cell phone
he hid at the crime scene.

362
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,872
Jeez, he's thorough.

363
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,709
He planned to pin everything
on Choi Yeong-seop

364
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,545
when he took that cell phone
to Jae-jeong's house.

365
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,715
He failed because
we inadvertently got in his way.

366
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:32,053
So the culprit must have hidden
that cell phone there too.

367
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,147
I'm sorry.

368
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:48,612
I'm truly sorry about not believing you,
doubting you, and accusing you.

369
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,657
I apologize

370
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,119
for having misjudged you until now.

371
00:24:58,455 --> 00:24:59,539
Look at this.

372
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:03,293
I knew you weren't being sincere
when you apologized last time.

373
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,841
I would've also thought that

374
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,636
Choi Yeong-seop was the killer
if I were you.

375
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,097
We just saw different things
and believed what we each saw.

376
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,349
So don't be sorry.

377
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,686
We're both regretting enough already.

378
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,232
I wish

379
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,236
I had just said that
Choi Yeong-seop was the killer.

380
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:31,655
I wish

381
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,075
I had rushed to my friend more quickly.

382
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,369
I regret it.

383
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,832
You must have regrets like that
weighing on your chest too.

384
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:50,423
It's hard enough with all this regret.

385
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,926
Let's not be sorry as well.

386
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,347
Gosh, my legs.

387
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,934
Mr. Nam. There's actually--

388
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,108
There's something I didn't tell you.

389
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,129
Lieutenant Han.

390
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,631
Gosh.

391
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,009
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

392
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:40,932
You just can't leave her alone
being her sidekick and all.

393
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:45,270
Hey, I'm not here for you,
so mind your own business.

394
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,400
-You want to duke it out?
-What's he on about?

395
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,944
-It's cold.
-Let's go inside.

396
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:54,571
Okay.

397
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,576
You've got to be kidding me.

398
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,495
It's freezing here. Gosh, it's cold.

399
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,377
Looks like you and Mr. Nam
are pretty close now.

400
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,589
Me? No way!

401
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,968
I want you to be as relaxed with me

402
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,305
as you are with Mr. Nam,
like you're with a friend.

403
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:25,226
Is it too soon for you
to think of me like that?

404
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,229
But kicking someone around
because they piss you off

405
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,566
and being relaxed with someone
are two different things.

406
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:37,447
It's just that it seems like you're closer
to Mr. Nam than you are with me.

407
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,491
That made me a little sad.

408
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,326
Mr. Cha.

409
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,661
Do you want me to
kick you around too from now on?

410
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,581
Yes.

411
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,792
No, wait. That's not what I meant.

412
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:54,172
Just don't forget that
I'm always on your side.

413
00:27:57,092 --> 00:28:00,053
Well, we're here.

414
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:02,347
I'll go inside.

415
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,183
Here…

416
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,732
Don't forget

417
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:17,153
that I'm always on your side too.

418
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,617
-Okay.
-Sweet dreams.

419
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,546
Oh, please. What a load of crap.

420
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,881
I'm not on anyone's side.

421
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,008
I'm on my side.

422
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,430
I ought to headbutt you.

423
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,935
You're still the same, Mr. Nam.
Three years ago…

424
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,399
and now.

425
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:05,368
If you hadn't ignored my advice then,

426
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,329
I might have not been the same.

427
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,792
Is that so?

428
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:17,589
If you gave up then,
could we have avoided conflicts like this?

429
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,552
Knowing when to brake is a skill

430
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,513
you only need when driving.

431
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,432
Finding the truth

432
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,268
isn't something you give up on.

433
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,440
That was fucking charismatic.

434
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,416
You saw the video like you wanted,

435
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,293
so why don't you hand over the phone?

436
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,089
All right.

437
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,342
This is where our cooperation ends.

438
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:05,261
I know you'd love to have
a great shaman like me help you,

439
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,429
but what can you do?

440
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,097
You'll have to do without me.

441
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,184
You have a knack for ticking me off
when I'm trying to be nice.

442
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,728
I'll call you if I have a question.

443
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,522
What for? Don't call me.

444
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,358
Let's just keep going
our separate ways.

445
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,070
If you don't want to see my face,

446
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,905
step away from the case.

447
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,452
How about we continue
to be each other's archenemies?

448
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,870
Doesn't that sound better?

449
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,916
Yes, that sounds better.

450
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:39,587
If you don't want to see us again,
don't get too involved in the case.

451
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,968
What's he smirking for?

452
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,305
Gosh, I don't feel good.

453
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,057
Let's go. I had too much to drink.

454
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:52,600
Gosh.

455
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,562
I want to sleep some more.

456
00:30:57,063 --> 00:31:00,400
Aren't you going to tell Inspector Han
everything we know about Gopuri?

457
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:03,111
It'll be better if we share information
and work together.

458
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,113
No, it'll only make Gopuri notice us.

459
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,407
No good can come from dealing with Grumpy.

460
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,450
Did you look into the employees at Joyce?

461
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,995
Yes. But that man
from the video wasn't there.

462
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,329
They all have straight hair.

463
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:16,499
He might be wearing a wig.
There's no one with a birthmark either?

464
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,709
No.

465
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,044
I'll see if anyone
outside the company fits the bill.

466
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,880
Look into Kang Eun-hye's movements

467
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,965
and dig into the people
who were around her.

468
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,383
-Okay.
-Right.

469
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:28,678
But I need some sleep first.
I still feel drunk.

470
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,847
Who gave Hye-jun alcohol? Who?

471
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,308
-It was you.
-Did you blackout?

472
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,810
-I did?
-Why are you so upbeat these days?

473
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,397
-We haven't left the house in a while.
-Wake me up when we're there.

474
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:41,900
I'm tired.

475
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,156
MS. LEE JI-EUN

476
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,284
MS. LEE JI-EUN

477
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,579
Yes, Ms. Lee. What is it?

478
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:58,082
I don't know if this will help…

479
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:00,418
JOYCE ENTERTAINMENT

480
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,545
…but I remembered something.

481
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:06,424
Eun-hye used to always get off
at Hankuk University Station.

482
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,052
Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Lee.

483
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,845
Bye.

484
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,139
Yes!

485
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,975
We might be able to find them
faster than Nam Han-jun!

486
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,523
We have to run.

487
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,776
Don't go.

488
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,280
I almost stopped the car.

489
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,491
We can do this…

490
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,620
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

491
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,456
TRAVEL HISTORY RESULTS

492
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:42,043
There's this guy who left the country
whenever Kang Eun-hye did.

493
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:45,755
His name's Jeon Gyeong-cheol.
He runs a livestream service.

494
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:49,092
They call it a streaming service,
but it's pretty much a porn studio.

495
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,969
A 21st-century pimp.

496
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,388
In a nutshell,

497
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,722
he's a piece of shit.

498
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,769
Hong Kong, Macao, Philippines…

499
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:04,190
It's obviously expedition gambling.
And they took a high school girl?

500
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,191
Crazy bastards.

501
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,776
-Yes. True.
-Jeez.

502
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:10,780
That guy, the one with
the birthmark on his face around here.

503
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,448
He's the acting chief
for the Jjokmun Gang.

504
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,742
-Hey, you guys were eating.
-Dig in.

505
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,245
The Jjokmun gang? The loan sharks?

506
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,831
Yes, they made big money with that,

507
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,708
and now they have
their fingers in everything.

508
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:26,129
The video must've been to check the tastes
of the people they bribe with sex.

509
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,464
Could anyone know
about Jeon Gyeong-cheol's trips?

510
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,469
Well, there is someone. Madam Wang…

511
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,264
-"The Queen Bee…"
-"Queen Bee"?

512
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:40,143
Yes. They call her that because
she devours men who are her type.

513
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,189
She likes flashy things,
so you two will get along.

514
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,527
A queen bee,
a pimp, and a high school girl…

515
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,405
Not a combination I love.

516
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,907
That bastard…

517
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,744
NAME: JEON GYEONG-CHEOL
POSITION: JJOKMUN GANG'S ACTING CHIEF

518

HANKUK UNIVERSITY

519
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,666
Excuse me.
Have you seen this woman around here?

520
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,961
-I'm not sure.
-Have you ever seen this woman?

521
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,838
No, I don't think so.

522
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,758
Hi, have you seen this woman?

523
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,051
Do you know…

524
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,845
I'm not sure. I don't think so.

525
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,892
YURA'S NEIGHBORHOOD GAMJATANG

526
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:25,521
Jeez.

527
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,819
I'm aching all over. My legs hurt.

528
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,656
Once your legs lose all feeling,

529
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,784
that's when they say a miracle will occur.

530
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:38,993
Right, sure.

531
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,244
Let's go.

532
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,581
-That way.
-Okay.

533
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,875
She's a regular at our cafe.

534
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,713
I saw her go toward
that studio building out front.

535
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,927
Oh, her? She lives in unit 1802.

536
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,263
Her parents don't live in Seoul,
so she came with her uncle.

537
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:02,517
Give me a second.

538
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,478
GREEN REAL ESTATE AGENCY

539
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,065
Here's the contract
and a copy of her bankbook.

540
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,234
TENANT: JEON GYEONG-CHEOL

541
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,693
Jeon Gyeong-cheol?

542
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,738
I've heard of that name before.

543
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,117
Jeon Gyeong-cheol, with the Jjokmun Gang.

544
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,160
Didn't he have a big birthmark
on his face?

545
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:25,540
Yes, he did. He left a strong impression
because of that big birthmark.

546
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,503
I tell you to dress up,
and you dress like a middle-aged man.

547
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,630
Come on. Are you kidding me?

548
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,298
Look how well-dressed I am.

549
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,301
What is that?
Did you get it from the hardware store?

550
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,928
It's 24-karat gold!

551
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,848
-My god, this is so frustrating.
-This stuff is expensive.

552
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,436
This is from the new line.

553
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:53,401
Flashy necklace and vivid-colored clothes…

554
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,737
She's interested in that hot pink bag,

555
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,198
but her makeup's very natural.

556
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:03,202
She likes getting attention
but doesn't want others to know that.

557
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,497
You can tell she's rich
just from her face.

558
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,875
She must really look after herself.

559
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,878
No. She's very strict
about maintaining her looks,

560
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,796
but she doesn't like complicated things.

561
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,340
And she's fixing her makeup
while looking this way,

562
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,634
which means she's interested in me.

563
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,553
That will make things easier.

564
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,222
Yes. You really must have something.

565
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,520
I think

566
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,609
that simple but classy black
will accentuate your beauty more.

567
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,444
-What do you think?
-You're right.

568
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,656
It's solid and elegant.

569
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,534
I like it very much.

570
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,204
Why me?

571
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,801
So he asked you to bring together
your best earners,

572
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,136
so you introduced them to him?

573
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,847
I could smell the money on him.

574
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:07,433
I said he wouldn't be able to afford
even one of them with the usual sum,

575
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,268
and do you know what he said?

576
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,145
"No need to worry about money."

577
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:13,773
"I'll be bringing famous politicians
and businessmen,

578
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,067
so prepare the women on that level."

579
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,320
-And then…
-And then?

580
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:22,573
He left a 100 million won deposit!

581
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:26,285
He said it was to ensure
complete confidentiality.

582
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,871
I brought all the top girls in the field,

583
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:32,333
and Jeon Gyeong-cheol brought someone
with him to interview them.

584
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,834
Who did he bring?

585
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,969
-What?
-Do something.

586
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,102
Who did he bring?

587
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,812
The director of Joyce Entertainment.

588
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,147
You mean Park Jin-sang?

589
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,191
I don't know his name.

590
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,902
Please hold on.

591
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,570
Let go, come on!

592
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:05,116
This is going to be
bigger than we thought.

593
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,119
I told you everything I know,

594
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,830
and you seem to have understood
how high up this goes…

595
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,177
Well, I'll just go take a look
at the new line.

596
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,727
You're adorable!

597
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,653
SISTER

598
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,157
The number you called cannot be reached.
Please leave--

599
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,783
I can't believe she screened me.

600
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:51,162
Where did she run off to?
I told her to be on standby.

601
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:55,458
Evade me all you want,
but you're in the palm of my hand.

602
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:00,546
Han River?

603
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,340
She's on a date at Han River again?

604
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,550
If she's on a date, she'll go on a picnic,

605
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,635
then they'll get in the car,
and if they click…

606
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,262
That little minx.

607
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,724
Hey, Su-cheol, let's go.

608
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,518
-What?
-Go. I'll see you again.

609
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:01,649
Honey.

610
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,153
Oh, god.

611
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,572
Shoot.

612
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,743
You son of a bitch.
I thought you were working?

613
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,370
I had no idea you were referring

614
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:17,498
to a hot date when you said
you had an urgent meeting.

615
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,083
Honey…

616
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:29,260
You really know how to make a guy
sick of you, don't you?

617
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:30,302
Sick of me?

618
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,179
You're sick of me?

619
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,848
Yes. I'm sick of you.

620
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:37,476
You're too unpredictable, I never know
what you'll do, and I'm sick of it!

621
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,437
You said that was what you liked about me.

622
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,857
Please. I put up with it at first
because you were hot.

623
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,068
But you're nothing like your looks.

624
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:48,529
You swear like a sailor
and eat like a middle-aged man.

625
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:49,780
Jeez.

626
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:53,868
There isn't a drop of femininity in you,
and you have to get home before midnight?

627
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,995
Who are you, Cinderella?

628
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:02,168
You're truly an outdated
and condescending prick, aren't you?

629
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:06,338
I've dated you although you were an idiot
who doesn't understand quantum computing.

630
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,090
What did you say, you piece of shit?

631
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:12,386
What a horndog you are,
considering you can't even get it up.

632
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,680
-You little…
-Stop right there.

633
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,675
Who are those idiots?

634
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,344
Your angels of death.

635
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,020
I don't usually look at guys in detail.

636
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,231
It's off-putting,
learning too much about guys.

637
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:06,774
But you…

638
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:08,567
This car isn't yours, is it?

639
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:11,195
How did you…

640
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:14,740
You use cheap shampoo and perfume,
and your watch is a knockoff,

641
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,992
but your car's expensive,
so I thought I'd ask.

642
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:20,120
I don't care if you're poor,

643
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,124
but how dare you raise
your hands at my sister?

644
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,210
Who the heck are you?

645
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,255
Hye-jun's so cute and adorable

646
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,507
that I couldn't touch
a single hair on her head,

647
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,634
yet you dared to raise your hand at her?

648
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,094
What should we do?

649
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:37,846
Should I throw him in the river to drown?

650
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:42,309
He does deserve to die,
but it'd just end up being a hassle.

651
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,103
I guess so.

652
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:46,480
Then how about I break something?

653
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,024
What should I snap?

654
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,110
Did Hye-jun tell you

655
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,486
how her brother

656
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,490
is a shaman famous for his curses?

657
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,997
Lie to another woman again,

658
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,083
and this is what will happen to you.

659
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,878
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

660
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,381
-It's fine. These things happen.
-Please?

661
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,383
Get back up. It's all right.

662
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:19,388
You know,
if you ever bother Hye-jun again,

663
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:22,683
my fists will get you
before that voodoo doll does.

664
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:23,976
Got it?

665
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,228
And…

666
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,023
keep it in your pants.

667
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,818
My gift to you.

668
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,706
By the way, why is his car like that?

669
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,626
I wouldn't be Nam Hye-jun
if I did nothing, would I?

670
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:49,918
True.

671
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,630
Do I have to pay for the damages again?

672
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,426
I was tracking the movements
of Joyce's funds

673
00:43:57,509 --> 00:44:00,888
and found they used
their company card in Southeast Asia.

674
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:04,266
It turns out we know the guy
who purchased the plane ticket.

675
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,352
Jeon Gyeong-cheol, the loan shark?

676
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,438
Yes. He runs a livestream service now,

677
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:12,608
but he has a record
of expedition gambling and sexual bribery.

678
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:16,153
Expedition gambling and high school girls…

679
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,155
Do you think Joyce Entertainment is

680
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,741
related to Kang Eun-hye's murder?

681
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:28,624
For now, it's just reasonable suspicion.
I don't have any proof.

682
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:35,089
I'm going to go to Daeun station.

683
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,257
In the meantime, could you find out

684
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,510
how Park Jin-sang knows Jeon Gyeong-cheol?

685
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,720
-Okay.
-Bye.

686
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,851
How does he do that?

687
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,562
Alumni and friends are one thing,

688
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:53,315
but it's hard to be
that cold to your relatives.

689
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:57,069
There's a reason he's famous for being
absolutely unapproachable to women.

690
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,113
No wonder.

691
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:04,034
What could have happened
to make her cry like that?

692
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,210
But I heard she got around
using the subway.

693
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,254
So why did she come out
of the underground car park?

694
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,590
Did someone come to pick her up?

695
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,344
-Jeon Gyeong-cheol…
-Did Jeon Gyeol-cheol lease

696
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,804
Kang Eun-hye's studio?

697
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,766
-Mr. Cha.
-Oh, hey.

698
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,733
The building looks like it should
be registered with UNESCO,

699
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,819
but it has a high-tech security system.

700
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,572
They've got dozens
of proxy servers overseas.

701
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:44,241
They're pulling that crap
to avoid having their IP traced.

702
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,872
-Are there any CCTVs inside?
-I can manipulate them all

703
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:53,000
except the one that's not
connected to the internet. This one.

704
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:57,296
Are they just begging
for someone to steal it,

705
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,089
or is it some convoluted trick?

706
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,717
That's the problem with smart people.

707
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,887
Why would you make things
unnecessarily complicated?

708
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,389
They just installed it there
because it's important.

709
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,391
-It's that simple?
-Yes.

710
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,520
What's going on there?

711
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:17,357
They must be crazy. In broad daylight?

712
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,651
-Su-cheol. The camera.
-Okay.

713
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,111
-Send it.
-Right.

714
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,283
It's Re-a, an adult
entertainment streamer.

715
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,536
It's obvious she's high on drugs.

716
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,916
She's forced into doing livestreams
to pay back her debt to Jeon Gyeong-cheol,

717
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:38,212
then is forced to buy drugs with the
money she makes. It's a vicious cycle.

718
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,798
She disappeared during a livestream,
and the chat room went wild.

719
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,342
But she's not the only victim.

720
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:44,510
What?

721
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,221
Eun-a, another streamer,

722
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,932
was dragged away
during a livestream a few months ago,

723
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:52,976
and she hasn't been heard from since.
There are no signs of life.

724
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,938
I think we should call the police
since this is serious.

725
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:59,816
What? Even the police
won't be able to get in there.

726
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,985
Guys in the drug trade are really brutal.

727
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,154
Damn it, all I wanted
was a lousy document.

728
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,490
Why can't they be good? Those scumbags.

729
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,286
Hey, Na-dan. We need a delivery.

730
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,540
-We should go too.
-Let's go.

731
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,794
Hey, are you listening? Can't you hear me?

732
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:22,714
-What?
-He's here. Jeez.

733
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,844
Is the AI done learning…
Hey, is the AI voice recognition…

734
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,056
Is the AI done learning her voice?

735
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:33,433
The AI voice learning!

736
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,645
Yes. It'll be like Eun-ha
came back to life.

737
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:40,399
Okay. I'm ready. I'm here.

738
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,192
Are you going to war?

739
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,278
-Where's the outfit?
-Here.

740
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,990
This is dangerous.

741
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,745
I'd rather just fight them.

742
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,914
I'm not wearing this!

743
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:59,001
-Oh, it'll look good on you.
-Aren't you coming?

744
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,294
Let's go!

745
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,379
Yes, okay.

746
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:04,548
Gosh, she's going deaf.

747
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:06,592
-We've all been through this.
-Come on.

748
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:10,012
-You can do it too.
-No, I can't!

749
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,264
-Gosh.
-Darn it.

750
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:14,308
-Even before I bet?
-Hey.

751
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,602
-This is going to be good.
-Delivery!

752
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:17,978
Darn it.

753
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:20,022
That doesn't work these days.

754
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,059
You!

755
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,854
Begone!

756
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:02,689
Who are you?

757
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,692
Do you think you can just barge in here
and pull your crap?

758
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:12,282
Me? I'm Shaman Nam Han-jun

759
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,035
the wonder of Yonghae-dong.

760
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,376
And your savior

761
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:25,003
who will rescue you
from that vengeful spirit over there.

762
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:26,922
A vengeful spirit?

763
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,801
Oh my.

764
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:36,515
So that's why that spirit is wandering
around the land of the living

765
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,434
because of you lot.

766
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,439
Are you kidding me? He's crazy.

767
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,357
Hey.

768
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,443
You haven't been
beaten up recently, have you?

769
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:49,820
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

770
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:51,029
-Drag him out.
-Yes, sir.

771
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,240
Jung Eun-ha.

772
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:59,871
The spirit behind you
says that's her name.

773
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,248
You really don't know her?

774
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,933
Hi, guys.

775
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:21,184
Nice to see you again.

776
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:23,019
Isn't that Eun-ha's voice?

777
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:26,064
-Oh my.
-Goodness.

778
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:31,319
Oh my. What to do.

779
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,571
You fools.

780
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:33,822
Oh my.

781
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:39,119
-Oh my.
-I sure am glad to see you again,

782
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,537
-but I don't think you are.
-Oh my.

783
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,417
Oh my.

784
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,502
Goodness. It's so realistic.

785
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:48,879
What's wrong?

786
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,381
-Are you going to kill me again?
-Oh my!

787
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:55,761
Oh my. Your ill intent is about to

788
00:50:56,928 --> 00:51:01,391
Oh my. The spirit grows evil
in its vengeance.

789
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,477
Oh my.

790
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,063
-Oh my.
-Ghosts don't fucking exist!

791
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,566
Oh my…

792
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,193
Who's pulling this crap?

793
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:17,199
Oh my.

794
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,160
Mr. Shaman, do something, please!

795
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:23,538
You're a shaman.
You can get rid of spirits, can't you?

796
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:29,503
Oh, that? It requires
a lot of time and effort.

797
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,879
I'll do anything.

798
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:32,672
-Anything?
-Yes!

799
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:36,760
You miserable, vicious,
horrible, vile creatures.

800
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,683
I pray to the gods of heaven and earth

801
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:47,521
to have mercy
on this vengeful spirit turned evil.

802
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:48,855
I pray upon you.

803
00:51:56,363 --> 00:52:00,116
You cannot leave this office
until I get rid of the spirit.

804
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,201
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

805
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,745
Disobey me,
and something terrible will happen.

806
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,997
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

807
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,082
Gosh…

808
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,753
Don't even look! Turn around!

809
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:14,172
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

810
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,471
We did it!

811
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:38,947
I wonder

812
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,993
why you were in such a bad state today.

813
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:44,953
I'm sorry.

814
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,580
I promise I won't do it again.

815
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:50,083
Again?

816
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,545
Again?

817
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:58,592
The viewers already saw
your eyes roll back like this.

818
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:03,096
Now that off-putting sight is
what they'll think of when they see you.

819
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:04,222
So what do you mean again?

820
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,308
JJOKMUN GANG'S ACTING CHIEF
JEON GYEONG-CHEOL

821
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,351
How much does she owe us?

822
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,562
One hundred and thirty million won.

823
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,480
Goodness.

824
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:15,942
She can't stream anymore like this,
so how shall we get our money back?

825
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,613
Send her to make videos
and receive clients.

826
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,740
Sir, please.

827
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:24,492
I promise I'll work really hard.

828
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,952
Please, don't.

829
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,246
-Please.
-Hey.

830
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:32,876
You wouldn't be here
if working hard is all it took.

831
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,128
Why do you think you're here?

832
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,598
I don't think she'll last much longer.

833
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:50,310
-Hurry up with the video.
-Yes, sir.

834
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,519
Hey, get the camera.

835
00:53:51,603 --> 00:53:53,480
What are you rolling your eyes back for?

836
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:54,940
What are you? A zombie?

837
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:56,900
-Jeez.
-Damn it.

838
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,364
You startled me, you prick.

839
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,699
-Prick?
-Are you a cop?

840
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,452
That's so rude, calling me names
when you just met me.

841
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:09,621
That's right. A prick?

842
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:12,582
I know he looks like an idiot,
but that's going too far!

843
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:15,794
I guess you're not cops. So what are you?

844
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:18,964
Hey, wait. An idiot?
You think I'm an idiot?

845
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,757
Isn't "prick" way worse?

846
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,425
How are you bothered about that?

847
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,803
How am I an idiot?

848
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:27,305
-Then you're a cheapskate!
-What?

849
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,265
-You're embarrassing us right now.
-Can't you hear me?

850
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:30,725
I'm embarrassing you?

851
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,352
-Yes!
-Two can play at that game.

852
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:35,355
-That one time, you even--
-Hey!

853
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:37,482
Are you kidding me?

854
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:40,068
One's dressed like a hobo…

855
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,111
Hobo?

856
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,445
…and the other is an idiot.

857
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,906
-An idiot?
-Hey, beat him to a pulp.

858
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,158
You're not supposed to be here,
so hurry on out.

859
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:55,959
-Damn it.
-My neck!

860
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,044
Watch your words, you moron!

861
00:54:59,045 --> 00:54:59,963
What was that?

862
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,634
What? An idiot?

863
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,681
Was it you? Come over here.

864
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:12,225
What?

865
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:28,116
-Yes! You knocked them all out!
-What did you say? An idiot?

866
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,659
An idiot?

867
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:31,828
-An idiot?
-No, of course not.

868
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:33,663
-I know how smart you are.
-What?

869
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:37,709
Here. How long has it been
since I gave you some pocket money?

870
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,210
Ta-da!

871
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:41,296
-Here.
-Okay.

872
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:46,760
-Are you hurt?
-No.

873
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:49,220
You did a good job.

874
00:55:55,226 --> 00:55:56,811
What did you say to me before?

875
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,772
A prick?

876
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,232
I can't fight. Let's talk this out.

877
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,609
Go easy on him.

878
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:15,413
I told you it's dangerous
to ambush them without a plan.

879
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,207
We'll split up, then.

880
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:18,875
Mr. Cha and I will go in first.

881
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,795
You, Detective Kim,
and Detective Na can back us up.

882
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,380
Watch our backs, please.

883
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,216
She didn't listen to me, right?

884
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,718
Is she just working hard
or messing with me?

885
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,595
She's working hard to mess with you.

886
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:33,723
Does she have it in for you?

887
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,141
I guess so.

888
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:36,810
Damn it.

889
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,353
Crap.

890
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:40,855
Shouldn't we call Mr. Nam?

891
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:43,358
Don't bother. It's too late.

892
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:47,278
What we need to do right now is…

893
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:49,989
run away.

894
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:51,783
Wait for me!

895
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:54,327
Didn't they say this place was dangerous?

896
00:56:54,410 --> 00:56:56,704
Did the other detectives
make some sort of mistake?

897
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:58,957
That or something's going on.

898
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,334
-What?
-Follow me.

899
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,586
Wait…

900
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,299
Are you still not going to talk?

901
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,135
What's the password? Come on.

902
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,511
I said, I don't know.

903
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,556
This isn't working.

904
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,475
-Su-cheol, you'll need to step in.
-Okay.

905
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:18,893
You're dead now.

906
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:21,312
Come on, tell us.

907
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,273
I told you I don't know!

908
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,732
Really? Okay.

909
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:28,278
The emergency responders
will be here soon, so don't worry.

910
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,990
I'm going to let you go
on a count of three.

911
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:33,825
One.

912
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:35,827
-Two.
-I really don't know!

913
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:37,495
Three.

914
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,877
How about now?

915
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:46,045
I'll tell you.

916
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:48,840
-I will.
-Okay.

917
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:54,012
-What's the password?
-It's 9876543.

918
00:57:54,095 --> 00:57:56,389
-It's 98, what?
-It's 9876543.

919
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:59,267
-Did you get that?
-What?

920
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,643
987654.

921
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:02,395
Okay, 987654!

922
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:11,696
Come.

923
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,949
So 987654.

924
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,162
Jeez, what a simpleton.

925
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:27,045
JJOKMUN ENTERTAINMENT PROFILE

926
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,756
MODELING FEE PAYMENTS

927
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:35,094
Now, everything's going to be fine
as long as you answer my questions.

928
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:38,223
-Could you untie me first?
-What?

929
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:40,517
-What do you want to know?
-What we want to know?

930
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:44,103
You should be asking me.

931
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:47,190
How are Joyce and Jjokmun related?

932
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:52,487
Did Director Park Jin-sang send you?

933
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,823
I guess you two don't get along?

934
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:59,369
Who sent you on those overseas trips,
if not Park Jin-sang?

935
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:03,081
I don't know what you're talking about.

936
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:05,625
-What?
-You're going to pretend you don't know?

937
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:06,543
Su-cheol.

938
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:09,337
Yes, okay, I hope this rope's sturdy.

939
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:12,840
I just know that Joyce is involved
but I don't know any details!

940
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:15,510
I just did it because
they offered me a lot of money.

941
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:16,928
I'm telling you the truth!

942
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:26,229
Did someone with a burn scar
on his arm put you up to this?

943
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:31,276
Who is it?

944
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:34,404
Come on, who is it?

945
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,497
Don't move. We're the police.

946
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,124
Mr. Nam?

947
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,084
What?

948
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,628
What are you doing here?

949
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:55,383
You know, I was passing by with Su-cheol,

950
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,260
and I felt this strange energy.

951
00:59:57,343 --> 01:00:01,014
I dropped by again and found that
he was being haunted by an evil spirit.

952
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:04,767
An evil spirit?

953
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:06,894
Don't you have any other excuses?

954
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:13,318
Put that down.

955
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:14,986
Move, and I'll shoot.

956
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:16,821
What?

957
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:20,241
I know we're archenemies,

958
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:22,493
but isn't it a bit much,
holding us at gunpoint?

959
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,162
I said I'll shoot if you move.

960
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:27,415
Do you think
I'll fall for an empty threat--

961
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:35,465
Han-jun!

962
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:51,773
EPILOGUE

963
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:54,984
Take off your clothes.

964
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:22,720
He's the cop from three years ago.

965
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:24,180
What should we do?

966
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,765
How bothersome.

967
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:08,266
There are people who are
trying to protect Jeon Gyeong-cheol.

968
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:09,892
Protect him?

969
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:13,312
I've heard that Park Jin-sang
of Joyce Entertainment is your cousin.

970
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:16,149
-Is it because you're afraid, or…
-Lieutenant Han.

971
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:17,483
…is it because you don't want to know?

972
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,610
I might endanger the people I love again.

973
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:22,071
I was told to take care of him
since Our plan will be foiled

974
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,531
once he starts running his mouth.

975
01:02:23,614 --> 01:02:26,784
We'll make him come on his own accord
and tell us everything.

976
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,536
Please, help me, Mr. Shaman.

977
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:30,830
The only way for you to live
is to sort him out.

978
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,331
He has a burn scar on his arm, right?

979
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,249
You bastard…

980
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:38,337
