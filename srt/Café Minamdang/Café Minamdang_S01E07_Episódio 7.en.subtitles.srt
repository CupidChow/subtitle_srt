1
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,666
Han-jun's at the emergency stairs.

2
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,667
Hurry!

3
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,548
Gopuri, you bastard.

4
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,935
Han-jun.

5
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:04,731
-Go catch Gopuri!
-Damn it.

6
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,308
Hey, stop right there!

7
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,503
Where…

8
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,007
Where did that bastard go?

9
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,889
EPISODE 7

10
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,528
Where's the killer?

11
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,905
Su-cheol's after him.
What about Choi Yeong-seop?

12
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,076
Damn it.

13
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,247
I'll go get the doctor!

14
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,916
Choi Yeong-seop!

15
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,251
Tell me who the killer is!

16
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,004
-Tell me who it is, then you--
-Mr. Shaman.

17
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:54,090
Su-ji, my Su-ji.

18
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,926
Su-ji…

19
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,178
Su-ji.

20
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,933
Su-ji.

21
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,644
Su-ji.…

22
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,854
Su-ji's asking me

23
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,858
to tell you that she's sorry
she broke your heart.

24
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:14,903
That she loves you

25
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:18,948
and that you never let her down.

26
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,285
She says you can let it go now

27
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,370
and come to her.

28
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:26,873
Your daughter is kind.

29
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,876
Su-ji…

30
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,258
I didn't kill anyone.

31
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:43,056
He's going to use someone like me again

32
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,266
to kill…

33
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:50,772
He won't stop…

34
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:00,573
Choi Yeong-seop.

35
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,784
Choi Yeong-seop.

36
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,078
Mr. Choi!

37
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,455
Wake up! Mr. Choi!

38
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,209
Do something!

39
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:14,003
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

40
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,505
-Give me 200 joules.
-Charging.

41
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:17,048
One, two, go!

42
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,716
One millimeter of epinephrine.

43
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,427
-One, two, three, four, five, six…
-Give me 200 joules.

44
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,805
-Charging.
-One, two, go!

45
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,816
No.

46
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,360
Choi Yeong-seop!

47
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,698
You can't die like this!

48
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:46,327
Choi Yeong-seop, wake up!

49
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,663
Choi Yeong-seop!

50
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,042
Wake up!

51
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:54,836
Stop it.

52
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,817
This was our chance to finally find out

53
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,236
why Jae-jeong was murdered.

54
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:27,577
I know. I thought
we'd finally be able to catch the killer.

55
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,962
I want an apology.

56
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:43,092
I told you so many times,
over and over again

57
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,512
that Choi Yeong-seop
didn't kill Kang Eun-hye

58
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,930
and he was just a pawn.

59
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,017
But you kept ignoring me.
Look what happened now.

60
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,062
-That's--
-You heard it too!

61
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,980
Choi Yeong-seop said
he didn't kill anyone!

62
00:05:56,064 --> 00:06:00,568
Even if that's true,
he was still an accomplice.

63
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,528
Gosh…

64
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,199
So you won't admit it to the very end?

65
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,702
I guess you won't need
the killer's DNA that I risked

66
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,662
my life to get.

67
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,457
Mr. Nam!

68
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,418
Without that,
you won't catch the killer either.

69
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,964
So admit that you made a mistake
and apologize!

70
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,884
Apologize for ignoring me and hitting me!

71
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:28,179
For screwing me over when we said
we'd catch the killer together

72
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:31,349
-and for removing the CCTV!
-I get that he's upset,

73
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:33,601
but he's being so immature about it.

74
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:37,563
If you destroy the evidence,
I will arrest you for real this time.

75
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,525
You…

76
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,362
You really are a bad person, aren't you?

77
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:47,657
No!

78
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,451
Okay, fine!

79
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,994
I'll apologize, I will.

80
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,209
Jeez.

81
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,548
I'm sorry.

82
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,926
I apologize for having
ignored your opinion.

83
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,555
I should have listened to you better.
I was too hasty.

84
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:14,767
I admit that I made a mistake
and I apologize.

85
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,482
That didn't feel sincere.

86
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,447
However…

87
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,743
I'll be the bigger person
and accept your apology.

88
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:37,999
Here you go.

89
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:42,044
And you! Are you listening?

90
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:45,756
If you want to catch the killer,
find the man who killed Choi Yeong-seop!

91
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,551
Don't do a slapdash job
just to close the case!

92
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,804
Investigate like a true police officer!
A true police officer!

93
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,556
Got it?

94
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,016
Now go!

95
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,772
-Okay, bye.
-See you again.

96
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,944
Nam Han-jun…

97
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,155
Nam Han-jun!

98
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:14,243
Nam Han-jun!

99
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,168
You can do it.

100
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,090
Are you feeling better?

101
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,345
I don't think I am.

102
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:36,557
If you were going to be this upset,
why didn't you just lash out at Mr. Nam?

103
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:40,937
Well, I was angrier with myself

104
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,688
than I was with Nam Han-jun earlier.

105
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,442
Now that I know
that Choi Yeong-seop isn't the killer,

106
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,486
everything I did until now felt pointless

107
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,404
and it made me feel incompetent.

108
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,198
That made me upset.

109
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:57,078
Why did it never occur to me in
the last three years that Choi Yeong-seop

110
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,830
might not be the killer?

111
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:03,668
I was sure it was Choi Yeong-seop too.

112
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:09,173
I guess Mr. Nam Han-jun was
the only one who saw through everything.

113
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:13,386
He must be laughing at me
somewhere even now.

114
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:16,681
Damn it!
Thinking about it makes me mad again.

115
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:21,060
Let's catch the killer together,
the two of us.

116
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,483
CLOSED UNTIL SUNDAY
DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

117
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,038
Damn it.

118
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,058
He hasn't eaten anything.

119
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,978
Shouldn't we drag him out
and feed him porridge or something?

120
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:08,983
It's his own fault for hoping
that there would be a DNA match.

121
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:13,195
Right. But being like that isn't good
for your mental health.

122
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:21,662
Gosh, Han-jun. It's okay.
Everything will be okay.

123
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,497
It's all right, everything's okay.

124
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,790
-What are you doing?
-What?

125
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,125
What do you mean it's okay?

126
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:31,422
And why does it smell like
someone else's house here?

127
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:34,675
What's that?

128
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,927
Fermented skate
with steamed pork and kimchi.

129
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:38,929
You must be hungry. Come on, eat with us.

130
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:40,931
Are you kidding me?

131
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:45,561
I told you to eat smelly food
in the kitchen over there!

132
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:49,982
You're driving me crazy.

133
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,276
At least turn on the air purifier!

134
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,700
Purify me.

135
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,661
Fine, throw your fit.

136
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,205
At least I'm used to it.
It's better than silence.

137
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,791
How can you speak
to your older brother that way?

138
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,086
Did you find who Choi last talked to
on his phone?

139
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:11,879
Yes. It was a burner phone.

140
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,632
What's this smell? It smells like feet…

141
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,884
Gosh, you're eating cheonggukjang too.

142
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,055
MOBILE SERVICE APPLICATION

143
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:24,767
Jeez. He's got dozens of phones
under his name.

144
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,560
This is a dead-end.

145
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,687
What about Choi Yeong-seop? Anything new?

146
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,275
The autopsy results didn't show
any traces of unusual chemicals.

147
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,903
And we're having trouble finding
where Gopuri went.

148
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:39,073
He ran through the underground floor
of the old wing

149
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,075
-where there aren't any CCTVs.
-And the police?

150
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,661
They seem to be closing the case
with Choi as the killer.

151
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,667
Are you trying to start a fight with me?

152
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,294
The killer murdered Choi Yeong-seop
right in front of me.

153
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,256
That's why
I'm trying to close the case discreetly!

154
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,049
If this gets out to the press,

155
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,219
do you think you'll be the only one
getting fired? Move it!

156
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,596
-Gosh.
-Sir.

157
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:09,186
Are you really okay with another station
catching a serial killer this big?

158
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,271
Serial…

159
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,898
A serial killer?

160
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,692
We've so far confirmed that he killed

161
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,528
Do Jun-ha, Han Jae-jeong,
Kang Eun-hye, and Choi Yeong-seop.

162
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,572
Four people?

163
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,574
I'm sure he will kill again,

164
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,826
and word will get out
even if I keep quiet.

165
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,288
Are you really okay with that?

166
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:30,499
Gosh, I'm getting goosebumps.

167
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,502
We have to get him
before the other stations!

168
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,339
I'll arrest him no matter what
and have him punished by law.

169
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:45,181
But you have to keep things quiet
and catch him as quickly as possible.

170
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:49,643
If there isn't any progress within a week,
I'll give it to another division. Got it?

171
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,146
Yes, sir.

172
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:02,490
Ms. Kang, who was reported missing
a while back, was the victim.

173
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:05,409
About Kang Eun-hye
who went missing a month ago…

174
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,745
She had a fight
with her father and left home.

175
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:10,581
See? I told you it was nothing.

176
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,959
I should have looked into it further.

177
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,337
It's my fault.

178
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,965
We were the ones
who said she was a runaway.

179
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,634
How is it your fault?

180
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,432
Sir, now isn't the time
for you to get upset.

181
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,685
We have to catch this killer.

182
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,733
It's just that I feel so bad.

183
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,278
I feel terrible for her.

184
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,823
The poor girl…

185
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:51,247
Kang Eun-hye is the key
to solving this case.

186
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,166
-What?
-How does this case differ

187
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,253
from the two previous ones?

188
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,796
What can it be?

189
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,089
I don't know.

190
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,550
-The shoes.
-What about the shoes?

191
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,884
The previous cases were

192
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,720
more of a ritual the killer performed
following his murders.

193
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,056
He choked his victims to death
with the Gopuri knot,

194
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,976
then untied it as he watched
the bodies burn.

195
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,562
It was a ceremony, a ritual of his.

196
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,230
-Right.
-But this time,

197
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,108
because of the shoes

198
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,027
It feels very personal.

199
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:26,699
Before, he threw the fabric on the body
and burned them together,

200
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:30,160
but this time,
he wrapped up the burnt body.

201
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,705
The killer felt remorse
and affection toward the victim.

202
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:37,126
What I'm sure of is that she must have
done something to reach him.

203
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,379
So the killer might be someone
who knew Kang Eun-hye?

204
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:44,049
Kong Su-cheol! You've still got it.

205
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,426
I'm a seasoned detective.

206
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,094
Then that would mean

207
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,763
that high school girl
really is our last hope.

208
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:50,681
Yes.

209
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,351
Gopuri…

210
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:56,145
We need to get him before Grumpy.

211
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,522
Going against the police
might get us in trouble.

212
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,482
You wait and see.

213
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:04,653
I'm going to get Gopuri before Grumpy does
and shove him right in her face.

214
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:08,490
Then I'll mock her
for being incompetent as much as I want.

215
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,242
Just the thought makes me happy.

216
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,499
No, don't look at him. Just ignore him.

217
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,302
Mr. Shaman told me

218
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:31,805
that major crimes was being haunted
and that the ghost was after me.

219
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,391
-Please!
-That's ridiculous!

220
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:37,311
When has Mr. Shaman ever been wrong?

221
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,647
He's right. He's a big help,

222
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,358
especially when we are
at a dead-end like this.

223
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:47,112
Hey! We won't ever
need help from him again!

224
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,073
Lieutenant Han,

225
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:52,242
I'm not taking sides or anything but--

226
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,203
He's a total fraud!

227
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,164
You can't say that.
He gets everything right.

228
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,541
He blinds people with all his words and--

229
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,085
-Hey, dunce!
-Damn it…

230
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,713
It's just like the dunce team
to fight during their team dinner.

231
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,132
We weren't fighting.

232
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,635
Are you having your team dinner today too?

233
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:13,138
You must not have heard about
how we just wiped out the Nogari gang.

234
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,683
I told the chief he really didn't have to,

235
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:18,852
but he just insisted on
treating us to a barbecue.

236
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:22,106
You guys enjoy your humble dishes.

237
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,611
The chief's buying them a barbecue dinner.

238
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:33,242
Jeez, he's never once bought us
dinner since our team first formed.

239
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,537
Hey, for division three, I'm always
happy to pay for a beef dinner…

240
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,706
-Really?
-Damn it.

241
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,041
Hey, wait. Wait a minute.

242
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,836
-Hide me. Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

243
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,881
Thank you for the dinner, Chief!

244
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,550
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

245
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,428
Cheol-geun!

246
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,930
-What?
-Chief!

247
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,185
Hey. It's division seven.

248
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,564
Are you guys having your team dinner?

249
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,567
The guys in division three
just wouldn't stop asking me

250
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,694
to treat them to a barbecue dinner,

251
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,654
so I just bought them a little.

252
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,866
I'll treat you guys to
a grand dinner sometime. Okay?

253
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,826
I'll get going then.

254
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:20,080
Chief, why don't you make it today?
It's the perfect occasion.

255
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,374
What? Today?

256
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,877
Yes, today would be great.

257
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,546
Yes, treat us today, Chief!

258
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:28,797
Hey, what's with you?

259
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,967
He's right. We didn't even eat much today.

260
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:41,643
FROZEN

261
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,479
RECEIPT

262
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,273
4 BOTTLES OF SOJU, 2 BOTTLES OF BEER,
4 PORTIONS OF FROZEN PORK BELLY

263
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,863
Well, all right. Should I?

264
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:55,699
Fine. Dinner's on me!

265
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,993
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

266
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,537
Yes, all right.
Let's go. I'll grab the bill.

267
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,122
-Put them back up.
-Yes!

268
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,124
-Let's go.
-Hey, what's this?

269
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,959
Here's the beef.

270
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,669
Did you guys have beef?

271
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,882
Gosh, there's a whole box.
You're drinking by the box?

272
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:14,384
Sir, we've only just started.

273
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,387
Ma'am, the chief's here, so let's have
another platter of Korean beef!

274
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,598
No, wait. Just order the pork.

275
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,809
Could you change the grill? For the beef--

276
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,977
Why change the grill? No, cancel that.

277
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,687
Sir, have a drink with us.

278
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,273
No, darn it, I don't want to!

279
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:31,443
-Load him in there. Put your head down.
-Go on now.

280
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:32,736
-Go.
-Careful, take care.

281
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,613
Thank you for your help.

282
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,115
-You go too.
-Go where?

283
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,325
Go straight home!

284
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,618
-Go, go on.
-Du-jin!

285
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,577
Thank you, sir.

286
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,371
-Get him home safe.
-Du-jin!

287
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,998
Go home already, you punk.

288
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,042
Gosh.

289
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:57,928
Lieutenant Han, why don't we go there
and just have one more drink each?

290
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,473
TTANGTTANG CHICKEN

291
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:05,686
-This, please!
-This, please!

292
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,940
We're in sync.

293
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,651
Here's your food.

294
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:16,405
Thank you.

295
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:24,955
I was full, but this is
so delicious that I keep eating it.

296
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,208
-Yes.
-Oven-baked chicken is the best.

297
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,503
You've still got a lot to learn,
Lieutenant Han.

298
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:35,257
Fried chicken is the only way to go.

299
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,313
Lieutenant Han. I'm sorry

300
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,523
about last time.

301
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,401
What?

302
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,028
You know…

303
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:00,908
About letting Mr. Shaman see
Choi Yeong-seop.

304
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,828
No, sir. I apologize!

305
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,623
I just assumed he was the killer
during the investigation,

306
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:11,752
and I'm sorry about today and I'll keep
doing something to be sorry about!

307
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:13,420
You don't have to apologize for that.

308
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:17,424
Why would you make
such a passionate apology?

309
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,550
Come on, sit down.

310
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:24,223
Well, to be honest,

311
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,602
I'm an old stuffy geezer now.

312
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,521
I was a little jealous
because they sent someone younger

313
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:35,359
and more competent than me
as the new team leader.

314
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:40,113
And it hurt my pride too.

315
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,991
That's why I was kind of grouchy

316
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,745
and didn't act my age.

317
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:52,209
Let's just call it even.

318
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:55,879
We're even now.

319
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,051
-Sir?
-What?

320
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:05,347
You know what I liked best
about being assigned to Daeun station?

321
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,016
What was it?

322
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,186
That you were here.

323
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:16,233
I became a team leader all of a sudden,

324
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:21,697
but I began to get scared
when I started to think about

325
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,991
why the higher-ups gave me the position.

326
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,951
But I had you here,

327
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,037
so it has been so reassuring.

328
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:35,752
So, I hope to learn even more
with your guidance, sir!

329
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:38,755
All right!

330
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,174
We're in it together!

331
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,011
Yes.

332
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,727
Again, I'm sorry.

333
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,395
There's nothing I can say.

334
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,314
What about Kang Eun-hye's parents?

335
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,857
We're a step behind.

336
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,776
Lieutenant Han and Prosecutor Cha
have already spoken to them.

337
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,236
Damn it…

338
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,033
Go talk to Kang Eun-hye's friend
before Grumpy does. Hurry.

339
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,535
What? What about you?
Aren't you going to go with me?

340
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:12,247
I'm busy. Trying to catch Gopuri is
going to put me out of business.

341
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:17,252
If you let her get ahead of you again,
you'll end up unemployed.

342
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,881
Move! Hurry up and get a move on.

343
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:26,553
Ms. Kang's mother said
you were her best friend.

344
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,889
I'll be waiting at the cafe then.

345
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,223
Call me when you get there.

346
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,641
-Okay.
-Gosh, a thief!

347
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,519
-Thief! My money!
-Oh, that's…

348
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,438
That no-good…

349
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:38,356
My money!

350
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,701
A thief!

351
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,870
-Ma'am, are you okay?
-Oh, no!

352
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,664
I think we need to call an ambulance.

353
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,458
Are you hurt?

354
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:59,920
Not me. For him. He needs an ambulance.

355
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:04,341
Jeez. How dare you steal a bag
from an old lady?

356
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:07,761
You better stop struggling,
or your arm's going to break.

357
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:15,519
Eun-hye was accepted
into a production? When?

358
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,436
Two months ago.

359
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,232
Then was she already a trainee
before she went missing?

360
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,735
Yes. She told me her dad couldn't find out

361
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,612
and that I had to keep it a secret.

362
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,282
Which company did Eun-hye get into?

363
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,242
Joyce Entertainment.

364
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,327
Joyce…

365
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,248
-Where?
-Joyce Entertainment.

366
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,919
She was so happy she made
the team that was going to debut.

367
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,172
She said she'd call me
when she made her debut,

368
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,591
so I was waiting.

369
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,303
But…

370
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,431
I already told someone this exact story.

371
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:54,933
To whom?

372
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,101
A male detective.

373
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,856
Could it be?

374
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,694
Why would you go talk
to the victim's friend?

375
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,613
You don't have the authority!

376
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:12,701
Come on, I need to make sure that
Kang Eun-hye's wrongful death is avenged.

377
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,494
She really didn't deserve it.

378
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,414
You think I'm going to fall for that?

379
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,791
And you might be a cop, but so what?

380
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,210
You can't boss me around.

381
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,629
Focus on your own investigation!

382
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,970
Nam Han-jun. Nam Han-jun!

383
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:36,683
You must have a lot of lives to burn.

384
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:41,897
You fraud. I'm going to destroy you!

385
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,951
MINAMDANG

386
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,288
Damn it.

387
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:02,334
Hey, someone brought
a possessed person to the cafe.

388
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,668
Su-cheol isn't here,

389
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,754
and they're looking for you
while people are watching.

390
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,924
-I'm sorry, it's my fault.
-Sir!

391
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,435
What is the cause of all this commotion?

392
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,064
It's bad. It's really bad.
We're in trouble.

393
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:26,733
It's a ghost.

394
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:27,776
Ghosts don't exist.

395
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:28,944
But she said…

396
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:32,739
Mr. Shaman. Thank goodness, sir.

397
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,866
Please help us.

398
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,079
My brother is behaving strangely. He keeps
saying he can see his dead girlfriend.

399
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:42,082
I think he's being haunted by a ghost.

400
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,627
Hey, I'm scared of ghosts too.

401
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,046
Do something, will you?

402
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,304
I'm sorry,
but exorcism isn't my specialty.

403
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,144
Mr. Shaman.

404
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,480
I'll pay you ten million won.

405
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,651
Just get rid of the ghost, and I'll pay
you another ten million right away.

406
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,819
Please, help us.

407
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:21,246
Na-dan, show them to the VIP room.

408
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,330
What? Wait.

409
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:28,169
What's he going to do
if he really is being haunted?

410
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,757
Ji-yeong, why are you doing this? Don't.

411
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,261
I'm sorry.

412
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,101
So…

413
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:46,771
your brother is being haunted?

414
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:52,277
Yes, I've been to all the famous
Buddhist temples, churches, and shamans.

415
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:57,282
We've been everywhere
and you're our last chance.

416
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,867
It must have been very hard.

417
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,036
Let's take a look.

418
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,579
Take a look at what?

419
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,290
I can't believe you took
on an unreserved client.

420
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,876
We don't have anything on them.
What are you thinking?

421
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,253
What if they find out
that you're a fake shaman?

422
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:11,546
We're fucked.

423
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,924
We're fucked? Why? What?

424
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,969
What do you mean?

425
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:19,721
You don't have…

426
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,973
You don't have the earpiece?

427
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,436
Where did you put it, you moron?

428
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,235
Let's see.

429
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:39,657
I call upon the gods of heaven and earth.

430
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:49,751
I wouldn't be able to tell you anything
even if you had the earpiece, you moron.

431
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,588
It serves you right after all the bragging
you did, Nam Han-jun.

432
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,299
You're on your own.

433
00:27:56,383 --> 00:28:00,220
I don't hear anything.

434
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,347
-There's nothing.
-Hey, Ms. Yoon.

435
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,183
You're still producing
Fraudbusters, right?

436
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,395
I've got a tip-off for you.

437
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,524
I have a great idea.
Do you want to give it a go?

438
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:18,405
Hope you enjoy your abject humiliation,
Nam Han-jun.

439
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,576
I thought you said
you weren't angry with Mr. Nam--

440
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,205
I held back because I was in the wrong,
but I won't ever forget what he did.

441
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:31,334
I'm going to pay him back
for all that humiliation and indignity.

442
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,628
Right.

443
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:36,423
MINAMDANG

444
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:41,261
-…where you should be.
-What the heck?

445
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,054
A live stream?

446
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:46,307
Is this a set-up?

447
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,600
Nam Han-jun, you're fucked--

448
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,061
FRAUDBUSTERS
IS MINAMDANG'S SHAMAN A FRAUD?

449
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,107
We're screwed.

450
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,093
TANNED SKIN

451
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,511
SCRAPE FROM A BOARD
THREE TO FOUR DAYS AGO

452
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,972
SIGNS OF CONTINUOUS SURFING

453
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,350
WRINKLED
REEKS OF CIGARETTES

454
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,227
BAGS UNDER HER EYES

455
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:33,813
DISCOLORED FROM NICOTINE

456
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:37,650
99.99% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING A SET-UP

457
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,116
ILLEGAL GAMBLING

458
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,369
GAMBLING ADDICT

459
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:09,557
It must have been so tough for you.

460
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,434
Yes, Mr. Shaman.

461
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:15,230
What should we do? Should we do
an exorcism or something?

462
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,774
No, you don't even need a talisman.

463
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,485
He was never haunted

464
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,737
in the first place.

465
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:33,873
Oh, what are you talking about?

466
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:38,253
I mean, he keeps talking nonsense
about how he can see his dead girlfriend.

467
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,088
Yes. It is nonsense.

468
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:44,217
There's no way he'd go surfing

469
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,095
when his girlfriend is dead.

470
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,389
My late girlfriend liked to surf.

471
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:50,640
How dare you!

472
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,310
How dare you keep up that shoddy act
in the presence of a god?

473
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,232
If you keep pretending to be haunted,

474
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,025
a real ghost will come for you.

475
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,237
I'm sorry. I was just doing
what I was told!

476
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,197
Please, forgive me.

477
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,576
You, on the other hand…

478
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,538
You're going to ruin your life
if you keep doing that.

479
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:16,666
-What?
-You're addicted to gambling.

480
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:19,252
Do you want to lose your job
and get divorced?

481
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,461
How did you…

482
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,718
What's gotten into him?

483
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,096
Maybe he really is a shaman.

484
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,558
Should I ask him to read my love fortune?

485
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,395
You're right, Mr. Shaman.

486
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:40,315
I want to stop too, but I can't seem to.

487
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,776
When I'm back to my senses,
I find myself in a gambling house.

488
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,655
What should I do, sir?

489
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,074
Well, there are ways,

490
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,911
but let's turn that camera off
for a start.

491
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,997
My image rights are very expensive.

492
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,457
Do you think you can afford it?

493
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,125
The camera?

494
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,754
LIVE BROADCAST HAS ENDED

495
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:03,671
What?

496
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,008
How did he know?

497
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,385
Well…

498
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,263
Maybe Mr. Nam really is a shaman.

499
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:14,724
That can't be it…

500
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,810
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

501
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:25,401
Thank you, Mr. Shaman. I will never
forget what you've done for me.

502
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,446
All right.
If something troubles you, drop in again.

503
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,739
Yes, sir.

504
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,408
Damn it. What's going on?

505
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,369
Ms. Yoon.

506
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,546
I knew it.

507
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:50,468
Detective Han. Sidekick.

508
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,387
You two were behind this, weren't you?

509
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:57,517
Are you referring to me
when you say "Sidekick"?

510
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,186
Who else would I be talking about?

511
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,938
Well, we're…

512
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:03,940
Well…

513
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:08,152
We heard the coffee here was good
and came to grab a cup.

514
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,612
Right!

515
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:13,908
I don't like the owner here

516
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,954
-but their desserts are wonderful.
-It's good. It really is.

517
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,164
Are you really going to lie
in front of a shaman?

518
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,208
Are you sure

519
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:26,295
you're not here to talk
to the capable Ms. Yoon

520
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,131
standing here?

521
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,298
Ms. Yoon.

522
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,719
I'm sorry, detective.

523
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,262
Bye.

524
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,351
Are you still going to deny it?

525
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,770
Fine. I sent her!

526
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,940
You kept interfering with my investigation
pretending to be a shaman,

527
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,526
-so I got angry--
-I was hoping it wouldn't be true.

528
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:53,406
My dear son really is a shaman.

529
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:03,249
Mom?

530
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,712
It wasn't Su-cheol.

531
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,714
It was you, Han-jun…

532
00:34:10,757 --> 00:34:12,008
-My Lord.
-Mom!

533
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,387
Are you all right?

534
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,723
My Lord. My Dear Lord.

535
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,809
Mom.

536
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,607
What I'm most angry about is

537
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,776
not that you're a shaman,

538
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:33,279
but that my children all lied to me!

539
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,866
Ma'am. That's not it.

540
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,160
We didn't mean to lie to you.

541
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,912
Han-jun is--

542
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,916
So what happened is, Han-jun is trying--

543
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:46,918
Mom.

544
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:52,715
I'm sorry, but I have my principles.

545
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:56,052
It's slightly different
from what you want, but…

546
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:00,223
My Lord can't do this to me.

547
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,976
-My Lord.
-Hallelujah.

548
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,603
Mom.

549
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:13,569
Han-jun. My legs are cramping up.

550
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:14,654
Han-jun.

551
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,490
-Come on.
-What is it?

552
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,785
Let's just tell her the truth.

553
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,787
No.

554
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,540
If she finds out I'm doing this
to catch Gopuri,

555
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:27,917
she'll end up joining a prayer retreat.

556
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:32,463
So, did you talk to Kang Eun-hye's friend?

557
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:37,260
Yes. She said Eun-hye was a trainee
at Joyce Entertainment.

558
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:38,678
-Joyce Entertainment?
-Yes.

559
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,060
FEELM_
PASSWORD

560
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,692
We're back.

561
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,152
We're back.

562
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:55,653
Give me the water.

563
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:03,161
Ma'am. I don't think we can
find the killer through her shoes.

564
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,371
The design has so many copies

565
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:08,958
that it's impossible to find
the manufacturer or where she bought it.

566
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:14,088
Do the two of you know
anything about Joyce Entertainment?

567
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,298
Joyce Entertainment?

568
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:17,341
Kang Eun-hye was a trainee there.

569
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,178
Every idol group
they produce ends up fizzling out…

570
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,972
I SAW EVERYTHING THAT DAY…

571
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,266
What's this person sorry about?

572
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,893
It came in just now.

573
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,061
I SAW EVERYTHING THAT DAY

574
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,231
BUT I WAS SCARED
AND PRETENDED I HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING

575
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,482
I'M SORRY, EUN-HYE

576
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,817
What was she scared of

577
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,737
and what did she pretend not to see?

578
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,742
The sender's account is private,

579
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:46,329
but the background of her profile photo
is the same as Kang's photo.

580
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,414
Joyce Entertainment studio?

581
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:52,835
Yes. The one who sent the DM
must be a trainee there too.

582
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:57,548
I should go see her.

583
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:01,219
But with Joyce Entertainment,
I don't think that'll be easy.

584
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:04,055
Park Jin-sang is the one
who owns the place.

585
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,976
The third son of Park Dong-gi,
the chairman of Choekang Insurance.

586
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,647
You mean that "Pain in the Ass"?

587
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,564
JOYCE ENTERTAINMENT DIRECTOR
PARK JIN-SANG

588
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,824
I feel disgusting

589
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,161
when you touch me.

590
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:28,996
I'm sorry, sir.

591
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,460
Get rid of this.

592
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,054
JOYCE ENTERTAINMENT
GU TAE-SU

593
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,306
He's been pretty quiet lately,

594
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,225
but he has an impressive criminal record

595
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:54,772
including DUIs, drunken assaults,
substance abuse, and philandering.

596
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,233
Also known as "Pain in the Ass."

597
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,359
PAIN IN THE ASS

598
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,987
He's a typical idiot conglomerate heir.

599
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,489
People even gave him a nickname.

600
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,907
A nickname?

601
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,338
They call him "Party Like Geenie"

602
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,173
because he parties like crazy.

603
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,217
SOBRIETY TESTS UNDERWAY

604
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,764
Excuse me, we're doing sobriety tests.

605
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,016
Breathe into the machine.

606
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:35,146
It's 0.125. We're revoking your license.
Please, step outside.

607
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:38,274
Revoke my license?
What the hell are you talking about?

608
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,651
Do you know who I am?

609
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,653
I said, do you know who I am?

610
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,447
Officer Kim, Officer Lee, arrest him.

611
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,325
Arrest me? Do you know who I am?

612
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:48,951
Do you know who I am?

613
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,202
Do you know who I am?

614
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:53,581
Do you know who I am?

615
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,916
Do you know who I am?

616
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,418
Do you know who I am? Damn it.

617
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,419
Take him downtown.

618
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,422
Do you think I'm going down? Do you?

619
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,631
MC GEENIE

620
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:06,469
They also call him MC Geenie since
he kept repeating "Do you know who I am?"

621
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,013
He does have his human rights,
so I'll stop here.

622
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,015
They say like attracts like.

623
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:14,226
With Shin Gyeong-ho of S&H Group
and Cha Seung-won of Choekang Group,

624
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,770
they were called Three Mad Dogs.

625
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,774
And he's a director
of an entertainment company?

626
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:23,694
He's out of his father's good graces,
and he can't just party all day.

627
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,946
But what's really strange is…

628
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,700
Joyce Entertainment.

629
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:35,581
Most of their contracts have expired,
and they don't make any money.

630
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,376
They're losing money every quarter.
Their stocks are worthless.

631
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,252
They should have gone bankrupt already,

632
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,297
but amazingly enough,
they received a lot of investments.

633
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,092
They've just got that one girl group
in the works though.

634
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,469
Yes. One thing's for sure.

635
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:52,264
Kang Eun-hye was in deeper
with Joyce Entertainment than we thought.

636
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,727
I hacked into her messenger account,

637
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:00,356
and the last person she messaged was
the director of Joyce Entertainment.

638
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,484
That's quite a message.

639
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,777
He sounds like a pimp.

640
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,114
If it's true, we should beat him to death
whether he's Gopuri or not.

641
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,784
Find out first where
Park Jin-sang is right now.

642
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,705
PARK JIN-SANG PROFILE

643
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,818
Excuse me.

644
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:47,820
Help.

645
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:49,905
Help.

646
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:05,880
What took you so long?

647
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:09,008
I almost died.

648
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,968
What are you doing here?

649
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:13,053
You know her, right?

650
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:18,392
A trainee at your company
was found dead in the sewers.

651
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,316
Damn it.

652
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:29,904
We have so many trainees.
How am I supposed to know who that is?

653
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:31,697
Really?

654
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:34,366
Then give me all the information
you have on her.

655
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,784
Why should I?

656
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,579
So what if you're a prosecutor?

657
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,706
Bring a warrant, you punk.

658
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,544
How's uncle?

659
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,255
Is he well?

660
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:55,179
What about Dad?

661
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,141
You made him go through all that
at the Prosecutor's Office.

662
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,684
-It still makes me--
-That's why.

663
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:04,271
I did that to Uncle.
What do you think I'd do to you?

664
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,399
What do you think?

665
00:42:09,235 --> 00:42:11,737
Send me the data
if you don't want to become a suspect.

666
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,241
Or maybe I should ransack
Joyce Entertainment first.

667
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,328
I'll send it over.

668
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,664
I will.

669
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:23,290
I will, you scumbag.

670
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,429
I need to speak to you
in person right now.

671
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,724
Right, there he comes.

672
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,893
I wonder where he's going in such a hurry.

673
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:45,354
He does look like he's in a hurry.

674
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,944
-Keep your distance.
-Okay.

675
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,320
Tail him.

676
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,530
Got it.

677
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,740
Stop it!

678
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,909
I think there's something behind me!

679
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:54,381
We're going to quietly sneak in
and find out what's happening in there…

680
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,301
Why aren't you coming?

681
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,432
You first.

682
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:05,184
Han-jun.

683
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,811
-Elders first. You go first.
-No, please.

684
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,549
Isn't that Kang Eun-hye's picture?

685
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,846
Death came for me.

686
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,431
What are they doing?

687
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,475
And I couldn't escape it.

688
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:50,437
What shall I do with this body?

689
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,276
Gopuri…

690
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:01,824
Do you think he really is Gopuri?

691
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,575
Do you see a burn scar on his wrist?

692
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:04,535
Wait.

693
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,204
It's dark so I can't see.

694
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,794
Oh, gosh.

695
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:24,680
You…

696
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,265
Steamed rice cake.

697
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,517
Beef.

698
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,602
Apples and jujubes.

699
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,563
Bananas.

700
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,274
Bananas.

701
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:38,610
I want to have bananas. I want bananas.

702
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:42,197
Damn it, why does that idiot want bananas
at a time like this?

703
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:44,783
You! You're sullying the ceremony!

704
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:53,584
You fool! What good is a ritual
if you cannot recognize the god you host?

705
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:54,877
What's that crazy bastard doing?

706
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:58,714
General?

707
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:04,511
But what are you doing in that body?

708
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,518
General? What are you talking about?

709
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:17,232
I think the general
picked the wrong person to possess.

710
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,026
Serve better food next time!

711
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:21,195
I hate to come
when there's nothing good to eat!

712
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:24,865
-I'm sorry, General.
-I'm sorry!

713
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,116
I'll be off then.

714
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,493
-What?
-He's going?

715
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,495
-I'll be back.
-But you only got here…

716
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:31,413
You can't leave.

717
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,457
-Wait, General!
-General…

718
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,875
-Gosh.
-Do something.

719
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:36,168
He's off his rockers.

720
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:38,086
General!

721
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:40,756
General!

722
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:48,055
The bananas were the only thing
I could use to hide my face.

723
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:51,558
Yes, that was some fast thinking.
Nice job, Kong Su-cheol.

724
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,643
Thanks.

725
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:59,650
I need to check for myself
if Park Jin-sang is Gopuri.

726
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,235
What? How?

727
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:03,612
Through my VIP client.

728
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:12,079
Yes, it's me.
There's something I need to ask you.

729
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:22,381
Just a phone call would've sufficed.
What's with this fuss?

730
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:25,676
But this is the only way
I get to see your face these days.

731
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,261
But what is it?

732
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:31,473
Are you accepting my proposal?

733
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:33,809
No, not that.

734
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:37,020
-You know Park Jin-sang, right?
-I do.

735
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:39,314
Why? Do you want me
to introduce you to him?

736
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:44,111
He said he won't cooperate
without a warrant.

737
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,116
Damn it.

738
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:52,703
Hey, Detective Na.

739
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,372
Hand over the case?

740
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,624
Be methodical, okay?

741
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,167
Make sure you search every corner.

742
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:02,629
-Ma'am, what do we do now?
-Hey, that's a different case.

743
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,631
-Is that Ms. Han?
-This isn't right.

744
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,174
-No.
-Give me that.

745
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,385
Come on. This isn't it.

746
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:12,931
Yes, the Choi Yeong-seop case
will go to division three.

747
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,976
You'll join the Illegal Election
Activities Regulation Division.

748
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:18,979
Sir! It hasn't been a week yet.

749
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:20,772
Give that to me.

750
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:25,152
Chief. I mean, Cheol-geun.
Why are you doing this again?

751
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,739
Who pressured you this time?

752
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,908
-Why would you do this to us--
-Hello?

753
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:36,455
The reception at the station
is really bad…

754
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:39,124
Jeez.

755
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,304
Lieutenant Han.

756
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:55,223
Let's go rogue big time.

757
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:58,560
What can he do to us
if we catch the killer first?

758
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,479
He's the chief, so what?

759
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,148
You're right.

760
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:05,567
Undercover operations

761
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,070
are the heart of investigations.

762
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:16,328
Let's take on the challenge.

763
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,336
TAKE ON THE CHALLENGE
AND BECOME A STAR WITH JOYCE ENTERTAINMENT

764
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,763
Here. Take this.

765
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,640
What is this?

766
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,517
It's a gift from the boss.

767
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,645
When we flex, we go at it together.

768
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,647
Thank you, sir.

769
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,774
Sure.

770
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,403
Shall we get going too?

771
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:00,414
That's our Na-dan.
He really stands out in the crowd.

772
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,250
You better be careful.

773
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,670
Wait for me.

774
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:13,051
I have the CCTV and gained access
to Joyce Entertainment's server.

775
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,428
I'm ready!

776
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:19,224
Jeez.

777
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:20,726
Can I get a picture with you?

778
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,018
Of course.

779
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,854
Na-dan. I told you to blend in.

780
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:27,107
I can't control it. I just shine.

781
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,235
This way.

782
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:34,656
Do you think you can go
and put the bug in the office?

783
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:40,912
Good job.

784
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:45,000
Okay.

785
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,712
Mr. Kim Sang-hyeop and Mr. Na Gwang-tae?

786
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,842
You two are quite… Can I see your IDs?

787
00:50:58,722 --> 00:50:59,723
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

788
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,228
Police?

789
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:11,735
My resident registration card.

790
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:14,821
Why?

791
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,490
I can rap, sing, dance…

792
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,413
The plan's been ruined.

793
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:26,666
What is it?

794
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:27,959
What should we do?

795
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,587
I knew they'd mess it up.

796
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:33,882
Let's get ready.

797
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,592
What?

798
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,054
I knew you'd have a way.

799
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,181
Right.

800
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,433
Me too?

801
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:46,561
I'm not doing it alone.

802
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:03,161
-Jenny, Jinny!
-Jenny, Jinny!

803
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:08,291
-Jenny, Jinny!
-Jenny, Jinny!

804
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:21,263
Mr. Shaman.

805
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,685
Nice to meet you.
I'm Gang Hae-seong, the CEO.

806
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,855
I've heard a lot about you from Ms. Lee.

807
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,692
Pick out our future K-Wave stars.

808
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,945
You must be the big shot here.

809
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,197
Yes, right.

810
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,241
Nice to meet you.

811
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,003
You're hurt.

812
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:56,423
I sprained it while playing golf.

813
00:52:58,466 --> 00:52:59,718
You should've been careful.

814
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:03,638
You have three misfortunes this year.

815
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:04,973
Well, one's gone by,

816
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,518
and seeing as how you even did a ritual
to prevent misfortune…

817
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,937
How did you know that?

818
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,898
A misfortune that worsens with time…

819
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,692
One will go to your family,

820
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,152
and in the end,

821
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,864
it will reach you.

822
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,659
Is there a way to stop it?

823
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,119
There is.

824
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,831
You need to trust me completely.

825
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:42,177
What is it?

826
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:52,979
I found someone suspicious,
so I brought them here.

827
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,648
They're police detectives.

828
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:58,526
She wouldn't come to practice
and didn't answer my calls,

829
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,153
so I thought she quit.

830
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:03,698
Is Eun-hye really dead?

831
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:08,787
Did you see anyone suspicious around her?

832
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,498
Someone she was afraid to meet,

833
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:14,334
or someone that scared her
whenever they called.

834
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,628
Something like that.

835
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:22,592
I'm not sure.

836
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:23,718
Then, by any chance…

837
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:25,679
do you know this person?

838
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,264
-They seem to be a trainee here.
-This is…

839
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,183
Detective?

840
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,688
-Who's that?
-He's the youngest at Minamdang.

841
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,356
Damn that shaman and his idiots.

842
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:39,067
It is you! What are you
doing here, detective?

843
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,444
Did he just call you a detective?

844
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:50,203
Bring them in.

845
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:57,711
Unbelievable.

846
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,671
Come on, let go of me.

847
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:03,967
Mr. Shaman!

848
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:08,847
Do you know them? Who are you people?

849
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,058
You fool!

850
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,477
You cast doubt on those
who would save you?

851
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:17,689
You'll never stop
the misfortune like this.

852
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,399
Well, I was just…

853
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,611
-You.
-Yes?

854
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:29,409
I remember getting rid of a ghost
that was haunting you.

855
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:32,037
-How are your shoulders?
-They're great.

856
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,039
I feel light as a feather.

857
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,917
And you were an aspiring actress.

858
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:41,421
I told you to give up the role
since being a detective doesn't suit you.

859
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:45,717
You mean that crime drama audition?

860
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:51,681
Detective Lee Jae-han.
This is Lieutenant Park Hae-yeong.

861
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,475
This is Detective Lee Jae-han, right?

862
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,981
We can change the past.

863
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:04,903
That's from Signal!

864
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:05,862
Bingo!

865
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:12,243
You run an entertainment company,
but you don't know that show?

866
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,163
I'm pretty busy…

867
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:18,333
But today's audition isn't for actors.

868
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:19,334
Today…

869
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:24,047
we're here to audition to become an idol.

870
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,303
You don't mind if they go first, do you?

871
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:33,181
I guess it's okay.

872
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:36,601
I'm dying to see how good you are.

873
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,067
JUDGE

874
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,562
What does your father do?

875
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:23,648
I don't have one.
I live with my grandmother.

876
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:27,235
Then, should we talk to her
about your contract?

877
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:30,405
-I don't want to join your company.
-What?

878
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:32,115
Then why did you audition?

879
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:33,825
Here!

880
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:40,290
A Jo Na-dan invention!
Shoe inserts for dancers!

881
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:45,545
They can be yours for just 10,000 won!

882
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:47,839
You're here to sell those?

883
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:52,635
Yes. I already sold 20 of them
to the people who came to audition.

884
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:53,845
You did?

885
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,682
You can't handle him.

886
00:57:57,765 --> 00:57:58,975
Jo Na-dan, out!

887
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:01,060
Okay, out!

888
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,187
Out!

889
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:05,940
Okay then, shall we move on
to the next applicant?

890
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:09,235
Your team's called "Jenny and Jinny"?

891
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,612
Yes.

892
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:13,198
Ms. Han Jenny?

893
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:25,543
Hello!

894
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:27,837
My name is Han Jenny.

895
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,506
Gosh.

896
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,926
I'm Du Jinny.

897
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:37,722
Music, please.

898
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,564
I'm out of prison now.

899
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,108
Give me a call.

900
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:20,014
Lieutenant Nam.

901
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,059
He's the cop from three years ago.

902
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,895
What should we do?

903
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:43,955
It's me. Be careful.

904
00:59:44,038 --> 00:59:47,125
We are looking for idols,
so they're out, right?

905
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:50,628
You're in!

906
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:52,338
-What?
-We're in!

907
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,965
Okay, we're in!

908
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:56,050
Sir.

909
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,185
GET RID OF HIM IMMEDIATELY

910
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:58,029
EPILOGUE

911
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:05,119
They're so pretty.

912
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:06,537
Try them on.

913
01:01:15,254 --> 01:01:17,965
Thank you. Thank you so much.

914
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:04,679
I'll find that friend for you.
In return, help me.

915
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:06,723
How are we going
to work together like this?

916
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,809
Well, something weird happened.

917
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:11,519
The culprit must have hidden it there.

918
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:12,770
I found where the buyer is.

919
01:02:12,854 --> 01:02:13,813
I'm just as offended.

920
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,940
Let's just keep going
our separate ways.

921
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,569
Expedition gambling and high school girls…

922
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:21,821
They call it a streaming service,
but it's pretty much a porn studio.

923
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,698
Why are you so fixated on this case?

924
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:26,909
I'm an officer of the law.
There's no way I'm losing to you!

925
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:29,078
Did someone with a burn scar
on his arm put you up to this?

926
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:34,917
