1
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,886
I'm busy. Let's get it done
within half an hour.

2
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:38,473
Yes, sir. We prepared it so that
you can get started as soon as you arrive.

3
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:13,091
He's arrived.

4
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,717
Let's begin the interview.

5
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,305
You were trained as a hotelier.

6
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,307
MK HOTEL CEO LEE MIN-GYEONG

7
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,562
Yes. I joined MK Noble Hotel
through open recruitment

8
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:28,815
and worked for 20 years
in sales and management teams.

9
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:32,652
It's about time we hire a general manager
who worked his way up from the bottom.

10
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:36,447
Thanks to you, I gained a lot
of experience at international hotels.

11
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:40,952
I've significantly improved the service
at our hotel through that experience,

12
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:44,330
and we were able to rank first
in the service quality index.

13
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:46,457
But I'm not satisfied just yet.

14
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,419
The forehead is bright,
and the smile lines are clear.

15
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,713
He has the energy to move up.

16
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,428
And his cheekbones are red.

17
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:03,308
Tell him to solve the problems
from ten years ago and come back.

18
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,935
He blamed a staff member for his mistake
and dismissed them wrongfully.

19
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,525
Did you blame a staff member for
your mistake

20
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,361
and dismiss them wrongfully ten years ago?

21
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,239
That's…

22
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,200
-Someone had to take the blame--
-Next.

23
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:29,042
My hotel management philosophy is
"Hotel is a trip in itself."

24
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,376
It's not just a place…

25
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,047
She is a considerate team leader
and is very competent.

26
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:39,010
But the root of her ear is sharp,
and the helix is bent.

27
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,430
She can't control her impulse.
Ask her to turn over her pocket.

28
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,640
Her pocket?

29
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:47,185
Can you show us what's in your pocket?

30
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,231
MK NOBLE HOTEL JEJU BRANCH
MANAGER INTERVIEW

31
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,035
CHOI JU-HEE, KO JU-WON

32
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,707
I'm receiving treatment
and I don't steal expensive items.

33
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:10,917
Next.

34
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,212
It's your first time managing a hotel.

35
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:17,173
Is there a special reason
why you applied for this hotel?

36
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:20,843
Yes. I've always been
taking up new challenges.

37
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,929
I do not know fear.

38
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,722
His eyebrows are full and ungroomed.

39
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,976
He blinks a lot and takes side glances.

40
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,270
-…and that is my goal.
-He's a con artist.

41
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,522
He's going to ruin the hotel.

42
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,109
I plan to replace
the entire staff with robots.

43
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,568
Next.

44
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:44,659
I've majored in business management

45
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:49,205
and I applied to this hotel because…

46
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,790
He doesn't look like an academic.

47
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,250
…in Paris.

48
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,377
A Ph.D. degree in France…

49
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,378
It was because…

50
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:59,090
You speak French, don't you?
Ask him what his father's name is.

51
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,675
What is your father's name?

52
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,469
Kwon Tae-gon.

53
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,263
"Kwon Tae-gon"?

54
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,058
MATCHES 100 PERCENT

55
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,728
They clearly look like father and son.

56
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,439
Gosh, I don't know. I'm screwed.

57
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,900
We don't have one decent candidate.

58
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:36,252
Singapore is nice, but I love Korea.

59
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,466
I want the foreigners
who are visiting Korea

60
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:44,635
to experience the same great impressions

61
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,389
I had while I was in Korea.

62
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,851
What is this strange energy?

63
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,653
I need to go and check.

64
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,951
My goodness.

65
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,080
We are in the middle of an interview.
What are you doing?

66
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:15,500
I've put in quite an effort to invite him.
Show some respect.

67
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,712
What's going on?

68
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,188
I see it.

69
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:41,609
This place is filled
with the voice of a vengeful spirit.

70
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,575
How resentful it is.

71
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,579
The cry of the dead is sad.

72
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,124
It's sad.

73
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,376
It's sad.

74
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,128
It's sad.

75
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,088
It's sad.

76
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:28,072
It's not him.

77
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,119
-It's you.
-What?

78
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,829
KO JU-WON

79
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,124
Hiring a branch manager
isn't your problem.

80
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,919
-Sack him and fill his position first.
-What?

81
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,506
What is this shaman saying? How dare you?

82
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,884
She died because of you. You killed her.

83
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,972
You said you'd give her a permanent
position and sexually harassed her.

84
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,932
You even went all the way to her place.

85
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:57,477
And what? She's like your daughter?

86
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,145
Your daughter?

87
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,647
Then why did you ask her
to call you "honey," you sicko?

88
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,983
When she didn't listen,
you made her an outcast,

89
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:07,445
and you dismissed her
without a word! You piece of trash.

90
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:11,449
The vengeful spirit of a secretary who
recently committed suicide is with him.

91
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,201
Sack him right away.

92
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,119
Post an apology before the press finds out

93
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,662
and the hotel's image plummets.

94
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,332
Take him away.

95
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:24,253
Let go! Let go of me!
I'm Ko Ju-won! Let go!

96
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,840
You believe what that shaman says? Hey!

97
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,134
Hey! You jerk!

98
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,225
Who are you?

99
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,352
I'm…

100
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,147

101
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,862

106
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,685

PARENTING ISSUES

109
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,360

ONLY THE BEST FOR MR. SHAMAN

120
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,455
-When will he get here?
-Where is he?

121
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,082
MINAMDANG

122
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,918
EPISODE 1

123
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,086
Gosh, I feel clean.

124
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:30,921
I feel so good.

125
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,701
Pants.

126
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:04,955
Do you have any idea how much
work I had to put in to have you?

127
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,083
I went to Italy and got my size measured

128
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:12,380
and for the year this suit was being made,
I didn't allow myself to gain 1kg.

129
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,298
That's how hard I've worked for this.

130
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,428
I love it.

131
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,692
I'm so hot.

132
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,445
Wake up. Get ready to open the shop.

133
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,616
Wake up!

134
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,579
Hey, wake up!

135
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,373
I can't believe her.

136
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:53,170
How can the smell pass through the door?

137
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,675
I said wake up!

138
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:02,096
If you don't wake up in ten minutes,
I will tell Su-cheol to rip the door open.

139
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,807
NAM HYE-JUN
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

140
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,270
Gosh, I love the smell of coffee.

141
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,440
Na-dan, make me a cup of coffee.
And let's open the shop.

142
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,649
Yes, sir.

143
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:28,539
Here's your coffee, sir.

144
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,303
LOOK AT ME, MR. SHAMAN!

145
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,387
HAN-JUN, I LOVE YOU

146
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,681
YOU'RE WHAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED

147
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:48,601
My gosh!

148
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,064
I'm so tired of being so popular.

149
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,949
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

150
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:06,911
Come in.

151
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,292
Na-dan.

152
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,294
-How have you been?
-How are you?

153
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,670
Please take it.

154
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,839
-No, it's okay.
-Please, it's for you.

155
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,559
Will you move?

156
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,994
You made a reservation, right?

157
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,620
Come this way.

158
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,378
Excuse me. You wait here. Okay?

159
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,509
What would you like to drink? HA? IA?

160
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,429
-HA?
-Hot Americano or iced Americano.

161
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,307
Do you have something that's not coffee?

162
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,767
Hot Americano.

163
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,688
You managed to come on time.

164
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,772
Yes.

165
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,693
Come this way.

166
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,207
Right through that door.

167
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,836
-Alone?
-Yes.

168
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,672
Didn't you see how busy it is?
I need to go make coffee.

169
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,800
You will be fine.

170
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,261
Don't you worry. It will be over soon.

171
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:32,014
-I will leave then. Go in.
-Thank you.

172
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,737
How dare you!

173
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,492
How dare you bring negative energy here?

174
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:06,131
You cheated on your wife
with another girl,

175
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,299
and she betrayed you.

176
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:10,886
How do you know that?

177
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,473
She ran off with your money.

178
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:18,936
So you should just blame yourself and
think you got punished for what you did.

179
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,355
How dare you crawl in here?

180
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,065
How…

181
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,234
How did you…

182
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,320
How did you know that?

183
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,996
Kwon Gi-jun, 48 years old.

184
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,122
A trading company owner

185
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,916
He has no criminal record,
but he's going through a divorce.

186
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,003
His wife sued him for alimony.

187
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,338
Here are his data
and the picture of his mistress.

188
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,511
Gosh, you're disgusting.

189
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,851
Her clothes are neat at work
but very flashy when she goes out.

190
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,895
Mr. Kwon is into modest and classy women.

191
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,399
Who did she dress so flashily for?

192
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,155
She was secretive
on the days she met up with Mr. Kwon.

193
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:14,992
Who did she contact
when she dressed flashily?

194
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,121
I found the accomplice.

195
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,124
Check the number 0706
from her call history.

196
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,168
Look for their plate number or address.

197
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,252
You took 20 seconds.

198
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,296
Your skills have gone rusty.

199
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,758
Level up your game
to work with a genius hacker like me.

200
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,719
You interrupted me. Ten seconds
would've been plenty otherwise.

201
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,431
There's no address,
but I found the license plate.

202
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:40,350
My goodness.
It took me less than ten seconds.

203
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,228
Stop testing my patience, will you?

204
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,521
Su-cheol.

205
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,609
It's "13 J 0242."
Can you look for this car?

206
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:53,113
What? But I'm chasing a pervert.

207
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,657
Hey! Stop!

208
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,577
Hey, this is more urgent.
He might flee abroad soon.

209
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,622
This is urgent too!

210
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,833
Jeez, that lunatic.

211
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,132
Come here!

212
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,303
I staked out for three days to find him.

213
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,806
I have to put him in jail
to be able to sleep.

214
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,976
I won't hit you if you
drive straight to the police station.

215
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,186
Jeez, whatever! Damn it!

216
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,445
Darn it.

217
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,208
There's still one more punch.

218
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,716
You could have spared yourself.
Why ask for it?

219
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,052
Am I a coupon? I offer no benefits.

220
00:18:57,136 --> 00:19:01,515
Su-cheol, do I have to
pay for his medical bill again?

221
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:06,228
No. I'm on my way
to look for the car. Yes.

222
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,650
13 J 0242

223
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,242
I found her.

224
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,995
But it looks like they are ready
to run away any minute.

225
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:25,164
I need to make him come in earlier then.

226
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,303
Please help me, Mr. Shaman.

227
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,181
Without that money,
my company will go bankrupt.

228
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,976
You shameless man. You ignored your wife
when she begged you.

229
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,521
Now you're on your knees because
you're about to go out of business.

230
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,981
Please, sir.

231
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,484
Where can I go to find that money?

232
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,570
If I side with you,
the heavens will get mad.

233
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,863
Get lost.

234
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,575
Please save me.

235
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,287
I will live the rest of my life
making up for my mistakes.

236
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,580
Please.

237
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:11,960
You need a talisman.

238
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,296
What?

239
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,673
Right.

240
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,678
How much would that cost me?

241
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:25,349
-Don't you dare jinx it!
-My goodness.

242
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,267
Don't you want your money back?

243
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:31,313
Sir, I forgot who you are
for a brief moment.

244
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,606
I should get one.

245
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,776
I'll get one right away.

246
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,538
All right.

247
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,342
-Repeat after me.
-Okay.

248
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,577
The car is still parked.

249
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,122
But they have a flight booked,
so you must hurry.

250
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:37,004
I don't feel like helping you,
but your wife's prayer saved you.

251
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,380
What?

252
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,590
Right.

253
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:49,141
If you do something stupid again,
you will die in a ditch.

254
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:53,895
Stay loyal to your dear wife
for the rest of your life. All right?

255
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:59,109
Of course. I will loyally serve my wife
for the rest of my life.

256
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,155
Go to the basement.

257
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:05,324
And guard the north exit.

258
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,742
"The north exit"?

259
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,078
What are you doing? Run!

260
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,914
Yes, sir! "The north exit…"

261
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:16,960
Yes, sir.

262
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:19,212
"The north exit…"

263
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:25,969
Gosh, my eyes hurt.

264
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,388
Gosh.

265
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,349
I'm exhausted.

266
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:43,737
Come on, sir.
I told you I would catch her.

267
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:47,908
I got a list of possible routes
the suspect can take. Trust me.

268
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,242
Trust me.

269
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,580
Shaman Nam Han-jun
picked this particular place.

270
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:57,584
What? You made us come here
based on what a shaman said?

271
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,669
Did you just say Shaman Nam Han-jun?

272
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,671
"The wonder of Yonghae-dong"?

273
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,383
-Yes, from Minamdang.
-I see.

274
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,052
What? You know him too?

275
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:11,139
I do. He's the rising star of Daeun-gu.
A rebel of the shaman world.

276
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:13,558
He's very good with criminal cases too.

277
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,060
If you do as he tells you,

278
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,854
you can catch the suspect… What is it?

279
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,903
See that? We got them.

280
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,613
-It's true.
-Really?

281
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,658
This is crazy. I got goosebumps.

282
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:32,244
What's wrong? Do you know them?

283
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,161
What?

284
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,038
No.

285
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:40,544
Did you have to take everything I had?

286
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:45,799
Goodness. He's such a great shaman.

287
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:50,178
DAEUN POLICE STATION

288
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,974
Gosh, that's hot.

289
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:58,687
He's so good.
I got goosebumps. He's so good.

290
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:02,566
Right? Isn't he good? He's unbelievable.

291
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:05,861
Anyway, the new recruit
should be here any minute.

292
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:08,113
We are getting a new recruit.

293
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:11,366
I hope we get someone good this time.

294
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,493
Hey, we don't need any of that.

295
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,539
As long as he doesn't
cause trouble, it will be all good.

296
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:18,999
DAILY HOROSCOPE

297
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:23,545
"You will struggle unexpectedly."

298
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,631
"Watch out for the east
and the color black."

299
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,718
"Watch out for the east
and the color black."

300
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,012
A struggle?

301
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,356
This is just superstition.

302
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,108
Gosh, could this mean

303
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,528
that the new recruit
is going to cause trouble?

304
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,865
Which way is the east?

305
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,450
West is that way, so…

306
00:24:59,122 --> 00:24:59,956
EAST

307
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,337
BLACK

308
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,341
Isn't she wearing black?

309
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:16,264
-Hello. I was appointed to join--
-Darn it.

310
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,432
Gosh.

311
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,809
Come on.

312
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,729
I get that we're
the seventh and last division,

313
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,856
but we asked for someone
who can do manual labor.

314
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,984
How could they send us
someone in a leather jacket?

315
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:31,863
I've never seen one
decent person wearing a leather jacket.

316
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,240
Darn it.

317
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,908
-Stop it.
-What?

318
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,410
What's wrong with leather?
She looks great.

319
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:42,999
As long as she's not a wild card,
we are good.

320
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,879
Welcome. It's nice to meet you.

321
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,465
Yes. It's nice to meet you, sir.

322
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,303
Perfect timing for a call.

323
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,015
-Yes, this is--
-Hello, sir.

324
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,685
This is the Foreign Affairs Division
of Korea Coast Guard.

325
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:02,727
Yes.

326
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:07,399
We got a report that MK Noble Hotel's
Mr. Ko will secretly flee to China.

327
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,901
You should hurry here
and check it for yourself.

328
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:13,655
Right now? Okay. We will do that.

329
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,368
-What is it?
-Ko Ju-won is going to flee to China.

330
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:22,455
-They called to ask for our support.
-Gosh, that bastard…

331
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:26,209
I thought it was strange
when he cashed in everything.

332
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,377
Damn it.

333
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:33,008
Right. You can stay here
and get used to this place.

334
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,718
If you feel like cleaning, you can.

335
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,345
But my desk is fine. Leave it as it is.

336
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,346
Let's go.

337
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,098
Right.

338
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,017
Hey, buddy.

339
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,021
Today's your first day
so we're going to cut you some slack.

340
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,897
But no more after that.

341
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,984
Darn it.

342
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,944
Gosh.

343
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,034
Hey!

344
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,494
-Hey!
-Darn it.

345
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,496
Stop there, you bastard!

346
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,670
Hey! Stop there!

347
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,298
Would you stop if you were me?

348
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,176
-Hey, stop!
-Hey!

349
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,510
Can't you run faster?

350
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,140
Hey, I can't do this.

351
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,600
My heart is going to explode.

352
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,603
-Go catch him.
-Gosh.

353
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,284
What was that?
I think something passed by just now.

354
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,747
Stop!

355
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,833
Would you stop if you were me?

356
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:50,835
What?

357
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,591
It's…

358
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,804
No. It can't be.

359
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,472
This is so annoying!

360
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,725
She's not human.

361
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,746
Who are you? Move!

362
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,499
I wouldn't be a detective
if I listened to you, would I?

363
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,167
Wait!

364
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,220
Gosh.

365
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:46,683
If you want to get paid,
do something about her.

366
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,027
What's going on?

367
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:13,168
Jeez, the new recruit
seems to fight quite well.

368
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,503
Darn it. I was happy so happy
to get a new recruit.

369
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:19,007
Isn't she the type
who goes around making trouble?

370
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,484
Don't come near me!

371
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,028
I said don't come near me!

372
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,292
Be thankful that you're still alive.

373
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,461
May the law bless you.

374
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,423
That was impressive.

375
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,549
Goodness.

376
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,511
-You are amazing.
-Hey, you were great.

377
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,346
-She's fast.
-Get up.

378
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,306
-Come on.
-You prick…

379
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,725
You're lucky it was her.
We would have gone to town on you.

380
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:14,604
-You're nothing compared to us.
-He's unrecyclable garbage.

381
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:20,026
It's settled, so go ask--

382
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,076
What's up with those romantic eyes?

383
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,288
Get lost.

384
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,958
She's totally my type.

385
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:38,920
I don't understand your tastes.

386
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,923
My ideal type of woman
is someone who can protect me.

387
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,676
Why would I need your understanding?

388
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:50,223
Right. You need
some sense beaten into you.

389
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,434
What's this stench?

390
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,811
Hello.

391
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,313
What's wrong with you?

392
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,983
You've been out of line as of late.

393
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,402
Hey, let go.

394
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,821
I said let go. Do you want to die?

395
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,322
Let go.

396
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,907
-I will kill you.
-Let go.

397
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,201
-I'm doing my best not to beat you.
-Is that so?

398
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,996
-Do you know how precious hair is?
-Oh, really?

399
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,498
I will go inside your room! Darn it.

400
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,000
Don't you dare!

401
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:20,211
-Hey, you're dead!
-No, it's you who's dead!

402
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:31,973
My sister

403
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,018
will be able to rest in peace now.

404
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,146
She died because of you. You killed her.

405
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,315
You said you'd give her
a permanent position

406
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,317
and sexually harassed her.

407
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,277
You even went all the way to her place.

408
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,237
You piece of trash.

409
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,865
The vengeful spirit of a secretary who
recently committed suicide is with him.

410
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,199
What?

411
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,495
You made this possible. Thank you.

412
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,960
Goodness. I didn't make anything happen.

413
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:05,006
It was your sister
who helped you. Poor thing…

414
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:09,761
She's so worried that you might
turn out like her, you know.

415
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,889
My sister…

416
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,146
Stop being so sad and live a good life
for your sister's sake, okay?

417
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,649
-Okay.
-Right.

418
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:26,611
Make sure you pay
for everything on your way out.

419
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,364
It's better if you pay cash.

420
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:35,703
Next time, I will come
to pick a wedding date.

421
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,914
-Okay.
-Thank you.

422
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,082
Take care.

423
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,670
Cheer up. The world is a rough place.

424
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,505
You can do it!

425
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,345
-Can't I eat first?
-No, it's a VIP.

426
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,264
Let him in.

427
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:01,688
Gosh, I haven't worked outside
in a while and my body is sore.

428
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:04,399
-Are your knees all right?
-Salute.

429
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,151
We're coming back from work.
You can do it!

430
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,028
Let's do this!

431
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:12,115
Should I go to a sauna? Gosh.

432
00:33:12,198 --> 00:33:13,449
Sir!

433
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,159
Constable Na Gwang-tae reporting.

434
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,953
As of January 10, 2022,

435
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:20,665
I've been appointed to Major Crime
Division Seven of Daeun Police Station.

436
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,333
A constable? The new recruit?

437
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,711
Yes. It's nice to meet you.

438
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,296
Then…

439
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,048
what about her?

440
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,679
I was transferred here as of today.
I'm Lieutenant Han Jae-hui.

441
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,598
You must be the new team leader.

442
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:38,975
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

443
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:45,023
You're the team leader?
Not the new recruit?

444
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,275
This is their way of
telling me to quit, right?

445
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,527
No, not at all.

446
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,780
The jacket is a symbol of individuality
and belief in personal freedom.

447
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,907
Your skills were amazing back there.

448
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:58,369
Welcome, Ms. Han!

449
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,041
I heard you were younger than me.

450
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,917
I must be mistaken, right?

451
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,963
-You're older, right?
-I'm still in my twenties.

452
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:13,092
My first birthday photo made my mom cry
because I looked the same as I do now.

453
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,262
It's okay. It happens
all the time. Right, sir?

454
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:23,144
Mr. Jang, I heard you used to be
the ace of the Investigation Bureau.

455
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,271
I look forward to working with you.

456
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,108
Right. Same here.

457
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,569
Lieutenant Han Jae-hui.

458
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,447
Han Jae-hui…

459
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,742
It sounds familiar.

460
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,577
Han Jae-hui?

461
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,955
Han Jae-hui?

462
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,875
No way.

463
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:50,213
The Ghost of Yongjin Police Station?

464
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:56,052
No way. Why would she come here?

465
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,762
-No.
-Right?

466
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,222
-No.
-No, right?

467
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:02,016
-No.
-She can't be her.

468
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,017
It's not you, is it?

469
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:07,855
Well, I didn't think
you would've heard about me.

470
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,498
-Jeez.
-Jeez.

471
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,376
-We are screwed.
-We are screwed.

472
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,086
Why is she nicknamed "The Ghost"?

473
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,801
-Where is he?
-I don't know.

474
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:40,638
You know the Southeast Asian
drug cartel got destroyed one day.

475
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,473
There was only one reason.

476
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,643
It was because they messed with
someone they should never mess with.

477
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,366
The drug squad of Yongjin Station
went to catch them

478
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:02,201
and ended up being held captive.

479
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,830
Upon hearing the news,
Ms. Han went to save her team.

480
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:10,251
She went there unarmed
and she took down every one of them.

481
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,627
-Darn it.
-Take her down!

482
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:44,702
Flapping her long hair, she flew
as if she was unaffected by gravity.

483
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,413
They say she looked like a ghost,
not a human.

484
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,085
That's when people started to wonder,

485
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:57,590
"Is Ms. Han even human? Is she a ghost?"
The rumor started to spread.

486
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,509
HAN THE GHOST

487
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,844
That's when people started

488
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,181
referring to her
as Han the Ghost. That's one story.

489
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,023
Is there another story?

490
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:17,652
Once she targets a case,
she goes after it like a ghost

491
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,446
until it gets resolved.

492
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:23,616
Some say that's why
people call her the Ghost.

493
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,167
Stop it!

494
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,335
Go away!

495
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,380
Don't come near me.

496
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:45,179
About Kang Eun-hye
who went missing a month ago…

497
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,807
Yes, ma'am!

498
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:52,019
She simply ran away from home,
so you don't need to worry.

499
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,981
But we don't have any records of her
doing anything since.

500
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,441
It might develop into a criminal case.

501
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,152
Please go over it once again just in case.

502
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,737
Why would you dig that up?

503
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,825
Yes, ma'am!
I will go over it! I will do it!

504
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,078
Detective Na, you can
work on it with Detective Kim.

505
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,329
Yes, ma'am.

506
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:12,915
You are my partner?

507
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,751
How about me then?

508
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:19,046
Right. You are my partner.

509
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,340
Please guide me well.

510
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:24,510
I see.

511
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,599
Chief…

512
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,103
Brother.

513
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:38,566
You want me to serve Han the Ghost
as the team leader? Come on.

514
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:41,902
I can't sink any lower than this.

515
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:44,613
I will have to quit my job altogether.

516
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:45,781
Hey.

517
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:50,745
I sent her to you
because I have a grand plan.

518
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,710
When she was at Yongjin Police Station,
she blew the whistle,

519
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,588
and the high officials
got sacked. You know this, right?

520
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,465
Right. So why bring her here?

521
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:09,096
The high officials are
very upset about what happened.

522
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,641
But they can't lay her off
because of the public sentiment.

523
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,769
They even promoted her to team leader.

524
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,146
She's like a time bomb.
Why keep her here--

525
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,192
Listen, Du-jin.

526
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:25,237
You have to return
to the Investigation Bureau.

527
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,490
Your life can be ruined
in a blink of an eye,

528
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:29,492
but it's hard getting back on your feet.

529
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:32,745
Let's climb up the ladder.

530
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,080
So…

531
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:35,998
How do we do that?

532
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:41,712
Do you know what the people
who don't like Han the Ghost want?

533
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,841
-It's getting rid of her for good.
-What?

534
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,762
So stay very close to her and observe her.

535
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,765
Observe her
and when the opportunity arises,

536
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:56,560
you can grab the chance
to get rid of her instantly.

537
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:59,021
-I see.
-Yes.

538
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,023
That's just too low.

539
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:02,775
Darn it.

540
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,780
Du-jin, an opportunity like this
doesn't come around easily.

541
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:11,325
I get to go to the main office,
and you get to go back to MCI.

542
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,994
-To MCI.
-To MCI.

543
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:15,871
-Yes.
-Okay.

544
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,836
MINAMDANG

545
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,730
It's really dark at night here.

546
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:09,717
Well, it's not that bad after all.

547
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:24,565
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

548
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,836
INVESTIGATION DATA
FROM 2019 TO 2020

549
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,389
DAEUN-DONG ASSAULT CASE

550
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,353
DAEUN POLICE STATION

551
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:05,481
I think there was a similar case.

552
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,585
DID THE JUDICIARY HELP
CHOI YEONG-SEOP GET AWAY?

553
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,184
OFFICER JAILED FOR FABRICATING EVIDENCE

554
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,103
You can't hide from me.

555
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,355
I will catch you

556
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:49,567
no matter what.

557
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,255
-The bone is mine.
-No way.

558
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,257
Hey!

559
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,758
-No!
-Hey!

560
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,053
Hey!

561
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:23,392
I told you to watch your manners
when you eat, didn't I?

562
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:24,727
Right.

563
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,815
I'm the one who has to clean up

564
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:33,360
after you two make a mess around here.

565
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,240
Hey! Get out!

566
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,871
Yesterday, you… Wait.

567
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,289
Will you put this down?

568
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:48,417
You stayed out last night
without telling me.

569
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:51,754
Are you mad? Have you lost your mind?

570
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:56,050
Maybe I shouldn't have come home.

571
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:03,849
This phone call saved you. Do you get it?

572
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:12,483
It could have been really bad.

573
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:15,110
How dare you do such a thing
to anger the gods and men?

574
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,196
How did you know that?

575
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,615
My gosh, you really are good.

576
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,952
Something is up, isn't it?

577
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:27,623
You said I should call you
if my husband starts acting suspiciously.

578
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,211
He came home high

579
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:34,338
and covered in blood.

580
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,965
-What's stranger is…
-What is it?

581
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,093
He's in the study

582
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,680
worrying about something.

583
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:44,223
What?

584
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,936
That idiot is worried about something?

585
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:51,730
Check what he's up to.

586
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:52,856
Okay.

587
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:09,415
The secretary just came in disheveled.

588
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,875
He must have done something again.

589
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:14,336
I will ask the spirit and get back to you.

590
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,629
Watch your husband.

591
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,425
Don't take your eyes off him.
Do you understand?

592
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:20,759
Yes, sir.

593
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:25,389
Maybe that jerk did drugs
and caused trouble again?

594
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,766
That may be it,

595
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,893
but I'm worried
about what he might have done.

596
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:33,522
I hacked the dashcam
and the surveillance cameras. Let's check.

597
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:34,940
Okay.

598
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,527
SHIN GYEONG-HO

599
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:45,617
One of Shin Gyeong-ho's
dashcams is turned off.

600
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,286
-Are there any saved footage?
-Yes.

601
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:48,620
Let's see it.

602
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,372
Okay.

603
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,630
S&H GROUP VICE CHAIRMAN
SHIN GYEONG-HO

604
00:45:58,714 --> 00:46:01,467
What is he hiding under that anxious face?

605
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:06,555
Fast forward.

606
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:12,227
Let's go!

607
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,815
Honey!

608
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,567
Let's race!

609
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:20,152
Honey!

610
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:22,362
Race!

611
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:26,909
I think I'm too drunk.

612
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:29,620
Too drunk?

613
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,915
-I'm too drunk.
-Come on.

614
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:36,376
Don't! Why would you do that?

615
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,670
-Honey.
-Open the window!

616
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,172
What's that?

617
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:48,889
Oh, no.

618
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,392
-Shit.
-What should we do?

619
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,895
-What should we do?
-Shut up!

620
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:04,947
Hey.

621
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,449
Hey!

622
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:13,664
Come over here.

623
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:20,337
Was it a hit-and-run?

624
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,177
DAEUN MEMORIAL PARK

625
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,178
DAEUN BRIDGE

626
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:31,223
DAEUN HANGANG PARK

627
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,147
It's Shin Gyeong-ho.

628
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:42,150
He would have
taken care of it if that was it.

629
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,527
What?

630
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:54,496
That jerk… Let's just kill him
and stop using him.

631
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:58,000
Yes. I want to beat him to death.
What will you do?

632
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:03,213
She's a conglomerate VVIP customer.

633
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:04,464
Let's play along.

634
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,591
What?

635
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:14,433
-Your husband killed another man.
-What?

636
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:17,352
If you don't get this taken care of,
you will pay for it too.

637
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,395
Sir…

638
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,105
what should I do?

639
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:22,858
I will take care of it myself
so don't you worry.

640
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:25,027
Just do what I say.

641
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:44,463
CONSTRUCTION ON-GOING

642
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:49,217
Darn it. This is where
the camera stopped tracking him.

643
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:52,763
There are no signages after this point,
and there's only the road.

644
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,973
He wouldn't have gotten far.

645
00:48:56,642 --> 00:49:00,228
It's cold and dark. Where would we
go and find this dead body?

646
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:04,733
Goodness. We might freeze to death.

647
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:08,403
Someone as impulsive and disorganized
as Shin Gyeong-ho has no patience.

648
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,823
He must have wanted
to get rid of the body fast.

649
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:15,702
He would've chosen somewhere safe
and familiar where people won't see him.

650
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,037
So where would that be?

651
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:21,208
Let's see.

652
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,920
What does he have to do with this area?

653
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:30,425
-Why did he go on a date here?
-Right.

654
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:33,136
There are lots of good restaurants here.

655
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:35,972
Just don't say anything, okay?

656
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,767
You're pouting again.

657
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,210
SH_SGH911, SHIN GYEONG-HO

658
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:13,760
Give me the map.

659
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:15,887
Here.

660
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:21,935
Where is the bike road near here
that has no foot traffic?

661
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:24,646
Daeun Reservoir, Museum of Martyrs,

662
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,189
Daeun Memorial Park…

663
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,067
It wouldn't be Hangang Park.

664
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,486
DAEUN MEMORIAL PARK

665
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,116
-Daeun Memorial Park.
-What?

666
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,827
Shin Gyeong-ho's mother is resting there.

667
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:41,413
A familiar and
quiet place with no cameras.

668
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:43,081
It's there. Let's go.

669
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,833
-Let's go.
-Okay.

670
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:49,171
He dared to abandon a dead body
while his mom was watching.

671
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:50,881
He's got guts.

672
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,925
It's because someone's
on their way to take care of the body.

673
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,636
We have to find the body
before his secretary does. Hurry.

674
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:57,554
Okay.

675
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,700
-Su-cheol, over there.
-Okay.

676
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,243
-You check there, Hye-jun.
-Okay.

677
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:40,889
Are you sure you're right? It's not there.

678
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,766
It's somewhere around here for sure.

679
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,353
What about you? Anything?

680
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,271
What? Nothing.

681
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:52,734
Goodness. People can
make mistakes, you know.

682
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,194
You're not an exception.

683
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,029
Don't be embarrassed. It's okay.

684
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:59,157
Have I ever been wrong? I'm Nam Han-jun.

685
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:02,369
What? What if his secretary
already stopped by?

686
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:06,998
-Let me check.
-Okay.

687
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,919
Gosh, I'm hungry.

688
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:21,012
Did you just hear that?

689
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,848
What? Hear what?

690
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,642
He left home just a moment ago.

691
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:27,561
I heard something.

692
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,398
Right.

693
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,400
I heard it too.

694
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,110
There aren't even any tombs nearby.

695
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:36,486
Wait…

696
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,154
Is it a ghost?

697
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:42,242
Han-jun.

698
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,369
-Han-jun.
-What?

699
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:46,413
Perhaps the person Shin Gyeong-ho killed

700
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,623
became a vengeful spirit.

701
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:51,418
This is the 21st century.
There are no ghosts.

702
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,336
But I heard something.

703
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:18,612
Go take a look. What good are your muscles
if you aren't going to use them?

704
00:53:19,195 --> 00:53:22,324
You are a shaman.
Do something to ward it off.

705
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:23,742
Come on.

706
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:28,330
I can't believe I call you my brothers.

707
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:29,789
I will go.

708
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:30,957
Go.

709
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:33,209
I'm proud of you, little sister.

710
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,888
Walk slowly.

711
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,436
-Will you walk slowly?
-Will you keep it down?

712
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:54,356
-Can we go back?
-Keep it down.

713
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:15,794
What was that?

714
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,380
-Hey.
-Darn it.

715
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:21,341
-What was that?
-Was it a zombie?

716
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,718
I don't see it now. It's gone.

717
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:30,433
Dear Lord, thank you for the food…

718
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,726
-No, that's not it.
-Amen.

719
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,937
Give me strength
to ward off this evil spirit.

720
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:40,944
Hey, move it.

721
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,488
-Isn't that a person?
-What?

722
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:44,656
A person?

723
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,704
He's the biker Shin Gyeong-ho hit.

724
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:08,013
His heart stopped from a shock.
Call 911, Hye-jun.

725
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:12,142
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

726
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,768
One, two, three, four…

727
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,451
Yes. Major Crime Division Seven.

728
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,287
Who?

729
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:39,711
After hitting him, the suspect thought
the victim died and abandoned him.

730
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:42,172
I was told to pass the case on
to the Major Crime Division.

731
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,799
-Who did?
-The person who reported it.

732
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,426
Mr. Nam Han-jun.

733
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:51,890
Nam Han-jun couldn't be
that Nam Han-jun, could he?

734
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,193
Is he alive?

735
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,153
Darn it.

736
00:56:15,371 --> 00:56:17,123
-Hello?
-There's a problem.

737
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,875
What is it? You didn't find the body?

738
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,836
He's not dead. He's alive.

739
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,213
Darn it!

740
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:26,841
You idiot! Are you out of your mind?

741
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:30,261
Are you insane? Are you going to visit him

742
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:33,640
and thank him for being alive?

743
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,975
You are a total idiot!

744
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,228
You should have finished him off
and buried him!

745
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:42,190
You should have ripped him to pieces
and thrown him in the Han River!

746
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:53,952
Where are the victim and the caller?

747
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,036
Over there.

748
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:28,862
Nam Han-jun?

749
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,544
She looks very familiar.

750
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,838
Do you know her?

751
00:57:46,921 --> 00:57:50,216
-Oh, the kick.
-What?

752
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,594
The new detective at Daeun Police Station.

753
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:56,723
I see. But why is she staring at you?

754
00:57:56,806 --> 00:58:00,351
Isn't it obvious? She fell in love
with me the moment she saw me.

755
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:03,021
No. It looks like she's
about to beat you up any moment.

756
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,397
She must be nervous.

757
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:14,949
See? She's walking towards me.

758
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:24,083
That's a strange pose.

759
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:27,629
You are the detective
who got the call, aren't you?

760
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,424
Yes. I'm from Daeun Police Station.

761
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,635
-I see.
-Did you report a hit-and-run case?

762
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:36,596
Yes. I reported it.

763
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:39,432
So you asked for the case to be
turned over to the Major Crime Division

764
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,434
because the suspect abandoned
the victim after hitting him?

765
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,393
I did.

766
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:45,438
How would you know that
unless you witnessed it?

767
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,148
Did the victim tell you this?

768
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:49,526
Well…

769
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,945
I didn't hear it from the victim--

770
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,029
A spirit told him.

771
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:57,158
-What?
-He's a shaman.

772
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,077
-Shaman?
-Well--

773
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:00,995
He doesn't look like one, right?

774
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,000
I'm--

775
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:08,294
"The Wonder of Yonghae-dong."
You don't know him?

776
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,254
He's very famous.

777
00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:13,424
Everyone knows Shaman Nam Han-jun.

778
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,802
Come see him when you have time.

779
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,222
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

780
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:21,140
He's very good with criminal cases too.

781
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,025
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

782
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:38,616
Ma'am.

783
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:40,910
Ma'am?

784
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:42,495
Yes.

785
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:48,126
Did you go over Kang Eun-hye Missing Case?

786
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:50,545
She had a fight
with her father and left home.

787
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:53,423
See? I told you it was nothing.

788
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:56,342
We've been working
in Major Crime Division for so long.

789
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,097
Then let's move on to the next case.

790
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:02,974
DAEUN MEMORIAL PARK HIT-AND-RUN CASE

791
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,269
A hit-and-run case?

792
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:10,940
There's a team that specializes in it.
Why are we taking this case?

793
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:12,817
It looks like a hit-and-run case

794
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,028
but it's more like
an attempted murder case.

795
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,155
Come on.

796
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:20,533
It says "hit-and-run" here.

797
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:24,662
We haven't arrested anyone
and we have poor performance.

798
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,998
People always call us idiots.

799
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:29,834
How can we take
a hit-and-run case as your first case?

800
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,461
You think so too, right?

801
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:33,755
Yes. I guess.

802
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:38,009
Why don't we settle
Daeun-dong Assault Case first?

803
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:42,347
There is no surveillance camera footage
or a witness. It will take some time.

804
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,974
-That case has already been resolved.
-Already?

805
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,352
The victim had signed up
for several insurances.

806
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:49,729
There was a similar case,
so I looked into it.

807
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:52,440
It was the work of
Kim Yun-bae's insurance scam gang.

808
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,028
How did you find that out?

809
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:59,697
By researching similar cases.
It's the most basic method.

810
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:03,409
You resolved it in just a day.

811
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,037
No wonder she's famous, right?

812
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,539
Since we got
the troublesome case out of our way,

813
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:11,125
we can take the hit-and-run case, right?

814
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:17,131
Do you know what the people
who don't like Han the Ghost want?

815
01:01:18,257 --> 01:01:20,968
-It's getting rid of her for good.
-What?

816
01:01:21,552 --> 01:01:24,931
So stay very close to her and observe her.

817
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:27,975
Observe her
and when the opportunity arises,

818
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:31,646
you can grab the chance
to get rid of her instantly.

819
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:34,023
-I see.
-Yes.

820
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:40,071
You do realize
people are watching you, right?

821
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,325
But everyone's gone home. There's no one--

822
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:50,998
If you really want to take it,
I won't stop you.

823
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:54,127
But if it's possible,

824
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:57,296
try not to stand out too much.

825
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,924
That way, you won't
harm your teammates either.

826
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:04,178
We haven't accepted you
as the team leader yet.

827
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,016
Right.

828
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:13,187
As a detective and a team leader,

829
01:02:13,271 --> 01:02:16,649
I will do my best to win your approval.

830
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:25,992
So it's a hit-and-run case?

831
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:30,163
-It's a hit-and-run case.
-Yes.

832
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:40,131
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

833
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:48,765
I head the team that captured Ko Ju-won
took the Shin Gyeong-ho Case.

834
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:51,184
The detective at the hit-and-run site?

835
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:55,062
I knew it. My prediction was right.

836
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:58,316
She took that case
to get involved with me somehow.

837
01:02:58,399 --> 01:02:59,901
She must have fallen for me.

838
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:03,446
Goodness. Don't listen to that.

839
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,952
All right. Wait.

840
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:13,206
Gosh.

841
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:15,958
Again?

842
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:18,461
I should do something about her.

843
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:23,007
Boss!

844
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:25,426
-Looney is here.
-Who?

845
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,594
Looney.

846
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:28,304
Looney?

847
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:29,722
-Looney?
-Looney?

848
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:33,100
Gosh.

849
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:37,855
He witnessed a hit-and-run by chance?

850
01:03:38,397 --> 01:03:41,108
A shaman? That's ridiculous.

851
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:51,077
I'm certain that he's hiding something.

852
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,922
He's very suspicious.

853
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:12,390
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

854
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:14,433
She scares me.

855
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,646
Has Looney finally come back?

856
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:21,816
No. Even I can't handle her.

857
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:22,900
Tell me about it.

858
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:24,902
Stop talking about her.

859
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:28,906
-Hey.
-Yes?

860
01:04:30,283 --> 01:04:32,076
-Why is this open?
-What?

861
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:35,454
-Did you get something from here?
-No, it wasn't me.

862
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,168
There's nothing.

863
01:05:14,493 --> 01:05:16,537
Boss!

864
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,874
Boss! I found Looney! She's here!

865
01:05:19,957 --> 01:05:21,542
-Boss!
-What?

866
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:23,210
-Where?
-Over there!

867
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:24,962
Get her!

868
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:27,715
-Where is she?
-Catch her!

869
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,468
-Hey!
-Hey!

870
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,179
Hey, stop!

871
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:35,681
Stop her!

872
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:36,974
Looney!

873
01:05:37,058 --> 01:05:38,559
Looney is here!

874
01:05:38,643 --> 01:05:40,144
I will catch you this time!

875
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:46,692
She's so fast!

876
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:48,653
Will you stop?

877
01:05:48,736 --> 01:05:51,739
-Looney!
-I will catch you!

878
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:54,033
Looney!

879
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:55,576
Stop!

880
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:08,756
-We got her now.
-Come on!

881
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:10,883
Get her.

882
01:06:42,206 --> 01:06:43,708
You're leaving me?

883
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:50,631
You're human, aren't you? Who are you?

884
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,717
Come on down right now!

885
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:09,900
EPILOGUE

886
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:29,295
POLICE

887
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:29,814
He was released when he killed someone?

888
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:33,442
This isn't the first time
you had blood on your hands.

889
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:34,568
He's declaring war.

890
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:36,862
You're right. This is war.

891
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,948
-Otherwise, we'll all die!
-Tell us!

892
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:41,992
Can't anyone issue us a warrant
without being scared of conglomerates?

893
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:43,077
Prosecutor Cha Do-won.

894
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,287
So what's our next move?

895
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:46,914
Operation Kill Two Birds with One Stone.

896
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:48,332
Hurry.

897
01:08:48,415 --> 01:08:50,501
I'd rather crush you myself.

898
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:53,504
I'm the special person who will help you
by any means necessary.

899
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:54,797
Shaman Nam Han-jun.
