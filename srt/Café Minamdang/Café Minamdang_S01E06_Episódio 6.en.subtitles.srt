00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,709
EPISODE 6

3
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,129
Careful. Follow me quietly.

4
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,548
POLICE

5
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:50,592
This is delicious.

6
00:00:51,509 --> 00:00:52,677
It's so good.

7
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,180
Oh no, Kkot-sun!

8
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:58,433
Gosh, she's doing it again!

9
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:01,895
You've eaten up a million won's
worth of strawberries already!

10
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,354
Get her!

11
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,106
Stop!

12
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,818
Your grandmother's worried!

13
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,200
Hey, Ms. Kkot-sun, put down the gun!

14
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,951
Stop, stay right there.

15
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,411
-Gosh.
-This way, this way.

16
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,329
Shoot.

17
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,500
Oh, seriously. Stop right there!

18
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,715
Jeez, where did she go? It's cold out.

19
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,800
I know.

20
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,260
Do you think she crossed the road?

21
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,597
Wait, I think that truck has a black box.

22
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,848
I'll go look.

23
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,899
Where's the owner?

24
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,444
Sir. Sir!

25
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,530
Ma'am, the black box isn't here.

26
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,033
But the key's in the ignition too.

27
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,576
I wonder where he went.

28
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,162
Sir!

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,123
Sir!

30
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,507
This isn't blood, is it?

31
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,592
I hope not.

32
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,098
Here, look at this.

33
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,355
RICE FOR SALE

34
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,241
Oh, wow. What's this smell?

35
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,535
Call for backup right now.

36
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:41,536
Okay.

37
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,540
We're at 278 Gisannam-ro.

38
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,417
There seems to be a fire.

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,460
Requesting backup from available officers.

40
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,718
POLICE

41
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:27,916
PROSECUTOR HAN JAE-JEONG

42
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,211
Jeez, clean it regularly, would you?
It's filthy.

43
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,505
Use a cleaner. You'll leave fingerprints.

44
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,632
Jeez.

45
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,846
You've never cleaned this before?

46
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,056
Probably not.

47
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,935
Never mind that.

48
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,854
Look at this. Do Jun-ha was arrested
without a warrant

49
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,190
six months ago on charges of rape.

50
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,984
There was a video on his phone
that he took himself,

51
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,321
but the evidence was illegally obtained
so he apparently got off free.

52
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,199
Choi Yeong-seop's daughter
killed herself the day after.

53
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,494
So you think Choi Yeong-seop murdered

54
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,537
-his daughter's rapist to get revenge?
-Yes.

55
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:09,082
He has a clear motive,

56
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:12,126
and while he doesn't remember
what happened because of his overdose,

57
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,462
he admits that he killed Do Jun-ha.

58
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,131
So he admits to the murder
but doesn't remember doing it.

59
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:21,552
You're saying you have it all, the motive,
the evidence, and the confession.

60
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,888
What's bothering you
that you asked me for help?

61
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:27,475
Why didn't he run away,
staying at the scene of the crime

62
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,228
and taking an insufficient dose
of medicine to kill himself?

63
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,521
Did you kill him?

64
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,737
He's dead.

65
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,992
He's really dead.

66
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,874
I killed him.

67
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,759
You're asking the wrong question.

68
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:05,138
No wonder you can't find an answer.

69
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,389
What?

70
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:10,351
You're asking the question
under the assumption that he did it.

71
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:14,731
Why didn't he run away
after committing a brutal murder?

72
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,025
Am I wrong?

73
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,484
No.

74
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:24,907
Why would he admit to a crime
he doesn't even remember?

75
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,243
That's what you should be asking.

76
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:29,912
Why?

77
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:34,709
Because Choi Yeong-seop didn't do it.

78
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:40,965
Choi Yeong-seop didn't do it?

79
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,426
On what grounds?

80
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:47,472
Is a cup of coffee
all I get for my professional analysis?

81
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,931
Of course not.

82
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:53,478
I shall find a restaurant

83
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:57,273
that's right up your alley, Mr. Profiler.

84
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:58,858
Somewhere really trendy.

85
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:02,153
But legal.

86
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:04,614
Okay, I have your word.

87
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:07,283
-All right, let's go!
-Go where?

88
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,077
-To the scene of the crime.
-Right now?

89
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,456
You can only learn about people and cases…

90
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,083
If you go see them for yourselves?

91
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,293
There you go.
How many times do I have to tell you that?

92
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,295
You drive.

93
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,634
The cause of death was
pressure exerted on the victim's neck.

94
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,261
That means the murderer took
the victim to the warehouse,

95
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,223
unconscious from the blow,
then choked him to death.

96
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,599
But this is the weird part.

97
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,769
Look. There are gaps
between the bloodstains.

98
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:38,481
He moved an adult man on his own,
but there are no drag marks?

99
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,650
Don't you find that odd?

100
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:44,028
Choi Yeong-seop is
10cm taller than the victim.

101
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,196
He's much bigger too.

102
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,740
Then we should
at least see his footprints.

103
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,033
The scene's too clean.

104
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,619
So he had an accomplice?

105
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,790
DO NOT ENTER, UNDER INVESTIGATION

106
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,238
The officer reported to have seen
smoke when they arrived.

107
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,365
Choi Yeong-seop was just waking up.

108
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,785
Judging from the ketamine level
in his blood at the time of arrest,

109
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,787
he must have been out
for at least an hour.

110
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,999
It takes 30 minutes at most
to burn the exterior of a body

111
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,834
like that with benzene.

112
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:42,837
Arsonists enjoy watching their work.

113
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,214
Especially if they committed murder.

114
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,885
If he did this,

115
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,678
this would have been an act of punishment,

116
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:53,306
and he would have wanted to watch.

117
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,642
But you said he had just woken up
when the officer got there.

118
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,729
-Yes.
-If that's true,

119
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,064
then that means Choi Yeong-seop
didn't see Do Jun-ha die

120
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,525
or his body burn.

121
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:07,695
You mean someone's framing
Choi Yeong-seop?

122
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,696
Bingo.

123
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:12,116
But I don't think
this is their first time.

124
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,785
What are you talking about?

125
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,498
It takes skill, special equipment,
and practice to use benzene

126
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:22,502
to scorch the exterior of a body
without burning up the internal organs.

127
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,713
And the way he's framing Choi Yeong-seop.

128
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,049
Wow, how fun.

129
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,176
There is no way

130
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,221
-this is their first crime.
-Wait.

131
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:37,475
You're not saying the real murderer
is a serial killer, are you?

132
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,643
That's not important.

133
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,604
What's important here is the link

134
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,023
between the victim, Choi Yeong-seop,
and the killer…

135
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,610
No. That's pretty important to me.
This is so confusing.

136
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,134
-Hey, you go that way.
-Okay.

137
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,908
Damn…

138
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:37,952
Gosh.

139
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,733
-Jeez, you scared me.
-Jeez.

140
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:12,320
Hey, who do you think you are,
Captain America?

141
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,113
And what are you supposed to be, Thor?

142
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,160
What?

143
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,042
Let me pour you a cup, sir.

144
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,293
Sure.

145
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:37,136
Is there anything you wanted
to report to the police, sir?

146
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,013
Yes, there is.

147
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:41,849
That day,

148
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:47,063
the day of the murder,
I saw something very strange.

149
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,982
I was working out in the field,

150
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,736
when I saw smoke
coming from the warehouse.

151
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:58,449
I kept watching because I thought
some outsider was burning garbage

152
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,662
That's when someone
walked out of the warehouse.

153
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,914
But…

154
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:09,502
he just swept the ground
with a broom or something and then left,

155
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,922
leaving the car behind.

156
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:17,093
Sir, do you remember when that happened?

157
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,888
Yes. I had just had lunch,

158
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,225
so it was a little after one o'clock.

159
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:27,686
The officer arrived at the scene at 1:08.

160
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,567
Yes. That was when we requested backup.

161
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,779
But you're going to let
Choi Yeong-seop go? Why?

162
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,281
We found a witness
who saw another man at the scene.

163
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,368
That doesn't mean
Choi Yeong-seop isn't the killer.

164
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,663
You should have seen his eyes.

165
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,666
He was smiling, I'm sure.

166
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,084
There was something off about him.

167
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,045
I hear you,

168
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,005
but there was another suspect at the scene

169
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,924
and no concrete physical evidence.

170
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,301
On top of that, the profiler says
Choi Yeong-seop didn't do it.

171
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,263
So you trust the profiler but not me?

172
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,765
Jeez, who's the quack?

173
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,392
He's not a quack.

174
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,061
His name is Nam Han-jun, the one
who solved the Mi-sun case recently--

175
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,647
Nam Han-jun? How do you know Nam Han-jun?

176
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,524
Are you two close?

177
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,235
Yes, he's my friend from high school.

178
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,655
I guess he's pretty famous
if you know about him too, Jang-mi.

179
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,325
You know how much
I love and respect you, right?

180
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:28,205
-Set me up with Nam Han-jun. Please?
-What's with you? Why?

181
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,707
Why not me?

182
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,460
Does he have a girlfriend?
Am I not his type?

183
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,421
He doesn't have a girlfriend,
but why would you want to go out with him?

184
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,047
Really?

185
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:40,634
I guess I'll have to meet up with him,
if only about the Choi Yeong-seop case.

186
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:43,846
Do you want to talk to him about the case,
or have a date with him?

187
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,182
The case, of course!

188
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,351
I mean, I did a pretty good job
growing up.

189
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,521
I think I can take him on this time.

190
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,775
DETENTION CENTER

191
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,039
Choi Yeong-seop.

192
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,415
I'm going to catch you

193
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,418
and make a majestic entrance
when I go see Nam Han-jun.

194
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,500
Shoot.

195
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,544
Why is he back at the crime scene?

196
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:02,216
DO NOT ENTER, UNDER INVESTIGATION

197
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,889
I'm going home for the first time
in I don't know how long. Don't stop me.

198
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,849
You said the guy who framed
Choi Yeong-seop

199
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,686
-must've done it before, right?
-Yes.

200
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:16,313
I think I found the link that connects

201
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:18,190
the victim, Choi Yeong-seop,
and the killer together.

202
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,359
What is it?

203
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,112
If you want to know, come over
to my place with jokbal and soju.

204
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,364
No, I don't want to know.

205
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,242
I find I've suddenly lost all interest.

206
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,174
NAM HAN-JUN

207
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,712
Stop right there. This is the police.

208
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,432
Put it down.

209
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,353
This is my last warning.

210
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,271
Put it down.

211
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,002
Mr. Choi Yeong-seop.

212
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:06,799
Did you kill Do Jun-ha?

213
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,593
I said I killed him.

214
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:14,056
Why couldn't you have believed me?
Why did you have to mess this up? Why?

215
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,224
Don't move!

216
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,559
Don't resent me.

217
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,438
Prosecutor Han Jae-jeong's going to die

218
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,692
and it's all your fault.

219
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,278
Shoot.

220
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,043
Gosh.

221
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,093
Hello?

222
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,512
Jae-jeong. Choi Yeong-seop did it.

223
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:38,140
He was back at the crime scene, and…

224
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,558
The crime scene?

225
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,520
Hey, are you tailing Choi Yeong-seop?

226
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,441
Hey, are you okay? Are you hurt?

227
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:51,028
I'm fine. I was following him,

228
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:54,031
and he came to the crime scene
to get his cell phone.

229
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,076
The phone had a video of the murder.

230
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,285
A video?

231
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,331
Oh, and Choi Yeong-seop said
something weird.

232
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:06,168
He said it was my fault
if Prosecutor Han Jae-jeong died.

233
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,795
So be careful.

234
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,297
Okay, I'll be careful.

235
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,591
Hey, you be careful too, you punk. Okay?

236
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:15,552
Jang-mi. Come over to my place right now.

237
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,388
I've found something.

238
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,266
-I'll tell you the details in person.
-You found something?

239
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,143
Why Choi Yeong-seop…

240
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:33,946
Jae-jeong.

241
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,824
What's going on?

242
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,059
Jae-jeong.

243
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,520
Are you okay?

244
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,491
Jae-jeong.

245
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,494
Jae-jeong.

246
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,659
Hey, big bro's here. Open the door.

247
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,872
You little…

248
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,417
I brought you your jokbal.
Come on and open the door.

249
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,723
Hey, open the door.

250
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,439
Jeez.

251
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,901
Don't you want the jokbal?

252
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,778
Hey, what are you doing here?

253
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,072
Hey, why are you here?

254
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,950
Well, this is my beat,
so of course I'm here,

255
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,035
but what brings you here from HQ?

256
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:34,668
This is my friend's house.

257
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,796
You're friends with Prosecutor Han?

258
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,089
-Yes.
-I'm here

259
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,216
because my boss told me
to come right away.

260
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,432
What the hell? What is this?

261
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,683
Hey, call 911.

262
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,768
Jae-jeong, Jae-jeong!

263
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,272
Jae-jeong!

264
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,899
Jae-jeong, Han Jae-jeong!

265
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,406
Jae-jeong!

266
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,744
Jae-jeong, Han Jae-jeong!

267
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,621
Is this 911? I'm calling
from Seoju Apartments. Send someone now!

268
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,498
Get out of the way.

269
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,481
Where's the fire extinguisher?

270
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:45,322
Come here, you bastard!

271
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,210
Damn it!

272
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,592
Fire!

273
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:08,095
Go chase him!

274
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,807
Gosh.

275
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,862
Jae-jeong.

276
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,782
Jae-jeong!

277
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:31,076
Jae-jeong!

278
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,860
Is someone hurt?

279
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:48,653
-Goodness, what's going on?
-Oh, no.

280
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,280
I think they're dead.

281
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,907
Goodness, someone died.

282
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,367
-What happened?
-Oh, gosh.

283
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:55,827
Jeez.

284
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,746
Excuse me, could you move aside?

285
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,248
Goodness.

286
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,508
Oh, no, he's been burnt black.

287
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:14,012
-Gosh.
-Gosh, I can't look.

288
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,014
Oh, I can't believe this.

289
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,768
Jae-jeong.

290
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,152
POLICE

291
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,498
You're Prosecutor Han's sister, right?

292
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,751
I'm Cha Do-won, the prosecutor in charge.

293
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,505
Who killed

294
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:50,799
my brother?

295
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,344
We found

296
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,305
Choi Yeong-seop's ID at the crime scene.

297
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,895
Prosecutor Han Jae-jeong's going to die
and it's all your fault.

298
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,345
It looks like Choi Yeong-seop did it.

299
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,599
They found his ID in the wallet

300
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,894
that the suspect dropped.

301
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,689
Choi Yeong-seop didn't do it.

302
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,066
You said you couldn't see anything
because it was so dark.

303
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,235
I did see one thing.

304
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,071
The burn scar on his arm.

305
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,991
He must've gotten it
while starting the fire. Come on.

306
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,744
It was an old scar.

307
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,999
Choi Yeong-seop
doesn't have a scar on his arm.

308
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,711
Then who did this, if not him?

309
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,920
I shouldn't have…

310
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:15,383
I shouldn't have tried to catch him.

311
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,097
I should have…

312
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:27,562
I should have saved Jae-jeong first…

313
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,824
I think I found the link that connects

314
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,995
the victim, Choi Yeong-seop,
and the killer together.

315
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,126
What?

316
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,173
Jae-jeong must have found something.

317
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,510
Here you go.

318
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:01,137
What are you talking about? What is it?

319
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,350
He said he found the link that connected

320
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,936
Do Jun-ha, Choi Yeong-seop,
and the killer together.

321
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,272
What he knew is why…

322
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:13,983
the killer murdered Jae-jeong.

323
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:17,737
So what did Prosecutor Han find
and what did the killer take?

324
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,364
That's what we need to find out.

325
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,159
Gosh.

326
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,751
JUNIOR JUDO COMPETITION

327
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:39,300
Han-jun.

328
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,303
Han-jun.

329
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,458
It's okay. Let's go.

330
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,894
You saw the killer?

331
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,648
He was running away from the scene.
I tried to catch him--

332
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,233
Did you see his face?

333
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,944
Can you be sure it wasn't Choi Yeong-seop?

334
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,197
I didn't see his face, but on his wrist…

335
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,242
So you only saw him run away.

336
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,577
You didn't see him
commit the murder yourself.

337
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,454
Jeez, Choi Yeong-seop admitted it too!

338
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,164
When he woke up, Do Jun-ha was dead!

339
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,709
He told me three years ago
that he killed Do Jun-ha.

340
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,336
He was very creepy about it too.

341
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,963
Honestly, you're driving me crazy.

342
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,757
You should trust me
since it's coming from me--

343
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,676
I can't, because it's coming from you.

344
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:47,512
I can't trust you
because you go around conning people

345
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,806
pretending to be a shaman!

346
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:52,600
Excuse me, could you stop fighting and--

347
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,185
You are a terrible judge of people,

348
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:56,229
no wonder you're a bad investigator!

349
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:59,107
That's freaking rich coming from you.

350
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,483
What? Coming from me?

351
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,236
I'm the famed shaman of Yonghaedong,
how dare--

352
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,822
I guess you aren't good,
compared to your reputation.

353
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:09,242
All you're saying is it isn't him.
You haven't caught the killer yet either.

354
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,583
Gosh.

355
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,835
What?

356
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,963
You found proof
at Choi Yeong-seop's place?

357
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,757
White dress shoes and benzene?
Things like that?

358
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,427
How did you…

359
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,305
Anyone could have put those there.

360
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,640
Don't be so certain that he's the killer
based on those things.

361
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,936
If you're truly a police officer,
and if you're truly a prosecutor,

362
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,690
you should at least have checked
your suspect's alibi.

363
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,025
Got it?

364
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,654
Jeez, what are you looking at?

365
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:57,874
Sometimes,
as important as the evidence is,

366
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,209
you need to rely on your gut feeling.

367
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,921
You know, when it feels like…

368
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:06,215
Protecting the witness is
more important than your gut feeling.

369
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,678
Of course it's important
to protect your witness.

370
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,515
But Mr. Shaman has a point too.

371
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:17,894
Why would the hit-and-run driver
have tried to kill Choi Yeong-seop?

372
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,979
Because Choi Yeong-seop knows something.

373
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:23,232
Sir, I think you made a mistake this time.

374
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:25,902
Ms. Han.

375
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,407
You need to be more flexible
with your investigations.

376
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,535
Be more reasonable
about utilizing the people around you.

377
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,331
You can't solve cases so rigidly.

378
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,708
And your idea of being reasonable
is using a shaman?

379
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,127
I won't be like
those incompetent detectives--

380
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:44,879
"Incompetent"?

381
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,339
No, that's not what I meant…

382
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,465
"Incompetent"?

383
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,177
Oh, really?

384
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,804
Okay.

385
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,767
Fine. You're competent and I'm not.

386
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,854
Since you're so great and competent,
Ms. Han,

387
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,732
good luck solving the case on your own.

388
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,652
-Oh, come on.
-Let go, jeez.

389
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,030
Ma'am, "incompetent"? Really?

390
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,826
Hey, you're not quite incompetent.

391
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:15,952
Sir!

392
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:31,718
I think I should go check
Choi Yeong-seop's alibi.

393
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,014
Because of what Mr. Nam said?

394
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,808
And Mr. Jang too.

395
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,894
He might be a quack, but his words stung.

396
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,314
I don't think I can ignore it.

397
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,819
I need to be certain
that Choi Yeong-seop did it.

398
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,075
My god, why does it smell
so moldy in here?

399
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,287
Jeez.

400
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,789
Wow, that's better.

401
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,916
Gosh.

402
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,545
-Mr. Nam.
-What?

403
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,922
There's something I've been meaning
to ask you--

404
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,300
Are you not busy?
Being a prosecutor must be easy.

405
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:15,887
Of course not. There's nothing
in the world such as an easy job.

406
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,889
I've had my share of tribulations.

407
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,557
-He's gone insane.
-In 2015,

408
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,267
-Close it.
-I became a prosecutor

409
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,061
and every single case I got that year

410
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,812
-Why won't this close?
-was so hard.

411
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,856
-What's with this?
-But I didn't give up.

412
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,317
On April 8th, 2016, I was assigned
my first criminal case,

413
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,028
and I was so busy
I was lucky to go home once a week,

414
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:35,198
-but I was proud after solving it.
-I think my ears are bleeding.

415
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,533
-I felt proud of my job.
-He's still doing it.

416
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,202
-And my second case was on
-Gosh.

417
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,287
-May 15th, 2016.
-Jeez, he's still going?

418
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:44,582
-You know, the Teacher's Day murder.
-Oh, gosh, he's here again.

419
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,834
-The culprit insisted it was an accident,
-Shut up!

420
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,586
but the wound seemed off.

421
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:52,131
-The victim was stabbed in the ribs.
-He looks normal, what's with him?

422
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,841
-Hey, hurry up.
-Yes, okay.

423
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,219
-This is as fast as this car goes.
-I interrogated

424
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,639
the culprit for over a week, then…

425
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:05,812
MINAMDANG

426
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,908
Have you gathered the info on Lim Min-jun?

427
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:26,499
Choekang Constructions ran into a problem
three years ago in a bid,

428
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,543
and he was hired as a director

429
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:31,003
under the condition
that he solved the issue.

430
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,881
Did Choekang Constructions contact him?

431
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,592
No. Someone high up gave the order.

432
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,094
I'll look into who it was.

433
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:41,472
You're the vice president.
Don't you have a business to take care of?

434
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,766
Your business is my business.

435
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,643
-Don't you know that?
-Hey.

436
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,938
I don't see Hye-jun.

437
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,107
Who cares where she is?

438
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,568
She said she had a date,
so she dolled up and left.

439
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,069
-Oh, a date.
-Oh, a date.

440
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,666
Honey,

441
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,918
what's all this?

442
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,504
I hope you didn't go
through too much trouble.

443
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,799
Oh, I waited so long for this moment.

444
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,260
Oh,

445
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,847
-I'm so excited.
-Just a minute.

446
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,807
I'll go check on the mic
and the background music.

447
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,434
Okay.

448
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:35,902
What are you doing!

449
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,196
You'd better put me down right now.

450
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,740
Can't you see he's about
to confess his love for me?

451
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,491
No, that's not what he's doing.

452
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,035
Let's go before the situation turns ugly.

453
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,412
No, I'm not going.

454
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:48,998
Stop getting in the way of my love life
and get lost.

455
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,416
This is a thriller with a twist.

456
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:52,585
-And it might turn into a horror movie.
-Yes.

457
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,836
What the hell are you…

458
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:57,381
WE GUARANTEE YOUR FUTURE

459
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,427
He's not confessing his love for you.

460
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,388
He's trying to rope you
into a pyramid scheme.

461
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:09,435
Jeez, I wonder
what that idiot's smiling about.

462
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,270
That crazy little…

463
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,232
The smile of a man soon to die.
How philosophical.

464
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:25,076
You son of a bitch!

465
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,380
TODAY'S YES

466
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,843
I hope you choke on your jam and die!

467
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,972
I hope you step on your nephew's Legos,
fall, and bash your head in!

468
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,683
-Let's go.
-I hope your drink burns your throat!

469
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:51,769
I'm going to kill you!

470
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,104
EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

471
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:56,315
Excuse me, have you seen this man?

472
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,692
Oh, Choi?

473
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,610
Oh, he works at our agency.

474
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:02,655
Can you tell me
where he was working this week?

475
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,407
It was in the provinces…

476
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:10,746
I'm Mr. Park's friend's
school friend's brother's friend.

477
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,749
You know, I'm a detective
at Daeun police station, remember?

478
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,668
Oh, yes.

479
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,629
-The detective, right.
-Yes, right.

480
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:22,216
Well, what brings you here?

481
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,594
It's nothing, it's just this thing.
Here it is.

482
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,055
Do you know…

483
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,598
-Oh, Choi?
-Right.

484
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,393
We were worried about him.
Did something happen?

485
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,896
-Well…
-Can you confirm when he was last here?

486
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,108
He worked the night shift two days ago.

487
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,819
It overlaps with the victim's
estimated time of death.

488
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,866
Detective Na, it's me. Choi Yeong-seop
was in Hancheon until last week

489
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,159
and went to Seoul two days ago.

490
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,535
Okay.

491
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,080
What about Mr. Jang? Is he still angry?

492
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,250
No. He's determined to find something
before we go back to Seoul.

493
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,626
That's good.

494
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,628
I'm going to stay at the hospital,

495
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,048
so check his movements
then come back to get rest.

496
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,966
Yes, ma'am!
I'll check on that and go back.

497
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,802
It seems Choi Yeong-seop

498
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,804
has an alibi.

499
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:09,972
Yes, it seems so.

500
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,933
He didn't do it,

501
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,895
at least with the body
found in the sewers.

502
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,193
SINMYEONG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

503
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,905
Of all the people you could have dated,
you just had to meet that guy.

504
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,656
You're such a dummy.

505
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,118
Jeez, you dated a pyramid scheme marketer.
How stupid are you?

506
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:36,207
So, I lie down, pretending
to be Choi Yeong-seop,

507
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,334
and catch Gopuri when he shows up?

508
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,543
-Yes, that's it.
-Okay.

509
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,670
In the meantime, I'll take Choi Yeong-seop

510
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,256
and sneak him to the VIP room
with this dummy.

511
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,884
Oh, she's just naive.
That's why she got fooled again.

512
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,969
-She's not a dummy.
-Naive, my foot.

513
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,679
Damn it!

514
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,433
I told you to stop it.

515
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,358
He'll leave his room
for a test in 20 minutes, so hurry.

516
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,319
-Okay.
-Okay.

517
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,656
I hope we don't run into
a pyramid scheme marketer.

518
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,494
Choi is being moved to the exam room.

519
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,163
Get ready.

520
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,043
NAME: CHOI *-SEOP

521
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,880
I'll put the bed in the waiting room
and distract the police.

522
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:28,384
-Check the name tag before lying down.
-Okay, okay. Don't worry.

523
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,849
Please stay outside
until his test is over.

524
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:43,482
Oh, this is it.

525
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,486
Oh my, this is nice.

526
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,905
Wow, it's so soft and comfy.

527
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,868
Oh, I'm getting sleepy.
I can't fall asleep.

528
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,665
NAME: CHOI * SEOP

529
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:04,170
Where's Kong Su-cheol? Jeez.

530
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:09,216
Hey, Kong Su-cheol. Where are you?
Where are you?

531
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,176
Kong Su-cheol!

532
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,929
What? Where am I?

533
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:17,224
Sir, if you could stay
on your side like that.

534
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:20,853
-Oh, okay.
-You haven't changed into a gown.

535
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,271
I'll just lower your pants.

536
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,482
Why? That's so embarrassing.

537
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,025
-You need to get the test.
-What?

538
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:27,401
You're very tense.

539
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,778
You'll fall asleep in a moment,
so close your eyes.

540
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,197
Wait, what test?

541
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,033
It'll be over soon. It won't take long.

542
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:36,160
What test? Let me go.

543
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,661
Now, Mr. Choi Il-seop,

544
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,914
-we'll begin the test.
-Choi Il-seop?

545
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,875
I think there's been a misunderstanding.
I'm not Choi Il-seop.

546
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,544
I'm the hot barista of Minamdang, Kong Su…

547
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,921
COLONOSCOPY

548
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:48,506
…cheol.

549
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:09,568
Oh, this is it.

550
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,698
NAME: CHOI IL-SEOP

551
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,746
NAME: CHOI YEONG-SEOP

552
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,302
NAME: CHOI YEONG-SEOP

553
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:48,065
-What about the CCTV? Did you install it?
-Check your phone.

554
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,702
Kong Su-cheol. Where on earth have…

555
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:06,667
Mr. Choi Yeong-seop?

556
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,961
I heard your surgery went well yesterday.

557
00:43:09,044 --> 00:43:10,671
Does it hurt anywhere?

558
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,757
You're recovering nicely,

559
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:17,678
so the neurologist won't need
to operate on you. The medication will do.

560
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:18,721
Okay.

561
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,431
-Here's your shot.
-Wait!

562
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,267
I don't need the shot.

563
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:27,479
Oh, Mr. Choi. It's just a sedative.

564
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,940
No, you can't.

565
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,864
I don't see a way out of this,
so I'm just going to tell you the truth.

566
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,157
Okay.

567
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,408
I'm not Choi Yeong-seop.

568
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,746
I'm an undercover detective.

569
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,497
-A detective?
-A detective.

570
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,500
This is all Kong Su-cheol's fault…

571
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,888
Can you tell me how many fingers
I'm holding up, Mr. Choi?

572
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,183
Oh, I'm not Choi Yeong-seop.

573
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,644
And you're holding up three fingers.

574
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:08,479
I'm not Choi Yeong-seop.

575
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:09,813
I'm an undercover

576
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,899
detective. I'm undercover.

577
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:13,901
Okay.

578
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,406
This sometimes happens after surgery.

579
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,159
It's a delirium of sorts.

580
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:23,994
Get the barbiturates.

581
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,038
-Now, hold on to him.
-"Barbie" what?

582
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,123
-Now, lie down. Come on.
-I'm a detective.

583
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,416
-No.
-Flip him over.

584
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,834
Hold on to him tight.

585
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,211
-I'm a detective…
-Now, lie down.

586
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:35,589
-Wait, please. Wait, don't do that.
-This will sting.

587
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,924
-There.
-Ow!

588
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:42,638
Gosh.

589
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,683
Mr. Choi, you'll feel better
after some sleep.

590
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,768
Let's go to the next room.

591
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:52,189
Kong Su-cheol. Darn it. I swear,

592
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,275
I'm going to kill you.

593
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,779
Goodness, what's all this?

594
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,489
Here you go.

595
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,200
Hye-jun said she'll kill me
if the pizza's cold, so hurry.

596
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:06,286
Yes, okay. Call me
if something happens at the cafe.

597
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,163
-Isn't he the barista at Minamdang?
-Thanks.

598
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,706
-No problem.
-Bye.

599
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,338
Those people, I can't believe this.

600
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,259
-Follow me.
-What? Okay.

601
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,680
I feel bad eating without him.

602
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:29,226
But why's he still unconscious?

603
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:32,938
They sedated him
because he was in too much pain.

604
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,314
I see.

605
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,359
-It'll be a while before he wakes up.
-Oh, okay. Right.

606
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,324
Choi Yeong-seop?

607
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:52,791
Nam Han-jun!

608
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,302
Ma'am, calm down.

609
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:11,143
Where's Nam Han-jun?

610
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,314
Well, about that…

611
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,399
We were just

612
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,234
trying to save Mr. Choi.

613
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:23,363
Yes. The spirit wouldn't stop telling
us to switch hospital rooms, so…

614
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,576
Detective Na.
You guard Choi Yeong-seop here.

615
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,121
Gosh, no.

616
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,000
You're dead.

617
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,045
Grumpy's on her way. Run.

618
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:40,506
Oh, jeez.

619
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:43,383
Grumpy's on her way. Run.

620
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,553
Grumpy. Grumpy's on her way.

621
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:48,889
Mr. Nam!

622
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:58,607
Whoa, so pretty.

623
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,278
Wow!

624
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,865
-Goddamn it!
-Wow!

625
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:17,668
-Oh, my.
-What the…

626
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:36,979
Well…

627
00:47:37,062 --> 00:47:39,189
What's wrong with Mr. Nam?

628
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:43,652
Oh, well, I think it's the drugs.

629
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:50,158
-Jeez.
-He'll come.

630
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,119
If he finds out Choi Yeong-seop's alive,

631
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,871
he'll come to kill him.

632
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:59,668
-Jeez. Just knock him out.
-He'll be dead before I do.

633
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,214
Pretty detective.

634
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,009
Did you check Choi Yeong-seop's alibi?

635
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,848
You did. You did!

636
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:19,438
So you know it too.
The real killer's someone else.

637
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,941
He'll be going after Choi Yeong-seop.

638
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,322
I'll pretend to be

639
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:32,075
Choi Yeong-seop and catch the killer,

640
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,745
so you go guard Choi Yeong-seop.

641
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,916
I need to catch the guy
who killed my friend.

642
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,882
No, you just want to prove
that Choi Yeong-seop wasn't the killer.

643
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,223
You said you wanted to believe me.

644
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:59,227
I'll show you that I wasn't wrong.

645
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:02,981
I'll catch the real killer for you.

646
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:08,528
So I'll stay here
and wait for the real killer,

647
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,030
and you go

648
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,658
get Choi Yeong-seop to confess.

649
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:17,204
One of us will succeed. Won't we?

650
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,045
Fine.

651
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,714
But I'll be catching the killer, not you.

652
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,800
If anyone suspicious appears,

653
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:32,469
call me immediately,
no fooling around. Got it?

654
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,388
Yes, pretty detective, ma'am!

655
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,597
Damn it.

656
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:42,312
Oh my, poor Han-jun.
He's completely out of it.

657
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,231
Come on, stay still.

658
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:51,905
You people.

659
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,831
Get it together, Han Jae-hui.

660
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:03,083
You can't let Nam Han-jun mess with you.

661
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,460
That was not a kiss.
That was just an accident.

662
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,421
I'm surprised because it was unexpected.

663
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,756
My heart is not racing
because of Nam Han-jun!

664
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:24,938
Prosecutor Cha.

665
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:27,107
Inspector Han? What are you doing here?

666
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,192
Well, the thing is…

667
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,362
Choi Yeong-seop's in a different room.

668
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:35,574
Mr. Nam's in that room
pretending to be him.

669
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:36,658
What?

670
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,869
Just follow me.

671
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:54,801
Mr. Choi.

672
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:58,013
Hello.

673
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,598
I'm Prosecutor Cha Do-won.

674
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:16,239
CHOI YEONG-SEOP

675
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:22,662
I can't believe Grumpy of all people
saw me high on drugs

676
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,831
and acting like an idiot. Damn it.

677
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,584
Damn, this is so annoying, jeez.

678
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:30,670
Please.

679
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:33,173
Acting like an idiot was the least of it.

680
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,382
Don't you remember?

681
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,357
No way.

682
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,026
Oh, my precious lips.

683
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,737
Oh no, it can't be.

684
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,281
It was an accident. Like a car accident.

685
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:02,994
I think the angle and the timing were
too on the nose to call it an accident.

686
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,330
"Pretty Detective."

687
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,667
Damn it! Stop that right now!

688
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,419
Oh, my head hurts.

689
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,471
Hey, forget what happened yesterday, okay?

690
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,604
Put on the CCTV feed.

691
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:31,690
Okay.

692
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:37,696
Nice timing.

693
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:42,158
Come on,

694
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:44,369
that Grumpy. Jeez.

695
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:47,581
The pretty detective
got rid of the CCTV, right?

696
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:51,543
It's good that the pretty detective
doesn't know about the bug, right?

697
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,878
-Right?
-Right.

698
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:57,424
Stop it! Stop sticking your lips out.

699
00:52:58,508 --> 00:53:00,844
Stop it. Oh, my head.

700
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,556
-Hey, let's listen to the bug.
-Okay.

701
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:13,064
Mr. Choi.

702
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,445
This is Do Jun-ha, the man you killed.

703
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:19,738
Do you recognize him?

704
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,323
Yes.

705
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:25,410
You can't assume he's the killer
when doing an interrogation.

706
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,163
Then

707
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,292
do you recognize this man?

708
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,088
It's Prosecutor Han Jae-jeong.

709
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:40,884
Do you admit to the murder of

710
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:43,595
Prosecutor Han Jae-jeong?

711
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:46,848
I do.

712
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:55,315
Mr. Choi. Someone told me,

713
00:53:55,398 --> 00:54:00,070
you are not the real killer,
you were being used by someone else.

714
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:06,409
Did someone other than you murder
Do Jun-ha

715
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,579
and Prosecutor Han Jae-jeong?

716
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,290
Don't move.

717
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,461
Did you kill him?

718
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:21,257
I think you remember me.

719
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,051
You're right.

720
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:27,931
I'm the officer who arrested you
at the scene of the crime three years ago.

721
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,475
We also met at the crime scene

722
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:33,979
after you were released
from the detention center.

723
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,730
This is my last warning.

724
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,482
Put it down.

725
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:45,073
That phone you were looking for

726
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,368
had a video of Do Jun-ha's murder.

727
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,203
Do you remember?

728
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,165
Where's

729
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:56,418
that phone?

730
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,255
I lost it.

731
00:55:00,338 --> 00:55:02,716
Did you record the murder

732
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,010
of Prosecutor Han as well?

733
00:55:10,849 --> 00:55:11,725
No.

734
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,268
Mr. Choi.

735
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:19,149
Why did you murder Prosecutor Han,
when there wasn't

736
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,943
any enmity between the two of you?

737
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:24,946
Because…

738
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:27,615
NATIONAL JUNIOR JUDO COMPETITION

739
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:36,666
Mr. Choi.

740
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,960
I know you didn't do it.

741
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:41,880
Someone used your grief and anger

742
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,882
at the loss of your daughter.

743
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:46,426
I'm truly sorry that you had to lose

744
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,970
your daughter like that because we failed

745
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,723
to punish her attacker.

746
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:57,687
PENITENTIARY

747
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:00,940
UNKNOWN CALLER ID

748
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,236
-Hello?
-There is a cell phone at the crime scene.

749
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,530
Bring it to the address I sent you.

750
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,991
You'd better move quickly

751
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:12,118
if you want to save Prosecutor Han.

752
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:16,456
Why would you do that to him?
All he did was let me go…

753
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:17,749
Did you forget?

754
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:20,543
You promised
you'd take the blame in return

755
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,837
for my killing your daughter's attacker.

756
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,756
If you don't hold to the terms
of the contract,

757
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:26,716
more people will die.

758
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,846
There was no reason.

759
00:56:33,515 --> 00:56:34,724
I just

760
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,061
killed him.

761
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:47,445
Just?

762
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:51,032
He must not know why.

763
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,328
This is a picture of Ms. Kang Eun-hye
that we found in your apartment.

764
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:57,497
Do Jun-ha,

765
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,708
Han Jae-jeong, and Kang Eun-hye
were all murdered in the same way.

766
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:03,378
Are you going
to confess to her murder too?

767
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,965
Mr. Choi.

768
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,718
We already checked out your alibi.

769
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:14,389
We believe that you didn't kill Ms. Kang,

770
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:16,182
but that you know who did it.

771
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:18,685
Is that correct?

772
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,898
You know better than anyone

773
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:27,444
how Ms. Kang's parents are feeling.

774
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:32,031
So please tell us who killed her.

775
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:33,533
He won't.

776
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:38,413
The killer must have looked like
a savior to Choi Yeong-seop.

777
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:39,664
Mr. Choi.

778
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,251
The killer must have felt
like your savior.

779
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:44,294
What?

780
00:57:45,336 --> 00:57:47,255
But revenge is just another crime.

781
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:49,048
It can never save you.

782
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:52,051
You are the only one who can

783
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,262
save yourself, Mr. Choi.

784
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:57,348
You know the killer tried to murder you.

785
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,809
We'll protect you,

786
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:01,227
so please don't hesitate

787
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,772
and tell us.

788
00:58:07,901 --> 00:58:11,654
I think Prosecutor Cha has
a lot in common with you.

789
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,490
He does not!

790
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,783
Who are you comparing him to? Jeez.

791
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,203
What's he getting angry for?

792
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:23,625
DOCTOR: LEE JIN-HO, NURSE: LEE JAE-MIN
PAITENT:

793
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,255
Can I help you?

794
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:33,176
I'm here to give Mr. Choi
his antibiotic shot.

795
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:36,513
Check the CCTV in front
of the hospital room, just in case.

796
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:39,933
All right.

797
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:42,060
Let's see.

798
00:58:47,232 --> 00:58:48,399
DIAGNOSIS
BROKEN LEG AND EXCESSIVE BLEEDING

799
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,402
Everything's correct.

800
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:35,154
Gopuri's there.

801
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:39,242
Gopuri, you're dead.

802
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,245
Damn it.

803
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,747
Who are you?

804
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:47,333
Prosecutor Cha,
take the IV out and call a doctor!

805
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:48,543
Hurry!

806
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:55,925
There!

807
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,679
-Gopuri!
-Gosh!

808
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,517
Get him!

809
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,561
-Gopuri!
-Hey!

810
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:10,982
Darn.

811
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:15,236
What the…

812
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:21,784
Gosh.

813
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:24,829
Let's split up and look.

814
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,001
Shoot.

815
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:11,084
Gopuri, you bastard.

816
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:22,261
EPILOGUE

817
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,722
COMFORT FUNERAL HALL

818
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,108
You shameless bastard.

819
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:36,734
How dare you come here?

820
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,611
Don't you know why Prosecutor Han died?

821
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,739
You said Choi Yeong-seop should go free,

822
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,950
that he didn't do it, and he murdered him.

823
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,243
He didn't do it.

824
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:46,369
What?

825
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:48,204
Why you…

826
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:55,962
I'd like to talk to you.

827
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:59,507
I'm Cha Do-won, the prosecutor in charge
of Prosecutor Han Jae-jeong's case.

828
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,344
Choi Yeong-seop
didn't kill Prosecutor Han.

829
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:08,349
I saw it.
The burn scar on the killer's arm.

830
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:44,343
I'm sorry.

831
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,721
I apologize for having
ignored your opinion.

832
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:48,389
Gopuri…

833
01:02:48,473 --> 01:02:51,684
I guess Mr. Nam Han-jun was
the only one who saw through everything.

834
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:53,728
The killer felt remorse
and affection toward the victim.

835
01:02:53,811 --> 01:02:55,438
She must have done something to reach him.

836
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:57,732
Which company did Eun-hye get into?

837
01:02:57,815 --> 01:03:00,401
-Joyce Entertainment.
-Also known as "Pain in the Ass."

838
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:04,197
-He's a typical idiot conglomerate heir.
-Lieutenant Nam.

839
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:05,948
He's that cop from three years ago.

840
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:07,784
I should go see her.

841
01:03:07,867 --> 01:03:11,037
Kang Eun-hye is the key
to solving this case.

842
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:16,125
