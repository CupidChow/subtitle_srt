1
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:40,749
Gu Tae-su.

2
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,419
Who knew you'd walk in here
of your own free will?

3
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,588
-What are you playing at?
-Mr. Gu.

4
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,423
Are you here to turn yourself in?

5
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:51,593
I'm here to make a report.
The man in question is right there.

6
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,429
I went to see Jeon Gyeong-cheol,

7
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,222
but he suddenly attacked me,

8
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:57,849
so I ran.

9
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,853
What on earth is he…

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,898
Are you trying to make me a suspect?

11
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:07,984
His left arm.

12
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,362
There's a scratch mark on his wrist.
Go and check.

13
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,200
Let me take a look.

14
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,622
I was burned while fighting him.

15
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,876
But seeing as how he attacked me
thinking that I was the killer,

16
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,962
I guess there was a misunderstanding.

17
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,803
You should have given up then.

18
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:38,139
Then you would have gotten
out of this alive.

19
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,406
You bastard.

20
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,659
-Hey
-Hey.

21
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,828
-Mr. Shaman!
-Mr. Nam!

22
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,080
-Hey.
-What do you think you're doing?

23
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,414
Mr. Nam!

24
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,334
Check his DNA. He's the killer!

25
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,795
What are you doing?

26
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,296
-Damn it!
-Get out.

27
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,506
Gosh.

28
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,508
Are you okay?

29
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,594
Damn it.

30
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,180
EPISODE 10

31
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:21,724
Hey, wait

32
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,938
I asked you to let me
interrogate Gu Tae-su.

33
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,023
Why are you putting me back in the cell?

34
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,900
Then you shouldn't have hit him.

35
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,444
What if Gu Tae-su presses charges?

36
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:38,575
I see, you were trying to protect
Mr. Shaman here, weren't you?

37
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,619
By putting me in a holding cell?

38
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:45,206
Because you might get into trouble
if I let you out of my sight.

39
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,626
My gosh. Damn it.

40
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,253
Do you think I'm a child?

41
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,347
Give this to Su-cheol for me.

42
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,183
Gu Tae-su isn't crazy.
Why would he come here?

43
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,936
He has something
that can get him out of here.

44
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,899
So you punched him

45
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,442
to get his DNA?

46
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,484
Yes.

47
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,988
They fabricated evidence three years ago.

48
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,948
They'll probably do it again.

49
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,701
But we're the police…

50
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,244
Seriously?

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,458
Give it to Su-cheol.
He'll know what to do.

52
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,084
And you absolutely cannot

53
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,086
tell anyone.

54
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,172
Yes, okay.

55
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:41,846
Let's go.

56
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,098
My shoes!

57
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,395
You knew Ms. Kang, didn't you?

58
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,524
She was a trainee at our company.

59
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,277
According to a witness account,

60
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:02,116
Jeon Gyeong-cheol took
a pornographic video of Kang Eun-hye.

61
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,662
-Did you know about this?
-I did not.

62
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:08,873
Then why did you go
to Jeon Gyeong-cheol's office?

63
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,585
How did you two know each other?

64
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,506
He approached me, saying he was interested
in the entertainment business.

65
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,591
He said he wanted
to run a legitimate business,

66
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,301
so I helped him.

67
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,762
Kang Eun-hye and Jeon Gyeong-cheol…

68
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,766
Two people you knew have been murdered.

69
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,270
Did you have a motive
to kill the two of them?

70
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,022
He's here to cooperate
with your investigation,

71
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,316
and you're trying to pin murders on him?

72
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,654
No, we're just leaving all avenues open

73
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,447
as we investigate.

74
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,951
When you have a warrant,
send us a summary of the indictment.

75
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,203
I'll be the one to get back to you.

76
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,956
Let's go now.

77
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,875
It's no use running.

78
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,670
We have a witness who saw you,

79
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,880
and the DNA we got from the crime scene.

80
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,801
If you're innocent
and it's really all a misunderstanding,

81
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,970
let us collect a sample of your DNA.

82
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,805
-I won't let you do that.
-If I do,

83
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,269
will I cease to be a suspect
in the murder of

84
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,104
Kang Eun-hye and Jeon Gyeong-cheol?

85
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,149
Yes.

86
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,445
I give you my consent.

87
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,075
You don't have to worry about Director Gu.

88
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,870
He is a trustworthy man
and will do as he is told.

89
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,999
I've pulled some strings with the police,
so don't worry about them.

90
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,459
We have our people standing by

91
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:38,713
so there's no need to worry even if
the case comes over to us, Mr. Mayor.

92
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,965
SUPREME PRESOCUTORS' OFFICE
ANTI-CORRUPTION CHIEF, NAM PIL-GU

93
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,259
With such reliable supporters
and Auntie Im on my side,

94
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,635
why would I worry?

95
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,928
That's true.

96
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:52,101
Isn't it amazing that she has
the power to overturn an election?

97
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,103
CHAIRMAN OF CHOEKANG INSURANCE
PARK DONG-GI

98
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,982
Of course. That's why everyone here
has such faith in Auntie Im.

99
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:01,360
Now.

100
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,654
May I propose a toast?

101
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:04,655
Of course.

102
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,157
Now!

103
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,456
Drink up.

104
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,261
Congratulations. This is my gift.

105
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,889
I hope you like it.

106
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,601
You are as discerning as ever.

107
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,776
Chairman Park Dong-gi
of Choekang Insurance

108
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:45,279
and Chief Prosecutor Nam Pil-gu
have been meeting to play golf often.

109
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:47,657
What does it have to do
with who's behind Gu?

110
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,908
The two are related.

111
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,494
Lee Tae-sik, Gu Tae-su's lawyer,

112
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,663
worked with Nam when he was in Busan.

113
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,666
Wasn't it the police
who let Jeon Gyeong-cheol go?

114
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:58,751
Lee Tae-sik's cousin is

115
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,711
Assemblyman Park Jeong-hyeon
of the True Conservative party,

116
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,923
and the current police commissioner is
Assemblyman Park's in-law.

117
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:07,760
It's a filthy cartel built on nepotism.

118
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,721
But that's not the point.

119
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:15,101
The point is that everyone here invested
in Joyce Entertainment.

120
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:18,479
And they've been regularly receiving
huge dividends ever since.

121
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,110
Yes, Detective Kim. An assault case.

122
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,611
Where did everyone go?

123
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,749
Retail investors are everywhere.

124
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,962
This is Gu Tae-su's DNA.

125
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:44,589
Run in against the one found
in Choi Yeong-seop's case.

126
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,550
He's bossing me around even
when he's locked up in a holding cell.

127
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,051
Seriously.

128
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,974
Gosh, I wonder
how he's faring in there, though.

129
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:57,185
It's not like it's his first time.
Don't worry.

130
00:07:57,268 --> 00:08:00,229
He is pretty particular.
It's about time he got into trouble.

131
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,439
I know, right?

132
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,983
It'd be weirder
if he doesn't get beaten up.

133
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,068
I'm going to kill you!

134
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,779
You're dead meat. Damn you.

135
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,490
-Darn.
-Seriously!

136
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,742
-Go.
-Let go!

137
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,702
-Stop!
-Darn it.

138
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:17,079
-Let go of me!
-Get in.

139
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,831
Take your shoes off.

140
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,292
-Geez.
-Darn it.

141
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,003
Hey, you! Come here.

142
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,463
Come over here.

143
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:28,883
Jeez. I didn't do anything, so why
are you framing me?

144
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:30,134
"Frame"?

145
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,262
You went around with my brother's wife,
and you say you're framed?

146
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,765
I definitely saw them go
into a hotel together.

147
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,600
Yes, we did go to a hotel.

148
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,060
Because we love each other!

149
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,729
But your brother was having an affair too,

150
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,648
and they were already over.

151
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,650
Damn it. Say that again.

152
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,611
I had an affair with her
and got her the money,

153
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,030
but I didn't kill him, you idiot!

154
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,574
-Hey, damn it.
-Come on!

155
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,452
Jeez, it's freaking loud in here.

156
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,288
Come over here, damn it!

157
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,749
-You little…
-Damn you.

158
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,584
-Come here.
-Hey!

159
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,629
-Stop!
-Damn it.

160
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:13,344
Everyone just please shut up
if you want to find the real killer.

161
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,221
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

162
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,931
Me?

163
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,809
I'm the wonder of Yonghae-dong,

164
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,143
Shaman Nam Han-jun.

165
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:23,813
Hey, shaman.

166
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:26,607
Do you really know who killed my brother?

167
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,573
I call upon the gods of heaven and earth

168
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,575
to tell me who killed

169
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:39,328
this wronged and vengeful spirit.

170
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,248
QUIET

171
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:08,357
He did have an affair
with your brother's wife,

172
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,776
but he didn't kill your brother.

173
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,613
See. I told you it wasn't me.
Honestly, damn it.

174
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,324
If not him, then who was it?

175
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,288
The one who killed your brother

176
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,624
isn't him.

177
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,045
It's him.

178
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,090
-What?
-You little…

179
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,091
What?

180
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,803
No, that's ridiculous. It's nonsense.

181
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,097
Hey, damn it, come here!

182
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,016
Come here.

183
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,727
Damn it, I'm going to kill you
when I catch you.

184
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,494
PRICE TAG HE FORGOT TO REMOVE

185
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,872
He had the sense to buy new clothes
but didn't check his belt?

186
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:05,790
BLOOD SPATTER PATTERN

187
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,834
The spatter pattern is long and narrow…

188
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,295
He must have used
a sharp instrument for the crime.

189
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,924
He's good with the knife
but has a deep cut on his index finger…

190
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,427
He acted out of impulse.

191
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,598
Poor fool.

192
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:26,143
You wield the knife for your boss,

193
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:30,064
but that knife will be the end of you.

194
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,149
-Damn it!
-Let go.

195
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,692
Come on.

196
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:38,364
What the hell are you saying?
This guy's a total fraud.

197
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:40,282
Is it true?

198
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,536
Come on, boss. you believe this fraud?

199
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,162
He didn't mean to.

200
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:50,876
He was trying to stop your brother
from stealing your money

201
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,294
and killed him by accident.

202
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:57,800
He told you about the affair
to throw off suspicion.

203
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:58,884
Why you…

204
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:03,848
I'm sorry.

205
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,893
I was trying to stop him
from running off with your money.

206
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,895
It was an accident. It really was.

207
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,188
My gosh!

208
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,150
-Hey.
-Stop.

209
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,693
Beat him to death!

210
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,528
What are you guys doing? Get in here.

211
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,321
I solved the case,

212
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,365
so hand them over
to the Prosecutors' Office.

213
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:25,286
I want some peace and quiet.

214
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,706
Mr. Shaman.

215
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:32,543
Don't sell your S&H stocks and hold on.
You have to wait it out.

216
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:34,545
How did you…

217
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,881
Gosh, that's…

218
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,720
Hello? Yes, it's me.

219
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,724
What? Lieutenant Han? Why?

220
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:50,394
Right. Yes. I'll deal with it.

221
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,395
Yes.

222
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:56,358
That loan from Sinnam Bank
that I mentioned last time…

223
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,402
Yes.

224
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,824
Why are you investigating it as murder
when you found the suicide note?

225
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,410
And you threatened an innocent citizen
who stepped up to help

226
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,953
and kept him from leaving?

227
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,497
We never threatened him,

228
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,791
and he's not an innocent citizen.
He's a suspect. We even have a witness.

229
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,461
You let Jeon Gyeong-cheol go last time

230
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,630
although he was a suspect.

231
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,591
Like he didn't kick up a big fuss
and forced us to let him go.

232
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:21,842
Hey, you.

233
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,930
Did you get the DNA results?

234
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,556
Yes, well…

235
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,019
Spit it out.

236
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,316
Gu Tae-su's DNA

237
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,653
doesn't match the DNA
found in the Choi Yeong-seop case.

238
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:46,158
That merits disciplinary action,
don't you think?

239
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,744
Lieutenant Han.
As of this moment, you’re suspended.

240
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:49,912
You're off the case.

241
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,081
Come on, Chief.

242
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,041
Aren't you being too hard on her?

243
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:57,836
Too hard? It's you lot
who are being too hard on me!

244
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,715
And Mr. Shaman too.
You had him locked up with no evidence!

245
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,468
That was to protect the witness--

246
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:06,804
Let Gu Tae-su and Mr. Shaman go right now

247
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,807
before I suspend the whole team.

248
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,351
And talk to them
to make sure there's no trouble, okay?

249
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:14,520
Yes, sir.

250
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,358
I really need to quit this job.

251
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,448
If you accuse my client
without evidence again,

252
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,659
we'll sue.

253
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,338
Are we sure the DNA test results
are accurate? If there's been a mistake…

254
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,926
Unless the sample's
been damaged or been switched,

255
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,177
that's not possible.

256
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,555
Detective Kim, Detective Na.

257
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,225
You can tail Gu Tae-su quietly
without him noticing, right?

258
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,061
Yes, ma'am.

259
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,730
DAEUN POLICE STATION

260
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,450
Mr. Gu.

261
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,079
Who are you?

262
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:16,624
I'm Prosecutor Cha Do-won
from the Western DPO.

263
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,500
WESTERN DPO
PROSECUTOR CHA DO-WON

264
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,128
Why is Prosecutor Cha
talking to Gu Tae-su?

265
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:26,967
This must be why
she told us to follow Gu Tae-su.

266
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,848
It's obvious that one of them
outranks the other.

267
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,267
It looks like Mr. Cha
is giving him orders.

268
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,478
Yes, you’re right.

269
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,823
So Prosecutor Cha and Gu Tae-su
are in this together

270
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,158
and he's been lying to us?

271
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:54,244
That's what my gut tells me.

272
00:15:56,872 --> 00:16:00,000
I think we need to
tell Ms. Han and Mr. Jang…

273
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,503
Let's keep an eye on them a little longer.

274
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,220
Wait. Where's Gu Tae-su?

275
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,764
Gosh, we lost him.

276
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,767
DAEUN POLICE STATION

277
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,740
The DNA we found at the scene of
Choi Yeong-seop's murder

278
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,243
didn't match Gu Tae-su's DNA.

279
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,584
Someone in the police
switched the DNA sample.

280
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,545
That's ridiculous!

281
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,172
That's what I want to say

282
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,884
but I'm confused about
whether I should believe you

283
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,011
or the test results.

284
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,392
So what happened to Gu Tae-su?
Did you let him go?

285
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,562
We didn't have the evidence to
hold him any further.

286
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:03,939
That's fine.

287
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,650
I didn't expect it to work anyway.

288
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,987
So how do feel now
that you've been royally screwed?

289
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,749
Next time, it might be your job,

290
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,585
so get it together and give up the case.

291
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,546
I'm already suspended.

292
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,507
Already?

293
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:34,553
If someone in the police switched
the sample like you said,

294
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,765
then you can rule me out
as Gu Tae-su's accomplice,

295
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,850
given that I got suspended
trying to catch him.

296
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,645
So?

297
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,900
Mr. Nam.

298
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,359
Trust me,

299
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,321
so we catch the killer together.

300
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,785
I desperately want to catch the killer.

301
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,420
No, I don't want to.

302
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,506
Why?

303
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,801
You said you wanted to catch him too.

304
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:17,096
Yes, I do. I want to catch him.

305
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,474
I'd team up with the devil himself
if I could catch him by doing that.

306
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,685
But not you.

307
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,689
Have you ever used someone
and stabbed them in the back?

308
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,275
Can you blackmail someone
to get information out of them?

309
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,652
All of that is illegal.

310
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,572
See?

311
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,534
How can I work with you
when you let your sense of justice

312
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,868
get in the way
of catching that demon spawn?

313
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,248
We'll both end up dead. No, thanks.

314
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:59,054
Leave the exciting stuff to me
like bending and breaking the rules,

315
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,306
and just keep being

316
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,518
a good cop as you always have.

317
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,702
-Han-jun.
-Did you get the DNA test results?

318
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,787
Yes. Gu Tae-su, that bastard, is Gopuri.

319
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,582
It matched the DNA sample
found in the Choi Yeong-seop case.

320
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,501
TEST CONCLUDED TO BE A MATCH

321
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,588
It's just like three years ago.
Someone tampered with the evidence.

322
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,716
The Chief has ties to the higher-ups?

323
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,218
I saw him in the holding cell--

324
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,095
Did you throw a fit there too?

325
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:43,473
Did he come because you complained
about how dirty the holding cell was?

326
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:44,683
-I didn't.
-Really?

327
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,811
I worked my magic on the Chief
and he fell for me and--

328
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,062
Did you pull the act there too?

329
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,773
It's like he has an alter ego now.
He's crazy for money.

330
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,609
Would you just listen?

331
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,403
Someone pressured him
to close the case prematurely.

332
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,906
The person behind
Gu Tae-su is powerful enough

333
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,532
to pressure the chief of police?

334
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,702
It was strange that he didn't have
a consistent pattern in his murders.

335
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,163
But what if he's an accessory?

336
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:07,998
It makes sense.

337
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:11,960
So whoever's behind
Gu Tae-su is the real Gopuri?

338
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,337
The guy pulling his strings.

339
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,048
It's him we need to catch.

340
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:19,301
He's connected to the Chief
in some way, I'm sure of it.

341
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,471
The chief was asking to get a loan
approved, so he needs money.

342
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,723
Let's hack his computer.

343
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:28,894
Let's see.

344
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:32,898
Shall we see how careless the Chief is?

345
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,067
You know that thing you're doing…

346
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,401
-Yes.
-Can I try?

347
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:39,738
-Do you want to?
-Yes.

348
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,282
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

349
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,327
-I use my head from time to time too.
-Enter the amount here

350
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,955
and type his phone number
on the top and send it.

351
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:50,999
Was this the Chief's number?

352
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:52,167
All right.

353
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,336
About 100,000 won should do, right?

354
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,963
Okay. One, ten…

355
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,385
One hundred thousand…

356
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,524
10,000,000 WON HAS BEEN
CHARGED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD

357
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:16,733
Ten million won?

358
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,403
That wasn't supposed to happen.

359
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,530
Are you crazy?

360
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,992
This is obviously a scam.

361
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,536
He's the chief of police,
he's not going to click on this.

362
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,621
No. That's even better.

363
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,625
He's the chief, so there must be a reason
why he's so strapped for money.

364
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,128
-Okay.
-You did a good job. Don't worry.

365
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,421
It's okay.

366
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,509
What's this?

367
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:45,595
What? My credit card has been
charged for ten million won?

368
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,889
Ten million won? Jeez.

369
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:53,145
What did he do this time?

370
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:56,315
Come on, what is it?

371
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:03,363
Jeez, I can't believe someone
this gullible is the chief of police.

372
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,282
-Right?
-Hye-jun!

373
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,366
Mr. Nam!

374
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,244
An emergency. It's an emergency.

375
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,454
It's really bad.

376
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:19,880
Mom.

377
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,428
What?

378
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,557
Who…

379
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,229
A pig?

380
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:42,694
By the light of St. Michael
and the Seraphim angels,

381
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:45,322
My Lord,

382
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:51,203
make us worthy to burn
with the fire of perfect charity.

383
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,542
St. Michael the Archangel

384
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,753
and the angels by his side--

385
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,922
Father, can I have a minute?

386
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,841
Mom, I really don't think
this is the answer.

387
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,011
You guys, say something.
Don't just stay quiet!

388
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,097
-My lord!
-My lord.

389
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,556
Brother Han-jun.

390
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,266
You must fight.

391
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,895
May the Lord protect our souls

392
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:19,606
against the snares
and temptations of the devil.

393
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,151
I'll do it.

394
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,362
I'll do the exorcism.

395
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,780
I will

396
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:28,573
but I have a favor.

397
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,992
Please send my mother out.

398
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,955
I've already caused her so much pain.

399
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,750
I can't let her see me like this.

400
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,712
I can't let you suffer on your own.

401
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:44,089
I can't.

402
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,092
My legs…

403
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:08,321
Jesus is in my heart,
and I have never abandoned him.

404
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,573
My Lord.

405
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:14,494
But then why did you become a shaman?

406
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,122
My lord!

407
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:23,420
I dare not tell you
in the presence of my mother.

408
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,598
Mom, let's leave.
I think that'll be better.

409
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,808
-You think so?
-Yes.

410
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,852
Son. I'll always love you

411
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,730
-no matter what you've become.
-Me too, Mom. Wish me luck.

412
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,232
Let's do it. Let's drive the demon out.

413
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,446
Now tell him the truth.

414
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,949
Father. Please, listen to me.

415
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,790
Jeez, for heaven's sake.

416
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:05,462
So you're going to keep doing this

417
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:07,214
until you catch that serial killer?

418
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,591
Well, yes.

419
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,301
Gosh, my legs.

420
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,638
Sit comfortably.
It's not like this is my home.

421
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,431
-Gosh.
-Gosh, my knees.

422
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:19,434
-He's pretty cool.
-Yes, this is killing me.

423
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,853
So until I catch Gopuri, that bastard…

424
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,440
I mean, until I catch Gopuri,

425
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,484
could you keep this
a secret from my mother?

426
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,779
I'll tell her everything
once it's all over.

427
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,241
But what happens after you catch him?

428
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,284
What about your life then?

429
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:41,122
People will remember you as a shaman.

430
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,917
If I'd been worried about that,
I wouldn't have done this.

431
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:48,672
And I’ll probably be enjoying a life
of leisure by then.

432
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,798
I…

433
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,760
make pretty good money.

434
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,346
Yes, he's quite the brutal businessman.

435
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,266
-Father--
-Get away from me!

436
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,143
I'm sorry, brother.

437
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,438
How do you get rid of
evil bosses, not evil spirits?

438
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:07,482
Gosh.

439
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,653
You're embarrassing us in front of Father.

440
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,364
See, this is my life.

441
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:28,461
Father, do you really think it's okay
for us to leave him like this?

442
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:32,007
I've prayed to God, and he told me
that Mr. Nam will come back to us soon,

443
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,259
and that we shouldn't worry and wait.

444
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,763
I have faith.

445
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,226
Mom.

446
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,853
Don't worry too much.

447
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,397
If praying doesn't work,
I'll go see Father again

448
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,732
and ask for an exorcism.

449
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,610
Okay, Son, I believe in you.

450
00:26:56,114 --> 00:27:00,076
Brother, I pray for your family's peace.

451
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,413
-Let's go, Father.
-Yes.

452
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:06,374
-I'll see them off.
-Okay.

453
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,294
Mom. Please, call next time, okay?

454
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,670
Okay.

455
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:11,880
I love you.

456
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,267
Lieutenant Han!

457
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:25,935
I found it.

458
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,854
I found something.

459
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,315
Mr. Jang, take a breath first.

460
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,401
What is it that you came
all the way here at this hour?

461
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,654
Mr. Shaman. No, wait.

462
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,990
-Mr. Shaman's case…
-Ms. Han!

463
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,244
You're here too, Detective Jang.

464
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,163
Why are you here?

465
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,289
Well, I…

466
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,124
What?

467
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:50,877
Knowing you have a rival
must have spurred you on.

468
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,420
No, that's not it.

469
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,756
I think I found something.

470
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:59,928
I think I found…

471
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:06,434
Why don't we head inside first?

472
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,645
Let's have a cup of hot tea while we talk.

473
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,440
-Shall we?
-You can't just go to a lady's house…

474
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,360
That's not polite…
I'll excuse myself then.

475
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,613
Do you have tea
made with flowers from Jirisan?

476
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,532
I can't drink anything cheap.

477
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,409
Let's talk when we're all inside.

478
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,619
He must have quite an expensive taste.

479
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:36,423
The forensic specialist who testified

480
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:39,592
that he was bribed in Mr. Shaman's trial

481
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:43,012
recently confessed
that he had given false testimony.

482
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,890
But they said
they couldn't trust his words

483
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,642
because he'd recanted his testimony

484
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,103
and turned him away.

485
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,191
But that alone isn't…

486
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,694
That's why I dug deeper

487
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,196
and found what he said when he confessed.

488
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:05,368
He said it was Jung Cheong-gi,
not Nam Han-jun

489
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,203
who told him to switch the evidence.

490
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,247
Jung Cheong-gi…

491
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,128
DAEUN POLICE STATION

492
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,629
WRITTEN RECORD OF STATEMENT

493
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,757
If that's true,

494
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,508
then Mr. Nam was framed.

495
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,801
Yes.

496
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,511
And Mr. Nam's target

497
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,264
wasn't Shin Gyeong-ho, but Jung Cheong-gi.

498
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:29,601
HE TOLD ME TO LIE AND TESTIFY
THAT INSPECTOR NAM HAN-JUN BRIBED ME

499
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:33,605
Mr. Shaman found out
that Jung Cheong-gi tampered

500
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:38,276
with the Shin Gyeong-ho case too

501
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,736
and caught them together.

502
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:45,784
The results from the DNA test Mr. Nam
requested will make things more certain.

503
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,329
DNA? Whose DNA?

504
00:29:49,412 --> 00:29:52,373
Today, Mr. Shaman punched Gu Tae-su
in the face

505
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,501
and got his DNA.

506
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:56,419
I see.

507
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:00,882
I think I might know the result too.

508
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,550
What?

509
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,682
Hey, where are you?

510
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:13,645
It's been hours since I gave you
the order to follow Gu Tae-su…

511
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,730
Wait, what?

512
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,898
Where?

513
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:24,030
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Thank you.

514
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,198
Gosh.

515
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:29,744
I can't believe you suspected me
and followed me this whole time.

516
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,625
It's obvious that one of them
outranks the other.

517
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,509
How much is that cup?

518
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,219
I need it for an investigation.

519
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,137
I'm hurt.

520
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,809
I had no idea you were gathering
a DNA sample from Gu Tae-su.

521
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,143
I'm sorry, sir.

522
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:57,397
I'm glad that's been sorted out.

523
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,400
But wait.

524
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:06,114
Doesn't this mean
Mr. Shaman was right about everything?

525
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:10,952
Mr. Nam served time because he was framed.

526
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,080
And he got possessed by ghosts there.

527
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,375
Poor Mr. Shaman.

528
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,713
Let's keep this to ourselves

529
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,549
until this case is over, just in case.

530
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:25,675
Of course.

531
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,969
Okay.

532
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:36,853
GOING TO JIRISAN TO PRAY

533
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,580
This cream. I can never get sick of it.

534
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,335
Can you do this?

535
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,255
Please. You don't think I can do that?

536
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,468
I can fit another one.

537
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,220
So can I.

538
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,723
Gosh.

539
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,392
You greedy pigs.

540
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,687
Are you working on the tasks I gave you?

541
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,940
Tell him you are, even if you haven't.

542
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:25,443
Yes, I did. I found it.

543
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,320
You're dead if you're lying.

544
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,865
I'm telling the truth. You were right.

545
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,660
The Chief was being blackmailed over
his son's gambling debt.

546
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,870
So that's why he needed money so urgently.

547
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,711
Don't eat that.

548
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,381
Nam Hye-jun. Hey!

549
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,883
That little…

550
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,511
Jeez.

551
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,306
You bastards.

552
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,976
He borrowed 30 million won.

553
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,353
Why does he need to pay
100 million in interest?

554
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,981
What? A text?

555
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,651
WANT ME TO CUT YOUR SON'S HAND OFF?

556
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,653
Hey!

557
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,321
Hey, don't do it.

558
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:14,242
I don't have any money to spare right now.

559
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,745
Everyone does it,
so why go against the flow?

560
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,706
Why won't you cooperate?

561
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,874
-Cooperate?
-What? Don't play innocent with me.

562
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,293
I told you to give me the info
on gambling crackdowns.

563
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:27,547
Just give me the information now

564
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:30,216
and I'll send your son home alive.

565
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:33,428
Or I don't know what I might do.
I'm going to start cutting wherever.

566
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,514
Dad, help me!

567
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:39,017
I'll never gamble again!

568
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,436
Anyway, call me when you've decided.

569
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,937
Don't keep me waiting.

570
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,690
Hey. Don’t hang up.

571
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,109
Hey!

572
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,197
My gosh.

573
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,034
I can't believe this.

574
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,496
-My goodness!
-What?

575
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,123
Goodness me!

576
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,208
-I'm dying here.
-What do we do?

577
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,085
-This is killing me!
-My gosh!

578
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,838
Mr. Shaman. What are you doing here?

579
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,506
-Are you okay?
-No, I'm not!

580
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,759
He's not okay. Not okay at all.

581
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,803
I was so preoccupied
that I didn't see you.

582
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,847
I'm so sorry.

583
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,975
Do you think an apology is going
to make this all go away?

584
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,852
No, it's not his fault.

585
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:23,811
What?

586
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:27,065
I was listening to the spirits
and wasn't looking.

587
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:30,860
I was passing by when I heard
someone scream,

588
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:34,322
"Help me, Dad! I'll never gamble again!"

589
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,449
Oh, gosh, please.

590
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:39,660
Mr. Shaman. Please, help my son.

591
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,915
-What?
-It's my son.

592
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:48,002
He's been taken by this terrible fiend.
What should I do?

593
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:54,884
Goodness. So that was why
I heard this old woman ask me for help.

594
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,636
Mom!

595
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,971
Mom!

596
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,973
What? You want me to help him?

597
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,601
Mother!

598
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:07,647
-Mom, please, help me.
-Well, I'm willing to help but…

599
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,570
-I have a condition.
-What is it?

600
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,573
Whatever it is,
just say it and I'll do it.

601
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:24,122
What's this place supposed to be?
A cult headquarters or a gambling house?

602
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:27,792
I guess they're not that different
since they both scam people.

603
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,795
What about Na-dan, is he in?

604
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,964
Yes, he is. I'll share the video.

605
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,857
-Give it.
-Come on.

606
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,526
-Gosh.
-Deal me a good hand.

607
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,611
Damn it. What's wrong with me today?

608
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,155
Darn it.

609
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,742
The guy with the mustache,
that's Dae-tong.

610
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,494
Can you stick it on his table?

611
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,584
Your Jjajangmyeon's here.

612
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:25,016
So that's why they
blocked off the signals.

613
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,977
The hwatu cards have ID chips in them.

614
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:31,397
The yuppie has three-ggeut,
and Dr. No has a four-pair.

615
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:35,318
Gosh. They tell him what cards
the others have on an app,

616
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,652
so he always wins.

617
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,155
I've got an idea of their system,
so come out.

618
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,323
Enjoy.

619
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:44,869
You're new. Who are you?

620
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,290
The boss is sick, so I came instead.

621
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,627
Too bad. I hope he gets better soon.

622
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,254
You're dead if you go blabbing
about this place, okay?

623
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:58,132
These are very important people.

624
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,344
Run your mouth and I'm going to
kill you with this just like that!

625
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,973
-Go on.
-Yes, sir.

626
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,059
Wait, kiddo. Come here.

627
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,104
Here's some pocket money.

628
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,522
There.

629
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,900
-Take it, you idiot.
-Yes, sir.

630
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,443
Thank you!

631
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,032
How about we show our hands?

632
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,621
Gosh, I'm shaking.

633
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,498
The guy with the ax is freaking scary.

634
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,793
-You did well.
-Nice job.

635
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,711
Give me triple the amount
you usually pay me.

636
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,007
What are you teaching him?

637
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,551
Here. Triple.

638
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,889
I was tipped as well.

639
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:48,766
-Good for you.
-Hey, give that back.

640
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,060
I'll be off then.

641
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,521
CHURCH OF THE OMNIPOTENT GOD

642
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,856
Grandma, is there anything you want?

643
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:59,402
He's so good to his grandma.

644
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,782
Wait for me!

645
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:08,411
Why do you always go off on your own?
Do I embarrass you?

646
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,162
-Yes. A lot.
-What?

647
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,999
Sometimes I think about
how I'd like to go places on my own.

648
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,375
Same here.

649
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,633
Damn it, why are you running?
The customers will be nervous.

650
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,178
A shaman?

651
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,848
A shaman? Not the police?

652
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,641
What's going on?

653
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,601
I won!

654
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:37,231
-The spirit must be helping him.
-Of course.

655
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,942
There.

656
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:44,030
Gosh, the guy on the left is out of luck.
He's got one-ggeut.

657
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,866
And the one in the middle…
He's got a seven-pair.

658
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,327
The one next to him has eight-ggeut.

659
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:53,372
I can see it.

660
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,208
I can see your cards.

661
00:38:56,292 --> 00:39:00,212
Just fold. What's the point of racking
your brain when you have only one-ggeut?

662
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,592
I fold.

663
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,013
How can you be gambling
when your wife's sick?

664
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,598
How did you know that?

665
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:13,100
That poor wife of yours.

666
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,188
I'm telling you this
because I feel bad for your wife.

667
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:20,775
He's got better cards than you.
Just fold and get out of here!

668
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,235
I fold.

669
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:28,783
Well, I can see you
have a higher hand, but…

670
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,994
Just fold.

671
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,163
No, let's just get this over with.

672
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,749
-All in.
-What?

673
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,918
-All that money?
-What does he have?

674
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,045
If he's that confident,
they're all done for.

675
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,923
You can put up a fight with
that seven-pair you have,

676
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,633
but you can't win against me.

677
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,223
I fold.

678
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:55,142
-What?
-He was right!

679
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,479
I can see it!

680
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:02,775
The police are coming!

681
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,695
Hey, shaman!

682
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,409
Did you call the police?

683
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:15,996
No. The spirit is telling me
that the police will be here soon

684
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,499
because of him over there.

685
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,750
Are you punks messing with me?

686
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,210
"Punks"?

687
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:24,213
Where are your manners? We only just met.

688
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,927
A card shark who's possessed by a spirit?

689
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,430
This is interesting.

690
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,683
Actually…

691
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,227
I find you more interesting.

692
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:41,522
They call you Dae-tong because
you get lucky whatever business you run.

693
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:45,276
Your luck against my powers.

694
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:46,610
How about a match?

695
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,903
You little…

696
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,780
Stop right there, or I'll…

697
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,158
-Watch it.
-Leave him, you idiot.

698
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,953
I told you to leave him be.
Where do you get your hair done?

699
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,122
-At home.
-I told you to go to a hairdresser.

700
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,626
We wouldn't want to ruin your outfit
by getting blood on it.

701
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,337
Leave your winnings here
and get lost while I'm being nice.

702
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,922
What's keeping you guys?

703
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:10,468
Hey, what's this?

704
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,471
-When did you get caught?
-Su-cheol. Boss.

705
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:16,307
Come here.

706
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,604
I was scared because
I thought you were the police.

707
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:24,857
A shaman?

708
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,568
I hope you're prepared
to lose a hand or two,

709
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,070
pulling tricks in my territory.

710
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,115
Are you all ready?

711
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:39,663
Of course I'd love
to play fair and square.

712
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:40,789
But…

713
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,295
Look.

714
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:53,260
Who knew the great Dae-tong
would pull a cheap trick like this?

715
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,055
Well, I did hear

716
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,850
even the criminal world has its rules.

717
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:01,685
Are you crazy?

718
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,271
How are you guys going to win
against a sharper?

719
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,856
You must have a death wish.

720
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,610
How is it cheating to use
your opponent's tricks to your advantage?

721
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:10,986
You little…

722
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,238
Damn it.

723
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,573
There.

724
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,660
All right.

725
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,870
Let's you and I…

726
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,372
Where in Chungnam are you from?

727
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:22,957
-Byeongcheon.
-Do you know Sonagi?

728
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,542
-No, I don't.
-All right.

729
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,379
Let's duke it out fair and square.

730
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:31,882
If I win, I cut off both your hands.

731
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,134
And if you win,

732
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:36,095
I'll let you walk out of here alive.

733
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,763
The terms are good, right?

734
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,932
I'm great at making deals.

735
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:42,393
I think they're getting the better deal.

736
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,271
That's true, but…

737
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:49,024
You don't like it? Want to renegotiate?

738
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:54,488
I'll take it. But if I win,
I take that guy over there.

739
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,074
I need him for my business.

740
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,996
You're funny, aren't you?

741
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,081
All right.

742
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:07,751
Let's see which is stronger,
my luck or your psychic powers.

743
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:13,215
Hey, maybe I should just call the police.

744
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,718
Then we'll be arrested with them.

745
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,053
I'll send you a signal
if things get bad, so wait.

746
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:22,641
Damn it, what is wrong with you?

747
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,644
I haven't had
such an interesting game in a while.

748
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,687
Wait.

749
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,106
Hold on. Sir.

750
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,483
Here.

751
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,444
It's not that we don't believe you.

752
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:36,864
-Let's keep this fair, just in case.
-All right.

753
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,283
Take your pick. Which one?

754
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:43,912
Here.

755
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:52,630
Don't pull a fast one
with that card under your wrist.

756
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,551
I thought I'd pull a little trick,
but you got me.

757
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,804
-Jeez.
-Are you two both shamans?

758
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,097
All right.

759
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,142
Let's play fair from now on.

760
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:15,527
I've got a pair on my first round.
Good, I've got great odds.

761
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,156
Ten million won.

762
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,493
-Fold.
-Fold? Okay.

763
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:25,704
Why's he folding?

764
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:31,168
Damn it.

765
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,089
He’s bluffing.

766
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,758
-Ten million.
-I call your ten

767
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,760
and raise you another 20.

768
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,264
Fold.

769
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:51,063
A nine-pair? Nice.

770
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:52,898
Twenty million.

771
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,275
I thought I was lucky,

772
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,903
but your powers
really are something. Fold.

773
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:02,574
Hey.

774
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:06,954
Why do I get the feeling
that Mr. Shaman is losing?

775
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,457
Gosh, my back.

776
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,088
That fucking idiot.

777
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:17,714
I've got a bad back.

778
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:28,976
You're dead.

779
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,812
Goodness.

780
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,730
Fifty million.

781
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:36,024
I call your 50 million…

782
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:41,071
and raise you 100 million.

783
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,407
-Han-jun.
-It's okay.

784
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:50,080
Is the great Dae-tong scared?

785
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,837
Fucking asshole. I'm scared?

786
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,423
I call your 100 million
and raise you another 500.

787
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,523
Now, match me if you can.

788
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:23,030
You've got some balls.

789
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,240
But I'm not falling for it.

790
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:28,285
I can see it in your eyes.

791
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,793
What now? Your hands are mine now.

792
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:43,967
I've got a ten-pair.

793
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:52,017
Come on, boys. Hold his arms down.

794
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,112
I've got a three-eight gwang-pair,
you fool.

795
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:09,535
I knew you could do it.

796
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:11,662
You didn't think I could do it, did you?

797
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:14,540
You goddamn cheater! I saw it myself.

798
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,166
He had a two-eight mangtong.

799
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:18,502
-I saw a bird on the card!
-What are you doing?

800
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:21,421
-I'm fine.
-What do you think you're pulling here?

801
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:27,928
When you said "bird,"
were you talking about this?

802
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,144
You were the one cheating.

803
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:39,898
All I did was to show this to the man
who was telling you my hand.

804
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,901
What now? Are you going to throw a fit

805
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,903
by taking my money
and cutting my hands off?

806
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,531
Then word will get around

807
00:47:47,614 --> 00:47:52,411
that the great Dae-tong
was actually a cheater.

808
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,453
-That's right.
-Or…

809
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,582
we can resolve this

810
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,001
in a nice, friendly, and happy manner.

811
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:02,462
I take him and disappear,

812
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,257
and you take my winnings
instead of the money he owes you,

813
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:08,093
thus preventing such rumors
and keeping your business intact.

814
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,094
How about it?

815
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,014
-I make great deals, right?
-You're exceptional.

816
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,435
I have a question.

817
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,854
How did you know
he was sending me signals?

818
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:20,772
Oh, that?

819
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:25,319
A nine-pair? Nice.

820
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,571
Your powers really are something.

821
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:28,989
Fold.

822
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:30,657
Dae-tong's reading my hand.

823
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:35,454
He can't use his tricks
and the rigged cards are out,

824
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,748
yet he’s reading my hand
at crucial moments.

825
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,918
That means someone is telling him my hand.

826
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,296
Who could it be?

827
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:46,798
One of those guys has
to be sending him signals.

828
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,885
I have to find him and use him
to my own advantage.

829
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,641
Right. I've found him!

830
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:00,062
Gosh, my back.
Maybe I've been sitting down for too long.

831
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,773
Gosh, you klutz.

832
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:05,067
Su-cheol. Do you see that guy on my left?

833
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,070
Do exactly what he's doing and show me.

834
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:10,030
7-PAIR

835
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,700
My gosh.

836
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,660
1-GGEUT

837
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,370
1-GGEUT

838
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,626
Some clairvoyance you've got.

839
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,545
You're good.

840
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,883
Take him and get out of my sight

841
00:49:29,966 --> 00:49:32,094
before I change my mind. Got it?

842
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,555
Hey, are you crying?

843
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:38,809
My tear ducts are malfunctioning.
It must be my age.

844
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:41,353
-Let's go!
-Okay.

845
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,773
What are you doing, you idiots? Hurry up!

846
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:50,278
And if you have any questions,
come to Minamdang!

847
00:49:50,362 --> 00:49:52,030
It's at 150 Yonghae-ro.

848
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,198
Let's go.

849
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:57,035
What do you think you're doing?
Get over here, right now!

850
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,037
You idiots!

851
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:03,041
You messed up big time, you fuckers!

852
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,877
That was a fucking embarrassment,
you dickheads.

853
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:17,013
How can you eat after all that?

854
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,557
Damn it, I could just…

855
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,145
Sir.

856
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:26,648
Thank you for saving my idiot son.

857
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,109
This isn't much, but…

858
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,363
it's a token of my gratitude.

859
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:36,992
You're mistaken if you think
you can win me over with this!

860
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,498
What the…

861
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,878
THANK YOU FOR YOUR GENEROSITY
FROM DAEUN POLICE CHIEF, KIM CHEOL-GEUN

862
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,256
I wouldn't have thought this of you.

863
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,216
Never mind!

864
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,262
Next time, pay me with cash.
For the good of the world.

865
00:50:57,345 --> 00:51:00,265
What do you mean by next time?

866
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,726
I don't think we'll be seeing--

867
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:06,062
We'll keep seeing each other.
You have three disasters coming this year.

868
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,357
And they're not just any disasters.

869
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:12,652
They're life-or-death situations

870
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:14,446
and there's three of them.

871
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:16,740
What should I do?

872
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:20,202
I'll do anything you tell me to.
Please, help me.

873
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:24,998
You can't ward off major disasters
with talismans. You need something bigger.

874
00:51:25,081 --> 00:51:26,917
Money? How much?

875
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,543
-There.
-Ask him.

876
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,628
Not money!

877
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:31,213
-A person.
-A person?

878
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,423
A human sacrifice.
Someone to ward off your misfortune!

879
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:35,634
A person.

880
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:39,095
Lucky for you, you do have
someone near you who can

881
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,806
ward off your misfortune.

882
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,891
Who is it?

883
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,604
Han Jae-hui of the Major Crimes
Investigation Division Seven.

884
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,648
Come on.

885
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:53,735
What? You're going to die
before your time without her.

886
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,320
Before my time?

887
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:59,074
Give Ms. Han back
the case you took from her.

888
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:02,702
If you don't,
that case will act as a conduit

889
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,788
for ghosts to haunt you.

890
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,666
They will be vicious.

891
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:16,591
What exactly did
Jung Cheong-gi tell you to do?

892
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,971
He told me to switch
the killer's DNA sample

893
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,723
that we collected from the scene

894
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,893
of Prosecutor Han's murder
for Choi Yeong-seop's,

895
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,812
and to lie that Inspector Nam bribed me.

896
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,274
Why did you confess?

897
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,986
I've never had
a good night's sleep since that day.

898
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,488
I did it to pay
for my mother's hospital bills,

899
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,240
but I shouldn't have.

900
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:42,993
I couldn't take doing his bidding anymore,

901
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:44,995
so I quit the force and came clean
to the Prosecutor's Office,

902
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,788
but they were in on it too.

903
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:14,524
I've been to see Mr. Gu Jong-man.

904
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,527
The man who actually killed
Prosecutor Han…

905
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:18,820
Where is his DNA sample now?

906
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,782
Do you think I'd be alive right now

907
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,702
if I still had it?

908
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:28,830
I got rid of it a long time ago,
that's how I'm still breathing.

909
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:31,541
The man who told you
to frame Mr. Nam and Mr. Gong

910
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,919
is in the police, right?

911
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:37,631
I thought about why
Mr. Gu went to the Prosecution

912
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:38,924
and there was only one answer.

913
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:42,552
There's someone higher ranked
than you in the force.

914
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,054
Am I wrong?

915
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:47,766
So what? What difference does it make?

916
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:51,811
That high-ranking man
has already kicked the bucket.

917
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,482
Are you afraid that
it might happen to you too?

918
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,652
Do you think you'll be safe
if you keep your mouth shut?

919
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:01,738
Just tell us everything
and apply for witness protection.

920
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:05,116
That's how you can stop them
from coming after you.

921
00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:12,415
I'll wind up dead
in a ditch somewhere if I did that.

922
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:15,543
I will never let that happen. I promise.

923
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:20,757
Gosh.

924
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:25,095
Call me if you make up your mind.

925
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:27,889
I promise that I'll protect you.

926
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,406
This is the first time I've heard that.

927
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:46,032
I'm sorry I can't be of help.

928
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:50,036
Mr. Gu doesn't seem to know anything
about who's behind this.

929
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,956
I don't think Jung Cheong-gi
is going to crack either.

930
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,295
Yes, Mr. Jang.

931
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,380
Lieutenant Han.

932
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,841
Come to the station right now.
The Chief's looking for you.

933
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:04,926
Okay.

934
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,849
Do you think he knows
that we've been doing this?

935
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,394
We'll have to see.

936
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:26,072
So you want me to take back
the Gu Tae-su case?

937
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:28,158
Yes, I told you.

938
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:33,038
And make sure your team stays quiet,
so the word doesn't get out.

939
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:35,582
You have to be
the one to work on the case.

940
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,376
You can't let anyone else do it.
Never. Got it?

941
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,461
But…

942
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:41,671
you suspended me.

943
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:45,717
Oh, that? I was just trying to scare you!

944
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:49,220
But can I ask you a question, though?

945
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,388
Don't!

946
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:54,893
Why do you want me to investigate it
in secret and not officially?

947
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:57,228
Because it'd look bad.

948
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,064
I'm the Chief of Police.

949
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:02,692
I can't just go changing
my mind willy-nilly.

950
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,694
How would that affect my authority?

951
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,906
That's not a great picture.
Do I have to spell it out for you?

952
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:10,867
Goodness. Mr. Shaman.

953
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:13,328
I was careless.

954
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:18,458
You think Mr. Nam persuaded the Chief?

955
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,168
But how?

956
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,839
I'm not so sure.

957
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,558
I've never seen you
smile like that before.

958
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:36,976
What?

959
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,313
Mr. Nam isn't the one
who's there for you at your side,

960
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:44,818
but it looks like you rely on him
more than me these days.

961
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:45,860
I'm a little hurt.

962
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,612
It's not like that…

963
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:54,369
To tell you the truth,
I didn't understand him before.

964
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:57,831
I kept going over to see him,
so he could at least make his excuses,

965
00:56:58,414 --> 00:56:59,791
but he didn't even let me see him.

966
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:04,963
So I got disappointed and resented him.
I had a grudge against him.

967
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:08,800
I thought Jae-jeong and I were
terrible judges of character.

968
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:10,844
That must have been because

969
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:14,013
he didn't want to involve you
when you were Prosecutor Han's sister.

970
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:17,976
Yes.

971
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,855
I understand now,

972
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:26,693
so I feel bad about how I resented him.

973
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:30,321
I can't help but sympathize
with the pain he must have endured alone.

974
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:35,702
So I can't help but think about him and…

975
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,956
That I'll fail to protect them again.

976
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,834
I might endanger the people I love again.

977
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:45,879
I feel so scared about that.

978
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,426
I mean,

979
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:56,431
I want to be there for him, by his side.

980
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:01,686
I get it.

981
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:05,398
Let's catch the killer
and clear Mr. Nam's name.

982
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,610
Then you can put him out of your mind.

983
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,487
No.

984
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,363
I don't want him

985
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,117
to fight alone anymore.

986
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:20,872
I think I need to go see Mr. Nam.

987
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,166
Don't go, Ms. Han.

988
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,168
What I meant was…

989
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:30,882
That might put all of us in danger.

990
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,259
I know.

991
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,678
But that's my job.

992
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:40,517
He's a citizen who's been wronged,

993
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,353
and I'm a detective
whose job is to protect people like him.

994
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:04,541
Leave the exciting stuff to me
like bending and breaking the rules,

995
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:08,545
and just keep being
a good cop as you always have.

996
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:17,011
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

997
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:20,223
GOPURI, KANG EUN-HYE, HAN JAE-JEONG

998
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:23,810
Everyone who might
know something are all dead.

999
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:24,936
Yes.

1000
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,315
You got the case back to Ms. Han,
so what's our next move?

1001
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,485
We take the bull by the horns.

1002
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:36,155
We'll use Park Jin-sang
to get to Chairman Park Dong-gi.

1003
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:40,368
Park Dong-gi the chairman
of Choekang Insurance?

1004
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,455
I already got it all on camera.

1005
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,042
Hye-jun. We need to go to the café.

1006
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:49,919
Yes, I want coffee.

1007
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,629
-Yes, right.
-Okay.

1008
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,548
My goodness.

1009
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:56,301
Good luck. Cheers.

1010
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,177
Those idiots…

1011
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,811
Can we talk?

1012
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:08,771
I don't have anything to say to you.

1013
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,067
But I do.

1014
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,945
Why? Are you going to arrest me again?

1015
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,072
You just can't leave me be, can you?

1016
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:19,324
Mr. Nam.

1017
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:21,743
Let's catch the killer together.

1018
01:00:22,493 --> 01:00:26,414
I want to join you.
No more rules or procedures.

1019
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,876
I'm pretty good
at bending and breaking the rules too.

1020
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:33,046
So, let's work together.

1021
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,172
No.

1022
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,592
I don't want you using me.

1023
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,429
If you don't cooperate
with the investigation,

1024
01:00:43,389 --> 01:00:47,393
I'll arrest you for illegally gathering
personal information

1025
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:51,814
and for concealing evidence.

1026
01:00:54,817 --> 01:00:55,777
Are you kidding me?

1027
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,071
Fine. Arrest me!

1028
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:00,657
I've got nothing to lose!

1029
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:01,824
Here!

1030
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:07,038
Hey, are you really arresting me?

1031
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,626
Mr. Nam.

1032
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:13,753
Stop running away.

1033
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,838
When did I do that?

1034
01:01:16,464 --> 01:01:19,175
I'm not running.

1035
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:21,427
Come on, take this off. It hurts.

1036
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,970
Prosecutor Han Jae-jeong

1037
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:25,640
was your best friend, wasn't he?

1038
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:28,142
You're pretending to be a shaman

1039
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:30,561
to catch the man who framed you

1040
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:32,063
and killed your friend.

1041
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,023
Who are you?

1042
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:37,276
Who are you to bring up Jae-jeong?

1043
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,320
I'm…

1044
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:44,367
Han Jae-jeong's sister.

1045
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,169
Let's work together

1046
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,754
to catch my brother's killer

1047
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:06,514
EPILOGUE

1048
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:08,558
I heard Director Gu was
still at the station.

1049
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,476
Why haven't you handled this already?

1050
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,355
-What's Division Seven's problem?
-Lieutenant Han? Why?

1051
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:18,151
You've made things very awkward
for me, Chief Kim.

1052
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:59,525
Cooperation? I refuse.

1053
01:02:59,609 --> 01:03:01,903
The list of Joyce Entertainment's
secret investors.

1054
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,696
So this person is…

1055
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:06,073
So the demoness that Gu Tae-su works for…

1056
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:07,492
Auntie Im.

1057
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,327
"Auntie Im"?

1058
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:11,913
He was cleaning up after them.

1059
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:14,749
How can I get him when he's
just about to get caught in the web?

1060
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:16,876
We need to wait until he's trapped.

1061
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,295
He's the type who will do
whatever it takes to root out

1062
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:20,630
anything that gets in his way.

1063
01:03:20,713 --> 01:03:21,672
Detective Han?

1064
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:23,549
Nam Han-jun…

1065
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:24,675
He must be here.

1066
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:29,764
