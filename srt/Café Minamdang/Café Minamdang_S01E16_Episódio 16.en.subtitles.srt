00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,956
THE NIGHT BEFORE JUNG HYE-YOON'S MURDER

2
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:43,168
EPISODE 16

3
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:48,423
I heard Seung-won still comes
to you for counseling.

4
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,718
Yes. He comes by occasionally.

5
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,431
That reminds me,
Seung-won was talking about you earlier.

6
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:59,559
Are you here about that day?

7
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:03,354
Did you remember anything?

8
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:10,195
I'm sure Seung-won killed
Hyeon-u that day…

9
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:15,617
but why do I keep seeing
a completely different memory?

10
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,826
You don't…

11
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,871
-remember--
-It was you, wasn't it?

12
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:24,000
You messed up my memories.

13
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,837
It was the chairman's orders.

14
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,507
My father?

15
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,634
You know.

16
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:37,514
He didn't think Seung-won had
what it took to lead the company.

17
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,933
You were the smart one,
but you turned out to be a…

18
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,519
psychopath.

19
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,198
What did I tell you happens
when you abuse a puppy?

20
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,783
That I'd get punished.

21
00:01:56,866 --> 00:02:00,161
For the sake of your future, you need
to learn to control your impulses.

22
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,209
You did well.

23
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,837
Use this the next time
you get an impulse like that.

24
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,965
Click on this until you calm down.

25
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,885
The chairman and I were both at ease,

26
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,513
thinking we had completely
brainwashed you as a child.

27
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:21,099
But then you suddenly murdered someone.

28
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,147
How much do you remember?

29
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,694
Hyeon-u…

30
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,784
Hyeon-u asked for water,
so I gave him the water.

31
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,287
Was it really water?

32
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,868
-This isn't water.
-It's antifreeze.

33
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,412
I saw in a movie
that you die if you drink it,

34
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,914
so I was curious.

35
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:28,416
But you're not dying as fast as
they did in the movie.

36
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,756
I told the chairman

37
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,926
that once you had tasted
that forbidden fruit,

38
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,887
you would murder again.

39
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:44,432
That it was impossible
to remove a memory perfectly.

40
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:52,690
In the end, the chairman chose
to manipulate your memory.

41
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,151
I'm almost done.

42
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,121
I have some pictures to show you.

43
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,249
Look at the first picture.

44
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,501
What does this look like?

45
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,336
A glass of water.

46
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,672
Now, the next picture.

47
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,383
What's this?

48
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,052
A necktie.

49
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,721
Seung-won's necktie…

50
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,265
So I inserted a distorted memory

51
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,017
-through hypnosis.
-Seung-won has the necktie…

52
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,229
-Seung-won's trying to do something…
-…to do something

53
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,773
-bad to Hyeon-u with the necktie.
-…bad to Hyeon-u with the necktie.

54
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,192
I made you believe
that the pleasure of killing

55
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:40,405
was the anger from seeing a criminal.

56
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,035
Why did you make me believe that

57
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,997
Seung-won was the one who killed Hyeon-u?

58
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,164
Because

59
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,543
I needed someone you'd easily
believe to be the killer.

60
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,007
After you got the water
and came back to the garage?

61
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:06,139
Seung-won was choking Hyeon-u.

62
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,185
You must have been so scared.

63
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,520
It's okay now.

64
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,376
So you do remember.

65
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,713
You know who to thank for the fact
that you're an amazing prosecutor

66
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,507
and not a psychopathic murderer.

67
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,304
You must be proud of
how you trained me like a dog.

68
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:50,391
A dog?

69
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,227
You

70
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,022
are my best creation.

71
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,150
I've never seen a patient
correct their behavior

72
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,444
and adjust to society
as perfectly as you did.

73
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:05,364
I brainwashed you so that you uphold
the system and the law,

74
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,493
and you became a prosecutor,
who is now trying to arrest his brother

75
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,245
based on fabricated memory.

76
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,002
Don't look at me like that.

77
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,129
If it weren't for me,

78
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,633
you would have had to live
in an institution your entire life.

79
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,514
What's that?

80
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:35,561
It entails the entire process of how I
brainwashed and manipulated your memory.

81
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,106
It's my accomplishment

82
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,484
as well as the proof
that you are a psychopath.

83
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,574
Of course,
with a small token of gratitude,

84
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,786
it can remain a secret forever,
between just you and me.

85
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,528
JUNG HYE-YOON

86
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,156
I replaced the memory
of him handing over the antifreeze

87
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:31,868
with him handing over water.
And the intense experience of murder

88
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:34,787
with a memory
of having witnessed a murder.

89
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:38,124
As a result,
the subject showed frustration and anger

90
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,168
at the fact that
his brother killed a person.

91
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,796
Die.

92
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,841
If the desire to kill cannot be stopped,

93
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,594
it must be redirected to something else.

94
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,804
"It is evil not to uphold the law."

95
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:54,474
"Evil must be eliminated from society."

96
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,601
"You are not someone to be eliminated,

97
00:07:56,684 --> 00:08:00,646
you must become a leader
who judges these evil men."

98
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,149
I am using these statements
to brainwash him.

99
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,444
I've been punishing criminals

100
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,698
because I've been brainwashed?

101
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,871
No.

102
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,708
I made those rules.

103
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,506
It was my own will.

104
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,467
I became a savior

105
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,554
through my own will.

106
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,734
The subject changed his dream job
to a prosecutor.

107
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,820
The brainwashing seems

108
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,823
to have strengthened his will
to punish criminals.

109
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,473
What I did wasn't wrong.

110
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,981
HYEYOON MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC

111
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,942
You're back faster than I thought.

112
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,695
The video must have

113
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,364
assured you that I saved you.

114
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,366
Yes.

115
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,827
It assured me.

116
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,454
No,

117
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,708
it'd be more accurate to say
it made me determined.

118
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,501
Yes.

119
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,922
As a child, you never missed
any opportunity that came your way.

120
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,387
Pay back my husband's debt,

121
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,932
and I'll give you all the data
that I have.

122
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,894
I will never ask you for anything again.

123
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,902
How do I know that you're giving me
the original data?

124
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,697
You could blackmail me again like this
using copies.

125
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,407
Yes.

126
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,410
It must be hard for you to trust me.

127
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,287
I understand.

128
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,122
But if I didn't care for you,

129
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,250
I'd have sold the data
to Seung-won already.

130
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,169
If I weren't in such a tight situation,

131
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,797
I'd never have asked you for this.

132
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:15,299
Okay.

133
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,444
Are you still going to say this is a favor
and not blackmail?

134
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,739
I just told them to come here
because I thought it'd help you decide.

135
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:40,825
Send away the detectives,

136
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,368
and we'll talk about the details.

137
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,832
Hong Myeong-su said that

138
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,709
you quarreled with Cha Seung-won that day.

139
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:54,255
I don't know.

140
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,174
I've quarreled with Seung-won quite often.

141
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:01,262
This is related to a recent murder,
so it's important.

142
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,388
Every little bit helps.

143
00:12:02,471 --> 00:12:04,849
So please, think about it carefully.

144
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,813
What do you mean, a recent murder?

145
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,400
His psychopathic tendencies must have
shown from his youth.

146
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:17,319
That's why Chairman Cha hired you.

147
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,281
Medical records are confidential,

148
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,615
so I can't tell you.

149
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:26,328
Then at least tell us about that day.

150
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,960
I'll look for the diary
I kept at the time.

151
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,796
I have a habit of recording
even small details.

152
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,132
Could you wait here for a minute?

153
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,893
HYEYOON MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC

154
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,114
How much will the token of gratitude
for the diary be?

155
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,995
You haven't killed anyone again

156
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,539
since that day, have you?

157
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,792
Why?

158
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:17,213
Are you afraid your best work
is actually a failure?

159
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,387
No.

160
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,848
It just makes me anxious,

161
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,392
now that I've heard

162
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,228
I'm a psychopath.

163
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,856
You don't have to be nervous.

164
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,109
How you live going forward depends
on the decisions you make.

165
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,822
So you just keep on being a model
prosecutor like you've been until now.

166
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:54,208
Yes.

167
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:59,004
I'll just blame Seung-won
like that last time.

168
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,541
How does it feel,
dying at the hands of your own creation?

169
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:40,045
You think you and Father are the reason
behind my acts of judgment?

170
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,840
You think I seek justice

171
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,760
because I've been brainwashed?

172
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,222
No.

173
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:53,475
I'm giving the victims
the gift of salvation through my own will.

174
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,875
She's taking longer than I thought.

175
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,047
More than ten minutes to go get a diary…

176
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,425
I've got a bad feeling about this.

177
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,510
I'd better go see what's going on.

178
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,011
Wait. You can't just go in there.

179
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,031
She's dead.

180
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,993
Who was in her office?

181
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:38,247
Well, I heard that a VIP was coming,
but I didn't see who it was.

182
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,873
Is there a separate entrance for VIPs?

183
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,125
There.

184
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,554
Damn it. I should have picked up on this.

185
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:57,850
There aren't any CCTVs here. We should
find the ones in the surrounding area.

186
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,728
I'll go to her office.

187
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,995
CHA SEUNG-WON

188
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,335
The CCTVs nearby are being checked.
What's that?

189
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,255
It's Cha Seung-won's chart.

190
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,257
He's been visiting her for a long time.

191
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:36,096
He'd know the layout
of this clinic better than anyone,

192
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,223
so he could be the killer.

193
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,350
I'll check his alibi.

194
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,936
Do you think he's nervous
because we found Hong Myeong-su?

195
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:48,525
It seems to have been out of impulse.
This wasn't planned at all.

196
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,995
Only the diary from
when the murder took place is missing.

197
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,377
Mr. Nam.

198
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,463
This…

199
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,924
It's the garage Oh Hyeon-u died in.

200
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,552
That's the uniform from
Cha Seung-won's high school.

201
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,352
Where on earth are they?

202
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,532
Are they really up to their
indecent shenanigans in this sacred spot?

203
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,452
-Hey.
-Han-jun.

204
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,497
-Don't get it wrong. We were eating chips.
-Yes.

205
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,500
You should use your hands to eat chips

206
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,210
not your mouths, you idiots.

207
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,212
We were tapping Cha Seung-won.

208
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:54,675
We came to find you, but we heard he was
on the move, so we were standing by.

209
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,177
So where is he?
Did he go anywhere suspicious?

210
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,888
No. He's holed up in his office

211
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,515
and hasn't moved all day.

212
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:06,019
Hey, take this.
See if this picture's been manipulated.

213
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,398
It's obviously a fake.

214
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:12,442
Look, the proportions are off
between this guy and his shadow,

215
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,444
and the pattern on the wall is warped.

216
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:18,907
Right, so exactly how was it manipulated?
Run an analysis.

217
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,870
If you let us stay out one night,

218
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,705
then I'll do the analysis.

219
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:28,584
No. You're going to run the analysis
as quickly as you can,

220
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:31,336
because I won't budge
from Su-cheol's side until you do.

221
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,006
Get off of me.

222
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,800
Let him go before I get violent.

223
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,260
Stop it, both of you.

224
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,888
You're going to rip
my first matching couple's t-shirt.

225
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,264
This is unbelievable.

226
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,266
-Wait.
-Let go of him.

227
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,268
I think Cha Seung-won got in a car.

228
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,190
What did the police say?

229
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,400
That they haven't found a suspect yet.

230
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,777
Sort it out
so it doesn't cause us trouble.

231
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,070
Yes, sir.

232
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,158
What's the situation?

233
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,327
We've found Auntie Im.

234
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,538
She's in a temple on Geumpa Mountain
in Yeonpyeong, Gyeonggi-do.

235
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,624
Take care of Kang first
before you go there.

236
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,211
Head to the temple in Geumpa Mountain.

237
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:16,006
She's a wily one. She'll run the moment
she realizes something's amiss.

238
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,549
Hurry.

239
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,844
Hurry and look up the list
of temples in Geumpa Mountain

240
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,054
Okay.

241
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,349
I'll show her what happens to anyone

242
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,476
who dares steal my money.

243
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,936
Looks like he's going to meet…

244
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,897
No, it seems like he's going
to kill Auntie Im.

245
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,441
What do we do?
Shouldn't we tell Detective Han?

246
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:38,111
No. We don't have the time.
We have to find Auntie Im before he does.

247
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,322
If Cha Seung-won gets rid of Auntie Im,

248
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,282
we won't be able
to find the evidence she has.

249
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,952
-Okay.
-There are three temples.

250
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,121
See if the movements of Gu's burner phone

251
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,623
-overlap with any of them.
-Right.

252
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,337
-There is one.
-Really?

253
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,756
-Let's go.
-Okay, then.

254
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,134
Hey…

255
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,349
I come upon you on this thorny road.

256
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,935
Please take this small offering
of your disciple.

257
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:13,105
My faith has been strong this whole time,

258
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,940
I look and follow only you…

259
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,079
You know me, right?

260
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,208
-You…
-Yes.

261
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,128
How could she forget
after that scene we caused?

262
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:41,758
Unless you'd like to die
at the hands of Cha Seung-won,

263
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,720
you'd better follow us quietly.

264
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:45,804
Yes.

265
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,018
Take care of Kang first
before you go there.

266
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,312
Head to the temple in Geumpa Mountain.

267
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:57,899
She's a wily one. She'll run the moment
she realizes something's amiss. Hurry.

268
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:59,609
I had wondered how someone

269
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,987
who hasn't taken on a god
pretended to be a shaman,

270
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,740
so this was your trick.

271
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,048
Find her.

272
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,270
I think she ran in a hurry.

273
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,484
Find her any way you can.

274
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:44,071
Nothing's off limits.
Just find her and bring her to me!

275
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,574
If you can't,

276
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,202
just kill her.

277
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,247
Yes, sir. Follow me.

278
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,301
A temple without a god…

279
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,679
You tried your best
to make yourself presentable,

280
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:13,266
but pretending to be a shaman
can bring doom upon you.

281
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,603
Hasn't the god you worship told you
something like this?

282
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,981
"The god of riches has disappeared
from your shoulders."

283
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,276
"Your luck with money has run out."

284
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,277
That sort of thing.

285
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,155
How would a man who hasn't taken on a god
see the god of riches?

286
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:35,080
Now, let's see.

287
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,375
What? 600 billion won?

288
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,128
I can see it.

289
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,880
You must have thought it was
worth betting your life on.

290
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,799
It's too bad, though.

291
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,386
You poor thing.

292
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:52,597
What bad luck. You're going to die
without ever having touched that money.

293
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,934
If you want to stay alive,

294
00:23:56,017 --> 00:24:00,647
you must confess about the body
you hanged 20 years ago.

295
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,774
It wasn't easy, finding that account.

296
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,526
-That is true.
-Yes.

297
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:07,195
These matching t-shirts
are so pretty, aren't they?

298
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,156
-Like me?
-Yes, like you.

299
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,717
COUNTRY, BANK

300
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,512
You have something on
Cha Seung-won, don't you?

301
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,014
Twenty years ago,

302
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:35,974
Oh Hyeon-u's murder,

303
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,144
you made it go away.

304
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,527
Chairman Cha Yong-jae called me.

305
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:52,449
He said his son killed someone,
and he wanted me to cover it up.

306
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,037
MOM, THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING

307
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,457
OH HYEON-U

308
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,336
Gu Tae-su pretended to be the dead kid
and fabricated the alibi,

309
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,046
and I made it look like a suicide.

310
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,177
Ever since then, I've been cleaning up
after the Cha family's dirty deeds,

311
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,681
doesn't that give me the right to that
600 billion won as compensation?

312
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,974
Gosh.

313
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:21,269
What a cheap move.
Then what about Gu Tae-su?

314
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,732
After all you used him for,

315
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:30,362
doesn't Gu Tae-su deserve compensation?

316
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:32,864
You

317
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,618
used and discarded Gu Tae-su as well.

318
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,871
Some are born with bad luck.

319
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:43,291
No matter how much they struggle,
they can never escape their misfortune.

320
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,586
There is nothing
as unfair and cruel as fate.

321
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,754
Come on.

322
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:52,592
You are the one who put Gu Tae-su
on that cruel path.

323
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:56,012
You made him believe that you were
his savior and used him remorselessly.

324
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,266
That doesn't seem like something
someone who serves a god should do.

325
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,017
You think I'm the only villain here?

326
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,937
Doesn't it occur to you that
it made him happier?

327
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,524
I redeemed that cursed child.

328
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,778
If you had led Gu Tae-su

329
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:16,616
on a different path when you first met,

330
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,452
he would have had
a completely different life.

331
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,790
He isn't a sociopath like you.

332
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,000
Who knows?

333
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,585
Maybe he would have become even worse.

334
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,130
Then why did you

335
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:33,008
give Gu Tae-su a new identity?

336
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,385
It'd have been better to leave him
as the ghost

337
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,179
so you could dump him
without attracting suspicion.

338
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,266
I didn't like him to begin with
because we shared the same surname.

339
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:45,562
But he kept wanting a normal life
when he should have lived like a ghost.

340
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,565
That's why I told him to assume
the identity of a dead man.

341
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,776
So he'd live as a ghost once again.

342
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,947
How harsh. Gu Tae-su trusted you.

343
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,615
Without a shred of doubt.

344
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,576
-Blindly.
-No.

345
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,204
There is only one person
he follows blindly.

346
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,040
You know this too.

347
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,500
Do Jun-ha, Choi Yeong-seop, Han Jae-jeong.

348
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,129
I didn't kill any of them.

349
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,381
I find myself curious.

350
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,343
Why would someone who killed so many,

351
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,929
spare you until the end?

352
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,396
Jeez, has she gone crazy?

353
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,606
Goodness.

354
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:33,818
You're good.

355
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,447
Now that I think about it,

356
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,949
you're like me.

357
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,495
Jeez. No.

358
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,247
I may not be a real shaman,

359
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,085
but let me make a prophecy.

360
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:51,878
Auntie Im.

361
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:55,215
Expose everything and turn yourself in.

362
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,299
If you don't,

363
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,803
you will die at the hands
of the person you serve.

364
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,472
Shall I make a prophecy too?

365
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,557
The evidence the police have,

366
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,684
you'll end up destroying it yourself.

367
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,940
That's a lot of effort to put
into a load of bull.

368
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,901
Why else would I have told you
about what happened 20 years ago?

369
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:19,114
Destroy the evidence and help
me escape in one piece.

370
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:23,076
The file that Prosecutor Han
had before he died…

371
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,413
I have that file.

372
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,051
No. This is wrong.

373
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,345
That choice is not right.

374
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:46,683
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

375
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:50,019
I understand the evidence
Prosecutor Han had is extremely important,

376
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,398
but still, we can't sneak
into a police station

377
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,899
and destroy evidence.

378
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:55,984
That's what I'm saying.

379
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,944
And do you believe that devil?

380
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,446
Yes, seriously.

381
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,990
Why don't you just ask Detective Han
for help--

382
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,116
No.

383
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:08,913
She'll be against it. Plus, I'll need to
take responsibility if things go wrong.

384
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,331
I can't drag Jae-hui into it.

385
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,751
Then do it on your own.
Why drag us into it?

386
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:18,339
You're going to abandon me?
My own baby sister? You too?

387
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,508
The thing is,

388
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,636
whether or not you manage
to extract the evidence now,

389
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,138
there'll be repercussions.

390
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,474
Come on,
what are you going to do about that?

391
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,225
That's what I'm saying.

392
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,227
This is the only way

393
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,898
to get the file and catch both Auntie Im
and Gopuri all at the same time.

394
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,858
Do you want all our efforts to be wasted?

395
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,109
Do you?

396
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:43,072
I'm sure Jae-hui will understand
when I tell her afterward.

397
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:49,329
Mother, Father.
Your son is going to prison.

398
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,874
We're screwed.

399
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,376
DAEUN POLICE STATION

400
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,843
You didn't sleep a wink last night,

401
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,512
do you really have to do this?

402
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,056
I want you to know that I warned you.

403
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,060
What about the CCTV in the evidence room?

404
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,771
Thankfully, they haven't realized
that I hacked into it yet.

405
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:20,693
Why do I always have to dress up
as a woman when we have Hye-jun?

406
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:23,738
Because I have the talent
to hack into a police station.

407
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,157
I want to do something cool too.

408
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,202
That's life.

409
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:36,376
Banana or strawberry milk?

410
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,627
That is the question.

411
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,921
Just pick one.

412
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:43,007
This is really important.
How could you tell me to "just pick one"?

413
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,385
Who cares as long as the drug works?

414
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,637
Just pick one.

415
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,105
Enlarge this and print it out.

416
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,690
Yes, ma'am.

417
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,985
Those scumbags.

418
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,782
EVIDENCE 1

419
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,579
I think Auntie Im is trying
to smuggle herself out of the country.

420
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,790
I sent the picture of Auntie Im
and Kang to my informant

421
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,792
who's a stowaway broker.

422
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,920
He said Kang came two days ago,
looking for a ship to China.

423
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:21,880
When are they leaving?

424
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,631
They don't have a schedule yet.

425
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,800
I don't know if we should do this.

426
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,677
If you get caught,

427
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,471
Lieutenant Han is going to kill you
before you go to prison.

428
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,141
I know, so stop it already and get ready.

429
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,434
Okay.

430
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,189
There.

431
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:58,833
All right.

432
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,837
I'll write it down.

433
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,672
How are the kids?

434
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,175
They're all grown now.
They're sleeping on their own.

435
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,054
I'm jealous. Bye.

436
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:14,140
Jeez, put the pen back
after you use it. Bye.

437
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:19,771
Delivery.

438
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,816
The Chief told me to hand out some snacks.

439
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,693
That's not like him.

440
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,320
Thank you for your hard work.

441
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,696
Thank you.

442
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,409
POLICE

443
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:51,552
I told them not to move this.
They keep making the same mistake.

444
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,763
It doesn't look like this will work.

445
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,139
-What do we do?
-Damn it.

446
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,976
-Let's try plan B.
-We have a plan B?

447
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,227
No idea.

448
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,231
Hello.

449
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,733
Is this Mr. Kim Gyeong-il?
You're the twin's father, right?

450
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,487
There's been a car accident,
and you need to come.

451
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:11,406
What? A car accident?

452
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:15,201
Yes. They aren't seriously hurt,
but your wife is in a bit of a shock.

453
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:18,246
This is the emergency room
at Sinmyeong St. Mary's Hospital,

454
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,831
please come quick.

455
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,625
Okay, I will. Yes, thank you.

456
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,835
Bye.

457
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:30,091
Wow, that's horrible. I know it's urgent,
but I can't believe you used the twins.

458
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:33,553
I've never been more ashamed of
how fast I'm able to think on my feet.

459
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,891
Oh, god.

460
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,137
Please.

461
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,806
It's at 95, 96, 97.

462
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,810
God, who the hell has the audacity
to prank call the police? Jeez.

463
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,353
It's working.

464
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,314
He's coming.

465
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,024
Goodness.

466
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,824
Are these people insane? Unbelievable…

467
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,418
Damn it.

468
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:50,046
And how did they know I have twins?

469
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,519
The expiration date hasn't passed…

470
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,063
What the hell did I eat?

471
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:21,911
DAEUN POLICE STATION

472
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,247
ARREST WARRANT

473
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,543
Mr. Jang and I will go
inside the broker's office,

474
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,253
you two cut off the escape routes

475
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,629
-and stand watch.
-Yes, ma'am.

476
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,966
I'm sure the broker isn't the only one
who's with the stowaway gang,

477
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,926
-so everyone becareful.
-Yes, sir.

478
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,594
-Now, let's go.
-Okay.

479
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:40,471
Get the cuffs.

480
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,558
Mr. Nam.

481
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,768
I was just about to go arrest Auntie Im.

482
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,020
She isn't going to stow away.

483
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,939
The arrest warrant, the travel ban,

484
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,443
they're all going to be revoked,
so she can just leave the country.

485
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,653
What?

486
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,489
We have the evidence,
why would the warrant be revoked?

487
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,907
What are you talking about?

488
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,870
That evidence is now useless.

489
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:16,424
You made

490
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,594
a deal with Auntie Im?

491
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,472
I had to move quickly,
so I didn't have the time to tell you.

492
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,641
It wasn't that you couldn't care less
about me?

493
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,226
How could you have pulled

494
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,478
something as big as this
without talking to me?

495
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,522
Should I have asked you to do it with me?

496
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,609
You're the police, and it would
surely hurt you, so how could I?

497
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,776
Are you saying

498
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,864
you did it for me?

499
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,872
Still, I can't believe he did
something awful like that.

500
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:52,001
-Damn it. I can't take his side this time.
-I know.

501
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:55,004
Don't cut him any slack.
Channel Han the ghost and beat him up.

502
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,715
They're fighting,
but I still sense this love between them.

503
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,842
Like a married couple.

504
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,969
Romantic relationships are unpredictable.

505
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,387
-Very true.
-Yes.

506
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,307
-My god.
-Gosh, you scared me.

507
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,142
Mr. Cha, how long have you been there?

508
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,688
Since Mr. Nam said
he destroyed the evidence.

509
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,483
So, for all of it.

510
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,568
Goodness, what do we do now?

511
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,737
What do you mean what do we do?

512
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,032
-We hear out Mr. Nam's plan.
-What?

513
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:26,994
Mr. Nam, just

514
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,248
-explain this to us so we can understand…
-There's no need to explain it.

515
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:33,876
I take back what I said
about investigating together.

516
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,754
Han Jae-hui,

517
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:39,090
-listen to me.
-No.

518
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,386
I've been understanding of the way
you've handled things.

519
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:46,180
Like how you do whatever it takes
to get results.

520
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,350
No, I cheered you on
while I took part in it too.

521
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,560
Because I know just how desperate you are.

522
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,230
But now I understand.

523
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:57,400
It's not just the results that matter.

524
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:00,319
The process and the procedure
have to be just too.

525
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:02,738
That at the very least, as the police,

526
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,074
I shouldn't do things like that.

527
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:10,079
I'll investigate using
my own methods going forward,

528
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,289
so you can go back to

529
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,166
your own world now, Mr. Nam.

530
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,545
Auntie Im has Jae-jeong's file.

531
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,136
Jae-jeong said he found the connection

532
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,888
between the victim
and the killer before he died,

533
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,807
and Auntie Im has that file.

534
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,811
Jae-jeong must have found out
who Gopuri was.

535
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,984
I see. So that's why
he killed Prosecutor Han.

536
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:43,112
If we have that file,
you can catch Gopuri, that bastard.

537
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,697
I'll control Auntie Im

538
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,782
and find both the file and Gopuri.

539
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,493
I can't let Auntie Im go
just to catch Gopuri.

540
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,537
We can't punish Auntie Im or Cha Seung-won

541
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,165
with the evidence we have now.

542
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,834
Can you prove they're guilty
of special solicitation of murder?

543
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,919
At best, we can prove
they concealed a corpse.

544
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:03,507
Mr. Shaman, you're saying you can get
both Auntie Im and Cha Seung-won?

545
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,800
Just let me see Gu Tae-su.

546
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,011
I'll get him to testify
that she solicited him.

547
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,263
We can use that to arrest her.

548
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,600
We have her with us right now.

549
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,311
You have Auntie Im too?

550
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:27,198
Well, you do have a point about getting

551
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,784
Auntie Im and the mastermind
behind her all at once.

552
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,370
But there's no guarantee
that your plan will succeed.

553
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:38,292
Even if it was to catch Gopuri,
I know I did something I shouldn't have.

554
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:40,795
I know that.

555
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,130
I know it won't be easy to forgive me.

556
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,174
But give me another chance
so I can catch Gopuri.

557
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,009
-Please.
-Gosh.

558
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,180
Why don't we

559
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:54,100
follow Mr. Nam's plans for now?

560
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,977
Well, it is dangerous,

561
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:00,439
but it seems to be
our best option for now.

562
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,525
Yes.

563
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:06,237
And if it doesn't work,
we can go back to doing it our way.

564
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,822
Yes, Ms. Han.

565
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,366
Let's give him one more chance.

566
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:14,703
Okay.

567
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:20,042
But if you ever make a decision
without consulting me again, it's over.

568
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,210
And don't

569
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:25,047
ask for my forgiveness about this

570
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,966
or talk to me.

571
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:29,635
Let's just do the investigation.
That's it.

572
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,512
Come on…

573
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,265
Does it have to be that extreme?

574
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,642
SU-CHEOL

575
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,979
-What is it?
-Han-jun, it's a warzone here.

576
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:43,107
Hye-jun and Auntie Im are about
to tear each other's hair out.

577
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,568
I've got an emergency here too,
so handle it yourself.

578
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,445
I'm in the middle of a war too.

579
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:52,366
I'm screwed.

580
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:58,747
I don't eat vulgar food like this.

581
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,249
What?

582
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,251
Vulgar?

583
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:05,588
Who are you to insult delivery food?

584
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,089
You are declaring war

585
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,593
against the tens of millions
of pizza lovers in Korea right now.

586
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:14,638
Whatever, I don't eat this stuff,
so bring me proper food.

587
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,057
-Damn it.
-Gosh.

588
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,438
-That bitch…
-Come on.

589
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,900
You're prettier, so let it slide.
Have a bite of this.

590
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:26,984
No.

591
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,080
NAM HAN-JUN

592
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,419
Burn them all.

593
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:18,744
Why do you have Prosecutor Han's file?

594
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,296
NAM HAN-JUN

595
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,007
That file will bring trouble.

596
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:35,177
The police swept in, so I just grabbed it.

597
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:38,597
I'll take care of that.
You go get your wounds treated.

598
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,107
NAM HAN-JUN

599
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,362
I THOUGHT…

600
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,535
I thought of it as a means
to protect my life.

601
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,208
I've overestimated you.

602
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,419
You were just used by Nam Han-jun.

603
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:11,755
What do you mean?

604
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,299
PROSECUTOR CHA DO-WON

605
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,634
Nam Han-jun made a deal with the police.

606
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:19,138
He's going to hand you over to the police
as soon as he gets that file.

607
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:22,057
Unless you want to walk into his trap,
do as I tell you.

608
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,271
What do you want me to do?

609
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,335
Are you being loyal to Auntie Im

610
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,129
because you believe her
to be your benefactor?

611
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,797
Or is it that

612
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:57,259
even if it wasn't Auntie Im,
you believed Gopuri

613
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:59,637
would save you one day?

614
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,393
I don't think Gopuri cares
whether you live or die,

615
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,521
and if it's because you believe
Auntie Im is your benefactor,

616
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,731
I think

617
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,485
I can break your loyalty.

618
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:19,239
Then why did you give
Gu Tae-su a new identity?

619
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,450
It'd have been better to leave him
as the ghost

620
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,827
so you could dump him
without attracting suspicion.

621
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,997
He kept clinging to life, when he
should have been living as a ghost.

622
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,750
That's why I told him to assume
the identity of a dead man.

623
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,710
So he'd live as a ghost again.

624
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,298
She never truly cared for you.

625
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:40,469
You have to escape the fantasy
she planted in you.

626
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:43,889
Nam Han-jun.

627
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,186
I should have killed you then.

628
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:51,647
Why?

629
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:55,067
Did you want to live
in this childish fantasy forever?

630
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,906
If not, then tell me. Was it Auntie Im

631
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:04,368
who told you to kill?

632
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,266
Did she tell you to kill
Jeon Gyeong-cheol?

633
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,935
I'm sorry. I thought
it was under your orders, sir.

634
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,854
I never gave that order.

635
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,273
When the police come, hit me and then run.

636
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,816
-Yes, sir.
-Over here!

637
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:40,737
I didn't realize Nam Han-jun
would find the RV too.

638
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:44,241
It'd be dangerous for us
if he digs into that list on the laptop.

639
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,870
Uncle kept all the proof
of Seung-won's corruption, right?

640
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:50,247
In a secret safe on the VIP floor.

641
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,833
I'll make Nam Han-jun go after that safe.

642
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,878
Wait there, and when I lure
Nam Han-jun in, you snatch the data

643
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,337
and take it to Seung-won.

644
00:45:57,421 --> 00:46:01,758
He'll see it and go crazy, which will make
Nam Han-jun suspect him even more.

645
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,303
Then we'll watch the two of them fight

646
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,597
and get rid of them both
when we get the chance.

647
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,309
What's that look on your face?

648
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,534
HE'S IN. GET READY.

649
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,038
DIRECTOR CHA SEUNG-WON

650
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,923
Director Cha gave me the order
to get rid of Chairman Park.

651
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,343
Do as he orders.

652
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,720
But kill him as Gopuri.

653
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:48,096
So Nam Han-jun will believe

654
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,350
that Cha Seung-won is Gopuri,
the man he's after.

655
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:52,392
Yes, sir.

656
00:47:12,287 --> 00:47:14,623
Auntie Im was the one

657
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,546
who told me to kill.

658
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:31,807
Wow, that was amazing.
Mr. Shaman really got him to confess.

659
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,184
I was a bit disappointed
about what happened,

660
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:37,187
-but he is really talented, that I'll say.
-Me too.

661
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,855
Now we just need to find that file

662
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,650
and arrest Auntie Im and her bosses,

663
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:43,443
and that's it.

664
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:47,114
All there is left to do now is
for me to wrap things up.

665
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,534
Right, yes.

666
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:58,292
Check the details of your confession,

667
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,669
and sign here.

668
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:07,175
Yes, everything's correct.

669
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:09,511
LIM YEONG-JU

670
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,656
To me, you were always my magpie
that brought me good luck.

671
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,203
Nothing's changed since then.

672
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,414
You must be cursed.

673
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,043
I don't care if you're cursed.

674
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,921
You're now my magpie.

675
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,765
It's dangerous, why would you…

676
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,059
I don't care.

677
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,353
You are what's important to me.

678
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:03,982
There'll be an accident
when they move you.

679
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,776
Look for an opening and escape then.

680
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:07,527
My people will tell you what to do next.

681
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,995
Here's your lunch box.

682
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,540
You need to eat.

683
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,751
-I'm all done now.
-Okay.

684
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:25,671
See you soon, Mr. Gu.

685
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,926
Here's your lunch.

686
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,511
Let's go.

687
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,098
Did you eat?

688
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,100
I will.

689
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,778
Wow, with this, I think
we have enough to arrest Auntie Im.

690
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:53,115
Just in case, add more guards when
you move him to the Prosecutors' Office.

691
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:55,158
Why? Did something happen?

692
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,869
If Gopuri finds out Gu Tae-su
ratted Auntie Im out,

693
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:01,415
he might try to kill him out of the fear
he might reveal his identity too.

694
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,919
Then we'll transport Gu Tae-su ourselves

695
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:08,463
while Lieutenant Han looks for the file
with Mr. Shaman.

696
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:09,673
-Okay.
-Okay.

697
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:12,676
You have the people at Minamdang.
But will you two be enough?

698
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,845
If there are a lot of people,
Auntie Im could grow suspicious,

699
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,888
and that'd make it harder
to lure in Gopuri.

700
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:20,225
We'll call you as soon as we get the file,
and then you can join us right away.

701
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:22,352
Yes, I'll do that.

702
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:26,440
And let's keep this plan just between us.

703
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:27,858
Okay.

704
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,111
Okay.

705
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:32,404
SU-CHEOL

706
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,406
Hey, Su-cheol.

707
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,742
Did she tell you where the file is?

708
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,201
About that,

709
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,329
-things are crazy here.
-Hey, give me that.

710
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:43,874
Hey!

711
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:49,379
I've shown her that her arrest warrant
and the travel ban have both been revoked,

712
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:52,007
but this bitch won't talk.

713
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:53,925
SU-CHEOL

714
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:58,054
So you're going back on your promise?

715
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:00,891
I'll give you the file when I've safely

716
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,726
left the country.

717
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:06,438
I've never thought
you'd give us that file so easily.

718
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,691
That's why I prepared a gift for you.

719
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,318
I don't know if you'll like it.

720
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,570
That?

721
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,409
Yes. Here.

722
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:31,671
I told you that
the god of riches has left you

723
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:34,591
and that your luck with money has run out.

724
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,551
What have you done?

725
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,805
That's why you should've
had the pizza with us before.

726
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,431
She gnashed her teeth
while looking for that account.

727
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:42,974
You won't see a penny of it.

728
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,644
You'll release my account

729
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:48,563
if I give you the file?

730
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,106
Don't worry.

731
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:53,235
I just want the file, not your money.

732
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,780
We're ready to go,
where should we meet you?

733
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:58,573
Cheonggakjeong.

734
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,201
Come to my temple behind Cheonggakjeong.

735
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,455
Okay.

736
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,083
Come on, get going.

737
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,793
Let's go. Get up.

738
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,753
Yes. Let's go.

739
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,386
Let's go.

740
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,596
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

741
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,603
I got him to go to the temple.

742
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:35,443
I'll do it myself this time.

743
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:45,412
Prosecutor Cha's going to the temple
in Cheonggakjeong.

744
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,581
I think he's going to see Auntie Im…

745
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,125
Do-won going to see Auntie Im?

746
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:07,475
CONVOY

747
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:30,707
Step on it!

748
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,302
Han-jun.

749
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,137
-Jeez.
-Goodness.

750
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,847
-Hey, good work.
-Yes

751
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,600
Well, would look at her, swanning in.

752
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,771
Well. I see the detective came too.

753
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:56,066
That file you have is important to me too.

754
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,527
Prosecutor Han was your brother, right?

755
00:54:00,862 --> 00:54:02,322
Just keep your promise,

756
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,075
and you'll know who killed your brother.

757
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:08,453
You guys keep a good eye on her from here,
just in case.

758
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:11,498
Yes, okay. Call us if anything happens.

759
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,708
And take this.

760
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,836
Those won't work in my temple.

761
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:21,758
Jeez…

762
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,595
Good luck.

763
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:28,098
What an ass.

764
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,599
I know.

765
00:54:49,244 --> 00:54:50,870
Door opening.

766
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,585
NAM HAN-JUN

767
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,212
That's my brother's handwriting.

768
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:07,429
If you want to see what's in the file,
release my account first.

769
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:08,596
Okay.

770
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,392
-What's the password to the account?
-What?

771
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:15,311
Well, Hye-jun wasn't in her right mind

772
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:17,105
when she set that password.

773
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:23,236
Yes.
Eighteen, eighteen, eighteen, eighteen.

774
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:24,946
Four ones and eights.

775
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:30,326
One, eight, one, eight,
one, eight, one, eight.

776
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:08,448
What do you think you're doing?

777
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,241
-Open the door!
-Open the door.

778
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:13,078
You thought you could catch him
by using me as bait,

779
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,204
but you were wrong.

780
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:16,623
It's him who has you where he wants you
using that file as bait.

781
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,669
Su-cheol, Auntie Im's boss is here.

782
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,297
Don't let Auntie Im escape
and catch him first.

783
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:27,342
Kong Su-cheol. There's no signal.

784
00:56:27,425 --> 00:56:29,803
I think she jammed the signal
once she closed the temple doors.

785
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,264
Damn it.

786
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,143
Open the door!

787
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,395
Damn it.

788
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,540
Jae-hui, it's gas.
You need to cover your mouth.

789
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:11,678
Jae-hui.

790
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,482
Mr. Nam.

791
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:35,488
I hereby arrest you without a warrant
for the murder of Im Hui-suk.

792
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:42,704
Let me go.

793
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:44,998
Please, just get out of the way.

794
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:11,608
EPILOGUE

795
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,699
What will you do now?

796
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:24,495
Execute the punishment, so my judgment
will never again be tainted

797
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,291
by the desires of others.

798
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:37,800
You will die anyway,

799
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:39,802
so you might as well make yourself useful.

800
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:08,498
You've gone mad, playing judge,

801
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:12,460
and will eventually

802
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:15,380
end up dying at his hands.

803
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:26,474
I'll make a prophecy.

804
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:31,521
Auntie Im. Reveal the truth
about everything and turn yourself in.

805
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:36,693
If you don't, you will die at the hands
of the person you serve.

806
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:16,399
I saw everything.

807
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:19,026
Your face was caught on tape
nice and clear,

808
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,445
so don't you try to deny it.

809
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:21,696
Hand them over to me by tomorrow,

810
01:02:21,779 --> 01:02:24,449
then Choekang's chairman position
will be all yours.

811
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:25,366
Mr. Nam's disappeared too.

812
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:28,453
Are you saying there's a spy among us?

813
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:31,956
I found out who Gopuri is.

814
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:33,916
We'll use Cha Seung-won as bait.

815
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,419
You should stop
investigating the case, Lieutenant Han.

816
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:37,545
Isn't that kidnapping?

817
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:39,672
How dare you take me for a fool?

818
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:43,426
You're going to get back exactly…
No, it's going to be much worse for you.

819
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:48,514
