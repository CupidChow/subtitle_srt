00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,080
EPISODE 17

2
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:42,208
Are you really not going to say anything?

3
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,838
Spare us both the trouble
and just tell us the truth.

4
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,591
Auntie Im and Cha Seung-won
aren't that different.

5
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,217
They both used you.

6
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:54,929
It's my job to protect.

7
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,309
That day I was rescued,

8
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,187
it sealed my fate.

9
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,564
Jeez.

10
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,486
It's not like those two were
cult leaders who brainwashed you…

11
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,286
Who is that?

12
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:21,122
I think there's a car following us.

13
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,040
What?

14
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,093
Come on, damn it.

15
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,334
You don't have to feel bad.

16
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,837
If you had found me then,

17
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,423
I would've lived a worthless life,
just like my father.

18
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,707
Let's go.

19
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,265
Quietly follow that car.

20
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,692
-Still nothing?
-No.

21
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,569
I can't wait any longer. Let's go.

22
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,237
Okay.

23
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:24,787
Gu escaped on the way
to the Prosecutors' Office.

24
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,248
The detectives got hurt too,
so they'll need back-up,

25
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,875
but Lieutenant Han's phone is off.

26
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,461
I don't know what happened,
but neither are responding,

27
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,880
so I'm on my way to check.
I'll call you later.

28
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,521
-Lieutenant!
-Ms. Han!

29
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,107
What happened?

30
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:56,486
Mr. Nam.

31
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:00,657
Where's Mr. Nam?

32
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,493
Weren't you with him?

33
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,745
Where's Han-jun? What is going on?

34
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,415
Auntie Im locked us in the temple,

35
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,334
then I smelled gas all of a sudden.

36
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,586
I can't remember what happened after that.

37
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,171
Auntie Im must have kidnapped Han-jun.

38
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,383
We have to hurry. Gu Tae-su escaped.

39
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,842
What?

40
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:34,023
Mr. Jang, Gu Tae-su escaped?
What happened?

41
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:37,568
Jeez, some guys appeared out of nowhere
and took Gu Tae-su.

42
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:40,989
Mr. Nam's disappeared too.
I think Auntie Im took him.

43
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:45,702
We'll try to find Gu Tae-su somehow.
You look for Mr. Shaman.

44
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,786
Okay.

45
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,914
The CCTV outside.

46
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:52,625
-We should check that first.
-Okay.

47
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,086
-Okay, let's go. Be careful.
-Can you walk?

48
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,045
Yes.

49
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:03,428
Hey, who's that next to Auntie Im?
I don't think that's Han-jun.

50
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,389
Do you think he kidnapped Mr. Nam
with Auntie Im?

51
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:09,642
Ms. Nam, you put that GPS tracker
on your brother, right?

52
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,353
I've checked,
but there's no signal for some reason.

53
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,941
That's Cha Seung-won's car.

54
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,861
Cha Seung-won? Wait.

55
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,530
We put that GPS tracker
on Cha Seung-won's car.

56
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,699
-Can you access its location?
-Just a minute.

57
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:26,993
He's on the move.

58
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,704
But why is he…

59
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:33,291
I think he's heading to Minamdang.

60
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,876
Let's hurry and catch up to him.

61
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,835
Yes, okay.

62
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,883
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

63
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,420
What on earth is he doing?

64
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,642
You brought this all on yourself.

65
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,816
Thanks to you, it's been fun.

66
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,485
But I can't lose this game.

67
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,687
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

68
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,111
Mr. Cha.

69
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:27,947
What happened?

70
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,365
Well…

71
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,661
We received a tip that Auntie Im was
at Minamdang.

72
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,205
I think Han-jun's in there too.

73
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,583
Wait, but who called it in?

74
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,210
-Gu Tae-su.
-What?

75
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,629
-Gu Tae-su called it in?
-Yes.

76
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:44,964
What did he say?

77
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,217
We'll know when we go in.

78
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,178
Let's head inside.

79
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,598
Let's go.

80
00:07:56,434 --> 00:08:00,897
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

81
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,217
Mr. Nam.

82
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:33,679
I hereby arrest you without a warrant
for the murder of Im Hui-suk.

83
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,019
Let me go.

84
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,647
Please, just get out of the way.

85
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,734
Damn it.

86
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,319
Let go.

87
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,584
You have the right to remain silent
and the right to an attorney.

88
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,382
You may refuse to say anything
that can be used against you.

89
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,508
I didn't kill her.

90
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:14,011
Gopuri caught me in his trap.

91
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,848
Or you got caught trying to

92
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,103
fool us, Mr. Nam.

93
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:24,855
What?

94
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,317
"Nam Han-jun is trying to kill Auntie Im

95
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,114
and plant the evidence on someone else."

96
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:36,617
That's what Gu Tae-su called in.

97
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,372
You believe that crap?

98
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,500
Really?

99
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,169
He said he didn't do it.

100
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,672
He said he didn't.

101
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,631
Wait.

102
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,969
We'll know once we test the weapon.

103
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,647
The killer left it in my hand.

104
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,485
He tampered with the crime scene.

105
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,946
To frame me.

106
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,333
Preserve the crime scene,

107
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,335
and ask the forensic team to come in.

108
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:28,544
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

109
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,510
Mr. Cha. Something is wrong here.

110
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:39,096
Mr. Nam can be a bit reckless,

111
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,516
but you know better than I do
that he wouldn't kill anyone.

112
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,477
I do.

113
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,357
But a prosecutor must investigate

114
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,068
based on the evidence,
not his personal feelings.

115
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,737
You know that, Lieutenant Han.

116
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,157
-Mr. Cha.
-If Mr. Nam didn't do it,

117
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,534
he'll be free to go soon, so don't worry.

118
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,372
Go home and rest.

119
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:09,210
And considering
your relationship with the suspect,

120
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,712
you should stop
investigating the case, Ms. Han.

121
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,757
I can't do that.

122
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,651
This isn't right. Why is it doing that?

123
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,325
Han-jun.

124
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,911
Han-jun.

125
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,167
They're my siblings, let me talk to them.

126
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,925
Han-jun. The power suddenly went out,

127
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:02,179
and the CCTVs didn't record anything.
What do we do?

128
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,641
I'm sure they didn't kill a person
on my turf without taking precautions.

129
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:08,811
This man left Cheonggakjeong
with Auntie Im.

130
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,610
Could I take a look at that video too?

131
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,626
The man who left Cheonggakjeong
with Auntie Im.

132
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,170
It's highly likely he's the culprit.

133
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:36,338
Okay, I'll check it out.

134
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:44,972
It's okay.

135
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,224
It's okay.

136
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,768
Han-jun, don't worry.

137
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:53,731
I'll catch the killer, I promise.

138
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,734
I'll never let you suffer again
for a crime you didn't commit.

139
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,694
Why do you think I quit the NIS?

140
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,738
Don't worry.

141
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:03,824
Su-cheol.

142
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:05,534
Hye-jun.

143
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:16,378
Case numbers 2018N966,
2019H1564, and 2019H1818.

144
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,796
Find out how they're related.

145
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,882
-Oh, okay.
-Okay.

146
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,426
Case numbers 2018…

147
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,932
Let's go.

148
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,397
Han-jun, don't worry.

149
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,565
Don't let them scare you.

150
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,913
Right, we forgot to tell him about
how Cha Seung-won's car came here.

151
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,456
Oh, right…

152
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,666
I'll tell him.

153
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:56,710
I'll call you right away
if anything happens. You two wait here.

154
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,546
Okay.

155
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,882
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

156
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:18,023
DAEUN POLICE STATION

157
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,793
Chairman Cha covered up the case,
so it never got out,

158
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,381
but Gopuri showed psychopathic tendencies
even when he was a child.

159
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,258
INSTINCT, FIRST MURDER,
ANTISOCIAL TENDENCIEs

160
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:50,014
He's been punishing his victims using his
own methods ever since he became an adult.

CASE NUMBER
SUSPENSION OF INDICTMENT

162
00:14:51,849 --> 00:14:56,520
He justified his murders by calling them
acts of judgment and righteousness.

163
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,660
THE SIMILARITY BETWEEN VICTIMS

164
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,874
Instead of looking for
what the victims have in common,

165
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:21,629
if I were to focus on his signature
characteristics and profile them…

166
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,927
Gopuri, that son of a bitch.

167
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,146
Did you think of something?

168
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,871
If I knew who was behind all this,

169
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:20,956
do you think I'd be here?

170
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,043
Mr. Nam, you were alone
at the crime scene,

171
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,587
and they found your prints on the weapon.

172
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,131
They're going to send you
to the Prosecutors' Office tomorrow.

173
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,342
The situation is very bad right now.

174
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,888
Of course.

175
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,267
I have a motive too.

176
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,603
They have more than enough
to pin this on me.

177
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,688
But what I care about

178
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,691
isn't evidence or circumstances,

179
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,360
it's whether or not you trust me.

180
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,783
Would you trust me,

181
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,534
no matter what I said?

182
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,956
I said I didn't agree with how
you'd do anything to solve the case.

183
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,959
I didn't say I didn't trust you.

184
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,714
I was worried you might get hurt,
that's why I did it.

185
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,634
I'm sorry.

186
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:19,389
I'll never lie to you or hide anything
from you ever again.

187
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,475
I promise.

188
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,106
You trust me too, right?

189
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:32,152
I'm going to prove your innocence
no matter what,

190
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,696
so just hold on
a little longer until then.

191
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:40,744
I was going to try to act cool
so you wouldn't worry,

192
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,287
but you're so reassuring.

193
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,253
You're making me want

194
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,588
to feign ignorance and wait.

195
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:16,864
Prosecutor Cha's here to take
Mr. Shaman himself.

196
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,950
What do you want me to do?
Just send him on his way?

197
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:21,660
I'll go see him.

198
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:25,038
No, not Prosecutor Cha. Mr. Shaman.

199
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,207
You might not see him for a while.

200
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,251
Are you sure you don't want
to see him now?

201
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,631
I'll see him again soon enough. It's okay.

202
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,599
Damn it. Come on.

203
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,060
Just use whatever toilet there is,
why do you have to be so picky?

204
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,979
That one didn't have a bidet, damn it.

205
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,314
Goodness.

206
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,402
It's happening. It's coming out.

207
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,653
Oh, no.

208
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,946
Where do you want to go?

209
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,575
The Chief's office.
The restroom next to it has a bidet.

210
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,619
-Come on.
-Let's hurry.

211
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:07,206
Goddamn it. This is so gross.
You're driving me crazy.

212
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,374
I can smell it. Hurry.

213
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,834
Hurry up.

214
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:14,129
Hold it in.

215
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,173
Here.

216
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:18,300
Here.

217
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,093
What is it?

218
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,013
Come on, you have to uncuff me.
Are you going to wipe my butt?

219
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:23,972
Okay.

220
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,475
-There's no toilet paper.
-Toilet paper.

221
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,393
-Toilet paper.
-Toilet paper.

222
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,897
Hurry up.

223
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,369
It's been a while since they said
they were coming. They're late.

224
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,287
Was he that sick?

225
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,959
-Sick?
-Yes. He said his stomach hurt.

226
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:54,461
They said they'd take him
to the toilet before coming.

227
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,505
Find out where he is, now.

228
00:20:58,048 --> 00:20:59,424
-Yes, let's go.
-Right.

229
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,598
Could you check upstairs?

230
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,683
-Okay.
-Okay.

231
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,606
They're not answering their phones.

232
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,901
Nam Han-jun, the suspect that just left
the holding cell, has disappeared.

233
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,112
Check the CCTVs to track his movements

234
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,114
and send more people to aid in the search.

235
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,659
There.

236
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,843
Let's go.

237
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,897
I can't believe
you call yourselves detectives.

238
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,191
What are you doing? Unbelievable.

239
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,445
-They're here.
-Seriously, you're driving me crazy.

240
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,575
What happened?

241
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,660
Mr. Kong ambushed us.

242
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,454
This is so gross.

243
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,290
That hurts. Be gentle.

244
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,374
Hurry.

245
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,835
This time, you…

246
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:20,922
Get in.

247
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:27,596
Why did you have to let him
go to the bathroom?

248
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,348
Come on, he said he couldn't hold it,
so how could we not?

249
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,392
Yes, Mr. Shaman has rights too.

250
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:33,727
Rights, my foot.

251
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,522
Seriously, you two should be ashamed
of yourselves.

252
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,774
Stop it.

253
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,068
I asked all investigative agencies
to work with us,

254
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:42,736
so we'll catch him soon.

255
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,199
Can you think of where he might be hiding?

256
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,292
I think it's Mr. Nam.

257
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,670
Connect your phone to the location tracer
and put it on speaker.

258
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:01,588
Okay.

259
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,185
Hello?

260
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,604
Did I put you in a difficult situation?

261
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,564
I'm sorry.

262
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,316
Mr. Nam.

263
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,821
I asked you to wait. I told you I'd prove
your innocence any way I can.

264
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,781
So how could you run away like this?

265
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,992
It's not that I don't trust you.

266
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,204
Listen carefully, Jae-hui.

267
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:38,041
I think Gopuri has a spy in our midst.

268
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,376
That's why I ran.

269
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,761
"A spy in our midst"?
What are you talking about?

270
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,639
Think about it.

271
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,517
When we went to see Jung Hye-yoon,
moved Gu Tae-su,

272
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,519
and went to Auntie Im's temple,

273
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,105
how else could Gu Tae-su
have been a step ahead of us?

274
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,190
He knew beforehand that we were going.

275
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,779
That's just your theory,
we don't know that for sure.

276
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:11,158
That's why I'm going to find
concrete evidence before I go back.

277
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,118
I can't tell you now,

278
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:16,371
but I think I can figure out
Gopuri's identity soon.

279
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,664
But how?

280
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,040
You probably know this,

281
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,585
but you can't track my location,
so you might as well give up.

282
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:24,337
Trust me and wait just a little longer.

283
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,258
I'll come back after I catch Gopuri.

284
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,013
Mr. Nam.

285
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,389
Mr. Nam.

286
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:43,231
It's apparently coming from Estonia,
Sri Lanka, Djibouti, and Madagascar.

287
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,692
Hey, move. What are you talking about?

288
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:47,694
RESULTS: ESTONIA, SRI LANKA,
DJIBOUTI, MADAGASCAR

289
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:51,406
He's messing with us.

290
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:54,492
Put the first words together
and it says "give up" in Korean.

291
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,374
A traitor from the inside?

292
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,211
You don't think
Mr. Shaman's lying to us, do you?

293
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,378
He has a point.

294
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,131
There were three leaks.
It's unlikely to be a coincidence.

295
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,051
Wait, Han.

296
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,055
Are you saying there's a spy among us?

297
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:19,517
The day Gu Tae-su escaped,
didn't Mr. Jang have the key to the cuffs?

298
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:23,730
Right, I think Gu Tae-su whispered
something to him before he ran.

299
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,024
Jeez, you morons.

300
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:30,070
Hey, what's that look in your eyes?
So you suspect me?

301
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:32,989
It's not suspicion,
it's just what the situation indicates.

302
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,742
You said you knew Gu Tae-su
from when he was young.

303
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:38,912
What did you just say?
You little punk, I should just--

304
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,413
-Come here.
-Hey.

305
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:42,332
Come on, just let me go.

306
00:25:42,415 --> 00:25:45,043
Fine. That's right. I killed Auntie Im

307
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,712
and pinned it all on Mr. Shaman, happy?

308
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,464
I was right. He's the spy.

309
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,049
"Right"? You punk.

310
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:53,426
-Do you want to get beaten to a pulp?
-Stop fighting.

311
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,680
-Calm down.
-How can I calm down?

312
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,057
The ink's not even dry on his police ID,

313
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,519
and he's trying to ruin my life
by tarnishing my entire career.

314
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,980
-My neck. That hurts.
-I'm still young. How old are you, gramps?

315
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,898
-How old am I…
-Stop it!

316
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,986
-Please stop…
-Jeez.

317
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:21,246
Jeez, you punk.
Don't you know when to shut up?

318
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:24,207
Come on, it's all just a misunderstanding.

319
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,627
BROTHER

320
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,642
Now that I think about it, there have been

321
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,437
so many strange things about you
since you were a kid.

322
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,399
I wonder why
this never occurred to me then.

323
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,484
What are you trying to say?

324
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,445
Get to the point.

325
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,699
I saw everything.

326
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:01,328
You're the one who killed Auntie Im,
aren't you?

327
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,165
Three people went in together.
Yet one dies,

328
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,375
while the other two slip away covered
in blood?

329
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,419
Anyone would be suspicious.

330
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:12,714
Your face was caught on video,
nice and clear,

331
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,257
so don't try to deny it.

332
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:19,387
But you don't have me on video
killing Auntie Im.

333
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,264
You're going to keep acting like this?

334
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:25,602
Auntie Im, Dr. Jung, Hyeon-u,
you killed them all.

335
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,187
I had no idea it was you.

336
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,939
I thought I killed Hyeon-u,
so I obeyed when they sent me abroad.

337
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,943
It makes my skin crawl to think about
what you've put me through.

338
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,823
You want me to tell the world
that you're a psychopathic murderer?

339
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,492
You think I won't do it?

340
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:46,623
Do you really think that
threat's going to work on me?

341
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:51,002
You want to become the chairman of
Choekang Company, yet this is how

342
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,253
you do business?

343
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,964
In times like this,
you shouldn't threaten me.

344
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,468
You should offer me a deal.

345
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,303
A deal?

346
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:07,185
What you want is my shares
to Choekang, isn't it?

347
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:10,605
Yes. Give me all your shares.

348
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,525
-Then I'll delete this--
-I'm not going to give you

349
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,235
all my shares for that one video.

350
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,029
I have a condition.

351
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,200
Tell me.

352
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,285
There's someone who's been bothering me.

353
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,705
Hand them over to me by tomorrow,

354
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:31,209
then Choekang's chairman position
will be all yours.

355
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:42,595
DAEUN POLICE STATION

356
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,139
PROSECUTION SERVICE

357
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,516
I called because I was worried.

358
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,560
How are the detectives?

359
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,353
It's a complete mess.

360
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,148
Mr. Jang didn't even come to work today.

361
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,234
That's bad.

362
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,572
I'm trying to track Mr. Nam's movements

363
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:03,366
and get the info on the car we caught
on the CCTV camera.

364
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,201
I'll call you as soon as I find anything.

365
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:06,995
Okay.

366
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,706
I'm on my way to talk
to Director Cha right now.

367
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,667
He's suddenly being cooperative,
which is strange,

368
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:16,004
but I'll tighten the screws on him
and see if he knows anything.

369
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:19,215
Okay. Call me when you're done.

370
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,592
Okay.

371
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,157
Isn't that Lieutenant Han?

372
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,242
-Yes.
-Where?

373
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,664
That car looks like
it's following her, doesn't it?

374
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,000
Yes, it's pretty suspicious.

375
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,600
Hey, open the door.

376
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:12,894
Who are you and why are you following me?

377
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:15,730
Isn't that kidnapping?

378
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,150
-Follow them. You can't let them escape.
-Okay.

379
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,462
I've got her and I'm on my way
to the rendezvous point.

380
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,673
I don't know why he needs her,

381
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,383
but keep her alive for now.

382
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,300
Yes, sir.

383
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,769
We're being followed.
Lose them at the next intersection.

384
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:55,937
Yes, sir.

385
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:15,540
-Damn it.
-What do we do now?

386
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,751
What do you think? We call for help.

387
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:19,711
What?

388
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,931
Mr. Cha.

389
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:35,268
Mr. Nam, what's going on?
Everyone's looking for you.

390
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,394
I need your help.

391
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:38,730
It's Jae-hui, she's been kidnapped.

392
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:42,233
What? Kidnapped?
What are you talking about?

393
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,778
Jae-hui went to see Cha Seung-won,
and I think she's been kidnapped.

394
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,906
We need to find her right now,
but I lost the car.

395
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:55,496
You were keeping an eye on Seung-won too?

396
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,166
I don't have time to explain.
You can track Jae-hui's location, right?

397
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,586
I'll trace her phone's location
and call you back right away.

398
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,504
Okay, thank you.

399
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,298
I won't forget this.

400
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,320
That was amazing, I mean it.

401
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:31,199
-I thought I was watching a movie.
-You deserve an Oscar.

402
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:35,161
Cha Do-won, that psychopathic pervert.

403
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,330
How dare you take me for a fool?

404
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,375
You're going to get back exactly…

405
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,752
No, it's going to be much worse for you.

406
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,004
That's right.

407
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:57,809
But what do you mean, pretend
you don't know anything?

408
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,353
Did you think of something?

409
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:01,604
No.

410
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:06,150
But could you ask Su-cheol
and Hye-jun to come here?

411
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:10,154
Oh, and gather the Major Crimes
Investigation Division Seven detectives.

412
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,197
Why?

413
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,704
I found out who Gopuri is.

414
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:35,638
Jeez, he killed a lot of people. Damn it.

415
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,559
Choi Seok-yun, Cho Ju-min,

416
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:44,022
Kim Go-ni?
Have we confirmed all their identities?

417
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:47,900
The file that Auntie Im had contained
information on the other victims.

418
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,194
But there might be more.

419
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,612
More…

420
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,281
Victims?

421
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:57,285
Even with Gu Tae-su's help,
I can't believe the same guy did all this.

422
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,453
It doesn't make any sense.

423
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,082
That's why I was confused.

424
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,422
The signature MO

425
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:14,385
made me think that Gopuri
committed all these murders.

426
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,721
It turns out that
Gopuri wasn't just one person,

427
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,264
it was three people.

428
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:28,524
Because of the MO, these cases all look
like they're in the same category,

429
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,485
but they have different motives.

430
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,946
Desire, execution, hindrance.

431
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,324
They can be divided
into these three categories.

432
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:37,784
The first,

433
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,453
Jeon Gyeong-cheol, Kang Eun-hye.

434
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:45,792
"Desire."

435
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,510
Auntie Im had them killed
because of her own greed.

436
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,095
The second.

437
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,392
HAN JAE-JEONG

438
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,945
Jae-jeong was murdered

439
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:17,657
because he was in the way.

440
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,243
Yes.

441
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:23,621
Jae-jeong…

442
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:24,914
I think I found the link

443
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,625
that connects the victim, Choi Yeong-seop,
and the killer together.

444
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,253
He found conclusive evidence
about the killer's identity,

445
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,338
so the killer killed him
and took that file.

446
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,262
Choi Yeong-seop, Lim Min-jun,
Jung Hye-yoon,

447
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:44,851
and Auntie Im were all killed because
the killer was afraid he'd be found out.

448
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,398
HINDRANCE

449
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,234
As for the last category of victims.

450
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,951
EXECUTION

451
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,038
It was execution.

452
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:07,707
Yes.

453
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,877
Right. Look.

454
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,214
These people all cleverly eluded the law.

455
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,385
None were indicted and they all escaped.

456
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:25,850
The even more astounding fact is that
they're all currently dead or missing.

457
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:30,646
He believed himself to be justice itself
and executed them.

458
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,191
Gu Tae-su was following his orders.

459
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:37,445
I get that the man behind Auntie Im
and Gu Tae-su is the real killer.

460
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,948
So who on earth is he?

461
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,080
Someone everyone here all knows.

462
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:00,259
He worked in the regional office
that let the murdered criminals go

463
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:03,346
and led us to think
Cha Seung-won was the killer.

464
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:05,932
The real killer,
who used Gu Tae-su to play the judge

465
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,893
and killed Jae-jeong
when he got in his way.

466
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,735
Prosecutor Cha Do-won.

467
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,862
He's the killer.

468
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,835
Mr. Shaman.
Isn't that taking the joke too far?

469
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,963
I'm sure it's not him.

470
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:41,342
You all know how hard he worked
to catch the killer.

471
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,593
That's what I'm saying.

472
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,638
It'd be easier to believe

473
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:48,307
that Gu Tae-su killed Auntie Im

474
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,686
after he escaped and pinned it all on you.

475
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:56,691
The day of the murder,
Cha Seung-won followed Prosecutor Cha.

476
00:37:57,858 --> 00:38:01,654
And this is the footage from the black box
on Cha Seung-won's car.

477
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:12,081
Of course, it was obtained illegally,
so it won't be admissible as evidence.

478
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,721
This is freaking shocking.
I'm having a meltdown. I have goosebumps.

479
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,307
You've got to be kidding me, damn it.

480
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:33,227
So he's been hanging around us
saying he wants to help while doing that?

481
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,147
He totally stabbed us
in the freaking back.

482
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,274
He must have thought
we were a complete joke.

483
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:02,840
You're Prosecutor Han's sister, right?

484
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,134
I'm Cha Do-won, the prosecutor in charge.

485
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,803
When Choi Yeong-seop wakes up,

486
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,598
I'll be able to learn
why my brother died, right?

487
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,184
I'm sure you will.

488
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:18,773
I was sure it was Choi Yeong-seop too.

489
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:23,944
I guess Mr. Nam Han-jun was
the only one who saw through everything.

490
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:28,240
He must be laughing at me
somewhere even now.

491
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,118
Let's catch the killer together,
the two of us.

492
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,915
Can you not go?

493
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,671
I like you a lot, Jae-hui.

494
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,552
This wasn't how I wanted to tell you…

495
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:54,350
Jae-jeong must have found out
who Gopuri was.

496
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:57,686
So that's why he killed Prosecutor Han.

497
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:17,016
Don't hold it in. Just cry or get angry.

498
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,392
Or it'll make you sick.

499
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:23,772
I'll do all of that
after we catch Prosecutor Cha.

500
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,916
Well, then we'll just catch him.

501
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,376
We found the phantom Gopuri.

502
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,004
Prosecutor Cha is right in front of us.
Of course we can catch him.

503
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:50,090
And I'm sure our Mr. Shaman has a plan.

504
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,635
That's right.
Hurry up and say that you do.

505
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,137
Of course, I do.

506
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,808
We'll use Cha Seung-won as bait.

507
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,479
Cha Seung-won has a strong desire
to be recognized.

508
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,856
He's fixated on inheriting Choekang
because of his desire

509
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,068
to be recognized by his father and
the lack of affection he's had.

510
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:11,570
He just needs Prosecutor Cha's shares

511
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,114
to become the Chairman.

512
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,658
There's no way he'll let it go.

513
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:22,498
If Prosecutor Cha really is the killer,
he's not going to stand aside either.

514
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,875
That's what we're counting on.

515
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:27,211
Based on his pattern so far,

516
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:30,506
he's definitely going to try to kill
Cha Seung-won.

517
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,258
We'll set the trap and wait,

518
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:35,094
and the moment Prosecutor Cha shows
his true colors…

519
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,179
We'll arrest him.

520
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,433
He's not going to be easy to trap.

521
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:42,434
That's why

522
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:46,313
I'm going to mess with his head too.

523
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:47,731
What?

524
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,568
I'm going to escape the station,

525
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,778
which will make Division Seven collapse.

526
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,760
-Detective Kim.
-Yes.

527
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:17,928
You're okay?

528
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:20,222
You almost killed me, seriously.
That hurt so much.

529
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,474
Mr. Kong, you too. Why are you all so…

530
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,685
You don't know how to make it realistic.

531
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:25,811
What?

532
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:27,062
-Let's go.
-Yes, okay.

533
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,480
-Good luck.
-Okay.

534
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,567
Good luck.

535
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,736
Your nose. It's bleeding.

536
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,405
Listen carefully, Jae-hui.

537
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:40,451
I think Gopuri has a spy in our midst.

538
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:41,827
That's why I ran.

539
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,456
If you aren't guilty,

540
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,625
-why do you keep interrupting me?
-Let go of me.

541
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,710
Are you guilty? Yes, I can see that!

542
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:51,211
-Aren't you?
-Do I feel guilty?

543
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,297
-You do? Don't you?
-Stop it!

544
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,924
-Come on.
-Jeez.

545
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,593
-Gosh.
-What, you punk?

546
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:00,804
You want those to be your last words?
Is that your will?

547
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,014
I'm going to live a long life.

548
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:05,309
-My neck! That hurts.
-I'm still young. How old are you, gramps?

549
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,686
-You punk, how old are you?
-How old are you, gramps?

550
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,438
How old are you? You punk.

551
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,482
I'm still young. How old are you, gramps?

552
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,658
Stop it!

553
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:25,120
Please stop.

554
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,998
Jeez!

555
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,337
Fuck.

556
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,769
My heart is beating like crazy.

557
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,397
-You did well.
-I did do well.

558
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,358
Someone bothering you?
You mean that shaman from Minamdang?

559
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:56,402
No, Lieutenant Han Jae-hui.

560
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,529
Call me when you have her
and the black box ready.

561
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,157
Okay. 5 p.m. tomorrow.

562
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:05,911
Come to the closed-down amusement park
in the Jakdu-dong development site.

563
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,330
Okay.

564
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:14,253
That scum's trying to lure me in
using Jae-hui as bait.

565
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:17,673
He's going to get rid of me
and Cha Seung-won at the same time.

566
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,926
I can play the bait. That's nothing.

567
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,219
No, it's too dangerous.

568
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,096
Yes, you can't.

569
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,515
Who knows
what those crazy idiots will do? No.

570
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,475
I need to be kidnapped so they'll think

571
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,811
their plan is working
and they let their guard down.

572
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:34,356
Still, I can't let you go on your own.
Who knows what they'll do to you?

573
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,108
I'm not going alone.

574
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:38,235
If anything goes wrong,
my team's going to rescue me,

575
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,404
so what's there to worry about? Right?

576
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,738
-Of course.
-Of course.

577
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:45,409
You don't need to worry
about Lieutenant Han here,

578
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,872
it's the guys who'll kidnap Han the Ghost
that you should be worrying about.

579
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,625
Yes, exactly. I'm Han the Ghost.

580
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,627
So trust me just this once, okay?

581
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,339
But you have to promise
you won't get hurt.

582
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,424
I promise. Here.

583
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:05,804
-Oh, my. Were you worried?
-Promise me you won't get hurt.

584
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:08,307
-Okay.
-Promise.

585
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,393
-Do you want to die?
-Du-jin, promise me too.

586
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,645
-You little…
-Du-jin, no cursing.

587
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:15,022
-I'm going to kill you.
-I'm sorry.

588
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,651
Now.

589
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:23,739
Cha Do-won will be
keeping an eye on us from here.

590
00:46:23,822 --> 00:46:26,283
But we should cut off all routes,
just in case.

591
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:28,952
Block that exit too.

592
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,664
-Damn it.
-How much more is there?

593
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,125
-We're done.
-My god.

594
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,045
-Gosh.
-My.

595
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,348
We block this place off.

596
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,599
And over there…

597
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,434
Okay. It's going to go well, right?

598
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:53,852
It will. Don't you trust me?

599
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,104
-You just do your part.
-Okay.

600
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,856
So we'll each be placed…

601
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:01,276
Jang Du-jin. Kim Sang-hyeop.

602
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,612
-Yes.
-Han Jae-hui.

603
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:06,031
And then our next rendezvous point

604
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:08,951
is here at the merry-go-round.

605
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,536
-Han-jun.
-Yes.

606
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,789
Gwang-tae and Kong Su-cheol.

607
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:16,583
-Anyway, let's do this. Let's begin.
-Okay.

608
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,836
I see they're both over 180cm.

609
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,630
Is anyone here over 180cm?

610
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,715
-183cm.
-Okay.

611
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,342
-All right.
-Nice.

612
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:27,344
If you mess up this time, you're dead.

613
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,192
Hey, that's not it.

614
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,860
I'll go get some water.

615
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,697
Hey, come on. Gosh, what is this?

616
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,407
What was that? You startled me.

617
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,325
You are fast.

618
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,285
Did you see that?

619
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:53,829
That was perfect.

620
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:58,000
Now, shall we go and get me kidnapped?

621
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:01,378
Okay, let's put our hands together
and say "let's go."

622
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,423
We'll raise our hands. On three.

623
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:06,383
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

624
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,432
I'm going this slow,
and they still can't catch me?

625
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:25,235
Hey. Who are you
and why are you following me?

626
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:30,032
Hey, wait.

627
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:32,242
What is that? That's not kidnapping.

628
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,911
Come on, she's basically
kidnapped herself.

629
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,083
-Let's go.
-Okay.

630
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,756
What about the detectives?
Are they following her?

631
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,509
They're following her at a steady pace,
thanks to the distraction we created.

632
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,303
Everything's going according to plan.

633
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:54,222
Now, it's our turn.

634
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:58,685
Yes. Let's give them
a good taste of their own medicine.

635
00:48:58,769 --> 00:48:59,770
-Yes.
-Yes.

636
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,321
I've got the woman you told me about.

637
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,615
Get ready to transfer the shares
and get out here.

638
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,076
What a dick.

639
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,372
Once I have the shares,
I'm going after you too.

640
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,377
WELCOME TO JAKDU LAND

641
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,878
-Where are we?
-I'm sorry, sir.

642
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,505
I think we came to the wrong…

643
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:29,132
No. This is it.
You came to the right place.

644
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,842
-Who are you people?
-Who are you?

645
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,470
Help!

646
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:12,634
I've confirmed that Gu Tae-su
has kidnapped Detective Han.

647
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:16,138
I'll signal you when he gets here,
then get Lieutenant Han out.

648
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,983
I've found where Lieutenant Han is.

649
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:30,360
Where is she?

650
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:33,947
She's at a closed-down amusement park,
Jakdu Land.

651
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,908
Okay, I'm on my way.
Can you call for backup?

652
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:38,660
Okay.

653
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:57,095
Cha Seung-won and Secretary Nam will make
their entrance in five minutes. Get ready.

654
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,848
What? Is Detective Na even ready?
I don't know where he is.

655
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:02,017
-He's not responding.
-Why is he not responding?

656
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,060
What are you doing? Go check.

657
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,021
Damn it.

658
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,356
Run.

659
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,238
Detective.

660
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:16,156
Damn it.

661
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:19,284
Detective.

662
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,327
Detective Na…

663
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,828
You have to wake up.

664
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,539
Mom? Mom.

665
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,960
"Relaxation solution"?
Did he drink the whole thing?

666
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,923
Damn it. This is bad.

667
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,800
We're in trouble. Detective Na drank

668
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:37,093
a whole bottle of some relaxant
and passed out.

669
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,223
We're only just getting started.
Why are things already messing up?

670
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,475
So do we just go ahead
without Secretary Nam?

671
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:46,686
He'll definitely find it weird
if Cha Seung-won comes on his own.

672
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,315
Then

673
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:57,280
I'll step into the role.

674
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,285
Are you serious?

675
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:05,121
Do you remember what we rehearsed?

676
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:12,212
I had a bad feeling
about Gwang-tae for some reason.

677
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,172
I'll have to step in.

678
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,259
You can handle it here on your own, right?

679
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,595
Well, I think I can get Lieutenant Han out
somehow.

680
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:23,807
But you're really going to do this?
Are you sure? You didn't even rehearse.

681
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,934
There are no rehearsals in real life.

682
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,269
You know me.

683
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,729
I'm not a very patient man.

684
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:31,815
I just go for it.

685
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,401
Watch my back.

686
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:53,837
Director Cha got here first.

687
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,761
Okay.

688
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,347
No.

689
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,599
Right.

690
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,088
Jae-hui!

691
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,387
Nam Han-jun's here too.

692
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,557
Once one of them dies,
whoever that might be,

693
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:49,601
we'll finish things off.

694
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,733
Yes, it's me.

695
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,694
I've just transferred 30% of the shares.

696
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:01,321
That's for the black box footage.

697
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,031
And the rest?

698
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,241
Nam Han-jun will arrive soon.

699
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,578
Kill him.

700
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:11,331
Then I'll give you the rest of the shares.

701
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,750
That ought to make this deal fair.

702
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:16,920
Because I have your dirty secret,

703
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:19,506
you want to have one on me too?

704
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,676
The real nuisance is

705
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,138
Nam Han-jun.

706
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,891
He'll submit once he finds out
you have Lieutenant Han,

707
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,267
so he'll be easy to kill.

708
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:32,602
Call me when it's over.

709
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,150
Jae-hui.

710
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,862
Where's Lieutenant Han?

711
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,369
Instead of a shaman,
he should have been an actor.

712
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,037
He is something, he really is.

713
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,581
Gwang-tae, you can do it.

714
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:58,545
-Gwang-tae, Sang-hyeop, Du-jin, go.
-What's that? Detective Na?

715
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:01,631
Damn it. Detective Na, that moron.
Why does he have to show up now?

716
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,091
-Jae-hui.
-Damn it. Hurry.

717
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,803
Du-jin, Jae-hui, Sang-hyeop,
Gwang-tae, you can do it.

718
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:07,887
Come here.

719
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,146
What is it? What's going on?

720
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,441
I can go to Su-cheol now, right?

721
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,276
Is Jae-hui okay?

722
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:28,074
Yes. I'm on my way to rescue her.

723
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:30,285
Yes.

724
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:39,586
Damn it. Nothing's going right.

725
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,384
What the hell? Who are you?

726
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:49,095
Don't come near me. Stay back.

727
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,014
Stay back.

728
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,932
Gosh.

729
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:12,327
Lieutenant Han.

730
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:13,828
Detective Kim.

731
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:19,626
Han Jae-hui. Where did you hide her?

732
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:23,713
Well.

733
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:28,676
Well, it looks like we have
an uninvited guest.

734
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,888
Hey, you idiot.
Prosecutor Cha can't hear you like that.

735
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:32,972
You need to speak louder.

736
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:39,187
Well, it looks like we have
an uninvited guest!

737
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:42,315
You practiced the whole day yesterday
and can't even memorize that one line.

738
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:44,484
You idiot. I'm going to kill you later.

739
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,529
Tell me where you hid Han Jae-hui.

740
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:50,698
My people are guarding her,
so no need to worry.

741
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,117
Gopuri, you bastard.

742
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,868
Nam.

743
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:54,953
Take care of him.

744
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,498
I'm really going to kill you later.

745
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:08,675
You've got a knife out already as if
to tell the world that you're a villain.

746
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:12,720
-Come on.
-Nam Han-jun, you bastard. Just die.

747
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:19,227
-That had to hurt.
-Why did it sound like…

748
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,229
Oh, god.

749
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,399
You're bleeding.

750
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:31,906
Detective Jang, calm down.
You know I didn't do it on purpose, right?

751
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:33,992
Okay.

752
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:38,413
Damn it. Why is the fake one here?

753
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,665
That had to hurt.

754
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,126
Wait, so that's real blood?

755
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:47,672
Gosh.

756
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:49,507
Prosecutor Cha…

757
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:54,971
Come on, Prosecutor Cha's watching.

758
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:56,014
Calm down.

759
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:01,728
Why are your eyes…

760
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,815
Good, it looks totally real now.

761
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:10,069
I think he's really in character.
What do we do?

762
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,279
He's scaring me.

763
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:12,363
Die.

764
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:14,908
Hey, wait.

765
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,161
Director.

766
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,288
I'll protect you.

767
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:21,748
-What?
-He's acting kind of strange.

768
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:25,877
Jeez, whatever.

769
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:32,050
Nam, are you okay?

770
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,218
Director.

771
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:35,678
I'm okay.

772
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:36,846
Director?

773
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,144
Is he dead?

774
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,481
Let's hurry up before Cha catches on.

775
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:48,775
Come on.

776
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:49,984
Die.

777
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,660
You okay?

778
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,453
Didn't you file the edges? That stings.

779
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,418
One, two, three.

780
00:59:07,502 --> 00:59:08,753
One, two, three.

781
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,756
I'm going to grab you now.
One, two, three.

782
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,355
Why aren't you lying down? Die already.

783
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:31,985
No.

784
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:53,715
Mr. Nam,
you have such a hard grip on life.

785
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:08,062
Prosecutor Cha.
I knew you were the killer.

786
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:13,151
Why are you only catching on now?
I'm so disappointed in you.

787
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:33,504
EPILOGUE

788
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,799
Just tell me already.

789
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,426
Do you people know who I am?

790
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:41,804
My god, he's so mouthy.
Just pour the cement already.

791
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:46,059
Why does he want to tell us so badly
who he is? Hey, just pour it.

792
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,268
Yes, okay.

793
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:49,812
What?

794
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:51,272
What do you think you're doing?

795
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:54,525
Wait, hold on. I'll tell you everything.

796
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:58,029
Director Cha did come up with
the Jakdu-dong scheme with Auntie Im.

797
01:00:58,112 --> 01:00:59,864
-I have the proof too.
-Shut up.

798
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:01,491
-You shut up.
-Keep talking.

799
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:03,826
-He's known Auntie Im for long.
-Shut up, you asshole.

800
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,496
Be quiet, don't talk down to me,
I'm older than you.

801
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:07,622
-Are you crazy?
-Crazy?

802
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:09,707
You crazy asshole.
I can curse you out too.

803
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,167
-Come here, you bastard.
-Come at me.

804
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,086
-I'll tell you.
-You little…

805
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,796
I'll get you out, so tell the truth.

806
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,506
-I've worked here for 15 years…
-Shut up.

807
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:19,258
He told me to talk. You stay quiet then.
I have to tell him.

808
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,260
Then just die there. You asshole.

809
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:27,725
My goodness.

810
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:29,227
You can't leave me here.

811
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,729
You told me you'd let me live
if I told you.

812
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:33,690
Can we just leave them like that?

813
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:36,484
It's okay, that's not cement. It's mud.

814
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,017
Jae-hui!

815
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:11,894
"The shaman who was killed

816
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,730
by a serial killer while trying
to rescue a kidnapped detective."

817
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:14,897
I let Cha Do-won get away.

818
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:18,276
He's going all sorts of places
when there's an APB out on him.

819
01:02:18,359 --> 01:02:21,070
I think he's chasing after the people
on that list to kill them

820
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:22,613
So this is like a "Death-Note."

821
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:26,200
This means he has no intention
of stopping his murder spree.

822
01:02:26,284 --> 01:02:27,869
We'd have a chance at catching him.

823
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:30,246
My target has always been you,
Mr. Nam Han-jun.

824
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:33,916
Why don't you just admit it already?
You're just a lowlife murderer.

825
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,753
You're not some righteous grand judge
that you think you are.

826
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:41,841
