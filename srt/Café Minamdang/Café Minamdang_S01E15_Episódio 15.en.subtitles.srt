00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:39,831
EPISODE 15

2
00:00:44,252 --> 00:00:47,505
The rest of you seal off the building
and make sure no one leaves.

3
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,008
Division Seven will go
straight to the ceremony hall.

4
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,050
Go in and take your positions.

5
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,594
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

6
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,026
There are all these reporters here,
what a disgrace…

7
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,196
Being disgraced isn't the issue.
We'll all be arrested at this rate!

8
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,865
Drag them off the stage
then come guard us!

9
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,621
What are you doing?

10
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,498
Stop filming.

11
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,875
Slow down.

12
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:24,959
Gosh.

13
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:27,045
They always do this
when they get cornered.

14
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,425
Who are you people?

15
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,803
-Hey!
-What's going on?

16
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,970
Go back.

17
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,931
-You can't come in here.
-Move.

18
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,057
I guess it's time for some action.

19
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,517
Take it easy, come on.

20
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,435
It's not like this is your fault.

21
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:43,645
Let's go.

22
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,360
Get them.

23
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,594
You little punks.

24
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,315
Tie them up.

25
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:35,321
Should such a corrupt project continue?

26
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:39,450
Of course not. Who knows
how many other sins they've committed?

27
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,702
You're all screwed now.

28
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:41,995
Right.

29
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,167
That hurt.

30
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,170
-This is why I don't like fighting.
-It hurts.

31
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,883
Look over there!

32
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:56,342
-What?
-What's that?

33
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,802
Oh, my.

34
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,053
Unbelievable.

35
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,601
Are you okay?

36
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,936
-Oh, my.
-I can't believe this!

37
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,563
-Goodness!
-Oh, my.

38
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:09,689
Damn it.

39
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,483
That reminds me.

40
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,778
Kang Eun-hye.
Has the case been taken care of?

41
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:18,990
You should have taken it easy, Mayor.

42
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,783
She should have taken it easy.

43
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,162
She went crazy for the drugs
and just wouldn't stop struggling.

44
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,080
I was only going to scare her.

45
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,957
Who knew she'd die so easily?

46
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,960
It's all been taken care of.
You don't have to worry.

47
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,134
Im Hui-suk.

48
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,389
You're under arrest for drug trafficking
and coercion of a minor into prostitution.

49
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,517
You have the right to remain silent,
and the right to an attorney.

50
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,270
You think the likes of you can catch me?

51
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,855
I did so much for this project.

52
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,358
Exactly. Why do something like this?

53
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,151
It's a road that leads right to jail.

54
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,073
Now be good and wait here.

55
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,748
Hey, isn't that guy running away
Cha Seung-won?

56
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,833
Yes, it is. I'll go.

57
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,503
Sir, why don't you take this?

58
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:16,673
-I invented it. It's a laughing gas gun…
-No, thank you.

59
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,426
This is really great…

60
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:23,888
TOP BODYGUARD

61
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,891
What are you doing here?

62
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,560
What do you think?
You have to come with me.

63
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,904
Let's get out of here.

64
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,992
-What is this?
-Where are you going?

65
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,126
What…

66
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,045
-Now!
-Yes.

67
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,464
Bye.

68
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,009
I was afraid we wouldn't get to use it
after all that hard work last night.

69
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:03,428
Ta-da.

70
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,765
What the hell?

71
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,183
What is this?

72
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,311
-What are you doing?
-This is why Mr. Shaman

73
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:14,939
-told us to rig it over the red carpet.
-It was the perfect spot to catch them.

74
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,234
Wow, I can't believe
that crazy plan actually worked.

75
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,862
It is simply the will

76
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,739
of the spirits.

77
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,490
Cha Seung-won's been apprehended.

78
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,576
What are you doing?
The police can't do this!

79
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,995
I happen to know your chief very well.

80
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:33,082
I'm going to ruin every one of you
and your mother. You'd better be ready.

81
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,709
You still don't get it.
I should just stomp on you all.

82
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:38,796
-A minor? How dare you? You beasts!
-Yes, you lowlives. Repent in prison!

83
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,299
Lee Myeong-jun, Park Jeong-hyeon,
Nam Pil-gu.

84
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,760
You are under arrest
for the rape of a minor,

85
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:46,763
murder, the use of illegal drugs,
and more.

86
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,891
You have the right to remain silent,
and the right to an attorney,

87
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:54,353
and anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

88
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,022
Thank you for your help.

89
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,899
-You too.
-Yes.

90
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,652
Where's Auntie Im?

91
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,821
Over there.

92
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,365
Hey, don't raise your heads.

93
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,784
-Put them back down.
-Put them down.

94
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:13,247
-Shoot.
-Damn it.

95
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:23,800
They're here.

96
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,426
-There.
-They're here.

97
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,844
-Hurry.
-Let's go.

98
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,179
-Here.
-Come on.

99
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,555
Who is it?

100
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,934
-Sir. Over here.
-Please look here.

101
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:35,061
Is the leaked video real?

102
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:38,523
We offer our sincerest apologies

103
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:42,276
to the bereaved
and to the citizens of this country.

104
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,445
We feel a heavy responsibility

105
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,073
for the mistakes that occurred
during the investigation

106
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,909
of Ms. Kang Eun-hye's murder.

107
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:55,623
We promise you that we will investigate
the truth of this matter

108
00:06:56,207 --> 00:07:00,211
with great thoroughness
and expose all of the corruption

109
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:03,381
associated with the Jakdu-dong
Land Development Project.

110
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,800
Goodness.

111
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,888
Hello, sir.
Why don't you have a drink of water?

112
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,348
-Chief Kim.
-Yes, sir.

113
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:14,767
Prosecutor Cha here doesn't get it.

114
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,186
This case is going
to peter out in the end,

115
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,856
so make him understand that it'd be better
not to waste the energy.

116
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,780
How dare you talk like that to me,
you goddamn criminal.

117
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,325
Hey, you think you're some hot shot
just because I brought you some water?

118
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:35,246
I brought it so it'd jolt you awake
and knock some sense into you. Got it?

119
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:40,710
I'm the Chief of Police, what do you think
you're doing trying to boss me around?

120
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,921
This time, the evidence is so strong that

121
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,507
the case isn't going to peter out.

122
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,555
Soliciting the prostitution of a minor,
overseas gambling,

123
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:55,892
use of illegal drugs,
illegal real estate speculation…

124
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,853
Jeez, there's so much
I'm getting tired just saying it.

125
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:02,899
Anyway, do you admit to the fact
that you received the aforementioned

126
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:07,028
bribes for approving
the Jakdu-dong land development project?

127
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:10,531
No. I was only doing
what Auntie Im told me to do.

128
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:14,118
Hey, you're the mayor. Not that shaman.

129
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:23,211
Jeez. This is so disgusting
I can't even look at it.

130
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,005
Pick a picture.
I need to put one in the report.

131
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,758
-I'll make sure it packs a punch.
-It's going to cause a stir.

132
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,219
It'd better.
After all the crimes they committed.

133
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,721
You little pricks…

134
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:38,476
Come on, Mr. Nam told you to confess all
and beg for forgiveness,

135
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,229
not to take the fall for everything.

136
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:45,816
Why are you denying
Cha Seung-won's involvement?

137
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,902
None of the evidence here

138
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:52,532
is direct proof of Mr. Cha's involvement.

139
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,575
Would I be correct

140
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,162
in thinking that what you just said means
you're going to tell us everything

141
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,040
if there's conclusive proof of
Cha Seung-won's involvement?

142
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:07,046
Thank you for saving my father's life
and exposing the Jakdu-dong scam, sir.

143
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:11,592
I know this is nowhere near enough,
but it's a small token of my gratitude.

144
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,895
Come on. You didn't have to.

145
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,482
SCAN THE QR CODE

146
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,276
"Scan the QR code"?

147
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,491
Hey, I told you to show
your thanks with money.

148
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,912
Mr. Shaman's not the sort
of person who's motivated by money.

149
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,253
NATION'S FINEST SHAMAN
NAM HAN-JUN'S FAN CLUB

150
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:50,298
This is so damn funny.
It says he's the nation's finest.

151
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,215
Nation's finest?

152
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,602
What is this sound?

153
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,487
You never heard someone eat a lollipop?

154
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:17,283
You bunch of liars.
You two are secretly dating, aren't you?

155
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,744
Amazing. You hear this sort of thing too?

156
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:23,664
No, Mr. Shaman. It's not true.

157
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,958
I thought we were dating.

158
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,251
Hey, I'm not even divorced yet.

159
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,712
-But that day, you--
-Quiet.

160
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,172
Stop.

161
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,216
Now isn't the time for dating.

162
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,428
Come on, Mr. Shaman,
do you still have things left to do?

163
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,390
Cha Seung-won.
He needs to be taken care of

164
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:44,852
if you want your father to be safe.

165
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,270
True.

166
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,898
The land development project
has been canceled.

167
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,608
That son of a devil will retaliate.

168
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,986
He knows your face now,
so you have to be careful too.

169
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,365
That's true.
What if something happens to Mr. Shaman?

170
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:59,158
With the lawyers that Cha has,

171
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,494
they'll get him released
from custody for sure.

172
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,120
I know.

173
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,623
Jeez.

174
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,962
INTERROGATION ROOM

175
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,138
SINMYEONG

176
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,479
Mr. Cha.

177
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:31,899
You colluded with Lee Myeong-jun, Park
Jeong-hyeon, Nam Pil-gu, and Auntie Im

178
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:35,236
and took part in the Jakdu-dong
land development project, right?

179
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,363
He did take part in the project,

180
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:41,534
but he had no idea
that anything illegal was involved.

181
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,327
Or he wouldn't have taken part in it.

182
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,413
This could determine
the future of his company…

183
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,332
For a project that could determine
the future of his company,

184
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,919
he made a rather rash decision.
He didn't even properly vet it.

185
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:55,423
So how did you come to take part
in the project?

186
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:59,635
That wasn't Mr. Cha's doing,
it was decided by the Planning Office…

187
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,305
I did make the final decision,

188
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,766
but my mistake was trusting Auntie Im.

189
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,436
You must have trusted her quite deeply.

190
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,230
She was close with my family
since my father's time.

191
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:15,651
So that's why you gave her
such unconditional trust?

192
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:18,237
Do you think it makes sense
that a head of a conglomerate went ahead

193
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,991
with a business worth hundreds
of billions over what a shaman said?

194
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,453
It's not so much
that I believed in Auntie Im 100 percent.

195
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,875
I trusted the mayor, the assemblyman,
the prosecutors, and my uncle,

196
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,461
who told me she could be trusted.

197
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:35,588
I guess I had been pretty naive.

198
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:47,516
It looks like they're trying to pin
everything on Auntie Im.

199
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,227
The 48 hours are almost up,
what should we do?

200
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:54,356
Park Dong-gi also stated Cha Seung-won
never gave him direct orders…

201
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,609
He'll be released due to
insufficient evidence.

202
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:02,573
You had real estate in Jakdu-dong
under someone else's name, didn't you?

203
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,283
Do you have proof of that?

204
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,287
I don't, but I do have a witness.

205
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,080
We can discuss this in court

206
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,500
after you check
whether this witness is reliable.

207
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,298
The 48 hours are up.

208
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,259
Do you have solid evidence
to prove his charges?

209
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,554
If not, I'll escort Mr. Cha out.

210
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,681
Let's go, sir.

211
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:08,097
Well, until next time, Mr. Cha.

212
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:16,689
Seung-won.

213
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,530
It's not too late to confess
and pay for your crimes.

214
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,701
You're so bent on arresting
your own brother.

215
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,744
What brotherly love.

216
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,582
You better watch it since Father's
no longer here to protect you.

217
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:39,128
You think Father would have chosen you

218
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,630
as the heir if I weren't in the picture?

219
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,842
Even if I weren't,
you wouldn't have got the job.

220
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,927
-What?
-Why do you think he gave me

221
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,179
the shares of Choekang
when I was so against it?

222
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,307
I couldn't understand why at the time,

223
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,933
but I think I do now.

224
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,436
Because he wanted me to stop you
from becoming the chairman.

225
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:02,067
You should know
there are limits to my tolerance.

226
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,110
I see.

227
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:06,322
Aren't you afraid all this impudence
might make me

228
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,240
rip you apart?

229
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:16,665
The more you struggle, the farther
you'll be from becoming the chairman.

230
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,959
I'm going to make you pay
for everything you did,

231
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,794
even the ones from the past.

232
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,426
The incident from 20 years ago.

233
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:32,348
You might have forgotten all about it,

234
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,600
but I still remember.

235
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,144
And you won't be able to run
like you did last time.

236
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:46,695
CHOEKANG CONSTRUCTION

237
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,322
How many shares do we have so far?

238
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:52,409
Because of the project cancellation,
we didn't hit our target profit.

239
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:55,704
The press is reporting
your alleged corruption,

240
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,915
and the police are tightening their net,

241
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,919
so we can't access the money
from the borrowed-name accounts.

242
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,630
What if we use the secret fund
in Singapore?

243
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,925
Auntie Im's been managing
the paper company there,

244
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,177
and I think she must have secretly moved

245
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:13,555
the money to other overseas accounts
as the money was being laundered.

246
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,433
So can you or can you not find my money?

247
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,728
If we find Auntie Im
and extract the information from her--

248
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,772
You useless parasites!

249
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,570
I pay you all that money
and this is the best you can do?

250
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:35,619
Do whatever you can to get the shares
by the shareholder's meeting,

251
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,747
or you're all dead.

252
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,005
What is it?

253
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,965
The board of directors won't hold the vote

254
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,759
for the chairman
in the next shareholder's meeting.

255
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,096
They said the vote should be deferred
until your investigation is over.

256
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,390
They filed to delay the vote.

257
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,840
I told you to keep an eye on Do-won.

258
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,175
I'm sorry, sir.

259
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,473
How much does he know?

260
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,229
How does Do-won know those
people who ruined the ceremony?

261
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,732
He's a shaman who runs
a café called Minamdang.

262
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,277
Your brother's been in contact
with them rather often lately.

263
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,239
The shaman was also the one
who raided the club.

264
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,574
Nothing's going right!

265
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,206
I will find where Auntie Im is
as quickly as possible.

266
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,959
Whether it's thugs or the police, use as
many people as you need!

267
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:51,755
And we need to send a warning
to those bastards

268
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,759
who ruined the ceremony too.

269
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:10,023
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

270
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:28,000
Hey, Nam Hye-jun!

271
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,091
Hey, you went drinking again
last night, didn't you?

272
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,179
How can you sleep
after making such a mess?

273
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,687
If you aren't up by three,
I'm going straight in.

274
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,106
One. Two.

275
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,525
Three.

276
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,906
You're dead.

277
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:07,831
Jeez, is this a pigsty or a room?

278
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,834
Seriously, people would think a burglar…

279
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,137
Wait, what happened to
all the computer cases?

280
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,020
Why are these…

281
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:51,833
Hye-jun.

282
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,090
What?

283
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,263
Sir, what's going on?

284
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,807
What is it?

285
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:17,693
Where's Hye-jun?

286
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,821
I don't know. What's this?

287
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,876
-I don't think anyone's here.
-Yes.

288
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,754
MINAMDANG

289
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:41,091
Gosh, who's the cutest boyfriend
in the world?

290
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:43,176
How are you so pretty?

291
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,679
I could just look at you all day.

292
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,931
Come on.

293
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,355
Hey, Nam Hye-jun!

294
00:21:58,191 --> 00:21:59,359
Hye-jun!

295
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,240
No, it's not what you think.

296
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,325
Wait.

297
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,370
Are you okay?

298
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,289
You're not hurt?

299
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,961
I'm so happy you're alive.

300
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:24,718
What is this? You're both being weird.

301
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,726
Su-cheol. Thank you.

302
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,102
What's going on?

303
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:35,312
What is this?

304
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,858
Sir!

305
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,152
Jeez…

306
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,528
Hey, are you crying?

307
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,865
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

308
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,453
I can't believe those idiots
stole my computers.

309
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,331
You can't let this bother you,
what you should do is

310
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,292
go after the idiots who pissed you off
and knock out all their teeth.

311
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,505
It's a warning.

312
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,883
That they'll go after the people around me

313
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,385
if I anger them any further.

314
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,180
Thankfully, it wasn't so bad this time,

315
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,557
but we don't know
what they might do the next time,

316
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,975
so we should all be careful.

317
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,644
I bet they're in a shock too.

318
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,605
You know, no one can hack my password.

319
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,316
The good thing is,
I've backed up my entire hard drive, so…

320
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,276
Who cares about the hard drive?

321
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,614
You could've been hurt.

322
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,743
If we hadn't slept outside--

323
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,461
I already knew about you two.

324
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,463
You two were being so obvious about it.

325
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,173
This is Nam Han-jun here.

326
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,842
I was waiting to see when you'd tell me.

327
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,513
Anyway, you better

328
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:53,849
keep your promise.

329
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:55,892
What promise?

330
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,811
You gave me all that big talk.

331
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,063
You said you'd wash your hair every day
if you dated him.

332
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,735
Then we have your blessing?

333
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,700
But no staying out all night,
there will be a 10 p.m. curfew,

334
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,202
and a kiss is as far as you can go.

335
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,453
Is this the Joseon era?

336
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,914
I'm just going to go back
to dating in secret.

337
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,374
Then do you only want to hold hands?

338
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:21,209
No…

339
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:25,589
I see that breaking up isn't an option.
Then stick to the rules!

340
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,132
Or else…

341
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,011
I'm going to kill this idiot.

342
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,016
We'll abide by the rules.

343
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,018
Fine. We'll follow them.

344
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,353
Goodness.

345
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,521
Yes.

346
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,566
This is so nice.

347
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:49,029
Her hair has got to stink to high heaven…

348
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:58,538
So you haven't found any direct evidence
to arrest Cha Seung-won?

349
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,083
No. We're still searching
while we try to track down Auntie Im,

350
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,376
but it's not easy.

351
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,671
Gu Tae-su still states that he did
everything of his own volition.

352
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,884
Did you dig into Cha Seung-won's past?

353
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,344
Yes.

354
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:15,222
I went to his old neighborhood
and asked around.

355
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:18,433
Their family is full of
all sorts of urban legends.

356
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,601
Urban legends?

357
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,938
How animals kept dying in that house,

358
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,482
and how they held
these exorcisms every night

359
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,108
as if someone there was possessed.

360
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,486
Then something must have happened

361
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,863
because their son
suddenly went abroad to study.

362
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,574
Why is it strange
that he went abroad to study?

363
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,785
He had been accepted
to a prestigious university here,

364
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,912
and he hadn't even applied to an American
university,

365
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:43,667
but he left abruptedly after
the CSATs ended as if to run away.

366
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,505
There has to be a reason
he left the country like that.

367
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:50,423
I think I can tell you why.

368
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,385
Hi, you came.

369
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,554
My brother killed someone
when he was young.

370
00:25:58,932 --> 00:25:59,849
Elaborate.

371
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:09,317
He brought home his friends
on the day he took the SATs,

372
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,404
and one of them was Hyeon-u,
this guy he used to bully.

373
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:16,741
Hey, open your eyes.

374
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:17,951
Open your eyes.

375
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,204
Come on, try harder.

376
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:25,709
Harder.

377
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,378
I saw Seung-won choking him
to death in the garage

378
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:29,921
- with my own eyes.
-Die.

379
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,841
But when I woke up a few days later
from the shock,

380
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,677
they said that Hyeon-u killed
himself over his test results.

381
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,349
So your brother killed his friend
and covered it up to look like a suicide?

382
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,143
My father must have covered it up.

383
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:46,021
Like he did every time
my brother did something bad.

384
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:48,606
They didn't do an autopsy?

385
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:54,988
They found multiple fractures
in his hyoid bone,

386
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,906
but that couldn't prove it was a murder,

387
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,533
so it remained unsolved.

388
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:04,581
Hyoid bone fractures are sometimes found
in people who hang themselves,

389
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,416
so I guess they didn't consider homicide.

390
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,709
That's horrible.

391
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,712
When was this? It was before
the statute of limitations was abolished.

392
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:14,883
That means he can't be punished
even if we reveal the truth.

393
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:18,720
My brother went abroad
right after it happened,

394
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,263
and I can prove it.

395
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,226
If Prosecutor Cha can prove that…

396
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,020
That'd push back
the statute of limitations…

397
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:30,690
So we publicize the case
and get Cha Seung-won again.

398
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:32,817
It happened 20 years ago.
It won't be easy.

399
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,652
No, it won't be.

400
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,530
But don't you think we might be
able to find new evidence

401
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,407
with your profiling skills and my memory?

402
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:43,536
Of course, my skills are quite amazing.

403
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,829
But

404
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:49,209
the case happened such a long time ago
that solving it won't be easy.

405
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,380
What have we got to lose?
You might as well try.

406
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,883
Yes, it could deliver a blow
to Cha Seung-won.

407
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:03,014
Lieutenant Han, Prosecutor Cha,
and I will investigate the case.

408
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,350
And Su-cheol…

409
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,771
you find Auntie Im with her.

410
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,774
The two of us? Okay.

411
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,025
Sure.

412
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,521
I've wondered
who lived in places like this.

413
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,565
Turns out it was you.

414
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,735
It's been empty
ever since my father passed away.

415
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,446
Our butler, Mr. Park,
comes to take care of the place.

416
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,742
-Wow. Honestly…
-Excuse me.

417
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:07,036
The garage is this way, right?

418
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,496
Yes, follow me.

419
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,626
He looks different. Yes, he does.

420
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,030
This is it.

421
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,826
Seung-won was beating Hyeon-u here,

422
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,913
and I was hiding behind that door.

423
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,545
You tried to stop them,

424
00:29:57,629 --> 00:30:00,173
but Oh Hyeon-u asked for water,
and you went to get it?

425
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,091
Yes.

426
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,514
Stop it!

427
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,854
If you ever tell Father again,

428
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,105
you're dead.

429
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,193
Give me some water.

430
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,751
You went to get water,

431
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,421
and Cha Seung-won was
strangling Oh Hyeon-u?

432
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,632
Yes.

433
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,052
I brought the water
and looked inside the garage,

434
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,973
and Seung-won was strangling Hyeon-u
with his school tie…

435
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,412
Mr. Cha, are you okay?

436
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,836
He must be traumatized.

437
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,881
It's a scary memory and
he must find it hard to look back on it.

438
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,717
No, I'm okay.

439
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,641
Okay, we'll try again.

440
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,310
You brought the water,

441
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:37,854
saw Cha Seung-won choking him,
dropped the glass out of shock,

442
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,772
and it broke.

443
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,567
Yes.

444
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,572
I dropped the glass…

445
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,603
-I don't think we should continue.
-Let's get out of here first.

446
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,981
Mr. Cha.

447
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,533
Mr. Cha. Here.

448
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,545
I'm sorry. We came all the way here,
but I wasn't very helpful.

449
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:48,633
No. Are you sure you don't need
to go to the hospital?

450
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:55,390
Gosh, you're more delicate than I thought.

451
00:32:58,267 --> 00:33:01,229
We'll go see this Hong Myeong-su
on our own, don't push yourself.

452
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,814
I'm feeling better now.

453
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,024
I'd like to be there with you.

454
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,652
And he's the CEO of
Choekang Construction's subsidiary,

455
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,320
so it will be faster if I contact him.

456
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,531
Choekang Construction's subsidiary?

457
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,908
That means he's still
under Cha Seung-won's power.

458
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:18,079
It has been a long time,
but I don't think he's going to talk.

459
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,750
Well, we'll do whatever's necessary
and make him talk.

460
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,629
Can you bring him to Minamdang?

461
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,764
Sir. Come take a look at this.

462
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,059
What is it?

463
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:43,396
I did an image search with
a screenshot of the video, just in case,

464
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:46,774
and this resort in Jungcheon-do matches
the room in the video.

465
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,276
It does.

466
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,654
I heard a lot of celebrities
and politicians stay here because

467
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,365
this place is known
for its great security.

468
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,117
-Really?
-Yes.

469
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,287
Then let's get a search warrant
and check this place out right now.

470
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,288
Okay.

471
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,873
Nice job.

472
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,550
Aren't there any more CCTVs in Building B?

473
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:17,013
No. This place is
for our VIP clients' personal use,

474
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:20,850
so there are almost no CCTVs in front
of the rooms, for privacy reasons.

475
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:21,893
Okay.

476
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,979
Right, okay. Thank you.

477
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,777
Gosh.

478
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,198
Those assholes must have picked this place
because it doesn't have CCTVs.

479
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,450
Hey. Did you find anything?

480
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:41,662
So much time has passed,
so don't get your hopes up.

481
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,831
Well, let me know
when you get the results.

482
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:44,999
Yes, okay.

483
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,212
Hello.

484
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,380
Hi.

485
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,007
-It's clean?
-Yes.

486
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,969
Check out the corridor
and places like those too.

487
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,304
-Yes, okay.
-Okay.

488
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,225
It's been too long.

489
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,310
I don't think this will be easy.

490
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:13,236
-All right. That should do it.
-Yes, sir.

491
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,072
Can I help you?

492
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,157
Hello.

493
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,411
Do you usually apply plastic film
to the windows yourselves?

494
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:27,250
No, but it's an urgent situation since
there's been a privacy complaint.

495
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,376
A privacy complaint?

496
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,172
Well, this singer named Harry
comes to our resort often,

497
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:36,217
and there's been this huge ruckus
because a fan sent out a drone.

498
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,554
Do you by any chance know
which room that fan filmed?

499
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,932
It's on the floor right above this one.

500
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:47,812
Did this Harry stay on the same night
as the mayor of Sinmyeong?

501
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,897
Yes.

502
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,609
That drone might have gotten something.

503
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:54,652
Right?

504
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,197
I only filmed Harry!

505
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,909
We're here to ask you for help,
not to cause trouble over the video.

506
00:36:01,993 --> 00:36:05,705
We just need the video that you took
on January 16.

507
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,374
There is no video!

508
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,711
She says there's no video.
What should we do?

509
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,922
Since when were you so good at Chinese?

510
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,176
I got in through the admission process
as a foreign language speaker.

511
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,761
I was in the Foreign Affairs Department
before.

512
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,722
Right, you were.

513
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,890
Yes.

514
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,725
Wow, you suddenly look different.

515
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:32,398
Hey, if you can't persuade her,
then threaten her.

516
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:35,026
Threaten?

517
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,570
What? I thought you didn't know Korean.

518
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,657
There's no video and I won't cooperate!

519
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:42,783
-Come on.
-Come on.

520
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,161
Sit. Stop.

521
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:51,500
Filming someone without their consent?
That's illegal in Korea.

522
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,212
Invading a celebrity's privacy?
That's stalking.

523
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:57,465
I could arrest you on the scene right now

524
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,342
for filming someone without their consent.

525
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:02,136
Handcuffs. Clank. Clank.

526
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,013
-Arrest?
-Yes.

527
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,024
What?

528
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,359
Gosh.

529
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,778
Harry?

530
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,157
Right.

531
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,535
-Gwang-tae here looks like Harry, right?
-Yes.

532
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,536
Gwang-tae.

533
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:31,624
-What?
-Do it.

534
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,764
Are you okay?
You must have been so surprised.

535
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:50,768
Are you hurt?

536
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:57,942
I want to be arrested by him.
Here is the video.

537
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,653
-Good.
-Thank you.

538
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,281
Harry.

539
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,116
-I like you.
-I love that guy.

540
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,076
-How nice.
-How nice.

541
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,828
A selfie? Let's take it over there.

542
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:11,372
Yes, take a picture. How nice.

543
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,873
Yes, that's good.

544
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,376
Good, he's giving it all he's got.

545
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,045
Good.

546
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,214
Okay, let's see.

547
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,466
It's this one.

548
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,426
Yes.

549
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,936
Damn it.

550
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:36,772
Hey.

551
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,781
-Found it.
-Found it.

552
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,202
You guys are dead now.

553
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,955
HAN THE GHOST

554
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,500
Yes, Han.

555
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,420
We found a video
of Auntie Im and Gu Tae-su

556
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:02,798
moving Kang Eun-hye's body on the day

557
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,550
Lee Myeong-ju murdered her.

558
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,510
Good work.

559
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:10,556
I have a witness to meet,
so I think I'm going to be a bit late.

560
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,558
Could you wrap things up there?

561
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:13,893
Yes, okay.

562
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:14,977
Okay.

563
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,941
I think we have the evidence we need
to arrest Auntie Im.

564
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:25,404
Okay, then we've got Auntie Im.
Now we only need to get Cha Seung-won.

565
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,489
You're so pretty.

566
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,074
Mr. Shaman.

567
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,284
I have Mr. Hong Myeong-su with me.

568
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,246
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

569
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:08,656
Hey, I came here because you asked me to.

570
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:12,076
But what does that shaman want with me?

571
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,482
So it is him!

572
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,903
Yes. What?

573
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,448
Right.

574
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:54,326
He is the man you were looking for.

575
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,829
Wait, someone's looking for me?

576
00:40:56,912 --> 00:41:01,125
Your friend who died unfairly 20 years ago
is still roaming the realm of the living.

577
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,127
Imagine how tortured he must be
to come to me!

578
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,760
Myeong-su, I'm sorry. Don't hit me.

579
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,721
What are you doing?

580
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,014
You've got the wrong person.

581
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,765
My neck.

582
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,060
My neck.

583
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,106
My neck hurts so much.

584
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,858
Someone's choking my neck.

585
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,488
Why did you kill Hyeon-u?

586
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,530
Damn it.

587
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:33,824
What do you mean choke?

588
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,368
I only hit you.

589
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,746
That's not what he says.

590
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,706
He says he was choked to death.

591
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,340
This is a misunderstanding.

592
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,467
It really wasn't me.

593
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,386
Why are you telling me that?

594
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,805
He's the one with a grudge against you.

595
00:41:57,556 --> 00:42:01,018
Not that way, this way.
In the back. Right there.

596
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,025
Hyeon-u.

597
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,361
Hyeon-u.

598
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:12,863
Hyeon-u. I, I'm sorry.

599
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:15,115
I was just taking my anger out on you
like I always did.

600
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,660
I didn't know you'd really die like that.

601
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,621
I wanted to reveal the truth,

602
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:28,337
but Chairman Cha told me that if I didn't
stay quiet, I'd go to prison too…

603
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:40,808
Did my father hush you up?

604
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,437
But I really

605
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,022
didn't mean to.

606
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:51,860
Did you see Cha Seung-won
choke Oh Hyeon-u with your own eyes?

607
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,154
Seung-won?

608
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:59,451
It's been such a long time.
I don't remember it too well.

609
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,246
So you didn't see Cha Seung-won
choke Hyeon-u yourself?

610
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:03,789
No.

611
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:08,168
We did beat Hyeon-u up together.
But then we went to a club right after.

612
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,254
He was still alive when we left.
I'm sure of it!

613
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,506
Do you have someone who can prove that?

614
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,805
I met someone that day,
I'm sure of it, damn it.

615
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,601
Right.

616
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,144
His counselor.

617
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,481
Seung-won fought with her
on the way to the club.

618
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,108
-His counselor?
-Yes.

619
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,119
Seung-won.

620
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:44,580
Seung-won.

621
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,128
He'd disobeyed teachers before,

622
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,130
but that was the first time
he hit a teacher,

623
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:54,882
that's why I remember it.

624
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:00,596
Hey, it's true! I really didn't kill him.

625
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:04,058
So could you please tell him
to stop haunting me?

626
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:06,477
Oh, that?
You can't get rid of a spirit that easily.

627
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,437
Then what do I do?

628
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:12,232
-You do an exorcism.
-How much is that?

629
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:16,195
Well, we'll talk about it later.

630
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,364
Gosh.

631
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,290
Darn it.

632
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:31,293
Keep that talisman with you.
We'll do the exorcism soon!

633
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:36,715
It doesn't seem like he's lying…

634
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,592
I definitely saw it, though.

635
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:46,183
Okay. The trauma might have tampered
with your memory.

636
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,815
What about the tutor? Do you remember her?

637
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,153
Seung-won…

638
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:02,658
had so many tutors
because they changed so often.

639
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:05,327
I can't remember.

640
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:08,997
It's been so long, so there wouldn't be
any records left, would there?

641
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:10,874
No.

642
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,045
Wait.

643
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,672
Our butler…

644
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:20,384
Mr. Park might have saved all the records.

645
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,928
I'll call him and ask him
to find out who she was.

646
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:34,982
Please take this.

647
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,526
Thank you. We just opened.

648
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,194
Please take one.

649
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:41,780
Damn it.

650
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,034
I'm busy, why are you calling me again?

651
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,369
Do you think you could find

652
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:51,457
a list of Cha Seung-won's tutors
from when he was in 12th grade?

653
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,666
What are you on about?

654
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,044
We just opened.

655
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,380
-Thank you.
-We just opened. Give us a visit.

656
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,299
You can do it.

657
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:04,344
Don't limit yourself, okay?
You can do anything!

658
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,929
Think of whose sister you are!

659
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,891
Shut up before I clean out
your bank accounts.

660
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,688
Su-cheol, are you not done yet?

661
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:17,816
I put it in, but it's not starting.

662
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:22,237
-I checked that it worked before we came.
-What is wrong with you?

663
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,698
Why won't you work?

664
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:31,622
Su-cheol.

665
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,207
-Cha Seung-won's coming.
-What?

666
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,376
It's Cha Seung-won. Come on, hurry up.

667
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,296
Su-cheol, hurry.

668
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,547
Who are you people?

669
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,843
We just opened--

670
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:47,721
I don't care.
Leave before I call security. Move.

671
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:08,450
I almost lost my head
trying to tap that car.

672
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:14,081
Why isn't it working?

673
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,131
So the wire and the GPS tracker
both don't work?

674
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,099
What are you talking about?

675
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:33,892
-Bingo!
-Bingo!

676
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,018
What?

677
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:37,980
The shaman Do-won introduced you to
asked about Hyeon-u's case?

678
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:40,148
Choke him?
What the hell are you talking about?

679
00:47:41,984 --> 00:47:44,861
I'll take care of it,
so just tell them you don't know anything.

680
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,989
If you don't, you and I are both dead!

681
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:54,746
Have our men tail him
and find out what he's up to.

682
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:55,747
Yes, sir.

683
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,499
Good, keep working yourself up.

684
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:03,171
Don't get flustered
and go discuss it with Auntie Im.

685
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,339
To Oegok-dong.

686
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,465
Oegok-dong?

687
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,634
Is he really going to see Auntie Im?

688
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,098
Let's go. Hold on tight.

689
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,022
HYEYOON MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC

690
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,746
What is this place?

691
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:39,625
He does need counseling.
He came to the right place.

692
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:42,961
Too bad it's a mental health clinic,
not Auntie Im.

693
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,297
HYEYOON MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC

694
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,341
Do-won went to see Myeong-su

695
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,344
and asked him about
what happened 20 years ago.

696
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:53,639
Do-won?

697
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,474
Why all of a sudden?

698
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,646
Maybe he's trying to
blackmail me with what happened.

699
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,523
You know it too.

700
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:07,027
As a prosecutor, he does
whatever it takes to get the job done.

701
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,909
It happened so long ago.

702
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,953
I don't know how much Do-won remembers,

703
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:18,955
but just in case,

704
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:22,668
it'd be better
if you tried not to provoke him.

705
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,295
If what happened then is exposed…

706
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:34,179
It's not me,

707
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,271
it's him who trying to provoke me.

708
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,373
I clawed my way up to this spot,

709
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:06,545
so why does everyone talk about it
like he gave me this chance?

710
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:13,093
If anyone gets in my way,

711
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:15,512
I'll make them regret it,

712
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,140
whoever it is.

Thankfully, Mr. Park held onto
the personnel records from back then too.

715
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:34,322
I was at a loss how to find her,
that's good.

716
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:37,826
I have a trial tomorrow, so I'm afraid
I won't be able to go with you.

717
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,911
Call me when you find out who it was.

718
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:41,663
Okay.

719
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,957
But Mr. Cha.

720
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,001
Are you okay?

721
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:48,837
I'm okay,

722
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,589
don't worry.

723
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:54,259
I know you're busy with work,
but make sure you don't forget to eat.

724
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:59,681
Okay. I'll call you as soon as
we find out who it was.

725
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:03,143
Yes, I'll call you too.

726
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:09,524
Come on, who cares if he eats or not,
why would you ask him that?

727
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,943
That was a work call.

728
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:15,405
So stick to work,
why would you ask him if he ate?

729
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,084
"Cho Hye-won."

730
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,503

It's okay now.

736
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,315
It's okay now.

-Oh, my.
-You must be hungry!

741
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:23,598
I could eat a horse, but I'm okay.

742
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,563
Gosh, it's hot.

743
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,692
Wow, he really is a chaebol.
He had more than ten tutors.

744
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:37,153
Wow, and that's how he turned out?
It's like he was raised by wolves.

745
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:38,071
Hey.

746
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,574
Should we order another set?

747
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,493
Yes. That's my favorite.

748
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,079
Why haven't you ordered it already?
Come on.

749
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:49,416
I think one won't be enough.
Would two be too much?

750
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:53,420
If you really want to order it that much,
just order two.

751
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,297
It's better to have too much
than too little.

752
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:56,256
Of course!

753
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,049
-Really?
-Yes.

754
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,885
Two sets please.

755
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:00,802
Sure.

756
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:05,640
Wow, we ate so much.

757
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:06,975

Oh? There's someone unusual
among the tutors.

761
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,574
A psychiatrist…

762
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,619
Perfect for his mental health.

763
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:30,665
Wait, wasn't the mental health clinic
Cha Seung-won visited called Hyeyoon?

764
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,542
Yes. "Hyeyoon Mental Health Clinic."

765
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,753
Can you check if it's the same person?

766
00:53:34,836 --> 00:53:36,129
Yes, just a minute.

-Anything else unusual about her?
-Wait.

INBOX

772
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,647
I see. She's got quite a bit of debt.

773
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:57,233
I think she's having trouble because
her husband's business went bankrupt.

00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,126
I hope you understand.

780
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:19,130
I heard you tutored
Director Cha Seung-won.

781
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,299
Yes. I did.

782
00:54:22,258 --> 00:54:24,803
A psychiatrist working as a tutor…

783
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:26,972
That's unique.

784
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:32,978
Director Cha lost his way
after his mother died.

785
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:37,232
The chairman felt that he needed to look
after his children's emotional well-being

786
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,733
and hired me.

787
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:44,864
By the way, why exactly
have you two come to see me?

788
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:49,369
We'd like to know more about how
Oh Hyeon-u died 20 years ago.

789
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:54,416
Hong Myeong-su said that you quarreled
with Cha Seung-won that day.

790
00:54:57,043 --> 00:55:00,922
I don't know. I've quarreled
with Seung-won quite often.

791
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:05,051
This is related to a recent murder,
so it's important.

792
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,594
Every little bit helps.

793
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:08,763
So please, think about it carefully.

794
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,728
What do you mean, a recent murder?

795
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:19,357
His psychopathic tendencies
must have shown from his youth.

796
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:22,485
That's why Chairman Cha hired you.

797
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,611
Wasn't it?

798
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:26,781
Medical records are confidential,

799
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,116
so I can't tell you.

800
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:32,829
Then at least tell us about that day.

801
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:39,461
I'll look for the diary
I kept at the time.

802
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:42,797
I have a habit of
recording even small details.

803
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,674
Could you wait here for a minute?

804
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:59,189
A diary would be admissible as evidence.

805
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,375
RESEARCH ON HYPNOSIS AND MEMORY LOSS

806
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,644
She's taking longer than I thought.

807
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,816
More than ten minutes to go get a diary…

808
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,194
I've got a bad feeling about this.

809
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:17,350
How does it feel,
dying at the hands of your own creation?

811

You think you and Father are the reason
behind my acts of judgment?

812
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:26,526
You think I seek justice

813
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,405
because I've been brainwashed?

814
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,091
No.

815
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,845
I'm giving victims the gift of
salvation through my own will.

816
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:38,306
EPILOGUE

817
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,906
This is the man we will punish.

818
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:58,284
He lured away a child on the street
and brutally raped her

819
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,662
but was released on grounds
of temporary insanity.

822
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:09,254
to people who evade
the judgment of the law.

Jae-jeong.

826
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:25,580
Prosecutor Cha. You…

827
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:28,625
You're scared.

828
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,586
You know it too.

829
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:34,422
That what you're doing right now

830
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:36,716
is violence masked as justice.

831
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:40,219
That you aren't any different

832
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,889
from the men you've killed.

833
01:00:44,265 --> 01:00:45,642
That's why you came to kill me,

834
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:48,144
to stop that from getting out.

835
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,653
Who are you to criticize me?

836
01:00:57,153 --> 01:01:00,990
No one can get in the way of my judgment.

837
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:18,591
I'm sorry.

838
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:09,392
It seems to have been out of impulse.
This wasn't planned at all.

839
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:11,269
Only the diary from
when the murder took place is missing.

840
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:14,480
Let me make a prophecy. Expose everything
and turn yourself in,

841
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:18,067
or you will die at the hands
of the person you serve.

842
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,862
The file that Prosecutor Han
had before he died…

843
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:21,863
I have that file.

844
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:24,365
You made a deal with Auntie Im?

845
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,242
Give me another chance
so I can catch Gopuri.

846
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,494
You were just used by Nam Han-jun.

847
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:29,871
I'll do it myself this time.

848
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:32,457
It's him who has you where he wants you
using that file as bait.

849
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,958
What do you think you're doing?

850
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:39,046
