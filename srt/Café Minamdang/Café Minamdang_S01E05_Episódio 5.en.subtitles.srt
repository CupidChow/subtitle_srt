EPISODE 5

2
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,033
-It's the KCSI. Did someone die?
-Look over there.

3
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,868
-Really?
-Gosh.

4
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,661
-I wonder what happened.
-I'm scared.

5
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,580
You've got to be kidding me.

6
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,416
How crazy do you have to be to do this?

7
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,293
Three years ago, there was a murderer

8
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:28,129
who killed someone in the same way
then disappeared.

9
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,758
It must be Choi Yeong-seop.

10
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,551
Choi Yeong-seop?

11
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,806
The bastard who murdered a prosecutor
and disappeared?

12
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:38,890
Yes.

13
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:41,976
If you find any DNA on the body,

14
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,437
please check if it matches
Choi Yeong-seop's,

15
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,439
who killed Prosecutor Han three years ago.

16
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,649
Yes, ma'am.

17
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,860
Jeez, this is insane.

18
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,403
Please move aside.

19
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,530
911 EMERGENCY RESCUE

20
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,076
Goodness.

21
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:04,207
Could it be Gopuri again?

22
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:05,875
Well…

23
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,670
This is the same MO as three years ago.

24
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:09,963
Except for one thing.

25
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:18,429
But why did he throw the body away
in the sewer of all places?

26
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,891
I mean, it'd be much easier to bury it
on a hill somewhere.

27
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,187
He was probably storing
the body there temporarily.

28
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,648
He didn't have the time to hide the body

29
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,483
or had no intention to.

30
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,112
Either way, he must have planned
on coming back to retrieve it.

31
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,364
What? Really?

32
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:41,703
Maybe…

33
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:44,747
he's watching us from somewhere even now.

34
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:45,957
Really?

35
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,836
Where? Here? There?

36
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,762
Let's go down.

37
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,055
Okay.

38
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,728
I need to find out something.

39
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,022
See if there's anything suspicious
around here.

40
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,189
-Okay.
-All right.

41
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,068
Mr. Shaman. Do you see anything?

42
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:18,323
It brings misfortune if you
run your mouth on matters like this.

43
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,908
Come on.

44
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:24,037
Yes. You shouldn't say something
if you can't take responsibility.

45
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,332
I'm very responsible

46
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,376
but I don't want people to think
that I'm playing a hero.

47
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,548
But still, you've got to
tell us something.

48
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,093
If anything comes to you later,

49
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,055
I'd be grateful if you could contact us.

50
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,559
Bye then.

51
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,988
You must be cold.

52
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,324
Have either of you…

53
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,287
ever seen this man?

54
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,916
He might have had
a different hairstyle or an outfit.

55
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,005
It's okay.

56
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:20,843
They'll give you food and new clothes
when you get to the station.

57
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,762
Right. Thank you.

58
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,862
Collect the CCTV footage in the area
starting from dawn yesterday

59
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,615
-and look for suspicious vehicles.
-Yes, ma'am.

60
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,518
This guy appears every ten minutes
at the same spot.

61
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:14,814
Look for a black van that passed this area
at about 4:30 a.m. yesterday.

62
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:30,663
Well…

63
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,664
STOLEN VEHICLE

64
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,499
But the car's been reported stolen.

65
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,834
LICENSE PLATE 70H 2163
REPORTED STOLEN ON MARCH 26, 2002

66
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:39,213
Someone rented it using a stolen identity.

67
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,132
Can you find who it was?

68
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:43,092
I'll try, but don't get your hopes up.

69
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:08,493
You'd better give me that right now
unless you want to get arrested

70
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,744
for destroying evidence.

71
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:18,711
Oh, the dashcam?

72
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,839
But the owner gave it to me herself.

73
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:24,133
Does this count as destroying evidence?

74
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:27,011
It's your specialty.

75
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,181
Tampering with evidence and destroying it.

76
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,478
Well, don't you think
you're too grumpy and rude?

77
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,188
If you go on like this,

78
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,981
I'll have to take action.

79
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,942
That is, cooperate with you.

80
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:44,904
Cooperation.

81
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,033
I'm busy, so I'll be off then.

82
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,288
An individual may be arrested
without a warrant

83
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,791
when suspected
that they might destroy any evidence.

84
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,211
Anyone who intentionally conceals evidence

85
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:05,299
can be fined up to seven million won
or sentenced to up to five years in jail.

86
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,510
You know that, don't you?

87
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,179
-Give it.
-What?

88
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,974
-Where did you hide it? Give me.
-This is sexual harassment.

89
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,059
- Don't you touch me!
-Where did you hide it?

90
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:26,237
Goodness, what's going on here? Let's see.

91
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:33,828
Under the streetlight. At my nine o'clock.

92
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,038
I've spotted a suspicious individual.

93
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,088
Here.

94
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:49,051
Let's call it even and put an end
to this unpleasantness, okay?

95
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,680
I really am busy, so bye.

96
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,870
How far is he going to go?
Jeez, I could just…

97
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,247
I wish I could just go at him.

98
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,093
Hey. You've got to keep a distance.

99
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:33,638
-You're tailing him, not arresting him.
-What?

100
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,100
We don't know if he's the mastermind
or just an accessory.

101
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,936
What if he's an accessory
like Choi Yeong-seop?

102
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,730
We must wait until Gopuri appears.
We can't lose him again.

103
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,774
-I know that too.
-Act like it, then.

104
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,278
-Do you have a visual on his face?
-Not yet.

105
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,614
But he's moving toward
the main road, so hold on.

106
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,096
Hey. What are you doing?

107
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,974
What? You said we were tailing him,
not arresting him.

108
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:22,103
But why is my face in your armpit?
It's disgusting.

109
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,523
Apologize to my armpit right now.

110
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,359
Did you just spit at me?

111
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,446
Jeez.

112
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,368
Yes, Detective Na.

113
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,537
Ma'am. We found a suspicious vehicle.

114
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,789
Only two cars were parked
by the sewers yesterday,

115
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:44,458
a delivery vehicle and a black van.

116
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,670
We confirmed the delivery vehicle
driver's ID. The van is a stolen vehicle.

117
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,006
The car was rented using a fake ID,

118
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,633
so I tracked the number
he used to rent the car,

119
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,136
and it turned out
he's near the crime scene right now.

120
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,763
Check if the van is around here too.

121
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,017
And track the phone's location
and let me know where he is. Hurry.

122
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,394
But they said we have to
wait for him to make a call

123
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,396
to obtain his precise location.

124
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,734
He's on the move again.

125
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,528
It looks like he's about to call someone.

126
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:13,696
What?

127
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,783
Where should I go?

128
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,252
Choi Yeong-seop!

129
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,254
CHOI YEONG-SEOP

130
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,340
-I'll send you the screenshot!
-What?

131
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,759
Let me see.

132
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,888
Gosh.

133
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,349
-We have to get him.
-Hurry.

134
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,769
Choi Yeong-seop…

135
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,396
We located the suspect.

136
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,899
I'm on my way now,
so keep me posted on his location.

137
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,651
Okay. We're on our way too.

138
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:05,623
-Where's he going?
-When should we go say hi?

139
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:08,668
What?

140
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:12,963
This way!

141
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,805
The Police found him already?

142
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,431
It must be that grumpy detective.

143
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,516
Darn it.

144
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,938
This is Shaman Nam Han-jun of Minamdang.

145
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,774
-Mr. Shaman?
-You can't catch your suspect now. Wait.

146
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,110
How did you know we were doing that?

147
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,195
Mr. Nam. Hang up the phone.

148
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,114
Choi Yeong-seop isn't the real culprit.

149
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,324
Did Choi Yeong-seop do this?

150
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,370
Hide.

151
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,747
He's being used by the real culprit.

152
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:50,334
He'll be meeting the culprit soon,
so wait for that moment.

153
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,295
What? That's Choi Yeong-seop!

154
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,547
Oh, really?

155
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,177
Damn it. We should go.

156
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,303
Damn it!

157
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,596
Hey!

158
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,437
Get him!

159
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,982
Stop right there!

160
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,776
-Hey!
-Gosh.

161
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,615
Gosh. He's so fast.

162
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,207
Stop getting in the way and get lost!

163
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,960
You're the one who should get lost!

164
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,213
Hey, wait.

165
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,007
-That way.
-Okay.

166
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,013
Stop right there!

167
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,518
-Damn it.
-Hey, get him! Hurry!

168
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,024
-Hey, Su-cheol. This way.
-Okay!

169
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,653
Stop!

170
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,834
-Oh, no!
-Crap.

171
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,477
Mr. Choi, wake up. Mr. Choi!

172
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,270
He's still alive.

173
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,857
There's been a car accident.

174
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,902
I'm at 170 Yeonhoe-ro, Daeun-gu.

175
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,029
Yes. The victim's unconscious.

176
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,532
Yes. He's bleeding from his head.

177
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,375
PROSECUTION SERVICE

178
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,126
That looks good.

179
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,379
-Here you go, sir.
-Thank you.

180
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,505
Thanks.

181
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:06,262
Right, sir. What happened
with that woman you were set up with?

182
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,471
Oh, her.

183
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,724
I felt bad for missing our date earlier.

184
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,227
So I offered her a meal on the weekend,
and she said it was fine.

185
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,690
Sir, you'll never
get married at this rate.

186
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:23,112
-What?
-The numerous women who work here ask me

187
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,948
why Mr. Cha doesn't date.

188
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,910
You don't have a girlfriend for a reason.

189
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,414
Did I do something wrong?

190
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,208
You're educated and have a great family.

191
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,670
Plus, you're good-looking
and have a great figure.

192
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,755
You're a dreamboat to all women here.

193
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,008
But none of that really matters.

194
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,969
The word has spread
about how obsessive you are,

195
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,555
and only with criminals. Jeez.

196
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,598
Sir.

197
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:54,518
When women tell you that they're fine,
it means things are not fine at all.

198
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:59,106
When they say they don't mind,
it means they do mind a lot.

199
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,150
When they say they want to be alone,

200
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,485
it means they really
want you to be by their side.

201
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:05,404
Oh, I see.

202
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,282
Right, that's pretty complicated.

203
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,368
Finding out what the criminals
are plotting might be easier.

204
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,167
Excuse me.

205
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,049
Yes, Inspector Han.
Good to hear from you again so soon.

206
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,760
Inspector Han?

207
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,136
Sir.

208
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,805
The man who killed my brother…

209
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,933
I finally caught him.

210
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,810
Really? You found Choi Yeong-seop?

211
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,856
Yes. I have to secure the evidence
and get him to confess,

212
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:45,277
but I'm so happy that I got him.

213
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,156
Oh. I'm so glad to hear that.

214
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:53,369
But I don't think
Choi Yeong-seop did it alone.

215
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,747
Someone hit him with a car and ran off,
trying to kill him.

216
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,041
So…

217
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,252
Choi Yeong-seop has an accomplice?

218
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,629
It must be…

219
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,299
Inspector Han.

220
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,386
Are you all right?

221
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,054
Yes.

222
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,139
I'm not hurt.

223
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,265
No.

224
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,227
I meant your feelings.

225
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,562
Are you feeling all right?

226
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:23,440
Oh, well…

227
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,027
Inspector Han?

228
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,946
Oh, I'm okay.

229
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,865
I'll call you
as soon as things settle down.

230
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,285
They found Choi Yeong-seop?

231
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,707
He's the serial killer
who murdered Prosecutor Han, right?

232
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,795
I'll be out for a moment.

233
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:46,797
What? Where are you going?

234
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,301
You said when women
say they're fine, they're actually not.

235
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:54,555
What's he talking about?

236
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,182
How's Choi Yeong-seop?

237
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:02,855
He's still in surgery,
and they're not sure if he'll make it.

238
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,359
What about his phone? Did you find it?

239
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,069
Not yet.

240
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,364
If he abandoned it while he was
running away, we'll find it soon.

241
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,242
I asked to widen the search perimeter,
so let's give it time.

242
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,332
Hold on, sir.

243
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,334
What?

244
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:36,638
I wonder what his passcode is.

245
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,435
Jeez, are you kidding me?

246
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,730
I mean, the police are right there.

247
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,899
This is stolen evidence.
Don't just take it out.

248
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,735
If you get caught, you'll be screwed.

249
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,487
I didn't get caught though.

250
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,655
Put that away right now!

251
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:54,865
You two.

252
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,541
-Do you think they saw it?
-We're screwed.

253
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,461
Come on.

254
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,715
It seems you've got the wrong idea
about something.

255
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,010
I told you not to interfere.

256
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,806
Are you going to take responsibility
if Choi Yeong-seop dies?

257
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,478
Wait.

258
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:28,732
The accident wasn't my fault, was it?
If you hadn't chased after him like that,

259
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,526
-this wouldn't have happened.
-Right.

260
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,445
-The real culprit was using him!
-Right.

261
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,114
There might be an accomplice,

262
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,492
but that doesn't change the fact
he committed a crime three years ago.

263
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:42,788
So stop disrupting the investigation
and go home.

264
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,835
Why on earth do you think
Choi Yeong-seop was the one who did it?

265
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:51,588
If you'd let him run, we would have
the real culprit by now, damn it.

266
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,673
Right.

267
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:57,761
You didn't…

268
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:02,724
Did you let Choi Yeong-seop run,
knowing he did it?

269
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:05,185
Because the one who ran him over
is the real culprit!

270
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:07,271
-You let a criminal run away…
-What?

271
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,856
…to cover up your own mistake?

272
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:22,327
Goodness, Mr. Shaman! Gosh, sir.

273
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,288
Sir, wake up.

274
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,415
Are you sure she didn't find the phone?

275
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:30,502
My goodness, Mr. Shaman. Oh, no…

276
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,421
Ms. Han, what do you think you're doing?

277
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,882
He found the criminal before us
and followed him

278
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,217
and let him run away
knowing it was Choi Yeong-seop.

279
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,846
He let Choi Yeong-sup run,
knowing fully well who he was

280
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,139
and what he did.

281
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:47,144
Come on. That was because he was trying
to help us catch the real culprit.

282
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,813
Help us, my foot!

283
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:54,526
Let me ask you, why on earth do you think
Choi Yeong-seop isn't the real culprit?

284
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,528
-Get up--
-Hey.

285
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:00,824
-Goodness. What should I do?
-He's gone into shock. Come on.

286
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,368
Hey, I found the car
that hit Choi Yeong-seop.

287
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,369
What?

288
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,165
-Just let it slide.
-You'd better get there before the police.

289
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,297
Gosh.

290
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,549
Goodness.

291
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,509
Oh, no, Mr. Shaman…

292
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,094
She found the van that hit him.

293
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,472
-Let's leave as naturally as possible.
-Okay!

294
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:27,434
Goodness, Mr. Shaman.

295
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,727
Mr. Shaman.

296
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:34,566
She punched your left cheek,
so why are you holding on to your right?

297
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:40,489
He must have been hit so hard
that he lost his senses.

298
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,367
-Maybe he has a concussion. Are you okay?
-It hurts.

299
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,370
Where's the doctor?
Right, we need to go see the doctor.

300
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,915
-Let's go home.
-Okay, let's go home.

301
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,634
I wouldn't have put up with that
if it weren't for the investigation.

302
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:03,637
I would have given her
a terrible memory to take with her.

303
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,097
Please.

304
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,976
Look at the state you're in.

305
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,477
Your cheek's all red.

306
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,854
Is it swollen?

307
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,400
It's red, darn it.

308
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,278
Detective Grumpy is ruining everything.

309
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,115
Hey!

310
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,783
-Gosh, what's wrong?
-My gosh!

311
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,576
Did the police get there first?

312
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,245
No!

313
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,289
Oh, god.

314
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,666
It's way worse than that.

315
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,626
Deacon Kim's coming.

316
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,254
-Mom's coming?
-Why though?

317
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,672
I don't know!

318
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:44,720
Anyway, she's on the subway.
She'll be here in 30 minutes.

319
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,305
Jeez.

320
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,601
Hey, we have to
get there before the police.

321
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,396
We'll go to the tunnel.
Try and take care of the situation.

322
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,897
Don't you bullshit me!

323
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,317
I knew you'd do that,
which is why I sent Na-dan.

324
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,069
He'll be there soon,
so you come and take care of Mom.

325
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:02,571
What? Na-dan?

326
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,199
I'm worried he'll get caught
doing something silly.

327
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,369
I emphatically told him
not to take his inventions,

328
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,913
so stop worrying
and get your butt over here right now!

329
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:12,873
If you don't, I'll…

330
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,667
I'll tell her everything.

331
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:20,964
Should I turn back?

332
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,509
-Do it. Darn it.
-Okay.

333
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,014
Mom's leaving the subway station.

334
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,058
She's coming up, she's…

335
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,280
She's out now.

336
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,538
Right…

337
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,666
She's entering the alley
where our cafe is.

338
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,255
She's there now.

339
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,351
THE HOLY BIBLE

340
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,652
My goodness.

341
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,114
We need to hurry!

342
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,337
Would you look at that?

343
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,756
The cafe is swarming with your fans.

344
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,926
-Hey, hurry up.
-I'm going as fast as I can.

345
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:59,062
We have to stop this.

346
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,022
You have to stop her.

347
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,112
Stop her at all costs!

348
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,879
You fucking assholes!

349
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,839
What the fuck is wrong with you?

350
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,048
Mom.

351
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,593
-What have I done?
-I lost control there.

352
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,428
-Hey, there!
-Ms. Kim!

353
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,435
Surprise!

354
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,729
You've got quite the dirty mouth.

355
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:43,982
You should've called if you were coming
so I could pick you up.

356
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,068
I was going to go home
after hanging out with my friends.

357
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,697
But they said they were going to go see
a shaman when they're church deacons.

358
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,865
-What?
-What?

359
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,534
-So I gave them a piece of my mind.
-Good for you.

360
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,077
Senior Deacon Kim?

361
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,875
You were going to see a shaman.
What are you doing here?

362
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:04,169
What about you? What are you doing here

363
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,922
after scolding us for idolatry?

364
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:09,007
I'm here to see my son.

365
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,551
My son runs Café Minamdang.

366
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,011
Minamdang?

367
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,764
-That's where the shaman is.
-Yes.

368
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:16,848
A shaman?

369
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:24,064
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

370
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,900
Yes, right, there's been
a big misunderstanding.

371
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,948
Right?

372
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,369
My son's a Christian.
What do you mean a shaman?

373
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:41,206
This place is it.
150 Yonghae-ro, Café Minamdang.

374
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,416
"Thank you for your reservation."

375
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:47,045
Son, that's the right address.
What's going on?

376
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:51,466
Well, that's…

377
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:55,387
No way. No, please…

378
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,305
-Ma'am!
-Time out!

379
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:02,936
Su-cheol.

380
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:06,231
-Yes.
-Let's stop lying.

381
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,567
-Okay.
-Let's tell her everything.

382
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,568
All right.

383
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,947
Mom. I'm sorry for having lied to you.

384
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:16,992
The truth is…

385
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,371
Su-cheol's a shaman.

386
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,124
Su-cheol?

387
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,879
Su-cheol became a shaman?

388
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,967
Yes, that's right.

389
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,386
That's right.

390
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:40,223
Su-cheol, my goodness…

391
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:44,644
Ma'am, what do I do?

392
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:47,897
You son of a bitch.

393
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,692
Su-cheol!

394
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,444
Su-cheol.

395
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,321
Oh, goodness.

396
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,699
-Ma'am…
-Su-cheol…

397
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:06,583
Oh, gosh. Thank you so much.
You're so pretty.

398
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:07,876
Thank you.

399
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,127
Thank you.

400
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,981
Where are you going? Are you nuts?

401
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,276
I can't. You know I can't lie.

402
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,487
Yes, you can. Come on.

403
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,906
Think of all the years
you've spent with me.

404
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,325
Kong Su-cheol, you can do it.
Yes, you can.

405
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,953
Just tell her the truth.

406
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:47,957
Just tell her why you're doing this!

407
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,794
-Okay. Let's tell her everything.
-Yes.

408
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,713
We'll tell her that I lied
about you becoming a shaman

409
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,882
and that I'm actually the shaman.

410
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,051
And I was wrongfully incarcerated,

411
00:27:58,134 --> 00:28:00,845
and the real culprit happens to be
the serial killer who killed my friend.

412
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,891
Let's tell her everything.

413
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:09,312
Goodness gracious. I don't think I can.

414
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:13,233
Kong Su-cheol. You can do this. Okay?

415
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,068
Just focus on what we tell you.

416
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,570
No, I can't. I'm too nervous.

417
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,905
Come on.

418
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:23,701
You know I hiccup when I lie!

419
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:28,331
Then have a candy.
That will stop the hiccups.

420
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,125
It's been scientifically proven.

421
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,334
Really?

422
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:32,502
-I think so.
-You "think"?

423
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,586
I'll get Mom.

424
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:39,634
Mom.

425
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,137
Come on in.

426
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,640
Goodness.

427
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,351
The one asking the question
should sit here in the middle.

428
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,853
-Gosh.
-Good.

429
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,271
This is marvelous.

430
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,900
All right. Here he comes.

431
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,869
He got his powers from a child's spirit.

432
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:08,163
-I see.
-A child…

433
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:15,920
No. Su-cheol doesn't want to do anything.

434
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,508
Spirit, sir? Well…

435
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,678
Why don't we talk to this lady

436
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,847
and ask her to get you some tasty candy?

437
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:28,850
-That's right.
-She'll get you candy.

438
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,397
She's too miserly. She won't buy me candy.

439
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:39,277
You're so relentless about it. Are you
going to take it all to your grave?

440
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,280
Goodness. He sounds just like my husband.

441
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,117
SHE DIDN'T SPEND ANY MONEY

442
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,660
ON FOOD OR CLOTHES

443
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,662
TO INVEST IN A FUND WITH FRIENDS

444
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:52,040
She had a fund she kept
with her friends for two years,

445
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,334
but one of them ran off with the money.

446
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:56,419
I don't think she's
the only victim though.

447
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,839
How dare she take off with
their hard-earned--

448
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:01,132
Get it together!

449
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:08,765
Su-cheol's scared.

450
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:13,102
That's why you can't trust anyone.

451
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,188
Mean ladies like that

452
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,607
should get owies.

453
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,945
Goodness, sir. You're so good.

454
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,365
Where can I find that crook?

455
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,952
I think I'm getting diabetes.

456
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,084
Don't worry. My big brother here
will take care of everything.

457
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,293
Right?

458
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,545
Big brother?

459
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,881
Right.

460
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,845
Well, since the spirit is still a child

461
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,722
so he's asking me
to give you legal counsel.

462
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,183
-May I?
-Yes, okay.

463
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:56,145
Right, ma'am. First, you need to stop
working at the restaurant in secret

464
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,897
and tell your husband what happened.

465
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:00,733
Next, gather everyone
who was scammed out of their money,

466
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,653
calculate the exact sum she stole,

467
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:05,488
and sue your friend for fraud.

468
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:09,325
You have a slightly higher chance
of getting her that way.

469
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,619
As you know, fraud cases are all…

470
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,418
I found it. I'll go closer.

471
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:21,296
Act natural and pass by the car
to see if anyone's there.

472
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,303
It's empty.

473
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:31,681
Put on your gloves, take a look at
what's inside the car, and tell me.

474
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,101
What?

475
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:39,898
Just a bunch of garbage.

476
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:43,818
Are there any parking permits or receipts?
Take a look at the glove box compartment.

477
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,531
There isn't much here.

478
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:50,325
Hurry, the police are almost there.

479
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,410
Even the dashcam is missing.

480
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,078
What about the GPS?

481
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,371
No car keys either.

482
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,917
They're almost there.
Never mind, just run!

483
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,335
What? Jeez.

484
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,891
DETECTIVE

485
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,394
Take a look at the front of the car.

486
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:25,693
-I don't see anything.
-Really?

487
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,448
Wait. What's this?

488
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,994
Jeez, I knew it.

489
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,874
Yes, ma'am. We found the car,

490
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,418
but the driver's gone
and the vehicle's been abandoned.

491
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:45,004
And we found a bloodstain in the trunk.

492
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,715
Get it tested for DNA
and tell them it's urgent.

493
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:48,758
And the suspect?

494
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,760
The area doesn't really have
security cameras,

495
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:53,638
so it won't be easy to ID him right away.

496
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,890
But we'll go over everything we can find.

497
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,226
Okay. Thanks, Detective Kim.

498
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,443
RESTRICTED AREA

499
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,196
Sir, I have to go.

500
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:13,574
They found the suspect's van,
and there was a bloodstain in the trunk.

501
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,953
I see. If it matches with the blood
we found in the sewers,

502
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,913
that will make the case easier.

503
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,750
Well, what about you then?

504
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,713
Well, I'll go back to work too

505
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,173
then come back when Mr. Choi
regains consciousness.

506
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,509
We'll get him to confess together.

507
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,303
Right.

508
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,724
When Choi Yeong-seop wakes up,

509
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:42,061
I'll be able to learn
why my brother died, right?

510
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:44,939
I'm sure you will.

511
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:51,404
-That went well.
-I know, right?

512
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,824
-He knew everything.
-Right.

513
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,244
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

514
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,537
All right.

515
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,752
Jesus can cure you if you pray to him.

516
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,212
Yes, ma'am. I'll do that.

517
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:11,049
You two pray for Su-cheol too.

518
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,884
When Moses parted the Red Sea…

519
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,845
Aaron did not stop praying next to him.

520
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:18,598
That's my son.

521
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:22,143
Mom.

522
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,729
-I want a hug too.
-Hey, you wash your hair first.

523
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,482
Even with a mother's love,
I can't stand the smell of your hair.

524
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,694
I love you very much, my daughter.

525
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:32,945
I love you too.

526
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:36,532
Gosh, you better wash your hands too.

527
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,618
-I'll be off then.
-Have a safe trip home.

528
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,369
Child spirit, sir. See you again.

529
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,497
Call ahead the next time you come!

530
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,456
Okay.

531
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,295
Mr. Nam! Su-cheol! Hye-jun!

532
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,384
Everyone's like that the first time.

533
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,639
-"I don't want to!"
-What's going on?

534
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:00,807
Leave him alone.

535
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,609
We've got soju and makgeolli.
He had a nice little pub set up here.

536
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:14,779
His palate is rather consistent.

537
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:18,407
We should look for a man
who bought these chips on a daily basis--

538
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,534
As if.

539
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,121
My gosh, you startled me.

540
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:26,040
Look at him, trying to save his own neck.

541
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,250
Gosh.

542
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,919
We can't catch Gopuri if we all get sick.

543
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,762
RECEIPT, THE RED CROSS
JEONGUIRO 1BEON-GIL, ILSAN

544
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,055
Wait.

545
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,434
This address is the slums.

546
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,728
Could this be Gopuri's address?

547
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:51,440
Gopuri either just threw it away
or left it there on purpose.

548
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,441
It's a clue!

549
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,654
I did good, right? Didn't I?

550
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,656
Can I get paid for my travel expenses?

551
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,908
All right.

552
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,996
Seriously?

553
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:09,250
Come on, sir.
You have to include the hazard pay.

554
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,543
You know your rights.

555
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:15,423
I am so glad that you turned out so smart.
It must be because you're my protégé.

556
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,966
-What?
-What?

557
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,344
What's with you two?

558
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,514
Never mind. We need to get there
before Grumpy, so let's hurry.

559
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,934
No. I have to know
why you were looking at me like that.

560
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:31,189
Do you really want to know?
Hye-jun doesn't want to tell you!

561
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:33,774
Is she ill?

562
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,027
This is so humiliating.

563
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:39,947
DAEUN POLICE STATION

564
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,324
Shall we begin the briefing?

565
00:36:42,074 --> 00:36:45,077
Well, the DNA found in the car matched
Choi Yeong-seop's.

566
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,039
And the bloodstain belongs to the victim
we found in the sewers.

567
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:50,291
No DNA has been found
other than those two?

568
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,375
No.

569
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:54,837
But the analysis of the cloth
covering the victim

570
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,673
showed traces of dye as well as blood.

571
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,967
-Dye?
-Yes.

572
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,177
And the analysis?

573
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,595
-Gwang-tae.
-Right.

574
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:07,058
They said it was a common dye
and it won't be easy to track down,

575
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,894
but I asked them to run a detailed
analysis just in case.

576
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:13,397
I sent the victim's DNA
to the data center,

577
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,442
where my friend's sister's cousin works.

578
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,528
So I was able to get the results early…

579
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,036
There hasn't been a match yet.

580
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,204
Come on.

581
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:31,082
If he is a runaway and
his disappearance hasn't been reported,

582
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,542
we wouldn't be able
to identify them using their DNA.

583
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:37,129
We lost the accomplice,
so we need to find out who the victim was.

584
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,381
That's not good.

585
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,302
Mr. Choi and the hit-and-run driver…

586
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,972
I will now consider them an accomplice
and investigate them.

587
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,349
How can you be sure that they were?

588
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,852
We would have had the DNA
of the person who hit Choi Yeong-seop

589
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,689
unless someone removed it on purpose.

590
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,148
We didn't find anything.

591
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:57,441
Right.

592
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:02,029
So they left Choi Yeong-seop's DNA
in order to frame him.

593
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,783
Then we need to be open to the possibility
that he's the main culprit.

594
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:09,412
Mr. Shaman said that
the real culprit is still out there.

595
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,997
Right.

596
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,500
That prosecutor three years ago

597
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,378
must have had a reason
to let Choi Yeong-seop go.

598
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,758
That's why he was murdered.

599
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,263
At the hand of Choi Yeong-seop,
who he let go himself.

600
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,105
PROSECUTOR CHA DO-WON

601
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,818
Yes, sir.

602
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,740
I'll join you.
Send me the location right away.

603
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,907
Yes.

604
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,828
Prosecutor Cha says
he found Choi Yeong-seop's residence,

605
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,289
so I'll go check it out
and call you afterward.

606
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,043
-Bye.
-Bye.

607
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,924
I've got a bad feeling.

608
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,259
About what?

609
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,595
That cell phone…
What if we end up in the slammer?

610
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:13,059
I can't believe you just said that.
You know I've been in one.

611
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:20,441
Why do you think I held on to this phone
and let her beat me like that?

612
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:25,905
It's highly likely that the person
Choi Yeong-seop last spoke to is Gopuri.

613
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:30,117
You were beaten up by Ms. Han?

614
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,952
No, I didn't.

615
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,455
I let her hit me
because of the cell phone.

616
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,499
Gosh, so it happened.

617
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,335
Great job. Congratulations.

618
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:42,421
That compliment wasn't for me, was it?

619
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,965
-I bet it's Ms. Han.
-Bingo.

620
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,967
You two better watch out.

621
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,354
Here. This way.

622
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,649
You're almost there. Just another block.

623
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,373
Put these on.

624
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:26,924
Damn it.

625
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:30,719
Jeez.

626
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,600
What? She's pretty.

627
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:41,188
I don't think this is
Choi Yeong-seop's daughter though.

628
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,649
That's probably the victim
we found in the sewers.

629
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,608
What?

630
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,656
So it was him who did it?

631
00:40:51,323 --> 00:40:52,408
Those aren't his.

632
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,827
Then did Gopuri put them here?

633
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,288
Yes. Because unlike Choi Yeong-seop,

634
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,331
Gopuri can't stand things being messy.

635
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,209
How creepy.

636
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,420
He's just like you.

637
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,633
I'm sure there's a clue here somewhere.

638
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,975
Great news. Choi Yeong-seop is conscious.

639
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,352
And the bad news is…

640
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:26,317
You need to hurry.
Detective Grumpy just arrived.

641
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,778
What are you doing there? Come on!

642
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,873
I think it's over there.

643
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,211
She'll be there in five minutes.

644
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,547
Su-cheol, if you were Choi Yeong-seop,

645
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:52,092
-what do you think your passcode would be?
-Come on!

646
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,428
That's not important right now!

647
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,933
Wouldn't he have thought it unfair
that he was living in squalor?

648
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,279
You have three minutes.

649
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:17,076
Are you crazy? What you're doing here
looks suspicious even in my eyes.

650
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:20,996
So what would a detective think?
They'll find you very suspicious.

651
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,515
The thing that keeps
Choi Yeong-seop going…

652
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,600
It's…

653
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,852
-Come on, let's go.
-Just a minute.

654
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,565
CENTER FOR MISSING CHILDREN

655
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,235
You're driving me insane here.

656
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,987
Come out, now.

657
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,948
I said wait! Damn it.

658
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,120
Come on.

659
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:29,565
Be quiet.

660
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:33,736
-Gosh!
-Geez.

661
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,739
Gosh, look what you just did.

662
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,949
That was my last cup!

663
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,327
I'm sorry, sir.
I understand that you're upset,

664
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,538
but alcohol is a Group One carcinogen
and is a fatal substance

665
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,416
-that could lead to premature--
-Don't patronize me!

666
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:49,501
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Sir, please calm down.

667
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,378
-I'll pay for your soju.
-What?

668
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,673
I don't have any cash.

669
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:57,426
-Are you kidding me?
-Sir, I've got it.

670
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,386
Here you go.

671
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,387
Damn it.

672
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,765
Gosh…

673
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,350
I'm sorry.

674
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:12,608
He's very energetic for his age.

675
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:16,695
-Shall we go in?
-Okay.

676
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:43,681
When are his daughter
and wife's birthdays?

677
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:44,598
Give me a minute.

678
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,477
June 10th and November 9th.

679
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:05,411
I'LL NEVER LET GO AGAIN.
I'LL ALWAYS PROTECT YOU.

680
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,586
You got it. What was the passcode?

681
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,089
The date his daughter's rapist,
Do Jun-ha, was killed.

682
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:19,258
-That's scary.
-His number is 01012344131.

683
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:20,592
We're off to the hospital.

684
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,761
Get the call record
and the location of that number.

685
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,721
And find out where he's been recently.

686
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,063
What?

687
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:38,235
I think we found proof
that Choi Yeong-seop was the real culprit.

688
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:45,325
I'm even more confident
that he was just an accessory.

689
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,890
What is it? Do you know her?

690
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:11,518
It's Kang Eun-hye,
the girl who went missing a month ago.

691
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,603
Then…

692
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,440
The body found in the sewers is…

693
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,358
Damn it.

694
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:21,904
I should have looked into it better.

695
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,955
It's not your fault. Don't blame yourself.

696
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:41,548
I've checked the base station access log.

697
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,091
Choi Yeong-seop was in Hancheon

698
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:46,136
and only arrived at Seoul Station
around 9 p.m. yesterday.

699
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,181
Then he moved to Yeonhoe-dong
at about ten o'clock.

700
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,724
Ten o'clock…

701
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,769
That's when I was being humiliated.

702
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,355
So he was in the countryside all this time

703
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,524
and came to Seoul
on the day the body was found.

704
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:03,612
Maybe the real culprit asked him
to come help dispose of the body.

705
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,989
That's possible.

706
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:09,201
Anyway, we need to find
who called him to the crime scene.

707
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,536
Right.

708
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,956
Who did Choi Yeong-seop last
talk to on the phone? Can you find out?

709
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,124
I think it's a burner phone,

710
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,878
-but I'll look into it. Bye.
-Bye.

711
00:47:20,879 --> 00:47:23,048
Well, this is a conundrum.

712
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,028
Sir, do you know where you are right now?

713
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,723
We'll take one each.

714
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:13,932
What?

715
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:16,393
Use your head, not your body.

716
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:17,561
Okay.

717
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:18,937
Your head.

718
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:21,857
I know. I heard you.
You don't want me to fight, do you?

719
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,985
-Use your head, okay?
-Yes, I got it.

720
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:33,952
Gosh. Well, hello there.

721
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,498
-Let's go.
-Okay.

722
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:56,850
I, too,

723
00:48:57,934 --> 00:48:59,353
use my head at times.

724
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:09,154
What? What's this?

725
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,366
Jeez, what a piece of crap.

726
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,452
Seriously?

727
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:23,377
What on earth did you do to
make the bumper fall off?

728
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,295
I'm on my way.

729
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,382
I need to take care of something.

730
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:33,553
Hey, get me a cup of coffee
on your way back.

731
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,723
Yemen Mocha Mattari.

732
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,558
Make it drip-brewed.

733
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,312
I can't believe you said that
when you look like that.

734
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:47,901
I guess young police these days
just say their thoughts out loud.

735
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:49,277
See you later, sir.

736
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,531
How do I knock some sense into him?

737
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:55,867
"Yemen Mocha Mattari."

738
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:58,620
That's a great coffee.

739
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,040
Mr. Shaman. What are you doing here?

740
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,629
You know the spirit that haunts
Major Crimes Investigation Division Seven?

741
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,258
-Yes?
-I think it's following you around.

742
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:15,679
I'm being haunted?

743
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:16,763
Yes.

744
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:23,103
You've had a series of misfortunes lately.

745
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,731
-Right.
-You used to be the best,

746
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,858
so how did you end up like this?

747
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,945
You were covering
for your junior officer's mistake

748
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:33,905
and got demoted.

749
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,158
What? How did you know that?

750
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:40,620
He was transferred to the Daeun Station
six months ago,

751
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:45,083
and he hasn't caught anyone since
because they won't give him any cases.

752
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:48,128
His superiors must have it in for him.

753
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,213
I think they're just waiting
for him to quit.

754
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,591
I'm sensing an ominous aura.

755
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:54,801
It's very angry.

756
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:58,054
You have an evil spirit haunting you.
A very nasty one at that!

757
00:50:58,638 --> 00:50:59,639
An evil spirit?

758
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:01,683
Evil spirit…

759
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,186
What did you just say?

760
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,271
Is that so?

761
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,357
I see. So it was six months ago.

762
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:11,693
Six months ago?

763
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:14,654
Something happened
six months ago, didn't it?

764
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:19,117
Is there a ghost behind me right now?

765
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,076
Yes.

766
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:25,373
Don't you feel a chill behind you?

767
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,251
And don't you wake up
in the middle of the night?

768
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,130
TURN ON AIR CONDITIONING

769
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:38,345
Cue the cold air!

770
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:50,941
You're in danger.

771
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:53,902
There are two of them,

772
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:58,114
the evil spirit and a spirit
held back by his regrets.

773
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:01,451
So what should I do?

774
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:05,539
The evil spirit has drained your energy,

775
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,916
making it easier for others to haunt you.

776
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,919
What do I do, Mr. Shaman?

777
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:15,382
Do you need to ask?
You have to coax them into crossing over.

778
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:16,675
What else is there to do?

779
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:21,805
Then could you do the coaxing
and send them to the afterlife?

780
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,934
They're a bit dangerous
to just leave there,

781
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:30,230
but how shall I coax them to see them off?

782
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:35,235
-Wait.
-Stop. You only have 2,000 won anyway.

783
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,195
How did you know that?

784
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:40,073
You can't send off
two spirits with just 2,000 won.

785
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:41,825
I can use my credit card.

786
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,743
Wait, this one is for official duties.

787
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,372
Why do I have
my loyalty card here? Unbelievable.

788
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:54,963
Well, he's a very powerful shaman

789
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:57,924
and he came to talk to you, Mr. Choi.

790
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:01,928
A spirit who was murdered

791
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,014
is looking at you, weeping.

792
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,516
As if.

793
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,854
I'm glad to see you
still alive and kicking.

794
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:13,523
That should be enough energy
for you to talk to the dead.

795
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:17,235
Sir, let me just remind you

796
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:20,864
that you should go easy on him
since this is against protocols.

797
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,699
I understand exactly what you mean.

798
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,160
-Now leave.
-Okay.

799
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:28,288
You can stay if you want
another spirit haunting you.

800
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,415
No, it's fine. I'll just leave you to it.

801
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:33,293
Please, see them off for me. Okay?

802
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,294
Bye.

803
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:43,845
The dead must dry their tears and
overcome their pain to reach the heavens,

804
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:46,139
but their tears never cease.

805
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:50,852
If anyone's upset, that would be me
and not some ghost.

806
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:52,354
Right.

807
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:56,816
That's why your daughter worries so much.

808
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,654
Stop that nonsense.

809
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,615
Your daughter,
who committed suicide, is telling me

810
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,493
that you didn't do it.

811
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:10,163
"My father would never kill someone.
He's been framed."

812
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,874
"I saw it. My father's being used."

813
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:14,584
That's what she said.

814
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,962
You promised her
you'd never let go of her again

815
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:21,049
on the day she got lost
at the amusement park.

816
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:23,718
Is…

817
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,887
Su-ji really here?

818
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,264
Su-ji…

819
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,643
I'm sorry.

820
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:35,814
I was going to kill that bastard
and kill myself too,

821
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:37,816
but I promised him

822
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:42,821
that I would pay any price
if he killed the bastard for me.

823
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:46,324
You promised him you'd pay a price
for having him kill someone?

824
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:56,126
I'm so sorry. I really am.

825
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:59,045
I'll get the car fixed
and make sure it's in perfect condition.

826
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:04,050
That's not the problem.
How am I going to get to work?

827
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:07,929
So you're worried about going to work.
Gosh, don't worry.

828
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,973
You can use that car
until yours get fixed.

829
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,392
How's that?

830
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:17,605
Sir…

831
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,818
I'd be happy to.

832
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:29,075
Wait. Isn't he the man

833
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,536
who was with Mr. Nam?

834
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:36,708
What? Don't tell me he's here.

835
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,710
What?

836
00:55:39,294 --> 00:55:42,130
Wait. Hold on.

837
00:55:42,213 --> 00:55:44,549
You should talk it out. Let's use words.

838
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:48,928
What? Ma'am.

839
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,514
I'll be off then.

840
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:58,938
I wanted to get revenge with my own hands,

841
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,607
but it turned out

842
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:04,027
murder isn't something
you can do just because you want to.

843
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:06,321
I'm such an idiot.

844
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,866
But he told me

845
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:13,078
he would punish Do Jun-ha for me.

846
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:17,874
I told him I'd do anything
for the bastard's death.

847
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:20,919
When I opened my eyes,

848
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:24,964
the bastard was really dead.

849
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:28,134
Who was the person who told you that?

850
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:30,595
I never

851
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,264
got to see his face.

852
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,642
Is he the one
who called you over to the sewers?

853
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:40,396
I can't really remember his voice.

854
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,818
You have to. If you can't,

855
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,570
everyone will think you're a murderer.

856
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:50,240
And that'll make your daughter sad.

857
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:52,075
Su-ji will understand.

858
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:58,998
It was the only way to bring justice
to the bastard who killed Su-ji.

859
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,460
The bastard deserved to die.

860
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:09,050
You didn't have a reason to go after
Prosecutor Han Jae-jeong though.

861
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:12,178
Is Mr. Nam here
at the hospital too right now?

862
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:19,894
He's not here to see
Choi Yeong-seop, is he?

863
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:24,816
No way. Choi Yeong-seop? Nonsense.

864
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,152
What? Wait!

865
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,070
Come here!

866
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,572
Why did he kill Prosecutor Han?

867
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:33,032
And what about the girl
we found in the sewers?

868
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:35,326
What did that man tell you?

869
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,662
Did he tell you
that they also deserved to die?

870
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:42,500
If it was him who did it,
there must have been a good reason--

871
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:44,002
No!

872
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:45,670
There's no reason behind it.

873
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,755
You helped the murderer

874
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,884
who killed an honorable prosecutor
and a young girl!

875
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,678
So tell me. Who's really behind this?

876
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,097
No, it can't be…

877
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,109
You know it too!

878
00:58:08,193 --> 00:58:10,570
The real reason
he told you to come to the sewers.

879
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:14,491
He was going to frame you
for his crime then kill you.

880
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,367
You were being used!

881
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,959
Tell me unless you want Su-ji
to remember you as a murderer.

882
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,128
Jeez.

883
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,588
Who called you over?

884
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,424
Who…

885
00:58:33,009 --> 00:58:35,053
Who killed Prosecutor Han Jae-jeong?

886
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:37,263
I…

887
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:40,642
I have a bad feeling about this.

888
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:42,769
I'm sorry!

889
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,524
Ms. Han!

890
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,027
I tried to save Prosecutor Han…

891
00:58:53,446 --> 00:58:55,657
What do you think you are doing?

892
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,951
Tell me, Choi Yeong-seop.
You didn't do it.

893
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:00,578
-Tell me who the real culprit is!
-Stop it!

894
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:01,996
Say it! Tell me!

895
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:03,790
Come here!

896
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:17,387
My goodness.

897
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:20,723
Mr. Choi. One, two…

898
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,226
-Move aside.
-Right, okay.

899
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:24,978
-Hurry up.
-How is he?

900
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,563
We need to hurry.

901
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,357
Let go of me.

902
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,027
I said, let go of me.

903
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,452
Please, let go.

904
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,960
There's something I need to hear
from Choi Yeong-seop!

905
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:52,005
Do you know what you just did?

906
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:56,926
The culprit almost died
before he could confess because of you.

907
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:01,014
Again, I lost the culprit because of you!

908
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:04,309
No. You're the one
who made me lose the culprit.

909
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:08,187
Choi Yeong-seop admitted it.
The culprit killed Do Jun-ha for him.

910
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,814
That's why he follows his orders.

911
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:13,109
Don't give me that crap.
Choi Yeong-seop is the killer.

912
01:00:13,192 --> 01:00:15,695
I was the one who arrested him
at the scene three years ago.

913
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,615
It's not like you saw him kill someone
with your own eyes.

914
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:23,536
What about you then?
Did you see it with your own eyes?

915
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,747
Is that how you're so sure?

916
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:31,669
I've seen him.

917
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:33,671
The real culprit.

918
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:56,569
EPILOGUE

919
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,669
Arsonists enjoy watching their work.

920
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,337
Especially if they committed murder.

921
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,465
I can't trust you
because you go around conning people

922
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,508
pretending to be a shaman!

923
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:45,428
Do you admit to the murder of
Prosecutor Han Jae-jeong?

924
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:46,721
I just killed him.

925
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:50,850
He won't. The killer must have
looked like a savior to Choi Yeong-seop.

926
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,394
So, I lie down, pretending
to be Choi Yeong-seop,

927
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:55,062
and catch Gopuri when he shows up?

928
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:58,191
You just want to prove
that Choi Yeong-seop wasn't the killer.

929
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:01,736
You said you wanted to believe me.
I'll show you that I wasn't wrong.

930
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:06,866
