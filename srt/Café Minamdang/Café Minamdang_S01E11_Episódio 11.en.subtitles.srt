1
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,541
Let's work together

2
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,710
to catch my brother's killer.

3
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:53,970
Please. Really?

4
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:59,392
Jae-jeong's sister is named Jang-mi,
Han Jang-mi.

5
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,812
And she went to the US with her parents
when she was a kid.

6
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:06,441
I persuaded my parents to let me come back
so I could catch my brother's killer.

7
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:10,236
I changed my name to live as a
police officer, not as a victim's sister.

8
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,864
Do you expect me to believe that?

9
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,829
Here. That's me.

10
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,552
If you're Jang-mi,

11
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,971
I can't let you join me.

12
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:41,226
You convinced the chief to
give me the Gu Tae-su case,

13
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,895
so it's not like you don't trust me.

14
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,230
So why?

15
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,397
Me?

16
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,484
What are you talking about?
That wasn't me.

17
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:53,071
I saw Minamdang merchandise in his office.

18
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,493
Anyway…

19
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,331
I definitely won't work with you
if you're Jae-jeong's sister.

20
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,958
I won't let my feelings sway me.

21
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,168
I was going to keep quiet

22
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,838
about what Minamdang really is
if you worked with me.

23
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,923
I guess it can't be helped.

24
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:15,468
First, let's go to the station
and talk this out slowly.

25
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,220
Hey, Han Jae-hui. I mean…

26
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:20,723
Han Jang-mi! Jang-mi!
Are you really going to do this?

27
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:24,352
Let's talk at the station.
I have lots of time.

28
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,521
But I don't.

29
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:29,190
This is blackmail.

30
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:33,945
I told you. I'm not going to get hung up
on rules or procedures anymore.

31
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:37,157
You told me to get what I want,
even if I have to resort to blackmail.

32
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,659
Let's not tire ourselves out
and go to the station.

33
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,331
EPISODE 11

34
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,181
-What?
-Hold on.

35
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,935
You can't take Mr. Nam away.

36
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,729
He's not a bad person.

37
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,814
Yes. I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

38
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:14,360
He is incredibly annoying,
but he's not a bad person at heart.

39
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,488
Well. If you'd all like to come with me…

40
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,409
I'm suddenly hungry.

41
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:22,619
-I'll join you.
-Come on.

42
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:26,080
Fine. Damn it.

43
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,293
I was just testing you.

44
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,087
I'm very impressed with your resolution
and determination.

45
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,631
I'll take you up on the offer.

46
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,174
Let's work together.

47
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,927
What?

48
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,555
Let's work together.

49
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,265
No takebacks

50
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,809
or I'll take you down.

51
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,988
What's our schedule tomorrow?

52
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,657
We have so many bookings.

53
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:01,991
Let's go.

54
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,952
-Gosh.
-I was going to say that.

55
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,787
I need to talk to you. Come over here.

56
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,996
Gosh.

57
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,373
Where are you going?

58
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,458
-Want some coffee?
-Yes.

59
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,254
So you are
Prosecutor Han Jae-jeong's sister?

60
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,090
Ma'am?

61
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,051
And he asked Han-jun to spar
with you without telling him

62
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,552
that you were his sister?

63
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,138
Ma'am?

64
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,642
Yes. I'm telling you, he did.
Jeez, that crazy idiot.

65
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,894
What if it ended badly?

66
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,063
For whom? Lieutenant Han?

67
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,565
No. For me.

68
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,318
Me.

69
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:44,826
Gosh, you used to be cute
and not violent like you are now.

70
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:48,955
How did that cute little girl
end up like this?

71
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,416
Gosh. What did you say?

72
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,334
He said she was cute.

73
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,753
And he said she was pretty last time
at the hospital.

74
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:59,007
Hey, that was because I was high,
you idiot.

75
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,926
Pretty? Please.

76
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,597
We've all agreed to work together on the
investigation, so tell me your next plan.

77
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:12,645
We need to come up with our next plan.

78
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:17,025
Do you think the handcuffs
might jog your memory?

79
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,609
Gosh, how unseemly. Goodness.

80
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:26,909
There is a possibility that Park Dong-gi
might be behind Gu Tae-su.

81
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:31,122
Gu Tae-su and Jeon Gyeong-cheol used
the trainees at Joyce for sexual bribes,

82
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,999
and they didn't get along
with Park Jin-sang.

83
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:37,378
But Park Jin-sang didn't fire Gu Tae-su,
and kept him by his side, which means…

84
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,089
Park Dong-gi is

85
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,092
the one who gave Gu Tae-su the job?

86
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,179
I was going to approach Park Jin-sang

87
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:51,059
to find out how Park Dong-gi
and Gu Tae-su are related,

88
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,437
but I haven't come up with a plan yet,

89
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,439
because someone barged in.

90
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,358
So sorry.

91
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,737
I'll tell you when I have a plan,

92
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,197
so go away now.

93
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:08,201
Don't even think
about squirming your way out of this.

94
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:11,662
Unless you want me to arrest
each and every one of you.

95
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,916
I'm telling you, under no circumstances

96
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,128
are you to go off on your own
without telling me, okay?

97
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,006
It's dangerous on your own.

98
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:24,425
Okay, then.

99
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,304
Bye.

100
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,936
Are you really going to get Gopuri
with her?

101
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,606
Not a chance. Who knows
what she might cause?

102
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,233
I'm just pretending.

103
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,194
I'll get rid of her later
when I get the chance.

104
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:46,072
Why don't you just work with her?
She's Prosecutor Han's sister.

105
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,574
She must want to catch the killer
as badly as you do.

106
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:49,992
And she's a skilled detective.

107
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,036
I think she'll make
a good partner, so why?

108
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,995
Hey.

109
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,248
She's Jae-jeong's sister.

110
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,626
How am I supposed to face him
if his sister ends up getting hurt too?

111
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,545
No way.

112
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,260
"I don't want you to get hurt.
I'll catch him.

113
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:10,054
Just say it!" And so the drama continues.

114
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,889
Things are going to get interesting.

115
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:29,699
Have you ever properly apologized to
Prosecutor Han or his family?

116
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,534
Are you even sorry?

117
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,620
I always am.

118
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,789
I'm wracked by guilt every night.

119
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:40,001
But I never made a mistake.

120
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,177
Was I too harsh with Jang-mi?

121
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,596
Damn it.

122
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,600
Mr. Nam!

123
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,687
She's pretty.

124
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,107
Goddamn it!

125
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,908
Oh, my god. You crazy idiot.

126
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,830
What the heck did you do to
your friend's sister, you crazy idiot?

127
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:19,665
Oh, god.

128
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,504
Wait, so Ms. Little Police…

129
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:38,184
I WANT TO BECOME A COP JUST LIKE YOU
I WANT A REMATCH WHEN I BECOME ONE

130
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:50,238
Jeez, what a mean-looking figurine.

131
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,448
Is this supposed to look like me?

132
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:56,911
Well, I guess it is kind of cute
if you keep looking at it.

133
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,247
Kind of handsome too.

134
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,838
"Nam Han-jun rocks."

135
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,393
Don't look at me like that.

136
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:23,396
It's your sister.
I'm doing this to protect her.

137
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:28,401
It's not that I like her in that way
or anything like that.

138
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,823
I don't. Stop looking at me like that.

139
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,875
Gosh, you used to be cute
and not violent like you are now.

140
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,134
Damn it, is my face too thin?

141
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,900
I can't believe I…

142
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,113
Gosh.

143
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,489
I told you that's not it!

144
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,036
I got you, you stalker.

145
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:26,751
You let a criminal run away…

146
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,133
Oh, god. It's hopeless.

147
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,926
I shouldn't have hit him so hard.

148
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,316
Now that I think about it,

149
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,486
I've held hands with my first love.

150
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:58,949
We kissed too.

151
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,535
Maybe it's the cold.

152
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,292
I saw his drawers too.

153
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,711
They were red.

154
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,797
Oh, gosh.

155
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,760
Oh, gosh, I don't know what to do.

156
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,555
I'm so bad. I just can't.

157
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,946
DAEUN POLICE STATION

158
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,407
These are everything…

159
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,662
Wait.

160
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,709
Do I look too pale?

161
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:10,896
I thought you were going to talk
to an informant. What's with the box

162
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,274
and the make-up?

163
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:18,279
My gut is telling me
that this is 100 percent a date.

164
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,447
It is, right?

165
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,949
No, it isn't.

166
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:25,953
I just slapped it on
because the air's so dry these days.

167
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:29,081
And this is for work. I'm going to work.

168
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,167
You're going to work?

169
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,877
Work and a date.

170
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,753
You're going to see Mr. Shaman, right?

171
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,422
What? I thought it was Prosecutor Cha.

172
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,632
Come on, I told you,
he and I aren't like that.

173
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:42,052
See. Prosecutor Cha's her friend.
Mr. Shaman's the one she likes.

174
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,721
You're both idiots.

175
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,890
Anything can happen with couples.

176
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,433
You never know
until they go down the aisle.

177
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,936
Personally, I'm a big fan of love
triangles. It's a big part of dating.

178
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,647
Date them both. Give it all you've got.

179
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,317
Come on. I can't believe
you're being like this too.

180
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,903
I'm really leaving for work,

181
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:02,198
so don't go getting any wrong ideas.
See you later.

182
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:05,451
This really is for work.
Don't get any wrong ideas.

183
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,787
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

184
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,623
Really?

185
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,416
-Really?
-Really?

186
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,501
Unbelievable.

187
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:17,129
-It was Mr. Shaman from the start.
-It's Prosecutor Cha, I'm sure of it.

188
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,840
Yes, I have all the files. I'm on my way.

189
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,219
Call me when you get here.
I'll meet you at the door.

190
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,971
-Why?
-You might not know this,

191
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,891
but hot guys like me
have to see the sun once a day.

192
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,809
It's not to carry your stuff for you,

193
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,729
I'm doing it so I can see the sun,
so call me.

194
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,491
TOGETHER FOREVER, NAM HAN-JUN

195
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:49,954
It's not even that heavy.

196
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,956
You offered…

197
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,419
Mr. Cha, you're here.

198
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,046
-Hi.
-No way.

199
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,422
TOGETHER FOREVER, NAM HAN-JUN

200
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,509
That's one shocking confession of love.

201
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,219
I refuse!

202
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,934
Why are we wearing similar outfits?

203
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,647
Damn it, he annoys me so much.

204
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,277
So that's why
I didn't want to put this on.

205
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,653
Take it off.

206
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,530
I said, take it off.

207
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:31,912
I don't want to spend even a single second
with Prosecutor Cha here.

208
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:37,710
Mr. Cha's helped me so much,

209
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:40,087
-and he knows this case better than--
-Whatever.

210
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,672
No.

211
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,424
Cooperation with Prosecutor Cha?

212
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,009
I refuse.

213
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,262
So, you refuse…

214
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,561
REFUSAL MEANS DEATH

215
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,446
If this isn't working,
I have no choice but to use this.

216
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,577
The list of Joyce Entertainment's
secret investors.

217
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:18,208
That is pretty tempting.

218
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,128
TOGETHER FOREVER, NAM HAN-JUN

219
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,011
Just give me that.

220
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,179
TOGETHER FOREVER, NAM HAN-JUN

221
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:32,932
I'll do it.

222
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,226
I'll work with this idiot.

223
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,895
Here you go.

224
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,817
So the initials here refer to
Lee Myeong-jun, the mayor of Sinmyeong,

225
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,111
Head of the Anti-corruption
Department Nam Pil-gu,

226
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,073
and Senior Assemblyman Park Jeong-hyeon?

227
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:50,783
Yes.

228
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,080
Joyce Entertainment used Jeon Gyeong-cheol

229
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:01,502
to provide these guys with overseas
gambling trips and sexual favors.

230
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,837
One of the girls they used was
Kang Eun-hye.

231
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,925
These people then invested
in Joyce Entertainment,

232
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,136
and Joyce Entertainment reinvested
that capital into Joyce Partners.

233
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,930
I don't know how they made the money,

234
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:16,058
but they paid enormous dividends
to the investors.

235
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,395
One hundred times the initial capital?
That's way too good to be true.

236
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,939
The cash flow seems to indicate

237
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,650
that Park Dong-gi is
laundering money for them.

238
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,695
But we don't know if he's the real
mastermind behind Gu Tae-su.

239
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:31,865
Are we sure that
one of these men is the real culprit

240
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,826
who pulled Gu Tae-su's strings?

241
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,328
We'll have to find out.

242
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,622
I'll look into Park Dong-gi,

243
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,918
you trace the money and find out where
the dividends came from, Prosecutor Cha.

244
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,169
Okay.

245
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,339
I'll look for stronger evidence
to arrest Gu Tae-su on.

246
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,882
Okay.

247
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,843
Shall we end the meeting here today?

248
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,554
-Okay.
-All right.

249
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:00,144
It's strange.

250
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,648
REFUSAL MEANS DEATH

251
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,445
Have I done something wrong?

252
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,790
Are you still waiting
for Mr. Shaman's call?

253
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,295
Yes. I told him
I've been discharged from the hospital,

254
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,173
but he's left me on read.

255
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,176
Hae-seong, could you take a look at this?

256
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,969
Did I offend him in some way?

257
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,598
Mr. Shaman.
I hope you and your family are well.

258
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:40,017
I am recovering quickly, thanks to you.

259
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,519
Mr. Shaman, I had a nightmare.

260
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,606
I've been having terrible dreams lately.
I'm scared.

261
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,066
I'm out of the hospital.

262
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:50,152
I have something I'd like to ask
your opinion on. May I go see you?

263
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,321
Mr. Shaman, the weather's lovely today.

264
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,490
Mr. Shaman, I await your answer…

265
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,909
I'll be waiting for you ever so patiently.

266
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,203
I can't think of anything, though.

267
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:02,414
Jeez, he's obviously telling you to GAFC.

268
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,208
What's that?

269
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,710
"Get a fucking clue."

270
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,047
What?

271
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,219
DIRECTOR PARK JIN-SANG

272
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,933
It's Mr. Shaman. It's him.

273
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,142
It's him.

274
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,270
Beware of the east and the color red.

275
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,731
"Beware of the east and the color red."

276
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,025
GAFC, my foot.

277
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,949
I'll do that, Mr. Shaman. Thank you,

278
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,826
I love you, sir.

279
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,958
There is an evil spirit
haunting your father.

280
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,334
An evil spirit?

281
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,503
I don't understand…

282
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:39,011
I see it. He's tall and has dark skin.

283
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:43,891
He's your employee,
but he turns a deaf ear to your orders.

284
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,810
He has a burn scar on his arm.

285
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:49,271
Director Gu.

286
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:55,861
He doesn't answer to a human master.
He serves an evil spirit like your father.

287
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,701
So the demoness that Gu Tae-su works for…

288
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:03,702
Auntie Im.

289
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,415
-"Auntie Im"?
-You must know her.

290
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:11,668
She reads fortunes for the top one percent
of the political and business worlds.

291
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,670
Everyone calls her "Auntie"
and looks up to her,

292
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,088
so I thought she'd be old,

293
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,174
but she was young and pretty.

294
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,176
She's good at it too.

295
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,845
Thanks to her,
my father's business has been flourishing.

296
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,722
Gu Tae-su works for Auntie Im, doesn't he?

297
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:32,105
Why invite someone like that
into your company?

298
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,066
That wasn't me.

299
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,944
I thought he was embezzling
the company funds and told my father,

300
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,362
but he only told me off.

301
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:42,157
I don't know what Gu Tae-su's doing,
sticking by my father's side like that,

302
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,117
but now he's taking the company funds…

303
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,584
Your father's been bewitched
by the evil spirit.

304
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,046
Mr. Shaman.

305
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,508
I've never knelt to anyone
except for my father.

306
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:02,052
Please, tell me what to do.

307
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,430
Well, this won't be easy.

308
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,474
I'm not sure if you can pull it off.

309
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,643
I'll do it. I'll do anything.

310
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,855
Okay. Then conduct an exorcism.

311
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,983
These evil spirits are no ordinary ones,

312
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,026
so your father won't escape
unscathed either,

313
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,321
but this is the only way to prevent
your family from going down.

314
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,949
Okay. I'll do the exorcism.

315
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,537
An ordinary exorcism won't cut it, though.

316
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,664
I'll give you five hundred million won.

317
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,876
Five hundred million?

318
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,253
Well… One billion won!

319
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,923
One billion more.

320
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,264
-How about 1.5 billion won?
-Then 1.5 billion won.

321
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,558
Yes.

322
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:54,855
Please, just get that evil spirit away
from my father's side.

323
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,275
Well, if you are truly so desperate,

324
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,528
we shall embark on this journey together,
arduous as it may be.

325
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:04,448
My faith is pure, Mr. Shaman.
My faith is pure.

326
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,242
I believe in you, sir.

327
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,577
We'll

328
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:13,206
get through this together.

329
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:15,751
Together.

330
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,211
Together, we can do it. Mr. Shaman.

331
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,008
What? 1.5 billion won?

332
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,718
I'm telling you.

333
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:27,596
Should we just start
accepting only the top one percent?

334
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:28,972
Yes!

335
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,891
Jeez, get a hold of yourself.

336
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,271
Isn't it time we upgrade your computer
equipment, dear sister?

337
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:40,358
-We can kill two birds with one stone.
-A win-win situation.

338
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:42,277
All in one fell swoop!

339
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:49,284
But we have to find this Auntie Im first
if we want that money.

340
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,828
But how? There's no information on her.

341
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,997
What? None at all?

342
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:57,042
Yes. She isn't registered
with the National Tax Service,

343
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,668
and when you search for "Auntie Im,"

344
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:02,881
you only find stories about aunts
becoming shamans. I don't see a way.

345
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,133
Have we popped the champagne too soon?

346
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,510
What do we do now?

347
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:12,557
Park Jin-sang said Auntie Im used to
operate in Taepyeong, right?

348
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,892
-Yes.
-Yes.

349
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,647
News about someone like Auntie Im must
have spread like wildfire among everyone.

350
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,949
About Gu Tae-su…

351
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,910
I found a record that says
he was investigated

352
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,704
in relation to a firearm accident
five years ago.

353
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,289
-A firearm accident?
-Yes.

354
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,916
Gu Tae-su was in, what was it?

355
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:40,585
The society for damage prevention
against harmful wildlife?

356
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,087
He was with some group like that.

357
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,005
Yes. He was a witness for the victim,

358
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,466
not the suspect,
so it didn't come up in our searches,

359
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,260
but we found it when we checked

360
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,428
his investigation records.

361
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,348
Someone got hurt
when a gun was discharged by accident?

362
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:56,935
The victim is running a mountain lodge
in Paldung Mountain, Gangwon-do.

363
00:23:57,018 --> 00:24:02,607
-I see, maybe he knows Gu Tae-su…
-Yes.

364
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,985
Mr. Jang and I will go visit him,

365
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,154
Detective Kim and Detective Na, you…

366
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,907
What the heck?

367
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:15,328
We really love hiking.

368
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,290
Take us with you, ma'am.

369
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:22,127
This is an investigation,
not a hiking trip.

370
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,381
Please.

371
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:32,512
Well, then shall we go together?

372
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:38,059
-Yes.
-Yes, ma'am.

373
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,812
Here's your hat.

374
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,314
-You too.
-Don't.

375
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,608
AFFILIATED COMPANIES

376
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,443
JOYCE X, JOYCE FOOD, JOYCE SPORTS…

377
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,698
Joyce Partners has
more than ten affiliated companies?

378
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:54,910
Entertainment companies have their hand in
restaurants, clubs, fashion, real estate…

379
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,661
Anything that rakes in the money.

380
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,539
Joyce Partners seems to be
a global franchise of that sort too.

381
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:02,500
They all look legitimate on paper…

382
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,256
KM Leaders? What's this one?

383
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,176
It's a company Joyce Partners
established in the Philippines.

384
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,804
The overseas investment process is
complex, so they made a local corporation.

385
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,182
So there's a possibility
it's a paper company?

386
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:20,143
Yes. Shall I ask the Ministry of Justice
for financial details?

387
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,854
Yes.

388
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,857
Track the cash flow
for all of Joyce's affiliate companies.

389
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:26,775
Yes, sir.

390
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,112
LIEUTENANT HAN JAE-HUI

391
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:34,699
-Yes, Ms. Han.
-I found someone who knows Gu Tae-su.

392
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,368
We're going to Gangwon-do right now--

393
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,245
Let's go together.

394
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,041
Yes. Let's go together. Wait, my jacket.

395
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,210
Where are you right now?

396
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:47,629
Yes, okay.

397
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:51,633
Was that really Prosecutor Cha
who just rushed out of here?

398
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,426
Yes, I've never seen him like that.

399
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,888
So he is dating Lieutenant Han.

400
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,306
Come on, it's…

401
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:00,433
Wait.

402
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,477
Maybe it's true.

403
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,820
Hey, this isn't a getaway.
This is an investigation.

404
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,530
Come on, I can't concentrate, stop…

405
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,241
Stop moving around. Let go of me.

406
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,784
Damn it.

407
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,869
This is for the investigation, right?

408
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:23,623
Yes. It might not look like it, but they
are serious about the investigation.

409
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,543
Of course.

410
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:28,753
They look like it.

411
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,694
-The air's so clean.
-Yes.

412
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:00,869
Gosh…

413
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,164
These are poplar sanghwang mushrooms.

414
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,540
These are really expensive.

415
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,917
-What kind is it again?
-Poplar sanghwang mushrooms.

416
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,753
How do you know so much about mushrooms?

417
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:13,089
I used to go hiking all the time with
my grandfather when I was a kid.

418
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:16,009
-It has a lot of antioxidants.
-Antioxidants?

419
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:19,346
Yes, it's called antioxidants
because it helps the oxidation process.

420
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,389
Shall we try it?

421
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,143
-Here, try it.
-Is it good?

422
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,394
It's good.

423
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,105
Spit that out! That's poisonous!

424
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,788
That was the
Daedaleopsis tricolor mushroom.

425
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,207
It looks similar
to poplar sanghwang mushrooms.

426
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,585
Some hikers eat it by mistake
and end up dead.

427
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,420
You're lucky you didn't die. Jeez.

428
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,882
Jeez, you just had to tag along.

429
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,884
There are many good mushrooms
in the mountain,

430
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:00,095
but you just had to eat a poisonous one.

431
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,597
-And what were you doing?
-Well…

432
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,308
Wipe that off. That's so gross.

433
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,311
I'm sorry.

434
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,687
Gosh, so gross.

435
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:14,192
So you're here
about the firearm accident five years ago.

436
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,193
-Yes.
-Yes.

437
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,779
Yes. Do you by any chance

438
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,407
remember Gu Tae-su?

439
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,741
Gu Tae-su…

440
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,119
How could I forget that name?

441
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,246
Just a minute.

442
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:44,180
It's been five years already
since he's gone missing.

443
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,308
Gu Tae-su's missing?

444
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:51,563
I got pretty hurt in that firearm accident
five years ago.

445
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,857
So he went hunting instead of me,

446
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,400
then went missing in the mountain.

447
00:28:55,483 --> 00:29:00,155
They found a dead body in the hunting
grounds around the area recently.

448
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,908
I called the police because
I thought it might be Tae-su,

449
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,369
but they said the body
couldn't be identified.

450
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:11,541
Come on. In that case,
he just might be out of touch.

451
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:15,253
Why do you think the body was Gu Tae-su's?

452
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:18,715
They found his watch
when they dug up the body.

453
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,388
Is this the man who went missing?

454
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,766
No.

455
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,310
This is Lim Yeong-ju, Gu Tae-su's friend.

456
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:31,853
That's Gu Tae-su.

457
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,446
So this person isn't Gu Tae-su,

458
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,281
but Lim Yeong-ju?

459
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,657
Yes.

460
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:55,960
Lim Yeong-ju…

461
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,558
DISTRICT MODEL FOREST WALKERS

462
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,647
So the real Gu Tae-su is dead,

463
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:18,733
and Lim Yeong-ju stole his identity?

464
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,027
Yes, if Lim Yeong-ju is his real name.

465
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:26,074
If that's another false identity,
it'll make it really hard to find him.

466
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,452
Let's just hope there's some information
on him under that name.

467
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,623
Lim Yeong-ju…

468
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:36,584
I know I've heard of the name,
but I just can't remember.

469
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,628
Lim Yeong-ju…

470
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:39,671
Jeez.

471
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,758
Damn it, you toadstool of an idiot.

472
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,432
So a gathering to learn about
Auntie Im will be held here?

473
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:55,520
It's a good idea that we rented
the place out for the gathering.

474
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,980
We make a little on the side too.

475
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:59,190
But why do we have to wear these outfits?

476
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,987
He lied and said Minamdang is a café

477
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,615
based on the modern reinterpretation
of shamanism

478
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,325
to get them to hold the event here.

479
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,874
I went to a lot of trouble
to bring them here,

480
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,376
so get everything
you can out of them on Auntie Im.

481
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,920
Let's squeeze them dry.

482
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,716
Okay. All right.

483
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,719
-But they're intimidating.
-Nonsense!

484
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,307
Let's go.

485
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,606
TAEKSEONG SHAMAN ASSOCIATION

486
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,399
That startled me.

487
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:47,113
Hi. Hello.

488
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,406
Hello, little girl.

489
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,324
You are…

490
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,867
Gong Su-cheol.

491
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,620
You have never had a girlfriend, have you?

492
00:31:56,623 --> 00:32:00,585
I just haven't met the right person yet.

493
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,128
What about me?

494
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,255
You need a woman with a strong character--

495
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:08,384
Where are your manners
when you're with your elders?

496
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,303
You can't talk like that to a grown-up!

497
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:13,932
She's possessed
by an old goddess of Jirisan.

498
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,725
Your woman is nearby.

499
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:19,228
Take a good look around you,
instead of looking in useless places.

500
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,564
But everyone is a shaman here.

501
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,198
Are you all enjoying yourselves?

502
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:31,616
I am.

503
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,576
I'm glad to hear that.

504
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,495
By the way, I heard

505
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:39,332
there's this really powerful shaman
in Taekseong,

506
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:42,502
I wonder if she's here today.
I think she was called Auntie Im.

507
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,254
Don't you mention that scum here!

508
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:50,468
I heard she was really good,
so I was curious.

509
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,971
Good, my foot. It's all hogwash!

510
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:57,475
I'm guessing you two don't get along.

511
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:01,062
You won't find a single shaman here
who's on good terms with that quack.

512
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,230
I dare you.

513
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:17,203
I sense resentment, fear,

514
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,872
and a deep grudge.

515
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,794
I thought you had a powerful aura.

516
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,295
You could be a shaman yourself.

517
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,719
It's true that there is deep-rooted enmity
between the two of them.

518
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:36,681
She murdered my mother.
How could I not hate her?

519
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:41,352
She and Auntie Im were under
the tutelage of the same godmother.

520
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,478
Wait.

521
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:47,108
Did Auntie Im kill her godmother?

522
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,624
TITLE DEED
OWNER: IM HUI-SUK

523
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,795
That scum cajoled the daughter
of one of the congregation members

524
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,547
and led her astray, ruining the family,

525
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,092
and our godmother found out about it.

526
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,054
I pray to you.

527
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,681
-I pray to you.
-Mother.

528
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,726
Mother.

529
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:22,810
Mother.

530
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,697
You fool,
you do not deserve to serve the god.

531
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,911
Please, just give me another chance.

532
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,371
I won't ever do it again.

533
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,248
Mother.

534
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,460
Mother, forgive me, please.

535
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,544
Mother!

536
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,944
The police said it was an accident,
but it wasn't.

537
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:16,572
Auntie Im, that scum,
killed our godmother.

538
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,788
After that,
Auntie Im took over the temple.

539
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:26,082
There were some chaebols
among the congregation,

540
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:30,503
and she even managed
to wheedle them all away.

541
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:35,091
Do you know what she did or where
she lived before she became a shaman?

542
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:39,137
Our godmother said you must cut all ties
with the world when you serve a god,

543
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,598
and she didn't let us ask each other about
what we did before we became shamans.

544
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,106
Hello.

545
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:57,572
Auntie snatched away
members of our congregation.

546
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,240
-Goodness.
-Oh, gosh.

547
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:01,200
She got to you too, Seong-gwang.

548
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,036
She took my biggest client away too,

549
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,998
and I haven't heard from him since.

550
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:07,999
Me too.

551
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:11,627
That scum. She's the reason
why I had to start doing YouTube.

552
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:15,506
I knew I'd seen you somewhere,
it must have been on YouTube!

553
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,302
You can't blame Auntie Im for that.

554
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,971
You've been losing
your touch lately, Chilseong.

555
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:25,183
Isn't YouTube for frauds
who have lost their power?

556
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,726
-What, frauds?
-Frauds.

557
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:29,478
Hey, Bak-su, I've got tens of thousands of
subscribers, you know.

558
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,480
So what?

559
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,650
I've watched it, and it's obvious
the whole thing's a sham.

560
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:35,693
-Hey.
-What?

561
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:39,238
Goodness, this fool's saying
that YouTube is

562
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,908
for frauds who have lost their powers.

563
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:45,119
-Oh, gosh, goodness.
-Hey.

564
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:49,040
-Let go of me. I said, let go.
-You're talking to one of those frauds.

565
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,083
Everybody, calm down.

566
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,299
Even my gaming meet-ups aren't this bad.

567
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,719
Shouldn't we stop them?

568
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,887
Gosh.

569
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:07,934
Don't. Let's just go.
I'm sure it'll die down, somehow.

570
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,977
-Let's go, come on.
-Okay, let's go.

571
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,105
Hurry!

572
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:19,153
Hey, what if it doesn't die down?

573
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,030
Hey, go do something.

574
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:23,324
What? Damn it.

575
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,619
I'm not sure if I can.

576
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,167
Is Na-dan going to intervene?

577
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,379
Come on everybody, stop fighting.
Can I have your attention, please?

578
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,258
We have a surprise performance

579
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,552
for you all today.

580
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,514
Everybody shout for me!

581
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,560
Our surprise guest today is,

582
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:56,482
give me a drumroll please,

583
00:37:56,565 --> 00:38:00,569
the wonder of Yonghae-dong, Minamdang!

584
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:03,030
Let's have a big round of applause!

585
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,162
Now, let's start the music.

586
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,254
Now.

587
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,424
Everyone, put your hands together!

588
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:39,191
I hope everyone has fun today.

589
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:42,820
Thank you, everyone,
for coming to Minamdang today.

590
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,488
A round of applause!

591
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,365
Are you having fun?

592
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:51,245
Here are our members.

593
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,750
Gong Su-cheol,
the twerking machine form hell!

594
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,924
Next is, Nam Hye-jun,

595
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,635
the armpit berserker!

596
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,851
And next,

597
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,979
Jo Na-dan the maverick! Make some noise!

598
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:25,112
Now, finally, the guest of honor today,

599
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,697
the star of Yonghae-dong,

600
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,617
Nam Han-jun!

601
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:02,733
The spirit told me there are those
trying to dig up information on me,

602
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,568
you must have found out who they are.

603
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:21,502
Nam Han-jun has been asking around
about you and your godmother.

604
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:25,965
They won't give up easily.
Keep an eye on them for a while.

605
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:30,219
How can I get him when he's
just about to get caught in the web?

606
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,721
We need to wait until he's trapped.

607
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,891
They'll come to me of their own volition.
You will wait.

608
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:36,976
Yes, ma'am.

609
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,410
MINAMDANG

610
00:40:54,493 --> 00:41:00,124
On 4 P.M., April 17th, 2022,
at Cheonggakjeong,

611
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:03,252
all of Joyce Entertainment's investors
will gather for the signing ceremony

612
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:06,005
for the Sinmyeong
land development project.

613
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,843
We should go undercover and find out
who's involved.

614
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,304
I'm sure they'll lead us
to the mastermind.

615
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,682
Gu Tae-su might be there,
so shouldn't we contact Lieutenant Han?

616
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,560
We agreed to work together.
And it's better to have backup.

617
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:21,479
Why bother?

618
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,064
If Gu Tae-su's there,
we'll catch him and turn him over.

619
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,151
You must be really worried
about Lieutenant Han.

620
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,527
Me?

621
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,279
Are you crazy? No way.

622
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,615
Isn't this because you're worried
she might get hurt?

623
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,159
-Is that so?
-Yes.

624
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,953
What? Wipe that look off your faces, jeez.

625
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:41,540
Why would I worry over someone
who can so clearly take care of herself?

626
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,794
Su-cheol, put up a notice that the café's
closed and you, check your equipment.

627
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,964
-Okay.
-Damn it, I'm swamped.

628
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,218
-Let's see.
-Don't.

629
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,472
Na-dan,

630
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:59,850
upload the announcement. April 17th, okay?

631
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,853
INVITATION

632
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,361
Everyone who's invested in Joyce
will be coming to the ceremony.

633
00:42:10,444 --> 00:42:13,239
Gu Tae-su might come too.

634
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:17,159
I'll need to find a way to infiltrate it.

635
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,246
What? You don't have to.

636
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:23,123
You can go with me. I've been invited too.

637
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:27,586
I heard the Director of Choekang
construction is your older brother.

638
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,214
I don't want to get you into any trouble…

639
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,925
The gathering will be
plenty troublesome as is.

640
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:35,469
You might as well come and save me.

641
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:38,806
Then I'll call Mr. Nam--

642
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,766
don't think we'll need to call them.

643
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,186
Well…

644
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:48,440
I mean, people might notice
if there are too many of us.

645
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,985
Let's check it out on our own first,
and afterward,

646
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,029
we can call him if we need to.

647
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:57,700
Okay, I'll just ask my team members
to provide backup, then.

648
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:59,201
Okay. Sounds good.

649
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,623
INVITATION

650
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:31,400
Enjoy.

651
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,540
Please enjoy.

652
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,295
LAND DEVELOPMENT SIGNING CEREMONY

653
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,297
Nam Pil-gu and Park Jeong-hyeon…
Their faces

654
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:58,427
are so amazingly clear.

655
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,598
Money's the best.

656
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,225
Look at the definition on this thing.
It's 4K.

657
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,979
Calm down and check
if all the investors are here.

658
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,106
Be nice to Park Jin-sang when you see him.

659
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:14,860
Thanks to him, work is fun
with this new and improved environment.

660
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:15,944
Get a grip.

661
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,744
Detective Han?

662
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,082
Hello.

663
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,083
Hello.

664
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,501
Lieutenant Han's here?

665
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,712
-Why's that idiot here?
-How are you?

666
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,425
That woman looks familiar.

667
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:40,719
-Whatever. Who cares?
-Okay.

668
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:43,305
You idiots. That's Lieutenant Han!

669
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:06,328
My gosh.

670
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,710
-Han-jun.
-What?

671
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,087
-Go.
-Yes, okay.

672
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,756
Mr. Shaman, what are you doing here?

673
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:21,802
The evil spirit might hear you.
I'm in the middle of an exorcism. Leave.

674
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:25,305
You have to hold on to her, okay?

675
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,598
Don't worry.

676
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,934
What do you think you're doing here?

677
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:32,062
You take care of this, okay?

678
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,064
-I'm going to go.
-Cha Do-won.

679
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,816
Aren't you going to say
hi to your brother?

680
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,111
Right. It's been a while.

681
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:41,321
He's always had no manners.

682
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,614
Stay still.

683
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:44,741
Nice to meet you.

684
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,910
I'm Lee Min-gyeong,
the vice president of S&H group.

685
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:50,914
And Mr. Nam here is my fiancé.

686
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:55,878
You're Mr. Nam's fiancé?

687
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,713
We're getting married soon.

688
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,506
-So--
-Wait, I…

689
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,509
I remember turning that offer down.

690
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:11,310
So he's rejected you.

691
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,815
I don't give up so easily
just because of one rejection

692
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,734
like some poor little girl.

693
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,083
Take her.

694
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:39,755
-Let's go.
-Let go of me.

695
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,299
I heard they have great drinks here.
Shall we get some?

696
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,467
-Let's go. You're so strong.
-Stop it.

697
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,219
Get over here right now!

698
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:34,476
I know this perfume.

699
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:36,395
It's yukgaejang.

700
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:37,854
Right.

701
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,694
What was that?

702
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,195
Is he someone scary?

703
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,365
That guy at the funeral home.

704
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,366
Right.

705
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:53,620
Thank you for your hard work.

706
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:59,668
He's obsessed with his sense of privilege.
He has to have the best.

707
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,128
He has a lot of weaknesses.

708
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,171
He has bodyguards, but they're useless

709
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,549
because he can't bear to let them
walk in front of him.

710
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,635
He's the type who will do
whatever it takes

711
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,304
to root out anything that gets in his way.

712
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,557
If this land development project
goes well,

713
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,726
you'll be a shoo-in
for the future president

714
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:18,437
at the next stockholder's meeting.

715
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,897
I thought it'd happen
at the last stockholder's meeting.

716
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,483
But Director Park and the labor union
turned against me.

717
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,236
I heard that
Director Park wanted you, Uncle.

718
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,321
I'm sure you have it wrong.

719
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:31,033
You do have to win over Director Park,

720
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:33,702
but I'm sure he'll change
his assessment of your abilities

721
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,954
if you successfully finish this project.

722
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,039
Assess?

723
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:41,043
How ironic that I'd need to be assessed
to take what was mine in the first place.

724
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:46,506
Isn't Park Dong-gi Cha Seung-won's uncle?

725
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,343
Him, along with Shin Gyeong-ho and
Park Jin-sang, are "the three mad dogs."

726
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:53,555
The jerk has no sense of respect
for his elders. What a douche.

727
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,224
A mad dog? No.

728
00:48:56,808 --> 00:49:00,771
Shin and Park are small fish compared
to him. He's on a totally different level.

729
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:01,855
Really?

730
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,067
Cha Seung-won's

731
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,486
at the top of the food chain.

732
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,326
I didn't expect to see you here.

733
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,787
What do you mean? You sent the invitation.

734
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:17,996
What, should I just go?

735
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,581
I was just pleasantly surprised.

736
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,792
I didn't think
you were interested in my work.

737
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:22,834
I'm glad you're here.

738
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:24,836
Who's this with you?

739
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,506
This is my partner, Ms. Han Jae-hui.
Say hello.

740
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:28,882
This is my brother.

741
00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:30,175
Your partner?

742
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,636
-Nice to meet you, I'm Cha Seung-won.
-Nice to meet you.

743
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,973
Can I offer you a glass?

744
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:37,933
No. You can go.

745
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,601
Yes, sir.

746
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:41,937
What the… Didn't they train you?

747
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:44,064
I didn't get much on me.

748
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:47,359
Don't get mad, it's a happy occasion.
I'll just go visit the bathroom.

749
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:48,485
Okay.

750
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,492
Goodbye, then.

751
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,875
Do-won went his own way
instead of taking over the group,

752
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:05,419
he should be bowing down in thanks…

753
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,463
Everyone knows Do-won was
first in line for the succession--

754
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:09,715
Shut up.

755
00:50:09,798 --> 00:50:12,175
Now remember, this is a happy occasion.

756
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,052
We're all in the same boat now.

757
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:18,515
This development wouldn't be possible
if it weren't for Choekang Construction.

758
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:19,474
It's true.

759
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:23,645
I only hope that you'll realize
your own place and step down soon.

760
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:32,904
Hey.

761
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,699
Hey, pain in the ass.
Get over here. Come on.

762
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,993
-Are you drunk again?
-Damn it, you pathetic fool.

763
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:41,663
Lee Min-gyeong, come on.
I hate you. Seriously.

764
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:46,626
Hey.

765
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:48,462
Hey.

766
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,175
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

767
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,928
I'm glad you're jealous.

768
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,513
I'm not jealous.

769
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:01,266
I'm worried like I'd be for my sister.

770
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,187
And Cha Seung-won might be your brother,

771
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:08,106
but I can't let that psychopath
and Lieutenant Han--

772
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,107
"Sister"?

773
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,486
Are you sure it's nothing more than
brotherly love?

774
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,321
What about you?

775
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:17,157
Why would you bring her as your partner?

776
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,743
I think that's fine given

777
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:21,620
how we're close.

778
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,040
-"Close"?
-Close.

779
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:31,004
My partner is waiting,

780
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,465
so bye.

781
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:39,930
Damn it, he doesn't pull his punches.

782
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:45,977
Are you okay?

783
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,897
I didn't get much on me.

784
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:56,154
Mr. Nam, you should go to your fiancée.

785
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,072
We'll--

786
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,406
We!

787
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,368
Should stop fighting and cooperate,

788
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,496
now that we're here together.

789
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,706
Jeez.

790
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:11,169
You wanted to be with me forever.
I don't do fiancées.

791
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:17,759
So I was mistaken about the whole thing,
the fiancée and the cooperation.

792
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:22,138
I was going to call you when I got
the situation under control. Really.

793
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,308
Then you should have told us before…

794
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:31,106
Let's go, shall we? Prosecutor Cha?

795
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,900
Let's go work together.
"We" should do that.

796
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:37,863
No, wait.

797
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,991
No, wait. Come on, wait.

798
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,659
Wait, Ms. Han.

799
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:51,001
We shall now sign the agreement.

800
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:54,838
MAYOR LEE MYEONG-JUN

801
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:58,717
Thank you.

802
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:03,722
Could you pose for a picture?

803
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:05,140
LAND REDEVELOPMENT CONTRACT

804
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:14,566
When is Auntie getting here?

805
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:16,776
She'll be down as soon as
she finishes her prayers.

806
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,486
She'll be with us soon.

807
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:48,642
Why are they looking for Auntie Im?
Who is she?

808
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,353
Mr. Nam said she's someone important…

809
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,736
It's Gu Tae-su.

810
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:01,154
What?

811
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:07,869
Is it really him?

812
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:10,246
Yes, it was him. I'm sure…

813
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:13,333
I'll go that way.

814
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,211
Okay, then I'll go this way. Be careful.

815
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:17,295
Okay.

816
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:28,473
Did the ceremony go well?

817
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,934
Yes, they're all waiting for you.

818
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,644
-And…
-Nam Han-jun…

819
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:34,854
He must be here.

820
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,567
I had a feeling he would choose to come.

821
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:42,946
He's at the ceremony in disguise.
What should we do with him?

822
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,492
We'll make sure
it's his last day on earth.

823
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,086
There.

824
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:02,841
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

825
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,303
You look like a real chef.

826
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,055
It suits you better than I thought.

827
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,102
Hey.

828
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:15,979
There.

829
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:30,410
Don't be so nervous and smile.

830
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,037
There you go.

831
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,375
Okay.

832
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:48,595
-Here's your food.
-There you go.

833
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,560
You.

834
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:58,521
What are you doing here?

835
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:03,026
I'm just serving the food.

836
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,655
You go out of your destined way to
appease the unhappy spirit.

837
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,914
Be careful, or you might find your
life unexpectedly cut short.

838
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:23,338
Auntie, if you tell him
out of the blue, you'll scare him.

839
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:24,506
Yes, ma'am.

840
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:26,925
You better pay her for the fortunetelling
before you go.

841
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,058
I don't have any cash on me.

842
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:40,230
Hey.

843
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,691
Look.

844
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,367
How am I supposed to eat this?
You need to cut it.

845
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:56,955
Right.

846
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:10,802
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

847
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:25,150
Did you have to do that?

848
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,526
It wasn't me.

849
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:29,529
Let's go, come on.

850
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,576
The bug's working fine.

851
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:37,203
But it doesn't have a wide radius,
so don't go too far.

852
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:38,913
We found a spot nearby.

853
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:40,707
I'll connect you to the bug, then.

854
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,585
My readings tell me

855
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:47,464
that you will now take flight, unimpeded,
and soar like a dragon, sir.

856
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,550
And that's what he wants too.

857
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:53,344
It's been less than a month
since I came into office.

858
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,890
That reminds me.

859
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:00,727
Has the Kang Eun-hye case
been taken care of?

860
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:04,230
You should have taken it easy, Mayor.

861
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,857
She should have taken it easy.

862
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:06,983
What a load of crap.

863
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:10,487
She went crazy for the drugs
and just wouldn't stop struggling.

864
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,405
I was only going to scare her.

865
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,365
Who knew she'd die so easily?

866
00:58:15,074 --> 00:58:17,785
It's all been taken care of.
You don't have to worry.

867
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:19,662
You are as remarkable as ever.

868
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,749
You must have been scared
with the campaign going on.

869
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:23,791
Of course.

870
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:25,585
I was shaking in my shoes.

871
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:31,174
By the way, that Gu Tae-su…

872
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:33,218
The one with the creepy look in his eyes.

873
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:36,429
The police keep calling him
into the station.

874
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,639
I can't help but worry.

875
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:40,558
Gu Tae-su's been taking care of the
business until now.

876
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:43,144
We'll get rid of him
as soon as this project is over,

877
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,687
so wait a little longer.

878
00:58:44,771 --> 00:58:49,108
Right. Gu Tae-su was
cleaning up after them.

879
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,735
Yes.

880
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:54,030
It also means
he knows all their weaknesses.

881
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:55,114
Right.

882
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,247
The director is here.

883
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:21,349
I'm sorry I'm late.

884
00:59:21,432 --> 00:59:24,477
The man of the hour.
You have impeccable timing.

885
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,108
The work…

886
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:13,735
Someone's coming your way.

887
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,112
-Did they find the bug?
-What?

888
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:48,144
EPILOGUE

889
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:39,737
I've got them.

890
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,490
-Deal with them quietly.
-Gu Tae-su!

891
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:45,284
Gu Tae-su.
You're Lim Yeong-ju, aren't you?

892
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,162
We'll look for evidence
that will allow us to arrest them both.

893
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,373
Am I interrupting anything?

894
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:51,541
Auntie Im is that woman
from before, right?

895
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,251
Whatever you're planning to do,

896
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:55,128
-you should stop.
-You punk!

897
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,755
So, his hideout is in one of these places.

898
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:02,385
A secret hideout that no one knows about,
that only he has access to.

899
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:05,096
Benzene, the gopuri fabric…
It's definitely Gu Tae-su's.

900
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:06,848
You need to come quickly. Hurry!

901
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:11,936
