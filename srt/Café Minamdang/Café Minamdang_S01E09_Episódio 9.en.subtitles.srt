1
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,163
Move, and I'll shoot.

2
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,917
What? I know we're archenemies,

3
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,170
but isn't it a bit much,
holding us at gunpoint?

4
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,838
I said I'll shoot if you move.

5
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,883
Do you think
I'll fall for an empty threat--

6
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,482
Han-jun!

7
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,944
Mr. Nam!

8
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,863
EPISODE 9

9
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,198
Han-jun!

10
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:17,535
What's happened to Han-jun?

11
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,125
-Han-jun.
-Hey.

12
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,088
Make sure to get the file.

13
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:31,591
Okay.

14
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,843
Han-jun.

15
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,598
Here! We're here!

16
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:41,768
There's a man dying here!

17
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,771
Mr. Nam, are you okay?

18
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,650
-Mr. Nam.
-Mr. Nam.

19
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,361
If you're okay,
please tell us why you're here.

20
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,907
You!

21
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:00,078
The misery of countless women rests
on your shoulders.

22
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,412
What you did

23
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,833
will bring about your death soon.

24
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:07,168
Repent right now.

25
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:11,172
Or the gods will smite you!

26
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:15,343
Goodness, Mr. Shaman.

27
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,137
Here, I've got you.

28
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,014
Gosh, Mr. Shaman. Are you all right?

29
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,350
-Gosh.
-No, don't do that.

30
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:26,229
Mr. Shaman…

31
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:32,527
Mr. Shaman. My goodness.

32
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,988
DAEUN POLICE STATION

33
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,166
Who is this?

34
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,959
Is she one of our streamers?

35
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,712
You really don't know who she is?

36
00:02:51,212 --> 00:02:54,924
I told you, I'm in finance. I really don't
know much about show business.

37
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,845
HOUSING RENTAL CONTRACT

38
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,556
Then why is this lease

39
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,266
under your name?

40
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:07,061
I guess my employees used my name for it.

41
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,607
Come on. Don't give us that nonsense.

42
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,776
The woman at the real estate agency
remembers your face.

43
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,570
We checked it out already.

44
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:20,116
Sometimes I find rooms for our employees
from less fortunate backgrounds.

45
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,536
I don't remember who that is though.

46
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,999
Is that so?
Maybe this might jog your memory.

47
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,711
Here.

48
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:39,093
What was this again?

49
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:42,305
Who are those people with you?

50
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,267
Right, the girl who shot
her casting profile video.

51
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,811
Actually, I produce movies too.

52
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:51,522
It was an audition with our staff.

53
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,026
What? Do you want me
to show you the script?

54
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,569
Is the plot of your movie

55
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,489
taking a minor overseas

56
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,617
and making her provide sexual favors
to the people you bribe?

57
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,037
I don't know about you, detective,

58
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,289
but I don't do that sort of thing anymore.

59
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:10,583
I did tag along with my employees,

60
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,253
but I just went and had some fun.
That's it.

61
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,966
Ask the guys you brought in with me.

62
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,397
I'm in charge of this side
of our business and its operations.

63
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,482
Mr. Jeon doesn't know anything about it.

64
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,235
You know who this is, don't you?

65
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:41,406
Yes, it's her. The one who came
for our overseas marketing event.

66
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,573
-Hey.
-Yes?

67
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,118
Do you call gambling trips
a marketing event?

68
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,453
Who were your clients?

69
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,289
You procured sexual services for them.

70
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:54,002
Come on, sir. It was just an event
to keep our VIP clients happy.

71
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,129
There wasn't any prostitution involved.

72
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:12,937
How much longer do I have to…
Gosh, that's hot!

73
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,816
How much longer will it be?

74
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,653
We confiscated this evidence
from the Jjokmun gang's offices.

75
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,073
They're mostly records
of your streamers' debt settlements

76
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,742
and prostitution.

77
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,162
I told you I don't know anything.

78
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,457
Ask the other guys you brought in.

79
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:38,629
Then…

80
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,298
VIP MARKETING EVENT RECORD

81
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,635
Do you recognize what this is?

82
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,561
These letters are initials
of people's names, aren't they?

83
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,149
The numbers are the dates
that the services were provided.

84
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,817
Well…

85
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:03,029
I didn't write these, so I don't know.

86
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,032
Has anyone here received
sexual services from Kang Eun-hye?

87
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,455
I'm done eating,
so I think I'll go home now.

88
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,875
Detective.
Could you call my lawyer for me?

89
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,547
What? Let Jeon Gyeong-cheol go?

90
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,427
Yes, sir. No, okay.

91
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,386
Mr. Jeon…

92
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,473
is a strong supporter of art and culture.

93
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,475
TRUE CONSERVATIVE PARTY SENIOR MEMBER
PARK JEONG-HYEON

94
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,310
I am aware of that.

95
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,854
Yes, I'll get right on it.

96
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:37,980
Yes, sir.

97
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,567
Hey.

98
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:45,279
Are you trying to put me out of a job?

99
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,906
I told you not to stir up trouble

100
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:50,326
and just close the case, didn't I?

101
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:55,331
I tried, but you know the deal.
Kids these days just don't listen.

102
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,959
-They're all so assertive--
-Hey!

103
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:02,713
You're getting way out of line these days.

104
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,298
Are you in a midlife crisis?

105
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,844
Would you like to retire before your
mortgage payments are finished?

106
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:12,557
Come on. Even Prosecutor Cha is here
in person, interrogating him--

107
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,809
Do you work for the Prosecutors' Office?

108
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,019
You're the police! Got that?

109
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,940
Indict his goons
and let Jeon Gyeong-cheol go right now!

110
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:24,110
Yes, sir.

111
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:27,405
I will do that. Chief Kim Cheol-geun.

112
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:30,450
What's with that attitude?

113
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:33,327
Unbelievable. You can't do that…

114
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,333
That punk must have a death wish.

115
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,587
Let Jeon Gyeong-cheol go?

116
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,297
That doesn't make any sense!

117
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:48,009
You're not going to hand the case over
to division three and give up, are you?

118
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:53,014
There are people who are
trying to protect Jeon Gyeong-cheol.

119
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,807
Protect him?

120
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,019
Someone told the Chief
to let Jeon Gyeong-cheol go.

121
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,521
I don't know the details,

122
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:03,483
but it seemed like
it was someone really high up.

123
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,487
We have to find out who that is first.

124
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,655
We don't have that kind of time.

125
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:13,284
Ma'am. Are you just going to
just watch and let them do this?

126
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:17,205
We need more conclusive evidence.
Something he can't squirm out of.

127
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,961
Darn it.

128
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,846
Thank you for helping us so often
when you must be busy.

129
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,307
I like investigating with you,

130
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,477
but it upsets me to watch you suffer.

131
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,647
I'm fine. It's not like it's over.

132
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,525
We'll find the evidence
and arrest him again.

133
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:50,363
Did you know? You put on
a braver face when things get tougher.

134
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,990
You really are astute.

135
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,577
The truth is, I am really upset right now.

136
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,205
Really? There's this thing I do
when I feel that way.

137
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,001
It's actually pretty helpful.

138
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,754
Cheer up, Jae-hui.

139
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:13,844
-We can do it.
-We can do it!

140
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:16,889
This is good.

141
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:17,932
That's me.

142
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:18,975
What?

143
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,852
It really is you.

144
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:22,770
WE CAN DO IT!

145
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,438
-We can do it.
-We can do it.

146
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,443
RE-A

147
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,361
HYE-JI

148
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,781
Did you find anything?

149
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,491
JJOKMUN ENTERTAINMENT PROFILE

150
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,909
-Look at this.
-Okay.

151
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,413
I think the numbers
on the modeling fee record

152
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,291
are the dates prostitution took place
and the sum paid to the women.

153
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,669
I'm looking for the person
that received her sexual service.

154
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:47,837
This includes minors.

155
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,215
These bastards should be beaten to death.

156
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,218
We should beat him up first.

157
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,472
He was released with no charges.

158
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,434
He was released without even
stepping foot in the detention center.

159
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:05,730
This is how fair
the Korean judicial system is.

160
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,734
By the way, are you sure
that Jeon Gyeong-cheol knows Gopuri?

161
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,652
Yes. I could tell he does.

162
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,237
Should I go get him and bring him here?

163
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,116
We'll make him come on his own accord
and tell us everything.

164
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,410
His business is profitable,

165
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,704
but it's been made to look
thoroughly legitimate.

166
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,205
He's meticulous

167
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,333
but not assertive.
That's Jeon Gyeong-cheol.

168
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,210
It means he scares very easily.

169
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,588
What do you think works on guys like this?

170
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,964
I got it!

171
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,633
-A spanking.
-Wrong.

172
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,885
Anxiety.

173
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,470
People like him hate being anxious.

174
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:41,682
We have to drive him completely nuts
by stoking his anxiety.

175
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:46,937
Some brains he's got.

176
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,232
Here, have some coffee.

177
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,528
Yes, that's it.

178
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,490
Would you look at that? What a cushy life.

179
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:59,742
Buying a new car at a time like this?

180
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,577
Jeon Gyeong-cheol's out. Get ready.

181
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,412
There he is, prancing about.

182
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,664
Damn it.

183
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,917
You rotten fool.

184
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,462
I told you to behave yourself and try
to avoid the misfortune coming to you.

185
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:14,674
Yet you're still running wild,
unable to see what's beyond your nose.

186
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,633
What?

187
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,718
What is it now?

188
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,388
Are going to have that idiot
beat me up again?

189
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,432
Your life will end shortly.

190
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,476
You were fated to die young,

191
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,770
but your energy has waned even further

192
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,147
since you met someone who's poison to you.

193
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:36,278
Today will be tough too,
so take special care.

194
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,159
Come find me
if you want to extend your lifespan.

195
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,287
I'm Shaman Han-jun of Minamdang.

196
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:47,998
Okay?

197
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,086
What the hell?

198
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,965
Hey, that's my car. Wait!

199
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,467
Hey, wait! No, wait!

200
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:02,596
Hey, I have to sell that today,
you assholes!

201
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,099
The first mission has been cleared.

202
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,482
Second player, going in.

203
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,241
Oh, no. That hurts.

204
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,826
Gosh.

205
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,119
Are you okay?

206
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,546
I'm sorry.

207
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,631
My gosh!

208
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,468
Damn it.

209
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:41,594
Wait…

210
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:44,138
Wait, no, are you…

211
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:47,558
Wait, you can't just go.

212
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:50,352
Come on, wait!

213
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,273
And the phone?

214
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,985
A super-speed battery burner.

215
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,653
It should be dead now.

216
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,614
Nice job.

217
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,285
Today's the day of
the eighth national regional elections.

218
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,663
Voting will take place
until 6 in the afternoon,

219
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,624
so if you haven't voted yet…

220
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:16,086
Stop playing around and switch on already.

221
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,007
What's with this phone? Unbelievable.

222
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,552
That nonsense is making me antsy…

223
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,641
My wallet…

224
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:31,936
Sir. You can use your cell phone to pay.

225
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:35,814
It's out of battery!

226
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:39,693
So what are you saying?
You're not going to pay for the fare?

227
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,780
No, I'll pay you when I get there.

228
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,616
Of course, I will.

229
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,212
Come on, I said I can pay you!

230
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:04,343
Do I look like I can't afford cab fare?

231
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,806
You can't just leave me here.
What am I supposed to do?

232
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,706
Hey.

233
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,125
Give me a cigarette.

234
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,127
And lend me your phone.

235
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,754
You're awfully rude for someone
who wants to borrow our things.

236
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,884
Goodness.

237
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,472
Keep this up and when you grow up,

238
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,726
you'll have nowhere
to go other than escort bars.

239
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,605
And you. They won't even accept you.

240
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,025
Who the hell do you
think you are to curse us?

241
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,611
My leg…

242
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,196
Pervert!

243
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,574
Get him.

244
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,909
-Jeez.
-What a prick.

245
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,202
-Hey, wait.
-Damn you.

246
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,662
Come on. I told you I'm sorry.

247
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,793
Stop it.

248
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,462
Why you…

249
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:24,173
That wasn't a part of my plan.

250
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,884
Gosh.

251
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,511
-Let's go.
-Do we leave him like that?

252
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,056
You don't mess with 18-year-old girls.

253
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,517
Even I can't handle teenage girls.

254
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,776
Damn it. Enough!

255
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,949
You were right, Mr. Shaman.

256
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,451
If that patrol car hadn't been passing by,

257
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:55,037
I would have been beaten to death.

258
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,582
Gosh, I'm sorry to hear that.

259
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,669
That must have been terrible.

260
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:05,297
Everything's going to get better.

261
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,927
It's okay. I'm really okay.

262
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,553
No, you're not!

263
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,598
This is just the beginning.

264
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,142
I told you. You don't have
a lot of time left to live.

265
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,562
Please, help me, Mr. Shaman.

266
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,399
I'll do anything you tell me to.

267
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,236
Please, just save me.

268
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,450
I don't know if I should save
someone like you.

269
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,035
Sir. Please.

270
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,705
I'll be good from now on.

271
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,248
Really!

272
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,500
What should I do?

273
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,044
Sir, please.

274
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:49,258
Mr. Shaman. Why don't you ask the spirit?

275
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,927
I'll bring you a raw egg.

276
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,722
Roll it over your wounds, okay?

277
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,764
All right.

278
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,189
Ta-da.

279
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:24,001
Let's see.

280
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:29,631
Let's see how many evil spirits
have gathered around you.

281
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:35,471
Someone you know is being haunted.
Someone who has killed recently.

282
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,348
He has committed so many sins

283
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,684
that all of nature rages at him.

284
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:06,210
Your silence on the matter is what invites
that anger upon you too!

285
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,589
I can't talk about it.

286
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,049
No.

287
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,635
I'll die if I talk about it.

288
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,224
The only way for you to live
is to sort him out.

289
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,852
He has a burn scar on his arm, right?

290
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,146
It's not like
catching him will change anything.

291
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,566
Catching Gu Tae-su
isn't going to make it end!

292
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,984
Gu Tae-su?

293
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,779
Is that his name?

294
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,262
I sense a woman next to him
with a fiendish aura.

295
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:00,305
Who is she?

296
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,893
I can't tell you.

297
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,606
I've brought you the egg.

298
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,358
Get out of my way!

299
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,278
Why? You can't extend your lifespan?

300
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,113
He's more scared of Gu Tae-su

301
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,116
than he is of his own death
and won't talk.

302
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,579
I'm not talking because I want to live.

303
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,374
But still,

304
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,461
rub your eyes with this.

305
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:35,299
You've been through a lot.

306
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,092
Cheer up.

307
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,512
Turn yourself in if you want to live.

308
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,267
With this sort of business,
you have to tell the world.

309
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,562
That's how you stop them
from coming after you.

310
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:52,399
That's how you can live.

311
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,355
Eun-hye…

312
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,706
The day Kang Eun-hye died,

313
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,168
I installed a hidden camera in the room.

314
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,380
It was dark,
so I was worried it might not work,

315
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,633
but thankfully,
the video was nice and clear.

316
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:01,885
What do you want?

317
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:07,516
I need money if I'm going to put an end
to this life and go abroad.

318
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,977
Just give me three billion won,

319
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,147
and I'll hand over the evidence
and lie low for the rest of my life.

320
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,733
I'll call you back
after I report the situation.

321
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,113
Report? To whom?

322
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,702
Gu Tae-su alone couldn't have
accounted for everything.

323
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,371
There's definitely someone behind him.

324
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,000
Did you find out anything about Gu Tae-su?

325
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,420
It's pretty weird.

326
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,968
He's not a registered director
and isn't listed on their payroll.

327
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,761
There's no record of him.

328
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,098
Even if he's not online,
he has to use a phone or a credit card.

329
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,391
Does he live in a cave?

330
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,227
Is there a company credit card
without a name attached to it?

331
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,526
Wait. There's one.

332
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:00,944
Of course.

333
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,156
This is the Republic of Korea.
You can't live on cash.

334
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:07,826
Jeez, but it hasn't been used
in the last few months.

335
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:10,037
Shoot. But still,

336
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,248
we threw the bait at Jeon Gyeong-cheol.
I'm sure he'll bite soon.

337
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,709
-Let's get this done in one go.
-Okay.

338
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:22,758
GOPURI MURDERED KANG EUN-HYE
MURDERED HAN JAE-JEONG

339
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,733
Sir! I found Jeon Gyeong-cheol.

340
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,318
Okay.

341
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,780
Damn it, I've got pins and needles. Ouch.

342
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,116
Oh, my back.

343
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:52,204
Jeon Gyeong-cheol's been visiting
Kang Eun-hye's apartment regularly.

344
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,873
Either Jeon Gyeong-cheol killed
Kang Eun-hye, or…

345
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:58,085
He took Kang Eun-hye to the killer.

346
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:03,381
Still, it's obvious that he's the link
in the Kang Eun-hye case.

347
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,429
But this car doesn't belong to
Jeon Gyeong-cheol, though.

348
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,555
VEHICLE SEARCH

349
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,349
That must be a vehicle
he seized from a debtor.

350
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,852
It'll be hard if it isn't registered
under the owner's name.

351
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,021
Damn it.

352
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,731
159P5110

353
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,527
159P5110

354
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,139
Where is the oracle?

355
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,599
She said you must wait here.

356
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:09,906
Yang Jae-won of the New Progressive Party

357
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,367
against Lee Myeong-jun
of the True Conservative Party.

358
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,120
It's expected to be
less than a five-percent difference.

359
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,998
The air is tense
in both parties' ballot situation room,

360
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,333
with the exit poll results
soon to be announced.

361
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:32,095
This is a live video
of each party's ballot situation room.

362
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,431
I wonder which party
will be cheering today.

363
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:38,143
We have ten seconds to go until
the exit poll results are announced.

364
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:41,062
The two candidates are neck-and-neck
in Sinmyeong's exit poll results.

365
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:59,164
Candidate Yang Jae-won of
the New Progressive Party has 46.5%,

366
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,500
and candidate Lee Myeong-jun of the
True Conservative Party has 44.2%.

367
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:06,379
Candidate Yang is expected to win
against Candidate Lee

368
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,298
by a small margin.

369
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,677
-Yang Jae-won!
-Yang Jae-won!

370
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:26,066
-Yang Jae-won!
-Yang Jae-won!

371
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:34,157
We can win.

372
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,451
The two candidates continue
to be closely matched

373
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:39,871
as more ballots are counted,
leaving both on high alert.

374
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:44,793
85.3% of the ballots have been counted,
and candidate Yang is…

375
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,800
Votes are rapidly pouring in
for candidate Lee,

376
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,678
who has been lagging behind candidate
Yang by a small margin.

377
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:05,939
Candidate Lee is on the rise
as the ballot count draws to an end.

378
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,237
45.0%
3,599,640 VOTES

379
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:20,912
90.3% of the ballots have been counted,

380
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:25,166
and candidate Lee overtakes
candidate Yang.

381
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,960
-Lee Myeong-jun!
-Lee Myeong-jun!

382
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,379
-Candidate Yang is at 45.80%…
-Lee Myeong-jun!

383
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:32,257
-…and Candidate Lee at 46.70%.
-Lee Myeong-jun!

384
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,926
It has been neck-and-neck until the end,

385
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,263
but candidate Lee has been elected
as the mayor of Sinmyeong.

386
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,225
LEE MYEONG-JUN
ELECTED

387
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:48,189
-Sir!
-He's collapsed.

388
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,899
-Call 911.
-Call 911 right now!

389
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,944
-Mr. Mayor!
-Mr. Mayor!

390
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,739
-Mr. Mayor!
-Mr. Mayor!

391
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,115
-Mr. Mayor!
-Mr. Mayor!

392
00:26:57,198 --> 00:27:00,452
-Mr. Mayor!
-Mr. Mayor!

393
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,599
THE ORACLE
AUNTIE IM

394
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:29,522
Congratulations on your election,
Mr. Mayor.

395
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,317
I haven't been appointed yet.

396
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:40,575
This is all thanks to you, Aunt.

397
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,827
I've done nothing.

398
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,748
You should not be thanking me but him.

399
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:50,085
Yes. Of course.

400
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,420
I wasn't thinking straight.

401
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,838
I'll visit soon

402
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:58,426
and will make sure the thing
you spoke of proceeds with no issues.

403
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,429
MAYOR OF SINMYEONG
LEE MYEONG-JUN

404
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,400
Something happened, didn't it?

405
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,652
Jeon Gyeong-cheol
seems to have taken a video

406
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,279
on the day Kang Eun-hye died.

407
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,739
Vulgar fool.

408
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,616
And?

409
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:24,994
He says he'll disappear
if he can get three billion won.

410
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,746
What should I do?

411
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,565
NAM HAN-JUN

412
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:17,714
JEON GYEONG-CHEOL

413
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,967
Our plan will be foiled
if he starts running his mouth.

414
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,262
I was told to take care of him.

415
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,526
This is what he wants.

416
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:43,406
I'll go deal with him.

417
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,295
I'll get the three billion won
and go to your office.

418
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,464
It will take an hour or so.

419
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,342
Then I'll be waiting.

420
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,356
We have to get there first. Hurry.

421
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,110
I've accessed the CCTV.

422
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:24,072
He seems to be alone in his office,
but still, be careful.

423
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,783
This is the last video.

424
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,286
January 16th, 5 p.m.

425
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,915
Kang Eun-hye's estimated time of death.

426
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:40,088
Damn it. Jeon Gyeong-cheol,
that son of a bitch. I ought to…

427
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,506
Damn him!

428
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,345
-Mr. Cha.
-Yes?

429
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:50,431
-Did you just laugh at Lieutenant Han?
-What?

430
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,476
Come on, that's really rude.

431
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,145
It's not like we wanted to let
Jeon Gyeong-cheol go.

432
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,313
It's not like that.

433
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,608
She looked cute fired up like that.

434
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,026
What? What did I say?

435
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,238
I can't believe I was so clueless,
sitting here and stuffing my face

436
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,365
when you brought the food for you two.

437
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,783
No, it's not like that.

438
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:09,784
What do you mean?

439
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:13,162
Am I being clueless,
or are you two interested in each other?

440
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:18,835
Sir, Mr. Cha and I aren't like that.

441
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,628
Enough kidding around.

442
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,132
Let's go get Jeon Gyeong-cheol again.

443
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,721
Mr. Cha.

444
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,602
It must be hard.

445
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:40,148
Come on, isn't it obvious?

446
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,358
She doesn't have a romantic bone
in her body.

447
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,903
She won't understand
if you beat around the bush.

448
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,324
You have to be direct. Be straightforward!

449
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,784
-Okay.
-I feel bad for you.

450
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:06,299
The light's out in his office, though.

451
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:10,094
Are you sure he's in there?

452
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,931
Yes. His car's still
in the parking lot. Why?

453
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:16,017
People don't have the lights off
when they're expecting someone.

454
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:16,935
Right.

455
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,395
I'll see if he walked somewhere else.

456
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,773
I have a bad feeling about this.

457
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,358
Let's go and see.

458
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,652
Okay.

459
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,313
It's dark.

460
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,901
-It's so quiet.
-Yes.

461
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,122
Mr. Jeon?

462
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,165
Mr. Jeon.

463
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,890
Han-jun.

464
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,809
He's not breathing.

465
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:56,451
They took the evidence
and made it look like suicide.

466
00:33:56,534 --> 00:34:00,913
Then I'll go see if they're nearby.

467
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,923
-Jeon Gyeong-cheol's dead.
-What?

468
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,426
Check Gu Tae-su's movements
through the CCTVs.

469
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,385
Yes, okay.

470
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,854
Not this time, you scumbag.

471
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,367
You bastard…

472
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,097
I see him going in,

473
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,851
but there's no footage of him leaving.
Do you want me to check the other side?

474
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:47,979
Nam Han-jun.

475
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,608
Han-jun.

476
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,279
Where is he?

477
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,990
Su-cheol, Nam Han-jun
isn't responding. Hurry back inside.

478
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,741
Yes, okay.

479
00:36:04,912 --> 00:36:06,539
What are you doing here?

480
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:09,417
-Are you here to see Jeon Gyeong-cheol?
-Is Mr. Nam with you?

481
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,153
You should have given up then.

482
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,406
Then you would have gotten
out of this alive.

483
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:44,035
It must be you

484
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,828
who killed Jae-jeong.

485
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,879
Why did you kill Jae-jeong? Why?

486
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,112
We don't have time to be chatting here.

487
00:37:31,791 --> 00:37:32,792
Han-jun!

488
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,712
Are you kidding me?

489
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,479
Han-jun!

490
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,898
Han-jun!

491
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,360
Han-jun! Are you okay? What happened?

492
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,070
It's Gopuri. He ran.

493
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,782
Gopuri, that bastard.

494
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,994
Sit.

495
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:12,248
Gosh, what happened?
Should I call an ambulance?

496
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,335
Wait, that fabric is…

497
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,213
Yes.

498
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:23,843
It's the same gopuri fabric that was
at the crime scene for Eun-hye's murder.

499
00:38:58,919 --> 00:38:59,920
Over here!

500
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,095
Mr. Cha!

501
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,434
I almost had him, but he ran.

502
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:15,853
Are you okay?

503
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:42,046
This is unusual in that…

504
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,340
What's that?

505
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,926
It seems like a crushed cell phone.

506
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,553
We can't retrieve anything
since it lacks a flash memory.

507
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,515
But could you try anyway?

508
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:53,766
Yes, ma'am.

509
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,229
-That hurts. Be gentle.
-Here? Or here?

510
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,730
Hey, don't touch me. Don't.

511
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:02,817
Where were you before?

512
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,944
Well, I…

513
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,238
-You should have hurried.
-I did hurry.

514
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:18,040
Lieutenant Han. You better look at this.

515
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:28,008
I prostituted Kang Eun-hye
to Choi Yeong-seop.

516
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:30,886
But I didn't know that he would kill her.

517
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,139
It's all my fault.

518
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,266
My deepest condolences
go to Kang Eun-hye's family.

519
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,518
"Choi Yeong-seop killed Kang Eun-hye."

520
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:42,440
"I'm committing suicide over the guilt."
It's something like that, I presume.

521
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,736
No, I didn't show it to him.

522
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:49,864
How did you…

523
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,534
It's him. He's the killer.

524
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,162
The one we saw in the bathroom
at Joyce Entertainment.

525
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,836
The employee who brought the security
guards and dragged us away?

526
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,882
Gosh, it hurts. Yes.

527
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:09,758
Gu Tae-su.

528
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,806
-Are you all right?
-Yes. Detective Kim.

529
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:19,226
Go to Joyce Entertainment and find out
about a man named Gu Tae-su.

530
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:20,978
Yes.

531
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,191
I've heard that Park Jin-sang
of Joyce Entertainment

532
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,485
is your cousin.

533
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,699
Yes, well. That is true.

534
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:37,328
But I don't let
personal connections get in my way,

535
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,163
so you don't have to worry.

536
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:41,165
I see.

537
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,751
Anyway, I have to sue Gu Tae-su

538
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,462
for what he did,

539
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:49,757
so give me a call
when you catch the scumbag.

540
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:53,552
Where are you going?
You're coming with us.

541
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,639
What? No, I'm not. Why should I?

542
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:01,477
If you refuse,
you'll be taken to the station by force.

543
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,024
By force? Me?

544
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:10,110
I didn't see the killer
you're talking about anywhere around here.

545
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,571
You were the only one
at the scene of the crime.

546
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,824
You're a suspect for now,
so you're coming with us.

547
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:19,370
-Really? Are you kidding me?
-Lieutenant Han.

548
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,540
-The killer, I…
-Quiet. Pretend it didn't happen.

549
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,709
Take him away.

550
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,962
Wait, you just exchanged glances…

551
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,507
Mr. Shaman, sorry about this.

552
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,384
Come on, seriously?

553
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,135
You know I don't want to.

554
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,012
Hold on. Wait.

555
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:40,808
Does that mean I'm getting arrested too?

556
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,435
I'll call you if we need you.

557
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,521
Really? Okay.

558
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,356
Come on, take him away.

559
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,360
-I need to cuff you. Come on.
-What?

560
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:54,071
-Come on already.
-This place is too dusty.

561
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:56,282
-Come on, move it.
-Wait…

562
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,746
Thank goodness, I'm safe.

563
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:05,624
DAEUN POLICE STATION

564
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:06,542
Ma'am.

565
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:10,296
Gu Tae-su's not even registered
as an employee. He's a director by name.

566
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:13,048
No one at Joyce Entertainment knows him.

567
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,843
But I did find out where he used to work,

568
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:18,304
so I'll go look there and call you.

569
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:19,346
Okay. Good luck.

570
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,639
Okay, bye.

571
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,433
INTERVIEW ROOM

572
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,768
BASIC INFORMATION
NAME: NAM HAN-JUN

573
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,228
THE MI-SUN MISSING CASE
SOLVED AFTER 18 YEARS

574
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:32,359
Mr. Shaman was
the famous Cold Case Hunter?

575
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:40,743
I've heard rumors
about this amazing profiler at HQ

576
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:43,370
when I was at the Investigation Bureau.

577
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,706
He would solve all these cold cases,

578
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:49,752
and everyone was so amazed.

579
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:56,592
He must have already had his powers then.

580
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:01,138
Honestly, he's amazing.

581
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:04,933
Wait.

582
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,853
Tampering with evidence?

583
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:11,065
I guess it didn't end well.

584
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:17,863
You don't really think
that Mr. Nam is the killer, do you?

585
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:22,076
The killer with the burn scar
that Mr. Nam talked about…

586
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,202
I saw him too earlier.

587
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:26,705
I know that Mr. Nam isn't the killer.

588
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,540
I want to hear the truth from him,

589
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:32,670
and I didn't want him
to squirm away again. So I'm holding him.

590
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:36,340
He wouldn't even see you
all those times you went to talk to him.

591
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,009
You think he'll tell you something now?

592
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:46,141
Lieutenant Han.
Did you know Mr. Shaman from before?

593
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,562
He's someone I need to get to know.

594
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,943
I'm going to go ask him
what exactly happened

595
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:57,861
three years ago.

596
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,167
-Mr. Cha.
-What?

597
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,420
You've got a rival.

598
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,340
You better stay on your toes.

599
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,219
What about Gu Tae-su? Did you find him?

600
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,513
Not yet.

601
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:28,434
The people at Joyce Entertainment
don't know who he is either.

602
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,228
Damn.

603
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:34,189
You'll never catch him with legwork.

604
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,193
You sound like you know him well.

605
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:43,240
Joyce Entertainment,
Choi Yeong-seop's hospital room,

606
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:45,909
Jeon Gyeong-cheol's office,
and Prosecutor Han's apartment.

607
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,412
I've run into him four times.

608
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:51,123
I don't just know him.
It's as if we're connected by fate.

609
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:56,253
You said you only saw the burn scar
at the scene and not his face.

610
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:57,963
Yes.

611
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:02,885
But I have a feeling
and I'm sure it was him.

612
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,180
"A feeling"?

613
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,057
How very logical of you.

614
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,936
Is that why you arrested me?
To twist my words?

615
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:16,523
Then convince me with facts, not feelings.

616
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:23,697
The white fabric
that Ms. Kang's body was covered with

617
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,657
and the fabric found
in Jeon Gyeong-cheol's office…

618
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:29,453
They are all gopuri fabrics
that shamans use for rituals.

619
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:34,082
The same fabric was found at the scene of
Prosecutor Han's murder three years ago.

620
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,211
And the red symbol found
splattered over the fabric

621
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,962
is the same too.

622
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,089
"The red symbol…"

623
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,592
But the analysis of the cloth
covering the victim

624
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:46,178
showed traces of dye as well as blood.

625
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,304
Dye?

626
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:53,143
Right, they found dye on the fabric.

627
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:59,233
It was burnt,
but it was definitely a gopuri knot.

628
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,569
And it looked like it had
writing on it like a talisman.

629
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,988
He must have been
carrying out a ritual of sorts,

630
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:07,366
believing himself to be punishing evil.

631
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,953
So Choi Yeong-seop's case was an exception

632
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:13,580
because he got caught
before he could do the ritual?

633
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:14,665
Yes.

634
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:18,544
He believes himself superior,
punishing sins using his own rules.

635
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:25,801
Let's check together
if Gu Tae-su was behind all the killings.

636
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,304
Let's try forensic hypnosis.

637
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:32,182
It might bring back the memory that faded

638
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,392
-from the shock …
-Please.

639
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,396
No, thanks. Hypnosis isn't
even admissible as evidence.

640
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:40,315
-But we might find something we missed.
-No.

641
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:46,196
Is it because you're afraid,

642
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,241
or is it because you don't want to know?

643
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:56,123
Perfectionists like me aren't
very susceptible to hypnosis anyway.

644
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,379
I guess you're right.

645
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:05,632
Give it some thought
while you go to sleep in the holding cell.

646
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:08,969
Fine.

647
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:15,601
You can only keep me for 48 hours anyway.

648
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,376
Move me to another room.
I can't stay here!

649
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:45,005
Does this look like a hotel to you?
You can't just switch rooms.

650
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,173
Hey, wait!

651
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,720
I'll do it. The forensic hypnosis.

652
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,891
I thought you weren't very susceptible
to hypnosis?

653
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:58,101
That is true, but…

654
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,520
I'll try for the sake of my investigation.

655
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,736
Hurry!

656
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:14,493
I'm sorry, sir.
Could you try just one more time?

657
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,500
Now. Mr. Nam. Picture yourself

658
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:23,460
watching a play in a safe space.

659
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:27,255
Now, take a deep breath in and out.

660
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,134
Now, when I count down from three,

661
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:36,431
you will return to 5 p.m.,
November 3rd, 2019.

662
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,142
Three, two, one.

663
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:45,816
Mr. Nam. What day is it today
and where are you?

664
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:46,900
Today is

665
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,737
February 24th, 2022.

666
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,365
I'm in the room of a forensic hypnotist.

667
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,666
Never mind. Let's just stop.

668
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:05,794
I told you. It just doesn't work!

669
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:08,797
I'm sorry, sir.

670
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,843
Could we just try one last time? Please?

671
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,262
Come on, let's just go
and stop wasting time.

672
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:24,312
Hey, let's try it now.

673
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:26,940
When he's focused on the pain.

674
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:29,234
-Let's try again.
-You really think that'll work?

675
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:32,904
Mr. Nam, stand up.

676
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:35,615
Jeez, why?

677
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,243
Oh, gosh!

678
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,704
Do it now!

679
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,080
I want to go home--

680
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:45,876
Wait, Mr. Nam. You're dreaming.
This is a dream. It's all a dream.

681
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:47,169
Now, calm down. Twenty.

682
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,337
Nineteen.

683
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:51,256
Eighteen.

684
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,091
Seventeen.

685
00:50:54,593 --> 00:50:55,594
Sixteen.

686
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:57,679
Good.

687
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:03,643
Now, then. Go back to 5 p.m.
on November 3rd, 2019.

688
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,438
What happened that day?

689
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,857
I was going home from work,

690
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,486
and Jae-jeong called me.

691
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,821
I think I found the link that connects

692
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,032
the victim, Choi Yeong-seop,
and the killer together.

693
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:19,910
I get jokbal and go to Jae-jeong's
apartment,

694
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,537
and I see

695
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,373
smoke coming from the door.

696
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:30,337
I break the door and go in,

697
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,588
then I see him.

698
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:36,343
Now, stop here. Do you see his face?

699
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:38,804
No.

700
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,223
I don't.

701
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:44,059
You don't have to try too hard.

702
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,561
Calm down and just tell us
what's around you,

703
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,355
it doesn't have to be the killer's face.

704
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,362
I see

705
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,781
the burn scar on his arm.

706
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:02,577
Now, the face of the man you're holding
grows clearer.

707
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,080
Can you see his face?

708
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,673
Gu Tae-su…

709
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:15,966
It's Gu Tae-su.

710
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,887
He's running away. I have to catch him.

711
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,348
Jae-jeong…

712
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:29,604
Jae-jeong.

713
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,482
Jae-jeong's on fire.

714
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,945
Jae-jeong!

715
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:39,948
Jae-jeong!

716
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,616
I need the fire extinguisher.

717
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,703
I have to put the fire out.

718
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,456
Jae-jeong.

719
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,167
Jae-jeong, don't die.

720
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:55,255
Jae-jeong. Don't die. I'm sorry.

721
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:59,175
It's my fault,
it's my fault that Jae-jeong…

722
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,054
It's my fault…

723
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,598
Right. Okay.

724
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:09,394
Mr. Nam. Three years have passed,
and you're back to the present.

725
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:14,232
How are you feeling?
Do you still feel tortured?

726
00:53:17,569 --> 00:53:18,862
No.

727
00:53:19,946 --> 00:53:24,326
I'm laughing and talking to Hye-jun,
Su-cheol, and Na-dan

728
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,786
at Minamdang.

729
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:30,832
But I feel these sudden bursts of fear.

730
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,752
What are you afraid of?

731
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:35,086
That…

732
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,089
That I'll fail to protect them again.

733
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,303
I might endanger the people I love again.

734
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,097
I feel so scared about that.

735
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:58,568
When I count down from three again,
you will awake from your trance.

736
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:01,905
Three, two, one.

737
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,527
It's not your fault.

738
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:42,946
Don't torment yourself.

739
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:48,243
It must have been

740
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,955
so hard on your own this whole time.

741
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,127
You said you'd never fall
for something like hypnosis.

742
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,422
I'm more

743
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,717
sensitive than I look.

744
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,098
It must have been so hard
on your own this whole time.

745
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:54,434
What the hell?

746
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:11,242
Jeez, what's with my heart?

747
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:13,661
Mr. Nam, are you feeling unwell?

748
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,371
No, I'm fine.

749
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:17,832
It's just some side effects. Don't worry.

750
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:39,771
What's this?

751
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:42,190
You said you'd take me home.
Why am I here?

752
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:45,110
What on earth goes on in your head?

753
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:49,197
After all those times you hit on me?

754
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:54,327
I'm going to get something to drink.
Get some fresh air.

755
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,205
I want coffee.

756
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,417
Why's she so quiet? It's not like her.

757
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,470
The river's so freaking calm.

758
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:16,224
Here.

759
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:17,725
I said I wanted coffee.

760
00:57:18,434 --> 00:57:20,186
Scooch over.

761
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,314
Scooch over so I can sit too.

762
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,316
Come on, why can't you just sit here?

763
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:29,904
Give me your hand.

764
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,951
Not this one. That one.

765
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,663
Gosh, you're annoying me
in so many ways today.

766
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,334
That must have hurt a lot.

767
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,044
What? When did I get hurt?

768
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:46,963
That hurts.

769
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:48,798
Let me take a look.

770
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:02,812
It must have been

771
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,398
so hard on your own this whole time.

772
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,080
There.

773
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:28,171
This is a side effect of hypnosis.
This is why I'm feeling this way.

774
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,299
Mr. Nam. Is it that bad? Let me see.

775
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:34,677
No. It's a side effect
of the hypnosis. That's what it is.

776
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,554
I'm feeling a little more sensitive.

777
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:38,723
It's nothing you need to worry about.

778
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:44,771
Yes, Mr. Jang.

779
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:47,273
What?

780
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:56,866
Gu Tae-su!

781
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:29,857
EPILOGUE

782
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:51,522
Mr. Nam. Trust me,
so we catch the killer together.

783
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:54,609
How can I, when you let
your sense of justice get in the way

784
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:56,194
of catching that demon spawn?

785
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:59,197
I've pulled some strings with the police,
so don't worry about them.

786
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,324
It's obvious that one of them
outranks the other.

787
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:04,118
-What's our next move?
-We take the bull by the horns.

788
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:06,204
-Bending and breaking the rules…
-Is he in?

789
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:08,122
Leave the exciting stuff to me…

790
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,874
I've never seen you
smile like that before.

791
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:12,502
-Don't go, Ms. Han.
-I don't want him to fight alone anymore.

792
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:16,172
…and just keep being
a good cop as you always have.

793
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:21,260
