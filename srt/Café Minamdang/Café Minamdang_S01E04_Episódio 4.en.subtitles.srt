EPISODE 4

2
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,310
Jeez, those idiots.

3
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,979
Why are they so late?

4
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,640
Damn it.

5
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:42,519
Why aren't those idiots coming? Damn it.

6
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,702
A woman who's bleeding from her head

7
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,705
is following you around and cursing you.

8
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:23,476
The ghost…

9
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,103
The ghost…

10
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,859
Sir, he's come out.

11
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,026
Sir.

12
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,487
Jeez, why isn't this working?

13
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:41,536
Darn it.

14
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,292
Sir.

15
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,169
You shouldn't drink and drive.

16
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,589
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:54,757
I didn't mean to kill you.

18
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,301
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,970
So stop following me around!

20
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,353
I said

21
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,814
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,575
Is he dead?

23
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:24,537
-It wasn't nearly enough to kill him.
-Has the warrant been issued?

24
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,415
Is that the police?

25
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,583
I don't know.

26
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,253
Calm down.

27
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,590
Shin Gyeong-ho and Nam Han-jun
aren't going to disappear.

28
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:38,718
The warrant will be issued soon,
so let's just wait a little longer.

29
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,802
Okay?

30
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:42,222
Okay.

31
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,935
Hey, call Su-cheol.

32
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,145
-I'll call Han-jun.
-Oh, okay.

33
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,528
Is he picking up?

34
00:03:57,612 --> 00:04:00,823
Shoot. Su-cheol isn't picking up.
What do we do?

35
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,701
Jeez, why's the police here so soon?

36
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,540
You go and tell them.

37
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:11,918
Get there faster than the police
no matter what.

38
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,086
Can you do it?

39
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,671
I can.

40
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,632
Good boy. Run.

41
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,068
What was that?

42
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,538
Hey. Go check what that was.

43
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:51,708
-Yes, sir.
-Hey. You can't leave me here!

44
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,503
You can't just leave me here!

45
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,692
What is that?

46
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,152
Don't come any closer.

47
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,322
Don't! Damn it!

48
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,332
Sir. I think something is going on here.

49
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,835
What's going on?

50
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,130
Hello? Can't you hear me? What's going on?

51
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:58,149
Strategy, my foot.

52
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,985
This would go quicker
if I beat them up with a gong instead.

53
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,278
Jeez, I'm tired.

54
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:06,908
Behind you!

55
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,826
There! Behind you!

56
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,002
Did you see that?

57
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,713
Did you see
how I took care of that guy like this?

58
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,465
What the heck was that?

59
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,175
Just let me do the fighting.

60
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,552
This takes more out of me
and is annoying to boot.

61
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,846
You have no idea of what's in fashion.

62
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,765
Jeez.

63
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,611
I can do it.

64
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,492
No, please.

65
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,035
Yes, you can do it.

66
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,664
Good. That's it!

67
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,250
Good. I can survive this.
I can save my life.

68
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,591
I crawled out.

69
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,763
Jeez, those bastards.
Where the hell are those idiots? Damn it.

70
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,185
What's that?

71
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,898
What's that sound?

72
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,954
What is this?

73
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,956
What is happening?

74
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,467
Nam Han-jun?

75
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,969
Kong Su-cheol?

76
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,275
THREE YEARS AGO

77
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,078
Sergeant Gu Jong-man of KCSI.

78
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,665
He's currently being investigated
on suspicion of receiving bribery.

79
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,584
What does that have to do with me?

80
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,879
Right after the case,

81
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:29,133
you wired Sergeant Gu ten million won.

82
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,801
Here you go.

83
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,512
And on your desk, Mr. Nam,

84
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,472
we found the evidence that you hid away

85
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,849
after you paid Sergeant Gu off.

86
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,018
RESIDENT REGISTRATION CARD
CHOI YEONG-SEOP

87
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,145
Come on.

88
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,855
That makes no sense.

89
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,983
I want to catch the culprit more
than anyone else. Why would I…

90
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:49,278
It's because a prosecutor was murdered
because of your profiling.

91
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,156
And you bribed Sergeant Gu
to tamper with the evidence

92
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,700
in case people would find out
about your mistake, no?

93
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,247
You were the first person to arrive

94
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,707
at the scene of
Prosecutor Han's murder, right?

95
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,293
And you are very close
to Lieutenant Kong Su-cheol,

96
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,170
who witnessed the culprit running away.

97
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,421
What are you trying to say?

98
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:10,550
The two of you were in it together,

99
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,843
and laid out a plan to help

100
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,179
Prosecutor Han's murderer run away.

101
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,847
Isn't that so?

102
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,898
How many times do I have to tell you?

103
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,358
I didn't.

104
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,651
It wasn't me.

105
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,820
It wasn't me. I didn't do it!

106
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,909
Damn it.

107
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,748
Just go ahead

108
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:45,501
and say that you need someone
to take the fall and that's me.

109
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,297
Yes, you're right.

110
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,965
You're quick on the uptake.

111
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,011
A prosecutor dies
and the police are at fault.

112
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,139
What a headache would that be?

113
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,266
Much cleaner to just blame it

114
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,018
on one corrupt cop.

115
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,436
Don't you think?

116
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,148
Now, stop besmirching
the good police honor

117
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,358
and admit that you did it.

118
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,282
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

119
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,909
Honor? That means nothing.

120
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,288
Jae-jeong's murderer is still out there.

121
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:27,543
I never took or gave bribes.

122
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,255
So why do I have to go to jail?

123
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,384
What? Justice?

124
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,762
It's dead. Damn it.

125
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,140
This isn't fair.

126
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,434
This isn't fair at all.

127
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,478
I didn't do it.

128
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,273
It wasn't me.

129
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,401
Be quiet!

130
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:01,994
Jeez.

131
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,873
My parents were always so worried

132
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,709
that I'd get beaten up on an assignment.

133
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,419
It's just as well this happened.

134
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,508
Hey, I'm a treasured only son.

135
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,967
Come on.

136
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:20,471
And this. Give it to your son.

137
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:26,268
And you. Be better to your wife.

138
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:31,232
Anyway, take it easy, okay?

139
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,652
Please take it easy.

140
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,029
I'll be off then.

141
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,968
So this was one of your plots.

142
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,723
These clownish antics aren't really
to my taste, but what was I to do?

143
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,185
You couldn't be blackmailed or persuaded,
so what else could we do?

144
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,604
We had to put your life
in danger to find out.

145
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,730
Right?

146
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,566
You psychos.

147
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,444
I already told you. I don't know anything.

148
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:19,405
You don't know anything?

149
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,535
Oh, please.

150
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,454
You're saying you don't know anything?

151
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,582
This is too big for you
to have done alone.

152
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,710
So come on and confess
who your bosses are.

153
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,670
Who told you to frame us?

154
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:36,172
-Say it, right now!
-Who was it?

155
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,675
Oh, please.

156
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:43,220
What difference does it make
if I tell you?

157
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,681
Don't tell me you want to be reinstated

158
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,517
and clear your names, that sort of thing?

159
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,689
Hey, the case is already closed.
What are you going to do about it now?

160
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,149
Who says it's closed?

161
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,067
I'd love to push you back in right now.

162
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,527
It's not closed for me.

163
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,029
So make your choice.

164
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,199
Tell us about your boss
and live to see another day,

165
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,910
or get caught by Shin Gyeong-ho again
and be buried alive.

166
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,537
What is your choice?

167
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,206
-Tell us!
-Don't touch me.

168
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,209
-What do you choose?
-Wait, wait. Give me a moment.

169
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:14,960
Wait, what was that?

170
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,880
-Hey, what's that sound?
-Wait. What is it?

171
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,007
-Hey, what's going on?
-What is it?

172
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,427
-What is it?
-Ghost! It's a ghost!

173
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,806
-It's not a ghost.
-You scared me.

174
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,142
-Sir.
-What?

175
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,645
The police are here.

176
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,563
Wow. Already?

177
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:57,545
We pray to you.

178
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:04,176
Nam Han-jun!

179
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,845
What are you doing there?

180
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,518
You can stop now.

181
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:13,477
Be quiet.

182
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,232
Who dares disturb me in my prayers
and invite misfortune?

183
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,317
We know everything.

184
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:22,111
There's no way you're getting out of this.

185
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,197
Where is Shin Gyeong-ho?

186
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,285
Shin Gyeong-ho?

187
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,161
We came here to do an exorcism.

188
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,130
-Can you hear them?
-Oh, no.

189
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:42,840
Can you hear the evil spirits cry?

190
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,341
Something terrible will happen

191
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,760
-if we do not assuage their anger.
-Yes.

192
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,722
Are they performing an exorcism?

193
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:50,890
Unless I heard wrong,

194
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,434
Lieutenant Nam Han-jun's
now a shaman, right?

195
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:55,185
I have my suspicions,

196
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,687
but that's what he says.

197
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,608
Prosecutor Han, you still don't know

198
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,028
what's going on
even when it's right in front of you.

199
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,698
Nam Han-jun, the profiler,
is now a shaman…

200
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,700
I'd never have seen that coming.

201
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,203
That's what keeps life interesting.

202
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,875
We have to do the exorcism,
so go away now.

203
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,422
Cry no more, vengeful ghosts.

204
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,798
-I pray to you.
-My gosh.

205
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:30,095
I pray to you, please lead
those poor lost ghosts to rest.

206
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,305
Yes, please lead them.

207
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,849
There are no such things as evil spirits!

208
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,477
You can't come here. It's dangerous.

209
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,187
You might get possessed.

210
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,355
You need to go.

211
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:41,523
Possessed, my foot.

212
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,150
Get out of my way!

213
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,906
The evil spirits are here.

214
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,908
We saw them.

215
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,124
-We pray to you.
-Oh, please!

216
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,427
It's the ghost!

217
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,390
-Stop right there, Shin Gyeong-ho!
-Oh, no!

218
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,100
I have to run away!

219
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,728
A ghost! I have to run!

220
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,397
Jeez, that idiot.

221
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:26,110
Hey! We have to get him!

222
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,277
He's coming!

223
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:29,530
Hey, stop!

224
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,283
What? Mommy?

225
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,868
Mommy?

226
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,870
What's he doing? He's scaring me.

227
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,791
-Jeez, look at his eyes. Hey, be careful.
-Right. Don't worry.

228
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,835
-Hey!
-Gosh.

229
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,045
Jeez, that idiot!

230
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,922
Jeez, I told you to stop running!

231
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,718
-Goodness.
-Gosh, it hurts.

232
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,928
Yes!

233
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,515
-Shin Gyeong-ho!
-You caught him!

234
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,600
-You got him, you did!
-I got him!

235
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,062
-Don't let him go.
-Nice job.

236
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,700
The situation seems pretty urgent
over there. Aren't you going to go down?

237
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:17,745
We need to get Shin Gyeong-ho.

238
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,373
You will receive a summons soon.

239
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,667
When you do, come to the police station.

240
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:27,588
I'll talk him into going. Go on.

241
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:34,470
I'll be seeing you again, Mr. Nam.

242
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,056
Let's go.

243
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:48,984
"See you again?" He's a real dogged one.

244
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,277
Stop right there!

245
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:57,493
Go turn yourself in before the spirits
decide to take revenge on you.

246
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,870
-Oh, no.
-It's the only way you'll live.

247
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,957
Oh, spirits.
What am I to do with these fools?

248
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,418
I pray to you.

249
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,922
Oh, the evil spirits are coming!

250
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:14,468
All right. I'll confess, I will.

251
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,720
What is to be done with these fools?

252
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,977
-Jeez, I'm tired.
-Gosh, it's finally over.

253
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,730
-Oh, I'm so tired.
-Gosh, my back.

254
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,734
This is pretty hard.

255
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,611
Stop swinging that around.
My ears are ringing.

256
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,115
-Hey, nice work.
-I did good, didn't I?

257
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:37,699
Yes. You did a great job.

258
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,536
We did it!

259
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,248
We did it!

260
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,009
Look where you're going, you idiot.

261
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,219
Jeez.

262
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,929
Hey, wait a minute.

263
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:00,931
What's this?

264
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,725
What is this?

265
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,644
What is it?

266
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,146
I don't know…

267
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,066
DNA TEST RESULTS

268
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,197
ANALYSIS REPORT

269
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:20,909
I knew it. The MK Noble murder.

270
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,288
It was Shin Gyeong-ho.

271
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,247
Jeez.

272
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,251
Jung Cheong-gi must have

273
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,712
hidden it away for him.

274
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,839
We'd better put Chief Jung
on the wanted list.

275
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,883
-Yes.
-Here.

276
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:37,926
-Let's take him away.
-Yes, sir.

277
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,187
Unless you want to join them,

278
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,856
you better tell us
who your boss is right now.

279
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,403
I arranged somewhere safe for you
to go to already,

280
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:57,988
so don't worry and just tell us.

281
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:02,284
Let us meet the guy and you can take
a ship there right away.

282
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,327
Yes.

283
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:11,043
That's it. Come on.

284
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,925
Superintendent Lim.
It's me, Jung Cheong-gi.

285
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,303
I need to talk to you right now
about that thing

286
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,388
you told me to do three years ago.

287
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:25,849
Yes.

288
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,562
Yes, sir. Okay.
I'll come over to your house right now.

289
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:31,605
Yes, sir!

290
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,819
Wait. Superintendent Lim?

291
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,613
You mean Superintendent Lim Min-jun?

292
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:43,116
The one who did so many corrupt deeds
and defected to Choekang Construction?

293
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:47,871
He's the one who told me
to tamper with the evidence.

294
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,593
No! Honey!

295
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,473
Oh, no. Honey.

296
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,685
Ma'am. What's going on?

297
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,938
My husband suddenly went into shock.

298
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:15,399
Honey!

299
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,693
Honey! Oh, no.

300
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,486
What's with this?

301
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:21,363
The timing couldn't be worse.

302
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,115
Follow them and check his condition.

303
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,783
Okay. What about you?

304
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,245
I'm going to check
if this was really a coincidence.

305
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,372
Okay.

306
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:05,240
Did anyone visit during then?

307
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,826
I heard he was expecting a guest,

308
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,954
but I don't know who they were.

309
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,205
HIBISCUS, MARIGOLD, DANDELION, PEPPERMINT

310
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,582
I see.

311
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,088
CAFFEINE, RHINITIS, SKIN

312
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,381
CAFFEINE ALLERGY

313
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,637
DATE UNSPECIFIED

314
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,390
NO CAFFEINE

315
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,062
CONTAINS CAFFEINE

316
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:43,612
NO SIGNS OF SOMEONE DRINKING

317
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:54,998
Did you find out?

318
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,083
Yes.

319
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:57,918
Well…

320
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,127
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

321
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,504
He died on his way here.

322
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,716
Check if there are needle marks
on his body.

323
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,759
What?

324
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,427
Needle marks?

325
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,764
Someone made it look
as if he had died from shock.

326
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,933
Okay.

327
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:17,771
Excuse me.

328
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,775
Wait. What do you mean

329
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,361
he was murdered and didn't die from shock?

330
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,697
Lim Min-jun was usually scrupulous
about his caffeine allergy.

331
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:30,575
He wouldn't suddenly drink tea
with high caffeine content.

332
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,163
He kept track of when each tea was open
except for the one he had just drank.

333
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,332
And he never drank from the teacup.

334
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,585
Someone murdered him and made it look like

335
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,963
he died from shock
after overdosing on caffeine.

336
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:47,551
Yes, Su-cheol.

337
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:51,054
Hey. There's a needle mark behind his ear.

338
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:52,639
I knew it.

339
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,767
Hint to the cops that it's a murder
and come back here.

340
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,026
If you want to live, you'd better…

341
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:09,990
What?

342
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,159
Live?

343
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,788
I want to live.

344
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,293
INTERROGATION ROOM

345
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,378
At 11 p.m. on January 10th,

346
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,630
you hit Mr. Woo In-cheol, the victim,

347
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,632
then dumped his body elsewhere.

348
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,759
Do you admit to the charges?

349
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,220
Do you?

350
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,222
I won't say a thing
until my secretary comes.

351
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:37,142
Your secretary is here too!

352
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,226
He is?

353
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,317
The last drop. I added the last drop…

354
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,905
I should have listened to the shaman…

355
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:53,950
Mr. Shaman…

356
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,665
I don't let most people

357
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,252
use this cup.

358
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,214
Ms. Min, you've been of great help

359
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,716
in arresting Shin Gyeong-ho.

360
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,552
We'll sort your situation out,

361
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,763
considering these mitigating factors.

362
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:18,558
Thank you for telling us what happened.

363
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:23,772
But how did you know Shin Gyeong-ho
would be hiding in his villa?

364
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:26,024
Well, Mr. Shaman told me…

365
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,197
You know, he told us about it

366
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,991
when he came to the station that time.

367
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,244
That's how I knew to go there too.

368
00:25:40,997 --> 00:25:42,666
Oh, right!

369
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,834
Right. So that's how you knew.

370
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,170
I'm such an idiot.
I can't believe I forgot.

371
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,881
He's really good.

372
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,007
-Isn't he?
-Yes.

373
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,134
I didn't believe him at first either,

374
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,137
but he knew everything.

375
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,722
He's such a great shaman.

376
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:58,765
I know, he is.

377
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,811
And he's so handsome. He's just my type.

378
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,938
Is he? I see.

379
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:09,401
He told me to wait until he called me
to come up as a witness.

380
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,445
He said that was
the only way I would live.

381
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,824
So you gave them
the testimony and the report

382
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,451
because Nam Han-jun told you to?

383
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,577
Yes!

384
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,999
Jeez, you startled me. What is it?

385
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,167
We found Jung Cheong-gi.

386
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,381
Help!

387
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:39,347
You said you had a ship
that would take me to safety!

388
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:42,434
Are you kidding me?

389
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,027
You look so snug.

390
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,488
Hey, wait.

391
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:58,116
What are you doing?

392
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,784
Come on.

393
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,120
Hey.

394
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:05,415
You said you'd make sure I'd be fine
if I let you meet my boss.

395
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,292
Speaking from personal experience,

396
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,044
prison's the safest place
for you right now.

397
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,920
You can't do anything fun in the clink,

398
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,672
so enjoy yourself now.

399
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:16,885
Have fun! You won't be having any soon!

400
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,096
Welcome to the land
of dreams and fantasies!

401
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,306
If you aren't ready,

402
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,308
-raise your arms above your head
-No.

403
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:25,101
and make an X with them.

404
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,020
You can't because your arms are tied?

405
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,314
All right, then we'll start the ride!

406
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:31,900
You made a great choice!

407
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,152
Very nicely done!

408
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,196
-Nice!
-Nice!

409
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,490
No, please!

410
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,617
-Oh no. Please!
-Let's go.

411
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,035
I hate this.

412
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,621
Viking, Viking, Super Viking!

413
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:45,914
King, king

414
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,792
King, king, Viking, Super Viking!

415
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,378
Please untie me!

416
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,588
Hey, you're leaving me like this?

417
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:54,964
Hey, I…

418
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,175
Oh, please. My goodness…

419
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,551
-King, king
-Gosh.

420
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,930
-King, king, Viking, Super Viking!
-No!

421
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:03,932
King, king

422
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,434
-King, Viking!
-Help! Help!

423
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,813
-Let's go!
-Let's go.

424
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:13,983
Please stop the ride.
Stop it. I'm begging you.

425
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:18,571
I'm dying here!

426
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,493
Why aren't you doing anything?

427
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,873
DON'T STOP THE RIDE AND CALL THE POLICE

428
00:28:33,586 --> 00:28:34,629
STOP

429
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,723
Thank you.

430
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,225
Thank you so much.

431
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,876
They got rid of Lim Min-jun

432
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,130
as soon as we went for him,

433
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,341
so that means Gopuri must have
been close to Lim Min-jun.

434
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,433
Yes. You're right.

435
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,186
I mean, the CCTV footage's been deleted,

436
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,272
but they're saying he died from shock,
which is suspicious.

437
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:37,025
And it's weird they're cremating him
right away without an autopsy.

438
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:43,072
I knew Gopuri wouldn't be here,

439
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:46,951
but there's not
a single suspicious person here.

440
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,750
Hey. How many bowls
of beef soup did you eat?

441
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:54,667
Five.

442
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,503
-Did you pay the condolence money?
-Yes.

443
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,547
You went to the bathroom,
so I assumed you wouldn't and I--

444
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,841
-What the…
-Gosh, hey!

445
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:04,844
What's going on?
Is the president coming or something?

446
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:19,442
HEIR TO CHOEKANG GROUP
CHA SEUNG-WON

447
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,826
What is going on?

448
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,453
Jeez. What was that?

449
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,580
Did you just see that?

450
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,542
He had this intense glare, did you see it?

451
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,503
Wow. Is he someone scary?

452
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,634
It's the beef soup.

453
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,846
I told you to have a bowl.

454
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,723
Hey, what you're smelling is

455
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,309
Egyptian acacia, myrrh, and frankincense.

456
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:57,146
It's the finest Baccarat perfume,
and all you can think of is beef soup?

457
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,399
-Seriously, beef soup?
-Isn't it the smell of beef soup?

458
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:03,236
-Amazing.
-Then is it a perfume?

459
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,072
Hey, wait for me.

460
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,619
Find out who hired director Lim Min-jun

461
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,663
at Choekang Constructions.

462
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,333
Why? Are you getting a vision?

463
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,003
His spirit is wandering around

464
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,589
because he has a message to give.

465
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,675
Okay, I'll get on that.

466
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,802
By the way,
why did you ask me to come here?

467
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,556
Well… Mr. Shaman,

468
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,851
I wanted to show you my new office,

469
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:39,439
which I couldn't have gotten without you.

470
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,107
Don't be silly.

471
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,944
If you're going to run it
like your husband, hire a qualified CEO.

472
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,696
I would never.

473
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:50,491
No. I'm confident that I can do
so much better.

474
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,579
As long as you're by my side.

475
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,165
You can always find me at Minamdang.

476
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:04,172
Sir. Here's your fee, as agreed upon.

477
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,342
-Check the amount.
-Oh, there's no need for that.

478
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:08,468
Sir.

479
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,680
Take a look right now.

480
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,308
What's with this fuss?

481
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,026
What's this?

482
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,322
It's a prenuptial agreement.

483
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,535
Nam Han-jun.

484
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,456
This is a marriage proposal.

485
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,041
You're not divorced yet.

486
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,043
You know I'll be getting one soon.

487
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,212
And it'll go smoothly, thanks to you.

488
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,511
Wait.

489
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,228
Ever since I was born,

490
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:04,482
I spent my whole life
fighting to protect what's mine.

491
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,235
But looking back,

492
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,364
I realized that none of it was my choice.

493
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:16,035
You gave me the gift of freedom.

494
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:20,248
So live your life free from now on.

495
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:23,209
Mr. Shaman. Didn't you say
you wanted to become a conglomerate?

496
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,044
I can make that dream come true.

497
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,129
No thanks.

498
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:29,048
You can't have me just because
you want me, I'm not that easy.

499
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,050
I knew you wouldn't say yes right away.

500
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,052
I was just declaring my intentions today.

501
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,470
You better be ready.

502
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:39,017
I'm going to do my very best
to steal your heart.

503
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,268
Okay?

504
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,567
Stop wasting your energy

505
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,819
and focus on the company instead.

506
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:56,117
Stay away from Minamdang
until your husband's case is done.

507
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,201
What?

508
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,329
Better yet, live a happy and untroubled
life and stay away forever!

509
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,540
Mr. Shaman!

510
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,715
NAME: WOO * CHEOL
SEX: MALE, AGE: 35

511
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,683
-Hey.
-You can hold it in, come on.

512
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,202
Excuse me.

513
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,329
Can we talk?

514
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,081
Nam Han-jun?

515
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,290
Let's go.

516
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,258
Here.

517
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,638
This is compensation money for Mr. Woo.

518
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,017
It'll cover the surgery
and the hospital bill.

519
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,311
It includes the kids' school fees
until they go to university.

520
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,856
Why would you give us all this money?

521
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,111
Did the man

522
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,947
who did this to my husband send you?

523
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,949
So we'll agree to a settlement?

524
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,243
No. It's the opposite.

525
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,579
Your husband's assailant will contact you.
Don't agree to a settlement.

526
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,873
Get him to recompense you for everything,

527
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,750
and bring him to justice.

528
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:31,170
This is just to help you
prepare for that day.

529
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,132
And if anything happens in the meantime,

530
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,051
you can call this number.

531
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,137
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

532
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,138
Café Minamdang?

533
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,102
It is as the spirit

534
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,062
wills it.

535
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,152
We'll be off then. Let's go.

536
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:58,030
Don't worry and be strong. Okay?

537
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,619
Thank you so much.

538
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,674
Why am I getting a sudden chill?

539
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:19,719
-What are you talking about? It's hot.
-Then take your jacket off.

540
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,930
-But that will make me cold.
-What on earth is he doing?

541
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,350
That hurts.

542
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:32,148
What made you give her all that money?
It's not like you.

543
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:34,859
The money would have brought misfortune.

544
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,611
Wait.

545
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:40,031
Didn't you once say you should
hate the sinner but not their money?

546
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,493
Why do you keep going back and forth?
You're being very inconsistent.

547
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,622
You wish you kept the money, don't you?

548
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,832
Yes.

549
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,211
-You can make your own way back.
-Really?

550
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:54,921
Are you sulking over what I said?

551
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,672
I have somewhere to go.

552
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,050
Where? Take me with you.

553
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:01,427
I want to go by myself.

554
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:05,014
You mean there?
Oh, you should've said that.

555
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,098
I'll drive you for you.

556
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,768
-No, I'm going on my own.
-What?

557
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,394
Hey.

558
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,979
You know I didn't--

559
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,397
Get lost!

560
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:15,775
Hey!

561
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,902
Wait, come on.

562
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:21,739
Hey! I forgot my wallet,
let me have just 10,000 won!

563
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:25,368
You son of a bitch!

564
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,640
LATE HAN JAE-JEONG

565
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,940
Stop smiling. You're annoying me.

566
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,859
Why are you smiling
when I didn't even catch your killer?

567
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:03,281
I was finally going
to find out who gave the orders,

568
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,450
but he died right in front of me.
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

569
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,079
I come empty-handed again.

570
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,294
I'm going to catch the bastard
who did this to you.

571
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,795
I'm sorry it's taking so long.

572
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,255
Wait just a little longer.

573
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:22,925
I swear I'll catch him and make him
kneel before you.

574
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,610
Your sister kept coming to see me,

575
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,821
but I refused to see her.

576
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,039
The three of us

577
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:57,543
are going to put everything behind us
and start over in the United States.

578
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,754
So

579
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:02,631
if Jang-mi comes, don't talk to her.

580
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:08,679
This is the last favor I'm asking you
as Jae-jeong's mother.

581
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,932
Okay.

582
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,769
I'll do that.

583
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,278
I'm going to catch your killer,

584
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,114
so tell Jang-mi to forget about everything

585
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,825
and have fun with her life.

586
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:32,703
The next time I'm here,
I'll have caught the killer,

587
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:34,747
so you just have faith in me and wait.

588
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,125
You punk.

589
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,421
Gopuri…

590
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,549
I swear I'm going to catch you

591
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,176
no matter what.

592
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,358
It's hot.

593
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,486
So you haven't found proof

594
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,155
that the ghost those people saw
was Lieutenant Nam?

595
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:09,740
No.

596
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:13,411
Everyone says they never saw his face
because he was wearing a mask.

597
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,831
One of them threw a fit and said
it was a ghost and not a guy in a mask.

598
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,165
Wait.

599
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,960
Then maybe
it really wasn't Lieutenant Nam.

600
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,878
It's Nam Han-jun, I'm sure of it!

601
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,048
Okay.

602
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:31,762
Then why don't you get him
to talk to you, face-to-face?

603
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,222
That's your specialty.

604
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:36,308
Listening to people and sympathizing
with them and persuading them.

605
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,104
I can't seem to do it with him.

606
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:43,816
He acts like he's the king of the world
with this arrogant look on his face.

607
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,192
I can't talk to him.

608
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,319
Things keep going wrong
whenever I run into him.

609
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,827
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

610
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,872
He got Shin Gyeong-ho
released then arrested.

611
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,707
It's like he's toying with me.

612
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,000
Are you kidding me?

613
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:04,128
What on earth is he planning?

614
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,187
I got you, you stalker.

615
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:53,093
Why would you sneak up on me like that?
You startled me.

616
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:55,679
When you're arresting a culprit,
do you say out loud

617
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:59,099
that you're coming to catch them?

618
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,809
Who are you calling a culprit?

619
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,439
Are you still going to deny it?

620
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,899
Ms. Kangaroo Mom?

621
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,152
Why do you have that?

622
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,989
Okay, I get that you like me.

623
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:18,244
But you should have just told me so
and gotten rejected fair and square.

624
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:21,830
You can't sneak around and startle
people like this. You're a police officer.

625
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,834
You must know
what a serious crime stalking is!

626
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:27,753
I do.

627
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,965
Stalking is a serious crime,
because it could even lead to murder.

628
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,132
So why would you do this?

629
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,134
Let me ask you something
before that happens.

630
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,928
No thanks.

631
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:38,681
It's true I don't have a girlfriend,
but you're not my type.

632
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:41,267
That wasn't what I was going to ask you!

633
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:44,103
You got Shin Gyeong-ho released,
then give us a tip-off

634
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,771
and took down a corrupt cop.

635
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:49,567
What I want to know is why you're
acting like some sort of superhero.

636
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,486
I don't know what sort of ideas
you have about me,

637
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,322
but my client is Lee Min-gyeong.

638
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,617
Not Shin Gyeong-ho. Lee Min-gyeong.

639
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,120
The one who got rid of Shin Gyeong-ho

640
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:03,163
and became the vice chairwoman.

641
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,667
So the whole thing

642
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:11,755
was to make Lee Min-gyeong
the vice chairwoman?

643
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,635
I don't know what you think I did,

644
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,014
but don't go around talking about it,
would you?

645
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:23,934
Confidentiality is everything
with my VVIP conglomerate clients.

646
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,272
I thought everything would become clear

647
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,232
once I saw you again.

648
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:34,653
-But I'm even more confused.
-What are you talking about?

649
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:39,950
You caught Shin Gyeong-ho anyway,
so just say thank you.

650
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:42,578
Don't overanalyze things
and give yourself a headache.

651
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:44,580
You made the evidence inadmissible too!

652
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:50,586
Yes, I did.

653
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:52,171
I apologize. I'm sorry.

654
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,799
That I do feel bad about.

655
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,259
You feel bad?

656
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,387
Is that why you paid
the victim's hospital bill?

657
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:06,894
Gosh, you really are stalking me.
How do you know that?

658
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,356
Don't obsess over me.

659
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,316
Don't fall for me. I'm warning you.

660
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,903
Stop making me do that then!

661
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,739
What? She really likes you?

662
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,115
What? Gosh!

663
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,701
Okay, wait.

664
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,745
Jeez, I'm so tired.

665
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,206
Oh, I'm sorry.

666
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,875
-We were just passing by.
-You two are cute together.

667
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:33,754
Hey, it really isn't like that!

668
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,383
Darn it. It really isn't!

669
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,593
Are you annoyed?

670
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,554
You shouldn't have stalked me then.

671
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,936
Just think it's all as the spirit
willed it and forget about it.

672
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:54,483
Next time, I'm really going to call
the police, so quit stalking me too. Okay?

673
00:44:55,567 --> 00:45:00,531
I really hope
we never see each other again.

674
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:10,916
I can't believe this. How did I end up
in this mortifying situation?

675
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,923
This is so annoying!

676
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:23,345
Instead of getting my revenge,

677
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,640
everyone now thinks I love him!

678
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:30,144
Jeez, this is so annoying!

679
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,983
Your husband's assailant will contact you.
Don't agree to a settlement.

680
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,277
Get him to recompense you for everything,

681
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,112
and bring him to justice.

682
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:43,198
This is just to help you
prepare for that day.

683
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:50,164
Maybe he isn't as terrible as I thought.

684
00:45:51,373 --> 00:45:54,918
I don't know. This is so confusing.

685
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:58,505
Right, he's just a nutcase.

686
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,722
I'm definitely not doing this
because I want to believe in Nam Han-jun.

687
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:13,979
Hello?

688
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:16,899
Hi, I was hoping to ask you a favor.

689
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:21,320
Could you show me the files on Lieutenant
Nam Han-jun's internal investigation?

690
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:47,888
Yes, Detective Na.

691
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,973
Ma'am, would you like a cup of coffee?

692
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,058
What??

693
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,229
Oh, yes. Hey, I need to
hang up for now. Bye.

694
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,735
Shoot. I'm giving that briefing
on the case today

695
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:02,778
and I'm late.

696
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,863
I can't believe this.

697
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:07,908
CAFÉ MINAMDANG

698
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:12,246
CLOSED TODAY

699
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,624
I almost had it and I missed it.

700
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:20,045
Jeez, stop sighing already.

701
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,380
Cheer up.

702
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:24,758
It's not that bad. We'll get them.

703
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:28,595
He's right. If you're going to agonize
over it, at least do it on a full stomach.

704
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,847
Here.

705
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:38,188
You were thinking about going shopping
for the new collection, not the killer?

706
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,151
I'm going to torch that catalog one day.

707
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:47,239
Jeez. Eat your food or buy
the new collection. Pick one!

708
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:49,950
I'd love to buy it!

709
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:53,078
But the sales are down after we spent
all that time chasing Gopuri.

710
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,581
VVIP MS. KIM GYEONG-JA

711
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:59,084
It's our day off, but she's a VIP,
so I have to take this.

712
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,210
Jeez.

713
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:08,260
Why are you calling me when I'm praying?

714
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,512
-I shall be angry if this isn't--
-Mr. Shaman.

715
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,685
-What is it?
-I think

716
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:19,521
there's a ghost in my house.

717
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,444
Hey.

718
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,238
-What?
-I'll be buying the new collection.

719
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:29,865
Eat up.

720
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:35,746
I shall stop by when my prayers are done,
wait for me.

721
00:48:37,497 --> 00:48:38,665
Eat up.

722
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:43,170
I think it's here somewhere.

723
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,714
-They all look the same.
-Yes.

724
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,090
-Hey.
-Yes?

725
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:50,510
Is it true that there's a ghost
in Ms. Kim's place?

726
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:54,014
She's been hearing something move around
in the kitchen at night these days

727
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,766
-and thought it was mice,
-Okay.

728
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,351
but then she saw a human figure.

729
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,562
Is it really a ghost? Maybe it's a thief.

730
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,815
I don't know. I think that's it.

731
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:04,941
-Okay.
-Right.

732
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:14,242
She looked at the CCTV footage,
but there wasn't anyone.

733
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,662
The figure appeared out of nowhere
then disappeared.

734
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,121
She's really scared.

735
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,166
-Mr. Shaman!
-Hello.

736
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:24,544
Hello.

737
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,172
Come on in.

738
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:38,016
Hey, get a hold of your glasses, jeez.
I can't see.

739
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:45,816
Now, let's see.

740
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:50,779
Let's see.

741
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,948
Where is the evil spirit?

742
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,034
Let's take a look.

743
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,623
Nothing's going on.

744
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,793
If you've kept me from my date
just to catch some petty thief,

745
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:05,961
you're dead.

746
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,504
You know that, right?

747
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:10,257
Oh, don't be so difficult.

748
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:16,596
Let's see if there's a difficult spirit

749
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,683
haunting the place.

750
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:23,353
Let's see, let's see.

751
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,815
Let's take a look.

752
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:40,704
I came downstairs late at night to get
a glass of water because I was thirsty

753
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:43,832
and I saw this black figure by the fridge.

754
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:48,295
It shot outside
when I entered the kitchen.

755
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:11,193
What's that flap down there?

756
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:15,113
Oh, I used to have a dog

757
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:18,116
and I put that there
so it could play in the backyard.

758
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:20,577
I see.

759
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,370
Is there something wrong?

760
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,082
It's giving off bad energy.

761
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,420
-I shall go and check. You stay here.
-Right, okay.

762
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:49,981
There aren't any CCTVs in the backyard,

763
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,943
but the security is good.

764
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:55,570
It's unlikely someone broke in
from outside.

765
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:28,937
Jeez.

766
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:35,694
Check where this sewer pipe leads to.

767
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:38,738
The sewer pipe in the backyard
is connected to the sewer system.

768
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,740
They must have escaped that way.

769
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:45,287
Su-cheol, you go see if there's
anyone suspicious outside the house.

770
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:49,082
-Okay. Sewer. Footprints.
-And muddy footprints.

771
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:50,000
Gosh.

772
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,503
It's the sewer.

773
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:56,923
I found the footprint.

774
00:53:04,514 --> 00:53:05,599
Jeez.

775
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:12,939
Wow. The weather's great today.

776
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:20,488
What would they look like?

777
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:23,867
They escaped through the sewer pipe,
so they must be thin. And they'd smell.

778
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,035
Okay.

779
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,958
I'm a good person. I'm not a bad person.

780
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,338
I got you. What are you doing here, kid?

781
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,048
I've got you good now.

782
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,550
You're in--

783
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,552
Jeez, you scared me.

784
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:45,472
Hey, put that down. It's dangerous.

785
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:47,599
You'll be in big trouble.
Put that down, kid.

786
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:48,808
What are you looking at?

787
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,811
What? Hey, you little…

788
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:55,607
-Come here.
-Help.

789
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,734
He's trying to kidnap me.

790
00:53:57,817 --> 00:54:00,654
What? Oh, I'm not.

791
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:04,324
No, that's not what this is.

792
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,450
Kong Su-cheol, no.

793
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:08,495
-That's not what this is.
-No, this isn't the time to grin.

794
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,291
Shit. I told you to stop grinning.

795
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:24,803
Shoot.

796
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:27,097
Tell them what really happened.

797
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,640
This man threatened me

798
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,517
with that knife.

799
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,602
What? This is unbelievable.

800
00:54:32,686 --> 00:54:34,980
You know I wouldn't do that.

801
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:37,816
You only have to look at my face
to know that.

802
00:54:37,899 --> 00:54:41,027
The sound of the wind is enough
to startle me from sleep.

803
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,570
-You too?
-What?

804
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,490
Let's go to the station.
I want to ask you something too.

805
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:47,701
-Wait!
-Let him go.

806
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,452
Hey!

807
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,037
Let go of me, will you?

808
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:55,792
We were just looking for a ghost.

809
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:56,793
A ghost?

810
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:59,170
Ghosts, again?

811
00:55:05,885 --> 00:55:10,140
I can see it all. Everything you've done.

812
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,350
What do you think you're doing?

813
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,106
The bad energy inside the house.
It's not a ghost.

814
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:20,984
-It was him.
-What?

815
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:23,028
Goodness.

816
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,281
There's another one of you, isn't there?

817
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:33,872
He is in the sewer pipe
that leads to Ms. Kim's backyard.

818
00:55:34,414 --> 00:55:35,457
You can go and check.

819
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,960
Okay. Let's go check. But untie me first.

820
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,171
No!

821
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:46,676
Do you know how much this outfit cost?

822
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,679
I'm not going to get these clothes
and shoes dirty. I'd rather…

823
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,391
What is it?

824
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,269
Satisfied?

825
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,361
I can't go in. It's too small.

826
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,991
My shoulders are too…

827
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,245
Oh, I've got a bad knee.

828
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:17,332
Once I bend this leg,
I can't straighten it again.

829
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,963
There's bad energy
coming off from there. It's very strong.

830
00:56:24,047 --> 00:56:26,800
It will anger the spirit if I go in there.

831
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:31,012
You'd better go in there with me.
If you don't, I'm going to arrest you.

832
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,515
Arrest me?

833
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,437
Your glasses have
a camera on them, don't they?

834
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,650
I don't care
if you're a real shaman or not.

835
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:47,612
But a fraud who cons people using
hidden cameras? That's a different matter.

836
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,199
Are you going to
go down the sewers with me?

837
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:53,618
Or would you rather go to the station?

838
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,791
What I meant was…

839
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:05,463
There is this bad energy
around the sewers,

840
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,299
and I'd worry if you went down
on your own,

841
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:12,137
so I'll go with you.

842
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,806
That's what I meant.

843
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,281
Jeez.

844
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,076
Jeez, it stinks.

845
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,372
Gosh, it smells horrible.

846
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:47,672
Darn it.

847
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:52,177
All right. There's no need to be scared.

848
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:56,389
I said he's the accomplice,
but it's a kid who doesn't know anything.

849
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,237
Hey, wait for me.

850
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:20,997
What is it?

851
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,758
KCSI

852
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:36,804
Are my brother and I going to jail?

853
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:40,517
Why did you two
go into someone else's house?

854
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,520
It's okay.

855
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:46,731
She wants to help you guys.

856
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,652
We were hungry.

857
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,695
I see.

858
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:54,614
You must be cold.

859
00:58:56,908 --> 00:59:00,328
Your brother's waiting outside,
so let's get out of here now, okay?

860
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:02,622
Let's go.

861
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,585
Oh, are you okay?

862
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,380
Are you all right?

863
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,216
Yes, I'm fine. Don't worry.
It's a bit slippery here.

864
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:55,842
It's Choi Yeong-seop.

865
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,803
Choi Yeong-seop's back.

866
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,805
It's him.

867
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:03,141
It's that bastard, Gopuri. I'm sure of it.

868
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:20,408
EPILOGUE

869
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:31,127
There's a fire in 38-2 Seohyeon-ro,
Yongmyeong. I repeat, there's a fire.

870
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,797
A burnt corpse has been found.
Requesting backup from officers nearby.

871
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:48,519
Burnt corpse found at the crime scene
at Hakbaek-dong.

872
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:49,979
Requesting backup.

873
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,398
Thank you.

874
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:55,193
Yes. Don't worry too much.

875
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:58,696
Just go home and do as I told you,
and everything will be fine.

876
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,031
Hey.

877
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:01,866
They found a burnt corpse.

878
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:17,131
EMERGENCY RESCUE

879
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:52,477
This is the same MO as three years ago.

880
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,645
Could it be Gopuri again?

881
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:57,899
The bloodstain belongs to the victim
we found in the sewers.

882
01:02:57,982 --> 01:03:01,027
I'll be able to learn
why my brother died, right?

883
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,321
-I'm sure you will.
-I'm sensing an ominous aura.

884
01:03:03,404 --> 01:03:05,114
Stop getting in the way and get lost!

885
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,241
You have to stop them!
Stop them at all costs!

886
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:09,368
I will now consider them an accomplice
and investigate them.

887
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:11,621
-He's not the culprit.
-Again, because of you…

888
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:13,623
You're the one
who made me lose the culprit.

889
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:15,792
I don't think he did it alone.

890
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:18,169
So tell me. Who's really behind this?

891
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:23,257
