00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,950
[Love and Strife]

2
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,960
[Episode 20]

3
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,850
Darling.

4
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,400
Are you waiting for me?

5
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,960
You came back

6
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,150
quite late today.

7
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,810
His Majesty had a sudden whim today.

8
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:07,060
He granted a corridor feast.

9
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,550
Why did he suddenly decide to grant a corridor feast?

10
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,900
Of course, it was to inform everyone

11
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,140
that Consort Shu has been reinstated.

12
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:16,900
Consort Shu?

13
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,220
How could this happen in just a few days?

14
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:22,780
That's just how he is.

15
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,190
Everything

16
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,990
must follow his whims and fancies.

17
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,550
Just like back then,

18
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,260
he couldn't stand the growing power of my maternal family,

19
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:30,980
so he framed the Zhao family

20
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,310
and coldly watched my mother suffer.

21
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:36,910
All right.

22
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,130
Let's not talk about this anymore.

23
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,550
Honey,

24
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,580
are you comfortable living in the residence?

25
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,110
Yes.

26
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,420
I was just saying today...

27
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:49,039
Your Highness, what's wrong?

28
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,070
Somebody!

29
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,750
Come quickly!

30
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,470
How is His Highness?

31
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,470
Why did he suddenly cough up blood and faint?

32
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:00,220
Your Highness,

33
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,310
I've examined His Highness's pulse.

34
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,550
It appears he has contracted leprosy.

35
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,420
His Highness's weak,

36
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,590
and these days,

37
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,470
he's run around for the Ministry of Revenue case.

38
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,380
In some villages on the outskirts of the capital,

39
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,220
leprosy has been spreading indeed.

40
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,280
He may have been infected.

41
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,780
Can it be cured?

42
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,660
Leprosy can be cured,

43
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:23,710
but His Highness's symptoms are particularly severe.

44
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,579
I will prescribe a treatment,

45
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,060
but I'm not sure if it will cure him.

46
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,540
You may leave now.

47
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,800
Yes.

48
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:37,900
Go and fetch Uncle Liu.

49
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:49,490
Uncle Liu,

50
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,590
how is it?

51
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,680
The pulse and symptoms indeed indicate leprosy.

52
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,060
But according to what you said,

53
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,150
His Highness coughed up blood before fainting.

54
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,470
This differs from the symptoms of leprosy.

55
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:04,060
Moreover, there are no patches on his body.

56
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:06,750
If it were truly contagious leprosy,

57
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,060
half of the people in the Eastern Palace would fall ill by now,

58
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,990
including you.

59
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,940
It's not leprosy.

60
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,100
Then what can we do with him?

61
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,220
The royal physician's prescription is appropriate for his symptoms.

62
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,250
He can take it for now.

63
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,960
I will deeply investigate this matter.

64
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,940
About this matter,

65
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:26,030
I feel something is amiss.

66
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,790
Okay.

67
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,780
If you need anything,

68
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,660
just tell Xue Ping and Su Zhu.

69
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,720
How could this happen?

70
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,630
Jiang Yunsheng.

71
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,220
I truly can't understand you guys

72
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,589
from the Jiang family.

73
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:23,030
If you want to scheme against me,

74
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,700
♫The dazzling lights look like snow falling on my shoulders♫

75
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,420
it'll be

76
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,300
a piece of cake.

77
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:31,830
Yet you treat me with genuine affection.

78
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:36,280
♫Which line of poetry did it awaken, gazing at each other from afar with you?♫

79
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,540
Jiang Yunsheng.

80
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:44,150
♫In the clouds, shadows flicker. Is it the faint glow of your lips♫

81
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,220
I've fallen for you.

82
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:51,000
♫Or the rusted moon hidden deep within your heart?♫

83
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,120
Is the background of the royal physicians sent above suspicion?

84
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,510
Your Majesty,

85
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,760
the royal physicians are not allies of the Third Prince.

86
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,660
My two sons

87
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,270
do have some ploys.

88
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:11,080
One relies on himself while the other depends on his maternal family.

89
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,670
Keep a close eye on them for me,

90
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,910
but don't interfere.

91
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,340
I want to see

92
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,830
what kind of show they'll put on

93
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,910
right under my nose.

94
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,860
[Fight]

95
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,540
How is His Highness?

96
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,860
Can he be cured?

97
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,659
If you have anything to say, just speak plainly.

98
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,300
His Majesty and Her Ladyship

99
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,420
are extremely concerned about His Highness's illness.

100
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,210
We have done our best.

101
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,510
His Highness...

102
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,560
I can do nothing about it.

103
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,740
If that's the case,

104
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,470
I shall return to the palace to report

105
00:05:58,470 --> 00:06:00,420
to His Majesty and Her Ladyship.

106
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,430
Now no one is stopping you from telling the truth.

107
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,290
Speak quickly if you have something to say.

108
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,480
Your Highness,

109
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,770
I have seen the same symptoms

110
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,000
before.

111
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,660
I don't believe His Highness's symptoms indicate leprosy.

112
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,030
He was poisoned, instead.

113
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,760
The poison is called Bi Luo.

114
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,740
Bi Luo?

115
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,270
When have you seen it before?

116
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,390
It was

117
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,340
before the late Empress passed away.

118
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,980
I wonder when the good news

119
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,710
will finally be delivered.

120
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,990
Even the god is favoring me.

121
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,970
You can't enter!

122
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,780
You can't go in!

123
00:06:51,659 --> 00:06:53,340
You can't go in! You...

124
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,050
Yunxiu,

125
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,590
go see who is so bold

126
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,870
to cause trouble in my palace.

127
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,530
Yes.

128
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,070
Xu Chuyun,

129
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,850
what's the meaning of this?

130
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,860
You barged into the palace with a sword.

131
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,300
Do you have a death wish?

132
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,630
Your Ladyship,

133
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,910
hand over the antidote.

134
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,390
What antidote?

135
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,070
The antidote for Bi Luo.

136
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,659
How dare you!

137
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:35,980
Your Majesty.

138
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,540
Crown Princess,

139
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,630
what are you doing?

140
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,220
Father Emperor, you came at the right time.

141
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:45,300
Please persuade Her Ladyship

142
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,140
into handing over the antidote quickly.

143
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,140
What antidote?

144
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,620
What have you done?

145
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,890
Your Majesty,

146
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,630
I have done nothing.

147
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,070
Your Majesty, you must defend me!

148
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,220
His Highness

149
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,100
didn't contract any epidemic at all.

150
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,100
He was poisoned with Bi Luo.

151
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
In the palace,

152
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:05,260
besides Her Ladyship,

153
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,550
who else would do such a thing?

154
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,910
You're falsely accusing me with your baseless claims.

155
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,710
How would I possibly do such a thing?

156
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,180
The poison took effect

157
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,830
right after His Highness dined in the corridor that day.

158
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,370
Who else could it be but you?

159
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,670
Your Majesty, this is a false accusation!

160
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,030
That day, I did prepare some food

161
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,150
and send it over.

162
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,660
But it wasn't just the Crown Prince who ate it.

163
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,420
You and the court officials

164
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,390
also partook of it.

165
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,110
So how could it be that only the Crown Prince

166
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,270
was poisoned?

167
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:35,460
Crown Princess,

168
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,330
no matter what,

169
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,150
you shouldn't have entered the palace with a sword

170
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,059
and held the Noble Consort hostage.

171
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,870
This is treason.

172
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,160
As long as I can secure

173
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,780
a chance of survival for His Highness,

174
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,040
what does it matter even if I came to the palace with a sword?

175
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,930
Your Majesty, you may not know.

176
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,540
Some time ago,

177
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,180
assassins broke into the Eastern Palace.

178
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,460
If it weren't for

179
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:58,110
my martial arts,

180
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,350
I'm afraid His Highness

181
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,180
would have been long gone.

182
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,750
This matter

183
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,060
was also done by Consort Shu, wasn't it?

184
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,910
No, no, no.

185
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:07,910
It wasn't me.

186
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,480
I've just been released from confinement.

187
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,910
How could it be me?

188
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,870
Your Majesty.

189
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,510
Father Emperor, please take a look at it.

190
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,860
What's the difference

191
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,510
between the pulse diagnosis of the late Empress

192
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:28,780
and the current Crown Prince's pulse diagnosis?

193
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,060
Are you going to just stand by and watch

194
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,630
the only flesh and blood of the late Empress

195
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,030
also die from Bi Luo?

196
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,660
Consort Shu,

197
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,820
do you admit your guilt?

198
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:41,990
Your Majesty,

199
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,560
I haven't done anything.

200
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,700
What guilt should I admit to?

201
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,590
I know nothing

202
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,660
about the Crown Prince's poisoning.

203
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,110
Can the previous poisoning of the late Empress

204
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,230
be blamed on me

205
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,430
as well?

206
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,260
Shut up!

207
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,890
You plotted against the royal heir.

208
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,360
You're stubborn and unrepentant!

209
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,110
Crown Princess,

210
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,510
release Consort Shu first.

211
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,300
I will make sure she

212
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,510
hands over the antidote for Bi Luo.

213
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,460
Considering your concern for the Crown Prince has made you lose your senses,

214
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,490
I won't punish you today

215
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,320
for the crime of barging into the imperial palace with a sword.

216
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,330
You may leave now.

217
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,820
Consort Shu, for plotting against the Crown Prince

218
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:33,630
and attempting to destabilize the state,

219
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,700
will be confined to the Cold Palace.

220
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,350
Crown Princess,

221
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,230
why haven't you left yet?

222
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,780
Thank you, Father Emperor.

223
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:49,940
I

224
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,150
will wait outside the hall

225
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,820
for the antidote.

226
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,630
All of you, leave as well.

227
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,980
Do you understand

228
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,670
what you should say

229
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,520
and what you shouldn't?

230
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,990
This is the antidote

231
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,420
His Majesty asked me to give to you.

232
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,510
Please keep it safe, Your Highness.

233
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:38,630
As for today's incident,

234
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,870
His Majesty hopes you will keep it confidential.

235
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,640
Please inform Father Emperor

236
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,760
that I was rash today.

237
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:49,110
It's good that you understand.

238
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,980
I will certainly report to His Majesty.

239
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:20,630
You poisoned yourself.

240
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,110
Even though Bi Luo took effect slowly,

241
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:22,990
it still harmed you.

242
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,990
Are you throwing your life away by doing this?

243
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,180
It doesn't matter.

244
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,810
As long as that woman

245
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,700
has no chance of making a comeback,

246
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,120
it's worth doing.

247
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,540
But you can't just keep quiet about it alone.

248
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,020
Given such a risky approach,

249
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,350
someone should be there to back you up.

250
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,800
Success comes with secrecy.

251
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,640
The fewer people there are who know,

252
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,920
the easier it is for others to believe.

253
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,920
By the way,

254
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,250
where's Chuyun?

255
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,060
On my way here,

256
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,190
I heard she stormed the palace gate with a sword for you,

257
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,910
holding Consort Shu hostage to demand the antidote.

258
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:58,990
Now the palace

259
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,460
is in complete chaos.

260
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,780
I thought

261
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,020
her earth-shattering actions

262
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,480
were also part of your plan.

263
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:07,460
Who would have thought you didn't even tell her?

264
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,440
Her actions are too rash.

265
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,100
Hurry to the palace on my behalf.

266
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,450
You must protect her at all costs.

267
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:13,870
Yes.

268
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,420
Go quickly.

269
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,460
There's no need to trouble Lord Jiang.
