[Episode 11]

3
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,160
Who is this unknown hero?

4
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,039
Completely covered up

5
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,430
all the gaps in our investigation.

6
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,850
Such a genious!

7
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,610
Don't make a fuss.

8
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,100
Just follow the address

9
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,650
and get everyone under control.

10
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:19,510
Also, find the original ledger

11
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,550
and list for me as well.

12
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:22,760
Yes,

13
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:23,990
I'll send someone to handle it right away.

14
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,740
Your Highness,

15
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,150
do you know who delivered

16
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,110
this brocade box?

17
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,280
I have an idea.

18
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,560
No need to panic.

19
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,690
No.

20
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,590
Allowing someone

21
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,000
to enter the study without anyone knowing

22
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,229
is my negligence.

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,430
I'll go

24
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,440
and arrange for new security measures immediately.

25
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,070
I also have something

26
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,360
I want to give you.

27
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,320
Mr. Qian.

28
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,420
Cheers.

29
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,380
Everyone,

30
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,640
I wish you

31
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,370
all sucess in the imperial

32
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,610
examination.

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,560
Mr. Qian,

34
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,950
you seem

35
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,000
very confident

36
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,780
about this exam, aren't you?

37
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:27,350
I have indeed put in

38
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,750
a lot of effort for this exam.

39
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,360
Regardless of the results,

40
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,490
I must live up to my own efforts.

41
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,960
Mr. Qian, what a noble attitude.

42
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,320
Come on, let's have another drink.

43
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,400
Cheers.

44
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,280
To success!

45
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:39,960
To success!

46
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,710
Hypocrite.

47
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,910
I've sent people to lure those candidates

48
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,280
who reserved the exam questions

49
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,310
to go to the places

50
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,150
we arranged beforehand to buy answer sheets.

51
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,160
Now, 60% of the candidates

52
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,820
have bought the same answers.

53
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,030
60%?

54
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:56,710
Yes.

55
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,250
Not bad.

56
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:04,250
When it comes to grading the papers,

57
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,810
it's going to be quite a spectacle.

58
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,920
With so many identical exam papers appearing,

59
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,470
I wonder how my elder brother, the Crown Prince,

60
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,470
will take responsibility for this.

61
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,150
Right?

62
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,030
Yes.

63
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:57,650
Long live Your Majesty!

64
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,060
All of you,

65
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,380
please rise.

66
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,470
Thank you, Your Majesty.

67
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,710
Your Majesty,

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,240
I have a matter to report.

69
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,310
Go ahead.

70
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,190
I'd like to accuse

71
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,670
Minister Guo Heng

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,800
of abusing his power and cheating in the imperial examination,

73
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,610
selling exam papers and questions,

74
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,070
not only lining his own pockets,

75
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,630
but also undermining talented individuals.

76
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,720
This has made the scholars disappointed,

77
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:37,240
leaving the Great Jing with no talent to employ

78
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,470
and shaking the very foundations of our state.

79
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:44,950
Yunsheng, don't make baseless accusations

80
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,040
and slander good people.

81
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,750
I am not making baseless accusations.

82
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:51,450
The evidence is right here in my possession.

83
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,490
The list of candidates who bought the papers,

84
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:59,159
the names of the officials involved,

85
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,370
and all the transaction records are here.

86
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,820
[Ledger]

87
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,280
Your Majesty!

88
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,490
Your Majesty!

89
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,100
Your Majesty!

90
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,230
I'm innocent!

91
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,980
This must be punished.

92
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:27,010
It's a threat to the state!

93
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,960
How foolish!

94
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,350
What else is there to say?

95
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,070
Sheng,

96
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,750
tomorrow is the general examination.

97
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,190
Are you certain that the exam questions

98
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,190
have been leaked?

99
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,470
I'm certain.

100
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,280
Your Majesty, please

101
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,430
arrest the candidates on this list

102
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,430
for questioning.

103
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,450
As for the exam questions,

104
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,840
as the chief examiner for this examination,

105
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,450
I was responsible for setting the questions.

106
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,970
Therefore, I did not adopt

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,950
Guo Heng's suggestions.

108
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,570
Tomorrow's general examination

109
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,670
can proceed as normal.

110
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,590
How did you come to know this?

111
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,160
Jiang Qi, the Deputy Chief of the Court of Judicial Review,

112
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,620
was ordered to investigate this case.

113
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,280
It's known both inside and outside the court.

114
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,140
A few days ago,

115
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,950
while I was out with the Crown Princess,

116
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,550
I happened to overhear some candidates

117
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,210
discussing the buying and selling of exam questions.

118
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,580
I didn't dare to take it lightly

119
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,590
and immediately reported it to the Court of Judicial Review.

120
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,190
Your Majesty,

121
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,410
what the Crown Prince says is true.

122
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,430
I've been overseeing the investigation

123
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,680
of examination fraud.

124
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,159
As soon as there's any news,

125
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,280
I won't let it go.

126
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,430
Jiang Qi!

127
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,750
You believe whatever

128
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,750
the Crown Prince says.

129
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,409
Are you conspiring together

130
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,150
to frame loyal officials?

131
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,950
Your Highness, what are you saying?

132
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:54,090
I, Jiang Qi, serve with integrity.

133
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,850
I only handle cases in the Court of Judicial Review.

134
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,680
Whether it's government offices

135
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,920
or attendants of the Eastern Palace,

136
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,190
when has anyone ever seen me and the Crown Prince

137
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:02,310
in close association?

138
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,400
The Court of Judicial Review's records are here.

139
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,590
I will report and submit them.

140
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,390
Indeed, someone has been selling

141
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,480
the imperial examination questions.

142
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,240
The general examination is approaching.

143
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,390
We can't let this undermine

144
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,360
the foundation of our dynasty.

145
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,640
Your Majesty, I implore you

146
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,010
to thoroughly investigate this matter

147
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,230
for the sake of our people!

148
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,760
Do it as the Crown Prince suggested.

149
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:40,720
Proceed.

150
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,310
Go!

151
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,630
Hurry!

152
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:55,970
Move quickly!

153
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,720
Go!

154
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,580
Is this reasonable?

155
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,200
This is outrageous!

156
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,630
Why are you arresting me?

157
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,240
I have an exam tomorrow!

158
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,920
You can't do this!

159
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,910
I'm a candidate!

160
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,040
Why panic?

161
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,160
You won't be for long.

162
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,830
Take him to the yamen!

163
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,590
Go!

164
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,310
Move it!

165
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:16,720
Hurry up!

166
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,630
Why are you arresting me?

167
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,720
I didn't expect

168
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,030
the Crown Prince to be so capable.

169
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,610
He handled things so quickly

170
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,790
and arrested them.

171
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,500
Success comes from secrecy.

172
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,370
He's discreet,

173
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,680
patient,

174
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:32,580
and decisive.

175
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,289
Nothing like the "loser"

176
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,830
everyone says he is.

177
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,570
I've underestimated him.

178
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,690
My Lady, what should we do now?

179
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,250
Tell our people

180
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,120
to be more

181
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,000
cautious and vigilant.

182
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,270
Use the skills

183
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:53,200
they used against barbarian scouts.

184
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,650
From now on,

185
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,790
all information

186
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,300
must go through me.

187
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,310
I'll have the final say.

188
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,420
Yes.

189
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:02,630
Why?

190
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,840
It's time already.

191
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,650
What a coincidence.

192
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,290
What's going on here?

193
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,280
Yesterday, I saw Mr. Qian

194
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,490
being arrested.

195
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:12,480
Yeah,

196
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
someone was arrested

197
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,810
at my inn too.

198
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,460
We're supposed to enter the exam hall today.

199
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,640
How could this happen?

200
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,750
Who is this person?

201
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,200
I don't know either.

202
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,320
I am the Crown Prince, Jiang Yunsheng,

203
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
the chief examiner for this spring's general examination.

204
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,310
[Exam Hall]

205
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,110
If you pass the exam,

206
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,730
I will be your mentor.

207
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,080
I know you have doubts

208
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,750
about what happened yesterday.

209
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,550
But please

210
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:50,310
set aside your doubts for now.

211
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,030
Those who can stand here

212
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,010
are all able to safely participate

213
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,230
in the examination.

214
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,210
In the future, when you become officials,

215
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,710
you will experience much more.

216
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,650
If even yesterday's events

217
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,040
can disturb your minds

218
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,980
and prevent you from answering questions,

219
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,000
then I advise you

220
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,430
to leave this exam hall now.

221
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,050
This is not

222
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,960
the right place for you.

223
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,280
Let's begin.

224
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,130
Let's go. There's nothing to see here.

225
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,940
I have truly raised two fine sons.

226
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,000
One colluded with court officials

227
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,510
to sell exam papers for cheating,

228
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,310
and the other had officials under his jurisdiction

229
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,020
buying and selling positions.

230
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,850
How are things on the Crown Prince's side?

231
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,670
Your Majesty,

232
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,670
the Crown Prince personally appeared

233
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,250
to comfort the remaining candidates.

234
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,960
Currently, the examination

235
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,530
is proceeding smoothly.

236
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,420
That's good.

237
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,880
Pass the decree.

238
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:10,280
All officials involved in this affair

239
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,350
will be severely punished,

240
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,890
including my own son.

241
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,710
Yes, Your Majesty.

242
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,400
Your Majesty,

243
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,340
Hao is innocent.

244
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,270
Your Majesty,

245
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,150
Hao truly didn't know

246
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,440
that someone under his command

247
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,080
would engage in buying and selling official positions.

248
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,740
He is still young

249
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,550
and must have been deceived.

250
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,840
Your Majesty, please.

251
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,520
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

252
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,770
I know my son had no part in it,

253
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,690
but since it happened,

254
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,720
Hao must

255
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,080
take some responsibility.

256
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,550
Don't worry, my dear.

257
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:48,190
Hao will be fine.

258
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,310
The Eldest Prince is also to blame.

259
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:59,020
How could he

260
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,690
do something so outrageous?

261
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,360
It's a disgrace to Your Majesty.

262
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:06,170
Your Majesty, you can just punish him.

263
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,620
Don't let anger harm your health.

264
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,710
I can't live without you.

265
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,210
Alright, I see.

266
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,040
Get up now.

267
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,850
Thank you, Your Majesty.
