[Love and Strife]

2
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,990
[Episode 1]

3
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,310
How dare you!

4
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,789
Who are you to offend His Highness?

5
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:26,640
You'll pay for this!

6
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,400
You're the Crown Prince?

7
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,070
My Lady,

8
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:33,560
how did you end up running into others

9
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,920
when I lost sight of you for a moment?

10
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,350
Your Highness, please forgive me.

11
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,530
Help me.

12
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,350
Help me.

13
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,150
She's inside.

14
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,500
Remember, act fast.

15
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:00,350
Rest assured.

16
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,400
Get rid of them properly.

17
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,750
In 15 minutes,

18
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,850
make sure to lead His Majesty here.

19
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,700
Help me.

20
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,490
You're heavily intoxicated.

21
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,079
Am I not pretty?

22
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,500
Why won't you look at me?

23
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,120
There's something wrong with you.

24
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:41,970
I'll go call a royal physician here.

25
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,630
You ungrateful boy!

26
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,680
What are you doing?

27
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,110
Father Emperor.

28
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,310
It's urgent to call a royal physician here.

29
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,800
County Princess has been drugged.

30
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,520
She's now delirious.

31
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:33,890
What?

32
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:35,940
Call a royal physician here.

33
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:36,920
Yes.

34
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,620
Don't make a fuss.

35
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:38,690
Ask them to come quietly.

36
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,190
Yes.

37
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,630
Your Majesty,

38
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,000
Miss Xu indeed shows signs of poisoning.

39
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:51,740
[Jiang Yunhao, Third Prince]

40
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,159
You may leave.

41
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:51,830
Yes.

42
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,760
[Consort Shu]

43
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,920
Without a marriage contract,

44
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,240
they've already consummated the marriage.

45
00:04:58,530 --> 00:04:59,730
This is too disgraceful.

46
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,370
Your Majesty, what do you think?

47
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
The die is cast.

48
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,430
There is no decency left to speak of.

49
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,560
Since the Crown Prince is so eager,

50
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,680
I can only grant him the marriage.

51
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,710
[Jiang Zheng, Emperor]

52
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,600
Your Highness,

53
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,600
the marriage was hastily granted.

54
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,070
Are you satisfied with the imperial decree?

55
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,560
By my parents' order,

56
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,120
I dare not refuse.

57
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,720
Then you're willing

58
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,920
to marry a woman you barely know?

59
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,950
Your marriage was granted right after a palace banquet.

60
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,070
How perfunctory it is!

61
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,810
[Three days ago]

62
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,480
Miss Shen from the Prime Minister's mansion found out

63
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,950
that Consort Shu wants Jiang Yunhao

64
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,920
to marry Xu Chuyun.

65
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,340
She would definitely try to harm Xu Chuyun.

66
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,400
She didn't expect this County Princess

67
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,990
would scheme to have an intimate relationship with me

68
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,560
after knowing Shen Yuanyuan's plan.

69
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,760
She used my status as the Crown Prince

70
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,030
to cancel this marriage.

71
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:56,100
I anticipated her scheme,

72
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,240
but I didn't expect

73
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,430
she would be so ruthless to herself.

74
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,460
Since she has given me a way out,

75
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,740
if I hadn't gone along with it,

76
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,540
wouldn't it have wasted

77
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,720
her careful planning?

78
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,760
This is how things stand.

79
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,950
She is the most suitable one

80
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,580
to be a weak and incompetent

81
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,440
Crown Princess of the Eastern Palace.

82
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,680
So,

83
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,390
marrying her is your own decision?

84
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,270
Yes.

85
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,240
That should be fine.

86
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,830
Once the grand wedding is held,

87
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,360
you will have

88
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,630
the qualification to participate in politics.

89
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,650
You can also openly gather supporters.

90
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:37,000
The plan that has been in the works for many years

91
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,560
can also be initiated.

92
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,950
Lord Jiang, the time is not yet right.

93
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,070
At least wait until the grand wedding is held.

94
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,070
Just wait and see,

95
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,510
the grand wedding in the Eastern Palace

96
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,770
will certainly not be so simple

97
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,750
as you and I think.

98
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,240
Three months ago,

99
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,190
people wearing black armor masks

100
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,200
disguised as bandits

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,680
massacred the entire Xu family.

102
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,990
How could this happen?

103
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,270
Auntie Liu!

104
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,310
Uncle Zhong!

105
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,070
How could this happen?

106
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,310
My Lady, Master is so skilled in martial arts.

107
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,480
He will be all right.

108
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,720
Calm down for now.

109
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:53,870
My Lady!

110
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,250
Who is there?

111
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:03,960
Leave now!

112
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,400
Stop right there!

113
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,310
With such kind of masks and martial arts,

114
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,680
how could they possibly be bandits?

115
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:17,710
So it's nothing but an excuse.

116
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,510
The real enemy

117
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,840
is within this imperial city.

118
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,120
My Lady,

119
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,190
this is the biography of Crown Prince Jiang Yunsheng.

120
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,200
It's been a long time since I've seen

121
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,340
someone so tight-lipped.

122
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,320
Be careful.

123
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,679
Don't kill him.

124
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,390
He's still useful.

125
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,840
I'll tell you!

126
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,650
It's... It's the Guo family.

127
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:09,510
Back then, Guo Heng,

128
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,960
the eldest prince's uncle, instructed me

129
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,760
to hide the evidence of Grand Preceptor's treason

130
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,030
in the Zhao's mansion.

131
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,920
It was Guo Heng who instructed me to do so.

132
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,200
Guo Heng.

133
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,030
Your Highness,

134
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,150
your legs...
