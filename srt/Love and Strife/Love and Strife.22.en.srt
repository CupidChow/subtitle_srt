[Love and Strife]

2
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,990
[Episode 22]

3
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,590
Father Emperor.

4
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,190
Where is Father Emperor?

5
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:04,540
Father Emperor?

6
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,960
Guards!

7
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,600
The Crown Prince

8
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,610
is plotting against the Emperor.

9
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:22,950
Take him down.

10
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:23,810
Who dares?

11
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:26,680
Third Brother,

12
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:28,620
what are you doing?

13
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,730
What am I doing?

14
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,080
I'm capturing

15
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,910
the treasonous rebels, of course.

16
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,400
Second Brother,

17
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,640
you're already the Crown Prince.

18
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,490
Are you really so eager

19
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,640
to get rid of Father Emperor

20
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,300
and ascend the throne?

21
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,170
Take him down now!

22
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,539
Jiang Yunhao really did rebel.

23
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,780
Shen Yuanyuan didn't lie to us.

24
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,170
If we had known,

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,240
we would have transferred

26
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,370
all the Yulin Guards in the city here.

27
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,280
She indeed

28
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,720
didn't lie to us about this.

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,729
But we got caught

30
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,330
because of her.

31
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,240
She came to inform us

32
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,490
just to lure us into the palace.

33
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,450
If it weren't for her,

34
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,560
we wouldn't have decided

35
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
to enter the palace now.

36
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,740
This woman

37
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,880
really has never had good intentions.

38
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,120
However,

39
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,340
she really was willing

40
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,640
to entrust her life

41
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,530
to me.

42
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,170
Honey, don't panic.

43
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,450
Who knows

44
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,520
who will fall into whose trap?

45
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:38,560
Let's go and find that Father Emperor of mine.

46
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,960
Jiang Yunhao has taken control

47
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,360
of all the Yulin Guards in the palace.

48
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:58,840
It seems

49
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:00,450
he has been planning this for a long time.

50
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,330
Let's go.

51
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,270
Well, well.

52
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,810
Where did these little mice come from?

53
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,500
You really didn't die.

54
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,640
Your Majesty,

55
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,120
how's the taste

56
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,200
of Bi Luo?

57
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
You vicious woman!

58
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,170
This can't be the first time

59
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,400
you've done such a vicious thing.

60
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,560
Of course it's not the first time.

61
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,770
Your Majesty,

62
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,600
you know better than I do.

63
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,520
Crown Prince,

64
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,770
do you think

65
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,620
I killed your mother?

66
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,340
Isn't that so?

67
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:12,490
Indeed,

68
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,610
I did administer the poison.

69
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,410
You've finally admitted it.

70
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,120
It really was you.

71
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,120
Really?

72
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,650
Is this just

73
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,190
the result of jealousy?

74
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,810
Your Majesty,

75
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,320
you are also a murderer.

76
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,010
Go on.

77
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,970
The late Empress was the most beautiful in the palace.

78
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,680
She and His Majesty were childhood sweethearts.

79
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,490
From when he was the most destitute prince

80
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,970
to when he became the Emperor,

81
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,880
they were always deeply in love and never doubted each other.

82
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,540
Who in the capital

83
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,409
didn't envy them?

84
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,240
I also wanted such a love

85
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,880
with His Majesty.

86
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,850
So you decided

87
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,320
to kill her?

88
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:07,930
That's right.

89
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,440
I did intend to kill her.

90
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:11,800
However,

91
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,730
even the best relationship

92
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,240
can sour.

93
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:17,410
If it weren't for the rift

94
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,560
between you two,

95
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,730
how could I have poisoned her

96
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,410
under the protection

97
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,850
of so many guards?

98
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,660
That's utter nonsense.

99
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,440
This is just

100
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,950
your delusion!

101
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,360
Delusions?

102
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:35,490
Your Majesty,

103
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,090
do you remember

104
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,530
when you told me

105
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,310
that I am the one who truly understands you?

106
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,360
I know everything you want.

107
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,170
So,

108
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,460
I will make sure to help you achieve it,

109
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,880
right?

110
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,120
You're so vicious.

111
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,170
You carry the bloodline of the Zhao family.

112
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,630
Do you know

113
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,620
that the late Empress's maternal family

114
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:09,250
held immense power in the court?

115
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,680
Half of the officials

116
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,000
are disciples of the Zhao family.

117
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,880
If they wanted to overthrow the Emperor

118
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,380
and have a child of their own bloodline

119
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,210
ascend to the throne,

120
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:19,900
wouldn't that

121
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,200
be the simplest thing?

122
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,300
My mother and the Zhao family

123
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,050
would never do such a thing.

124
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,320
Really?

125
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,470
Never?

126
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,050
What about the Xu family?

127
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,200
The Xu family controls half of the military.

128
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,650
Don't they have even the slightest intention

129
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:46,930
of rebellion?

130
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,320
Shuqin,

131
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,590
you've lost your mind!

132
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,090
Shuqin?

133
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,730
You finally started calling me

134
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,800
Shuqin again.

135
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:03,490
Your Majesty,

136
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,760
I know what's on your mind.

137
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,800
You got your empire by seizing it.

138
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,690
What you fear most

139
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,370
is losing it to someone else,

140
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,790
isn't it?

141
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,410
Although you don't say it,

142
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,610
I can tell.

143
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,440
So,

144
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,360
I will help you achieve everything you want.

145
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,610
After that,

146
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,460
I eliminated the Empress.

147
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,650
It was I

148
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,440
who secretly dealt with those troubles.

149
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,360
For you,

150
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,530
I would do anything.

151
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,050
Without these obstacles,

152
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,970
I could become your true love.

153
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,400
Unfortunately...

154
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,700
Unfortunately,

155
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,490
you have never

156
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,440
truly loved me.

157
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,140
Your Majesty.

158
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,470
I still have

159
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,410
one last wish before I die,

160
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,710
and I hope you can fulfill it.

161
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,680
I'm listening.

162
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,790
Before I die,

163
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,560
I want to see Hao one last time.

164
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,200
I know

165
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,169
you're worried.

166
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,190
So let Hao

167
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,049
be the knife in your hand.

168
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,409
Whatever you want,

169
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,720
Hao will definitely fulfill it.

170
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,580
Your Majesty, I beg you

171
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,320
to grant me this.

172
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,120
His Majesty is too suspicious.

173
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,480
Now that the Eldest Prince is confined,

174
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,670
my son has been imprisoned because of you,

175
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,750
and the other princes are still young,

176
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,840
only you, the Crown Prince,

177
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,200
stand above all others.

178
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,330
Do you think the Emperor will tolerate this?

179
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,650
He won't!

180
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,470
And with my death,

181
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,680
Hao's opportunity

182
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,070
will come.

183
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:10,910
By order of the Emperor.

184
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,410
I accept the decree.

185
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,560
[Trap]

186
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,800
Get ready

187
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:58,390
to go to the Crown Prince Mansion.

188
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:14,920
Your Majesty.

189
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,480
Is there anything else

190
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,340
you want to say now that you've called me here?

191
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,200
Your Majesty,

192
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,880
have you ever

193
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,210
truly loved me?

194
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,180
I used to have

195
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,130
some feelings for you.

196
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:43,400
You...

197
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,560
How dare you attempt to assassinate me!

198
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,130
Guards! Guards!

199
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,200
Guards! Hurry!

200
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,820
Consort Shu attempted to assassinate me!

201
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,670
Some feelings?

202
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,770
How cruel you are.

203
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,370
Go,

204
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,380
escort His Majesty to the Imperial Study.

205
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,960
Issue a decree

206
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,030
saying that I have passed away.

207
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,970
You vicious woman!

208
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,090
The Empress wasn't vicious,

209
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,340
but you killed her.

210
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,250
Seeing you two

211
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,930
walk into the palace just like that,

212
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,580
I was absolutely thrilled.

213
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,650
Crown Prince,

214
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,060
what do you think of my plan?

215
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,200
By tomorrow morning's court session,

216
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,610
everyone will know that

217
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,340
you murdered your father, the Emperor,

218
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,610
and conspired to usurp the throne.

219
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,080
And my Hao

220
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,650
will be the hero who eliminated the traitors,

221
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,330
ascending to the throne fair and square.

222
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
Your Ladyship,

223
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,810
do you think

224
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,340
the officials are fools?

225
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:59,650
Do you think they won't see through

226
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,890
such a simple frame-up?

227
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,170
Well said.

228
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,010
You are absolutely right.

229
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,680
However,

230
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,470
to ensure my plan is foolproof,

231
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,030
all of you

232
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,530
must die!

233
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,150
Whoever kills them,

234
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,890
I will grant them titles of nobility,

235
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,190
raise them to high office,

236
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,720
and reward them with 10 thousand taels of gold!

237
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,820
I will send the Crown Prince

238
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,530
to the Empress first.

239
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,550
Your Majesty, you should spend more time with me.
