00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:53,900
[Love and Strife]

2
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,990
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,570
Never did I expect…

4
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,920
Since you are so eager for revenge,

5
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,200
why are you so desperate

6
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,960
to bear my heir?

7
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,670
Your actions

8
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,870
make me wonder

9
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,640
if you have some other plan

10
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,430
in mind?

11
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,400
Your Highness, it's time to change your attire.

12
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,280
Your Highness.

13
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,680
Why the rush?

14
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,039
Did the Crown Princess

15
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,280
notice something unusual?

16
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,120
No,

17
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,090
someone from the palace came

18
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:00,580
unexpectedly to summon the Crown Princess to the palace.

19
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,690
The day after the grand wedding,

20
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,430
it is only proper etiquette

21
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,510
for the Crown Prince to bring the Crown Princess to the palace to offer gratitude.

22
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,280
Why the hurry?

23
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,190
Your Highness,

24
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,240
only the Crown Princess has been summoned to the palace—

25
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,360
it is not for you to express gratitude.

26
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:12,910
It's

27
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,360
for an instruction.

28
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,430
Noble Consort.

29
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,870
County Princess Gongchen,

30
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,400
as the wife of the Crown Prince,

31
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,710
you lack the virtues expected of a woman.

32
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,280
Now that you have made a mistake,

33
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,430
how dare you appear in such extravagant attire?

34
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,750
Guards!

35
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,190
Strip her of her garments!

36
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,560
Are you alright?

37
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,840
Get up quickly.

38
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,080
How are you? Be careful.

39
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,520
Are you hurt? Get up quickly.

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,840
Are you okay?

41
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,400
Get up.

42
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:15,520
Take care.

43
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,310
Take care.

44
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,630
Noble Consort,

45
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,840
what crime have I committed?

46
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,750
Xu Chuyun,

47
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,400
yesterday the Crown Prince Mansion was attacked by assassins

48
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,470
of unknown origin.

49
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,150
Summoning you to the palace to receive an instruction

50
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,750
is in accordance with palace regulations.

51
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,590
You, a bringer of calamity

52
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,680
who doomed your entire family—

53
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,120
how could you possibly be worthy of the position of Crown Princess?

54
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,000
Sister,

55
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,360
how can you say that?

56
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,400
Even His Majesty has personally praised

57
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,030
my Xu family for loyalty and bravery,

58
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,520
and has granted me the title of County Princess,

59
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,079
bestowing upon me the honor

60
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,960
of a propitious marriage to the Crown Prince.

61
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,310
Are you suggesting that

62
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,430
His Majesty is wrong?

63
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:03,910
You...

64
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,590
His Majesty has arranged this marriage for you

65
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,800
in his compassion.

66
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,800
How could he be wrong?

67
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,430
However, the Eastern Palace is the foundation of the state,

68
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,000
and not the slightest mistake can be tolerated.

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,470
These assassins have come under mysterious circumstances,

70
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,430
and according to palace regulations,

71
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,240
it is only natural to question you.

72
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,750
Noble Consort,

73
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,270
I grew up in the border regions

74
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,680
and am unfamiliar with the rules,

75
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,120
let alone the palace regulations.

76
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,310
However, I do know that

77
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,430
if a daughter-in-law makes a mistake,

78
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,920
it is only right that

79
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,240
she be punished by her parents-in-law,

80
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,000
and it is not for others to mistreat her.

81
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
How dare you disrespect Consort Shu!

82
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,430
The one who is disrespectful

83
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,750
is you, a servant who knows neither the rules

84
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,120
nor her place.

85
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,240
No matter how meek and easy to bully I may seem,

86
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,440
I am not someone you can lay hands on.

87
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,560
Noble Consort,

88
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:09,950
I

89
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,630
truly do not know what mistake I have made.

90
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,110
But for the sake of the royal family's dignity,

91
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,660
the reputation of the Xu family,

92
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,790
and the rules of the palace,

93
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,920
I humbly ask for your guidance.

94
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,420
Crown Princess,

95
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:49,610
as the one in charge of the six palaces,

96
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,920
today's inquiry

97
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,100
is merely following palace protocol.

98
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,830
It is not meant to disrespect you,

99
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,420
nor is there any intention to disregard the hierarchy.

100
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,880
Noble Consort,

101
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,920
what do you mean by this?

102
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,320
Could it be that within this palace,

103
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,960
I am considered more noble than you?

104
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,460
The Crown Princess, as the consort of the Eastern Palace,

105
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,730
represents the rightful lineage of the state.

106
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,830
With the position of the Empress currently vacant,

107
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,170
the Crown Princess

108
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,200
is the most noble woman in the palace.

109
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:34,280
[Imperial Study]

110
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,440
Eunuch,

111
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
the Crown Prince's health is frail,

112
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,710
and the spring chill is still biting.

113
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,060
When will His Majesty be able to grant an audience?

114
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,370
Guard Xue,

115
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,880
as you know,

116
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,440
the day after the grand wedding,

117
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:01,270
it is customary for the couple to express their gratitude together.

118
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,760
The Third Prince and his consort

119
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,120
came together.

120
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,270
The consort has just gone to Hualian Palace

121
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,790
to see the Noble Consort.

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,510
His Majesty has therefore asked the Third Prince

123
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,920
to stay a bit longer.

124
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,360
But

125
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,220
without the Crown Princess,

126
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,360
how can I report to His Majesty?

127
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,150
You...

128
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,830
Your Highness, you're here.

129
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,390
I

130
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:40,680
congratulate you on your grand wedding.

131
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,420
Wasn't your wedding

132
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,930
on the same day as mine?

133
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,880
Congratulations to you as well.

134
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,390
Thank you, Your Highness.

135
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,560
Where is the Crown Princess?

136
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,830
Why isn't she here?

137
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,800
I heard there were assassins last night.

138
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,800
Is everything alright?

139
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,710
Your Highness, please forgive me.

140
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,630
I was late

141
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,830
because I was receiving instructions at Hualian Palace.

142
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,660
Your Majesty, I humbly greet you and wish you good health.

143
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,840
Your Majesty, I respectfully inquire if you're in good health.

144
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,950
I'm well. You may rise.

145
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:37,740
There is no need for such formalities in front of me.

146
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,460
Thank you, Father Emperor.

147
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:42,080
Chuyun,

148
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:44,260
you have been free-spirited since childhood,

149
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,920
and I fear you may not be accustomed to the palace's rules.

150
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,940
Among common folk, new daughters-in-law

151
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,110
receive gifts when meeting their in-laws,

152
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,580
so I have

153
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,790
prepared some things for you.

154
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,150
Let's follow the customs you are fond of.

155
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,430
Additionally, here are a thousand taels of gold.

156
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,560
If there is anything you fancy,

157
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,270
feel free to buy it yourself.

158
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,910
Thank you for your generosity.

159
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,090
Yunsheng,

160
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,770
in the blink of an eye, you're already married.

161
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,270
If your mother knew,

162
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,030
she would be overjoyed.
