[Episode 10]

3
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,170
Why are you looking at me?

4
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,440
Focus on the chess game.

5
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,020
I heard,

6
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:10,680
a few days ago,

7
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,480
Crown Princess hurt you.

8
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,100
Nonsense.

9
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:15,900
It was just an accident.

10
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,620
Is that so?

11
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,789
It seems my sister-in-law

12
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:23,820
has quite a grudge against you.

13
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:29,860
It's just marital intimacy.

14
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,530
You wouldn't understand.

15
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,050
Are you not planning

16
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,200
to tell her about that matter?

17
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,960
It's not the right time yet.

18
00:01:38,690 --> 00:01:39,740
If I rashly tell her,

19
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,670
both of us will be in danger.

20
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,920
You should still find a way to reveal a little about it.

21
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,520
If she's kept in the dark,

22
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,720
she's bound to harbor resentment.

23
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,470
Something's bound to go wrong sooner or later.

24
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,390
I know what I'm doing.

25
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,160
Your Highness,

26
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,560
our people have obtained the list of candidates.

27
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,680
So quickly?

28
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,800
The list alone as evidence

29
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,630
is not enough.

[Hualian Palace]

31
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,310
I heard

32
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,820
the Crown Prince's health has improved greatly these days.

33
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,160
His work has also received

34
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,440
praise from the ministers.

35
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:26,620
It seems

36
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,040
getting married has made quite a difference to him.

37
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:31,460
Sheng's health

38
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,160
has indeed improved considerably,

39
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,220
but his work is still somewhat immature.

40
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,750
He still needs more experience.

41
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,530
Your Majesty, please rest assured.

42
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,590
With Lord Guo and others,

43
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,680
the Crown Prince

44
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,040
will surely handle this spring imperial examination smoothly.

45
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,290
If Sister were to see this,

46
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,940
she would certainly be pleased as well.

47
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:54,260
If Shuang were here,

48
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,130
she would definitely be happy.

49
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,680
Happy?

50
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,590
When the spring imperial examination begins,

51
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,440
even if the wretched woman were to jump out of her coffin

52
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,790
and die of anger again, that would be the least of it.

53
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,070
What are you standing there for?

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,590
Hurry and help me with my makeup.

55
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,500
Yes.

56
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,190
Darling,

57
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,820
you've been very busy lately.

58
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,570
Please eat more today.

59
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,760
You too, Honey.

60
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,290
You've been worrying a lot as well.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,370
This lotus seed soup helps reduce internal heat.

62
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,620
It's good for your health.

63
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,270
Wait, Honey.

64
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,260
My bowl of soup is neither cold nor hot.

65
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,960
It's just right to eat.

66
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,510
Honey,

67
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:10,100
you may try my bowl of soup.

68
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:19,839
What's wrong?

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,800
It's nothing.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,800
I'm sorry, Your Highness!

71
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,560
It's my fault!

72
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,360
It's my fault!

73
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,360
I'm sorry, Your Highness!

74
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,390
I'm sorry, Your Highness!

75
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,480
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,310
Go and receive your punishment immediately.

77
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,240
Yes.

78
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,880
Are you hurt, Honey?

79
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,240
No.

80
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:03,950
Darling,

81
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,040
I'll go change my clothes.

82
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:14,480
No need to get up.

83
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,110
Listen.

84
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,140
Your heart is beating so fast.

85
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,710
You must have been frightened.

86
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,960
No, I'm not.

87
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,120
Su Zhu.

88
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,110
How is she?

89
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,360
The Crown Princess is fine.

90
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,200
She's practicing the Qin in the music room right now.

91
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,120
That's good to hear.

92
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,090
Clean up everything.

93
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,480
Don't leave any traces.

94
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:07,730
Your Highness,

95
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,360
in addition to this poisoning attempt,

96
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,410
the Crown Princess

97
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,310
has tried to kill you twice.

98
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:12,970
Well...

99
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,540
Your Highness,

100
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,750
what can happen once

101
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,920
can happen again and again.

102
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,040
If the Crown Princess continues like this,

103
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,710
and if you let your guard down one day,

104
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,710
you'll get hurt.

105
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,190
We can't be on guard forever.

106
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:35,820
Shut up.

107
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,909
The Crown Princess's actions

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,190
are none of your business.

109
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,909
I have overstepped my bounds.

110
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,960
If you care so much about her,

111
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,240
why don't you tell her about those things?

112
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,880
It can help clear up the misunderstanding.

113
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:50,830
Win her sincerity

114
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
with your own sincerity, right?

115
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,980
Let's wait a bit longer.

116
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,300
The Crown Prince's schemes run so deep.

117
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,390
He has some deeply hidden tricks up his sleeve,

118
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,780
making a complete fool of me.

119
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,800
Do I still have a chance

120
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,150
to kill him?

121
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:26,310
My Lady,

122
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,600
what are you doing?

123
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,880
I'm fine.

124
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,020
I just need to calm down.

125
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,250
Be patient, My Lady.

126
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,870
We weren't caught this time.

127
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,420
We still have plenty of opportunities.

128
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,800
There's no need to rush.

129
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,210
Perhaps he's already found out about me.

130
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,720
He just didn't say anything.

131
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,690
He's just playing along with us.

132
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,990
Any news from Ding Er?

133
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,710
Ding Er has already found

134
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,120
the list of all participants

135
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,680
and figured out their residences.

136
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,950
He's made a copy of the information,

137
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,300
without alerting anyone.

138
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,570
My Lady,

139
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,950
what should we do next?

140
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,350
What else can we do?

141
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,590
Send it out.

142
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,200
You appeared as expected.

143
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,990
You don't seem surprised at all

144
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,720
that I would appear here.

145
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,050
How many times have you done so?

146
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,060
You enter the Eastern Palace as if it were deserted.

147
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,480
You

148
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,340
are living right here in the Eastern Palace.

149
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,700
All fingers are linked to the heart.

150
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,550
Didn't it hurt?

151
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,390
It's just a superficial wound.

152
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
It's nothing.

153
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,650
Have you ever considered

154
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:21,780
that you might be seeking revenge on the wrong person?

155
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,700
Better to kill the wrong person

156
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,020
than to let the right one go.

157
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,380
If the Crown Prince has nothing to do with it,

158
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,260
what would you do then?

159
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,880
Once I uncover the truth

160
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,490
and have my revenge,

161
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,220
if he's truly not involved,

162
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,690
I'll die with him as compensation.

163
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,230
What are you going to do?

164
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,070
Wait a little longer.

165
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,320
I will show you

166
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,950
the truth you seek.

167
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:57,780
Just wait a bit more.

168
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,880
What do you mean?

169
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,030
Soon,

170
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:05,750
you will know

171
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:06,610
the whole truth.

172
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,390
You will also understand

173
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,080
that the Crown Prince

174
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,620
only wants to protect you.

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,830
What gives you the right to say such things?

176
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,430
Who on earth are you?

177
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:21,630
Or could it be

178
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,380
that you are him?

179
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,750
Since you don't dare to

180
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,910
show your true face

181
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,600
or want to kill me,

182
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,850
don't get in my way.

183
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,340
You said you want to protect me,

184
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,380
but how can you protect me?
