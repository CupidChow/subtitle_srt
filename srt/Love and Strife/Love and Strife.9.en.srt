[Love and Strife]

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,960
[Episode 9]

3
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,780
Brother?

4
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,000
What are you doing here?

5
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,270
Are you looking for Father Emperor?

6
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:07,380
I’m waiting for you, third brother.

7
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,200
Waiting for me?

8
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,250
Brother, what do you mean?

9
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:13,710
You know

10
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,150
what I mean very well.

11
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,820
Your hands are reaching too far.

12
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,200
One day they might get chopped off.

13
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,120
What will you do then?

14
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,530
Fool.

15
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,750
The eldest and the third have started fighting.

16
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:35,410
They are just like that wild dog

17
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:37,920
that won't let go once it bites.

18
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:39,700
In just a few short months,

19
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,660
the factions in the court are turning on each other,

20
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:42,770
causing the downfall of many political allies.

21
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,170
Now, the six ministries

22
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,270
have no one left who can control the situation.

23
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,140
The official positions crossed out on this paper,

24
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,970
we should try to push our people into them.

25
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,090
As for Consort Shu,

26
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,700
we need to be cautious.

27
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,890
There's no need to worry about that.

28
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,220
A few days ago,

29
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,450
you asked me to send into the palace

30
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,370
those beauties

31
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,290
who have gained quite a bit of royal favor.

32
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,660
Consort Shu is busy with palace intrigue.

33
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,280
She barely has a moment to catch her breath.

34
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:07,100
How could she have time to take care of her son?

35
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,009
This is enough.

36
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,380
With internal strife and external threats going on,

37
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,220
we, empty-handed,

38
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:13,690
will let go

39
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,230
and do what we need to do.

40
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:22,020
My Crown Princess has arrived.

41
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,090
I'll go to welcome her.

42
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,130
Where is the Crown Princess now?

43
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,550
She has already passed the second gate.

44
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,030
Honey, why do you come at this time?

45
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,270
Your Highness,

46
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:43,950
I've noticed

47
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,370
Your Highness has been busy with the spring imperial examinations lately.

48
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,070
You've been working too hard.

49
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,340
I'm a bit worried about Your Highness's health.

50
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,340
So,

51
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,110
I've invited Doctor Liu.

52
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,560
I, Liu Yan, a humble subject,

53
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,310
pay my respects to Your Highness.

54
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,020
You're too kind, Honey.

55
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:00,740
Come,

56
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,510
sit down.

57
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,810
Darling, there's something you should know.

58
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,220
Uncle Liu

59
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,100
was originally a military doctor in my father's army.

60
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,740
Whenever I had any ailment since childhood,

61
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,579
Uncle Liu always cured me.

62
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,840
So,

63
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,840
I thought he could take a look at you as well.

64
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,230
I understand your good intentions, Honey.

65
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:27,150
However,

66
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,260
I've been disappointed too many times.

67
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,690
I...

68
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,700
Do I

69
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,690
put you in a difficult position?

70
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,140
It was thoughtless of me.

71
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,050
Then, Darling,

72
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:55,900
I'll go make you some soup.

73
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,370
Darling.

74
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,970
Doctor Liu will remain in the residence.

75
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,110
If you change your mind,

76
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,100
you can call for him at any time.

77
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,560
Xue Ping.

78
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,640
I see you serving by my side every day.

79
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,770
It must be quite tiring.

80
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:37,290
The tonic soup that the Crown Princess will bring later,

81
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:38,890
you should drink it instead.

82
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:40,540
I'm not tired, Your Highness.

83
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,530
It's not hard for me.

84
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,570
The Crown Princess has worked hard

85
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,810
to prepare the tonic soup for Your Highness.

86
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:44,940
I'm not worthy to drink it.

87
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,200
I never thought

88
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,870
he would be so resistant to treating his leg.

89
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,940
According to what you've said, My Lady,

90
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,180
the imperial physicians

91
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,810
and the doctors summoned by the Emperor

92
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,300
have all failed to cure him.

93
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,770
They gave him hope,

94
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,130
only to disappoint him again.

95
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,100
Over time,

96
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,380
it's indeed likely to make someone resistant.

97
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,860
One might also become demoralized.

98
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,040
Uncle Liu,

99
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,210
do you think it's possible that

100
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,370
his leg

101
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,190
was never actually a problem?

102
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,450
No problem?

103
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,670
On the surface,

104
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,100
it's hard to tell.

105
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,130
We still need to examine it.

106
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,100
Never mind.

107
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,430
Whether his leg is well or not

108
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,570
doesn't really matter to me.

109
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,909
What I care about

110
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,060
is whether he can help me conceive a royal heir.

111
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,240
My Lady,

112
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,310
the porridge is ready.

113
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,659
I'll take it.

114
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,670
Darling.

115
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,120
Please have this late-night snack and then go to sleep.

116
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,590
I

117
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,400
just finished dinner, didn't I?

118
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:02,690
This...

119
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,420
This longan porridge is best for nourishing qi and blood.

120
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,500
Your health has never been good.

121
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:11,770
Lately, you've been even more

122
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,890
overworked due to the spring imperial examination.

123
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:15,570
This porridge

124
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,610
can help you sleep well.

125
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,300
Alright.

126
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,650
If that's the case,

127
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,010
I'll have some then.

128
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,250
It's just off the stove and a bit hot.

129
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,250
Be careful, Darling.

130
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,570
Are you alright, Darling?

131
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,250
Someone come!

132
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:43,620
Someone come quickly!

133
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:50,100
Darling!

134
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,450
It's all my fault.

135
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,000
I couldn't even hold the bowl of porridge steady.

136
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,300
I will

137
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,380
go summon the imperial physician right away.

138
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,980
Don't panic, Honey.

139
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,300
It's just some porridge.

140
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,450
No harm done.

141
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,270
Darling,

142
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,880
it's all my fault.

143
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,720
If it weren't for

144
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,140
my carelessness,

145
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,210
I wouldn't have caused

146
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,860
you to miss court today.

147
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,000
If Father Emperor blames you,

148
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,530
I'll take

149
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,940
all the blame.

150
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,150
I won't blame you.

151
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,210
I'm fine, aren't I?

152
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:35,210
And there's no burn either.

153
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,580
A few days of rest will do.

154
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:41,060
If only I had been more careful,

155
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,060
this wouldn't have happened.

156
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,420
I won't blame you,

157
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,630
never.

158
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,010
Really?

159
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:12,810
I will never break my word to you.

160
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,620
Jiang Yunsheng,

161
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,060
who are you really?

162
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,620
I can't trust you,

163
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,770
nor do I dare to.

164
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,370
At this point,

165
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,550
only the truth I uncover myself

166
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,890
can put my mind at ease.

167
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,860
Darling, you treat me so well.

168
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,450
Long time no see.

169
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,539
Indeed.

170
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:53,430
My Lady,

171
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,540
we have a lead.

172
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,590
Speak.

173
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,230
The person in charge from the Guo family

174
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,760
has connections with the Third Prince.

175
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,320
Ding Er has found out where he lives.

176
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,550
We're planning to find time in the next few days

177
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,220
to search for crucial clues.

178
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,430
In this matter,

179
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,130
Jiang Yunhao indeed intervened.

180
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,190
Have Ding Er keep an eye on it,

181
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,150
but don't make a move.

182
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,210
Yes.

183
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,210
For the sake of a man,

184
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,700
My Lady was almost harmed.

185
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,660
Such a person, even if momentarily triumphant,

186
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,160
won't have a good outcome in the end.

187
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:32,140
She's nothing but a pawn

188
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,690
being moved around by others.

189
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,780
This Shen Yuanyuan, with all her pretenses,

190
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,020
is quite capable indeed.

191
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:39,810
Tell me,

192
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,780
are they truly in love,

193
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,470
or just putting on an act?

194
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,960
Third Prince.

195
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,560
I was walking too fast.

196
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,420
So they are truly in love.

197
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,750
I thought

198
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,860
everyone in the royal family was just acting.

199
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,230
It turns out

200
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,440
only Jiang Yunsheng and I

201
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,230
were putting on a show for each other.

202
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,110
Let's go.

203
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,540
Greetings to the Crown Princess.

204
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:29,380
You may all rise.

205
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,940
We didn't know you would come in person, Your Highness.

206
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,060
Do you have any instructions?

207
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,570
It's nothing.

208
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,140
I'm just looking around.

209
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,270
The Crown Prince has been busy with official duties lately.

210
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:41,940
His diet should be light.

211
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,610
Yes,

212
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:43,970
what we've prepared

213
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,420
are all light dishes.

214
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,520
Please take a look, Your Highness.

215
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,380
Who made this lotus seed soup?

216
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,450
It smells delicious.

217
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,190
Here's a reward.

218
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,790
Thank you, Your Highness.

219
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,140
Jiang Yunsheng.

220
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,520
Although this medicine will kill you,

221
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,290
it's enough to make you

222
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:24,120
healthy in a short time,

223
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,780
helping me conceive a child soon.
