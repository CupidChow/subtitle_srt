00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,890
[Episode 7]

3
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,090
Long live Your Majesty!

4
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:06,620
You may rise.

5
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,590
Thank you, Your Majesty.

6
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,200
How is the selection of the chief examiner for the imperial examination going?

7
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,800
Most of the examinees have already arrived in the capital.

8
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,760
We must make a decision today, no matter what.

9
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,130
Your Majesty,

10
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,920
the imperial examination is a matter of great importance.

11
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,550
I believe that

12
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,560
the Crown Prince is the most suitable candidate

13
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,280
to take on the role of the chief examiner.

14
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,789
What makes you say that?

15
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,370
The Crown Prince is the heir to the throne

16
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,479
and has already married.

17
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
It is time for him to establish his career

18
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,430
and show the authority of the heir apparent.

19
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,039
By then,

20
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,500
the people will also see

21
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,760
the Crown Prince's grace and talent.

22
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,170
Father Emperor, I…

23
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,000
Father Emperor.

24
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,800
I also believe

25
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,190
that the Crown Prince

26
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,710
is the most suitable choice.

27
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,870
I've noticed that

28
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,650
since he got married, the Crown Prince

29
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,120
has become increasingly healthy.

30
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:21,050
I'm sure he's now able to share the burdens of the country.

31
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,079
Father Emperor,

32
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:28,400
I don't think this is appropriate.

33
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,370
Though the Crown Prince

34
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,920
has participated in state affairs for many years,

35
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:32,560
he has

36
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,630
no real achievements to speak of.

37
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,800
Appointing him

38
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,000
as the chief examiner rashly

39
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,310
could lead to dissatisfaction among students across the country.

40
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,800
I second the motion.

41
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,000
I second the motion.

42
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,710
I second the motion.

43
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,280
I second the motion.

44
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,410
Sheng,

45
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,800
what do you think of this proposal?

46
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,240
I...

47
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,480
will defer to your decision, Father Emperor.

48
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,030
I also think this proposal is excellent.

49
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,320
Well, I'll have the Crown Prince be the chief examiner

50
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,000
for this year's spring imperial examination.

51
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
I accept the imperial decree.

52
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,810
I will not disappoint your expectations.

53
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,360
Mother.

54
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,079
What's wrong?

55
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,590
That stupid Guo Heng

56
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
actually proposed in court

57
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,150
to make that loser

58
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,400
the chief examiner for this year's imperial examination.

59
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,360
Why on earth did Guo Heng

60
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,960
suddenly bring him up?

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,800
I don't know.

62
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,150
That loser

63
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,910
has been nothing

64
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,630
but a mascot in the court all these years.

65
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,240
What achievements has he ever had?

66
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,610
He has no achievements at all!

67
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,750
That idiot Jiang Yunmo

68
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,650
must be trying to drag him down

69
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,880
and get himself out of this mess.

70
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:20,510
This is a bit strange.

71
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,240
Why did he bring him up out of nowhere?

72
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,920
How would I know?

73
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,500
Something doesn't feel right about this.

74
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:32,760
Hao,

75
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,560
stop whatever

76
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,990
you're doing now.

77
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,070
Stop?

78
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:38,830
Mother,

79
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,190
we've been working on this

80
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,830
for nine years. Are we just going to abandon it now?

81
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,870
This is a bit strange.

82
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,830
Acting rashly

83
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,390
is likely to cause trouble.

84
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,720
Mother, you're overthinking it.

85
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,310
He's just a loser.

86
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,390
I'll handle it properly.

87
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:56,159
I won't let our plan fail.

88
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,360
No.

89
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,120
Let me think about it.

90
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:06,150
Let me think it over.

91
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,740
My Lady,

92
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,480
the Crown Prince

93
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,480
was appointed

94
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,830
as the chief examiner for this year's spring general examination.

95
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,390
What did you say?

96
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,830
Which bastard

97
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,000
came up with this idea?

98
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,070
The Guo family.

99
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,410
The Eldest Prince is the one who encouraged it.

100
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,920
They clearly want to make

101
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,240
the Eastern Palace the scapegoat.

102
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,480
My Lady, will we be implicated?

103
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,690
Of course we will.

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,510
I am now the Crown Princess.

105
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,040
On the surface, I share the Eastern Palace's glory

106
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
and its downfall.

107
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,310
If something happens to the Crown Prince,

108
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,120
not to mention seeking vengeance,

109
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,040
I might even...

110
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:48,240
It seems we can no longer stand by

111
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,159
and just look out for ourselves.

112
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,770
Have Ding Er take Team Ding

113
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,360
and investigate everything thoroughly.

114
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,800
I need to know

115
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,980
who the mastermind behind this is.

116
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,120
I'll handle it right away.

117
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,310
Your Highness, you're truly one step ahead.

118
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,960
You even guessed it correctly.

119
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,910
It's not that I'm one step ahead;

120
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,070
it's that they've never

121
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:16,430
taken me seriously,

122
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,720
whether it's Jiang Yunmo,

123
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,750
Jiang Yunhao,

124
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,920
or even my

125
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,150
dear Father Emperor.

126
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,950
As long as Jiang Yunmo

127
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,240
realizes the value of me as a tool,

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,440
he will definitely take action.

129
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,870
The Third Prince probably didn't expect

130
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,940
that he would be paving the way for you.

131
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,070
He's too arrogant,

132
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,430
looking down on everything,

133
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,830
taking everything for granted,

134
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,190
and never willing to look at those beneath him.

135
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,510
As his older brother,

136
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,920
it's my duty to teach him a lesson.

137
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,240
I should even thank him,

138
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:51,700
for giving me this

139
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,760
opportunity to make a name for myself.

140
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,240
Your Highness, you must be extra careful.

141
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,950
You now have the Crown Princess.

142
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:00,870
I know.

143
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,720
As long as the Crown Prince

144
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,870
is alive,

145
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,950
he will always be a target,

146
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,800
constantly bringing me trouble.

147
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,160
So,

148
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,990
the priority for me now

149
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,410
is to have his child.

150
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,270
After that,

151
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,270
he can be

152
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,430
a living dead—

153
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,740
no longer

154
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,410
an obstacle to my revenge.

155
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,000
What are you doing?

156
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,870
Your Highness,

157
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,250
it's already midnight.

158
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,260
If you don't rest,

159
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,030
it will be dawn.

160
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,360
Very well.

161
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,600
I'll go to sleep.

162
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,120
Your Highness,

163
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,040
you're already married.

164
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,810
Why are you still sleeping in the study?

165
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:09,870
Why does the Crown Princess

166
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,830
never come to be with you?

167
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:12,330
Is that any of your business?

168
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,060
Keep talking,

169
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,680
and I'll have you thrown out.

170
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,060
Darling,

171
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,880
may I come in?

172
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:46,480
Please come in, Crown Princess.

173
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,150
Darling.

174
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,950
Honey?

175
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,420
Honey, what brings you here?

176
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,700
Darling, do you dislike me?

177
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,510
Why do you never

178
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,440
sleep with me?

179
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,510
How could that be?

180
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,230
It's just that these past few days...

181
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:22,940
I've been feeling unwell.

182
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,960
If you're not feeling well,

183
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,070
you should let me take care of you.

184
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,840
I just think...

185
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,700
We are husband and wife.

186
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,010
If you were to pass away...

187
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:39,330
Do you want to leave me all alone?

188
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,240
How could that be?

189
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,150
I just feel like

190
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,360
I don't deserve you.

191
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,390
I want to give you a way out.

192
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,720
We got married

193
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,870
because of that misunderstanding.

194
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,440
I don't want you to regret it.

195
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,360
I'm not avoiding you on purpose.

196
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,390
I just...

197
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,300
cherish you.

198
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,320
I've told you,

199
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,270
I'm not unwilling.

200
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,240
You're still young.

201
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:17,750
I don't want you to force yourself.

202
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,720
I'd rather

203
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,480
you marry someone you truly like.

204
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,200
I've already married

205
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,510
the person I like.

206
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:32,520
The person you love?

207
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,790
I like you,

208
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,030
Darling.

209
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,320
I like you too.

210
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:51,570
From the moment I saw you, I've liked you.

211
00:10:54,070 --> 00:11:00,030
♫Lighting a pair of red candles to shield the cold moonlight♫

212
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,600
Me too.

213
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,960
From the moment I first saw you,

214
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:07,030
♫In the courtyard, intertwined crabapple blossoms stand together against the frost and wind♫

215
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,910
I knew I wanted to marry you.

216
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,670
Darling,

217
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,850
you're all I have now.

218
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:14,380
♫But this time, falling for you is not a lie♫

219
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:22,130
♫Yet I'm still in the game, so how could I dare proclaim?♫

220
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:27,380
♫Whose mask, whose labyrinth?♫

221
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,880
♫I bury my love and hate, just to share each dawn and dusk with you♫

222
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,520
♫I dare not long for you, so I can only hide my feelings♫

223
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,130
♫Within the shadow of a blade♫

224
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,450
♫Whose springtime, whose soaring feather?♫

225
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,880
♫I melt away my frozen walls, promising to be with you♫

226
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,590
♫Looking back, I see this love was a stratagem♫

227
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:54,720
♫Yet you have been by my side all along♫

228
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:12,380
♫Through the mist, the light ahead grows ever clearer♫

229
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,550
♫And all along, you have been the truth I've been searching for♫
