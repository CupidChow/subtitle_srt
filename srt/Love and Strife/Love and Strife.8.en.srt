00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,020
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,200
How's it going?

4
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,590
Ding Er reported that

5
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,920
there are two groups investigating.

6
00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:14,350
Jiang Yunhao has also gotten involved?

7
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,380
It was he who encouraged

8
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,460
the expansion of the circle.

9
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,200
It seems

10
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,280
he is determined

11
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,600
to bring down the Eldest Prince.

12
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,210
My Lady,

13
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,350
what should we do?

14
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,310
Find evidence first.

15
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,860
I'll figure out a way

16
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,950
to have the Crown Prince expose this matter.

17
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,430
Since they want to

18
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,680
use the Eastern Palace,

19
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,070
let's make it the stepping stone

20
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:37,229
for the Crown Prince's fame.

21
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,070
Once everything settles,

22
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,280
it will be my time

23
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,039
to reap the benefits.

24
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,120
I understand.

25
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,710
By the way,

26
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,509
how is the investigation on the masked man going?

27
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,479
The people we sent out

28
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,200
have scoured the entire capital

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,560
following the characteristics described by you,

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,350
but still haven't found him.

31
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,480
Those characteristics can't be wrong.

32
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,590
If we still can't find him,

33
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,800
it means

34
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,310
that person is deliberately hiding.

35
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,120
They say a gentleman is open and aboveboard,

36
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,080
but why this person

37
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,030
hide?

38
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,120
Why?

39
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,560
What if his identity is special

40
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,630
and he does not dare to show his true face?

41
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,320
My Lady, are you suggesting that

42
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,120
you have someone in mind?

43
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,150
My Lady?

44
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,560
Keep investigating.

45
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:41,940
Yes.

46
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,470
Your Highness.

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,480
How did it go?

48
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,310
Everything has been carried out according to your instructions.

49
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,880
The Third Prince has taken the bait,

50
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,030
and this time we can definitely kill two birds with one stone.

51
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,710
At most, this move

52
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,710
will remove Jiang Yunmo

53
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,640
from the succession list.

54
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,130
Jiang Yunhao

55
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,670
won't be abandoned by the Father Emperor

56
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,540
over such a small matter.

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,480
He wouldn't want to see

58
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,120
the pawn he has groomed

59
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,310
destroyed so easily.

60
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,430
Then...

61
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,710
Let's take it slow.

62
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,829
No need to rush.

63
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,079
Tell Jiang Qi to be careful as well.

64
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:36,870
Yes.

65
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,240
Wait.

66
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,970
Wait, go to Tianxiang House

67
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,310
and buy some almond cookies for the Crown Princess.

68
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:45,780
Yes.

69
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,430
My Crown Princess

70
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,100
is still more interesting.

71
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,720
This is the colorless and odorless substance

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,390
you wanted.

73
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,330
Take once every three days,

74
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,310
it makes one

75
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,120
appear increasingly healthy

76
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,280
and vigorous on the surface,

77
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,440
but in reality,

78
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,290
the toxin accumulates in the body.

79
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,950
It only takes three years

80
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,430
to die unknowingly,

81
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,570
as if falling asleep.

82
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,800
It's called "Ascension to Immortality"

83
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,440
Will it be detected

84
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,720
by the royal physician during routine health checks?

85
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,040
This is a secret drug from the previous dynasty.

86
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,750
If taken once every three days

87
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,090
in small doses,

88
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,740
it won't be detected.

89
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,420
In the next few days, I'll find an opportunity

90
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,360
to introduce you to the Crown Prince

91
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,630
to treat his legs and improve his health.

92
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,300
At your service, My Lady.

93
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,590
I'll take my leave.

94
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,600
My Lady,

95
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,440
the Crown Prince

96
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,190
has prepared

97
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,490
your favorite almond cookies for you.

98
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,870
Have some.

99
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,670
No,

100
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,280
you have them.

101
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,430
Jiang Yunsheng,

102
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,430
don't be too kind to me.

103
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,870
My Lady.

104
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,240
Su Zhu,

105
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,720
go and make preparations.

106
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,850
We have more important things

107
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,520
to do tonight.

108
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,920
Yes.

109
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,360
The weather is dry;

110
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,120
be careful with fire.

111
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,210
The weather is dry;

112
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,980
be careful with fire.

113
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,280
The weather is dry;

114
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,360
be careful with fire.

115
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,280
Give it to me quickly.

116
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:08,870
Give me one.

117
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,680
Give me one.

118
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,160
This is really the paper for this exam?

119
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,870
With this set of questions,

120
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,990
we're certain to achieve the top honor in the exam.

121
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:16,870
That's right.

122
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,320
Memorize it quickly.

123
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,600
Indeed, I have memorized it.

124
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,990
Great, the money was well spent.

125
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,990
It's really good.

126
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:36,860
How is it?

127
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:37,920
You weren't discovered, were you?

128
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,120
Guard Xue said that the Crown Prince

129
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,950
will be staying in the study

130
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,840
to review past exam papers for the spring imperial examination

131
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,950
and asked you not to wait for him

132
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,840
and to rest early.

133
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,430
Alright, got it.

134
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,620
You may leave now.

135
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,390
Yes.

136
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:55,950
Come out.

137
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,800
It's you again.

138
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,280
It seems

139
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,540
I have left an impression on the Crown Princess.

140
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:10,550
Even in black attire, you

141
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,230
look

142
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,070
so strikingly beautiful.

143
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,680
What exactly do you want,

144
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,600
teasing me time and time again?

145
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:20,920
I'm fond of you;

146
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,070
haven't you

147
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,710
noticed?

148
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,640
Such a rare drug as “Ascension to Immortality",

149
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,510
who do you intend to use it on?

150
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,909
-Is it for the Crown Prince?
-Give it back to me.

151
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,100
A cripple

152
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,390
like the Crown Prince,

153
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,030
it's truly a pity

154
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,040
for you to be married to him.

155
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,720
However,

156
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:46,409
there's no need to resort to "Ascension to Immortality".

157
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,390
Why not let me help you?

158
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:54,550
You say you want to help me,

159
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,880
but you always wear a mask

160
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,130
and never show your true face.

161
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,300
If you could remove the mask

162
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,580
and tell me your true identity,

163
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,600
then there might be a chance.

164
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,630
Now...

165
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,920
It's not the time yet,

166
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,280
but being able to accompany you

167
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,330
to the afterlife

168
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,950
would indeed be a beautiful thing.

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,320
You don't need to be so afraid of me.

170
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,790
We're in the same boat.

171
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,130
I truly want to help you.

172
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,420
I can't tell you

173
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:23,450
my identity now,

174
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,920
but I promise you that

175
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,920
within this Eastern Palace,

176
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,240
you will always be safe.

177
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,510
Do you work for the Crown Prince?

178
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,270
No,

179
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,630
I'm your man.

180
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,150
Crown Princess, rest early.

181
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,150
I'll come find you

182
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,240
another day.

183
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,040
Your Highness,

184
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,980
the Eldest Prince is truly too arrogant.

185
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,240
The questions for the spring imperial examination

186
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,390
should have been set by you,

187
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,480
but Guo Heng is trying to bypass you

188
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,510
and directly decide on the exam topics.

189
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,620
He simply

190
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,160
doesn't regard you at all.

191
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,440
He never

192
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,600
has.

193
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,120
In his eyes,

194
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,150
I'm just a living target.

195
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,720
Has he finalized the exam questions?

196
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:30,710
Yes.

197
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,480
These past few days, while you were said to be reviewing

198
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,320
past exam papers,

199
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,960
Guo Heng used the excuse of time constraints

200
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,720
to petition His Majesty

201
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,020
and preemptively decided on the draft exam questions.

202
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,960
It seems he really couldn't wait.

203
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,760
The Third Prince's people

204
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,190
were also egging him on.

205
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,290
He must be convinced that with my level of knowledge,

206
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,960
I couldn't possibly come up with the exam questions.

207
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,200
Fine,

208
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,870
then I'll just wait for Guo Heng

209
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,030
to deliver the questions to me.

210
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,750
Our people reported that

211
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,720
while investigating the Guo family,

212
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,460
they ran into another group.

213
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,750
It doesn't seem like

214
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,860
they're Jiang Yunhao's people.

215
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,270
My Lady,

216
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,080
Ding Er reported that

217
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,080
while investigating,

218
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,840
there was another team

219
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,440
also looking into the spring imperial examination matters.

220
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,390
Did you clash with them?

221
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,320
No, we didn't,

222
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:13,780
but

223
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,960
it seems they noticed us.

224
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,840
What do you think?

225
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:19,560
It's fine.

226
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,270
If you do clash, just say

227
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,440
you're Jiang Yunhao's men.

228
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,800
Tell Ding Er to be careful;

229
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,360
if he is discovered,

230
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,670
just use

231
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,600
Jiang Yunhao's name.

232
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,490
Yes.
