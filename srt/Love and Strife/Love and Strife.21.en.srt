[Love and Strife]

2
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,960
[Episode 21]

3
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,750
There's no need to trouble Lord Jiang.

4
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:01,880
Chuyun.

5
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,000
Don't worry.

6
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,780
I've already prepared the antidote.

7
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,840
I'll be fine.

8
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,750
On my way back,

9
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,170
I saw Jiang Yunhao.

10
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,710
His appearance at this time

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,560
must mean he has other plans.

12
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,640
Chuyun.

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,450
But with all the commotion

14
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,840
I've caused in the palace,

15
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,450
the fact that Consort Shu poisoned you

16
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:33,970
is now confirmed.

17
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,000
His Majesty has also punished her.

18
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
This way,

19
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,250
not only can

20
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,920
our revenge plan proceed smoothly,

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,140
but Jiang Yunhao

22
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,920
has also lost his support in the palace.

23
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:47,350
No matter what he's plotting upon his return,

24
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:50,450
the Eastern Palace should have countermeasures.

25
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,620
Chuyun,

26
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,260
I didn't mean to keep it from you.

27
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,570
I just wanted to make the act convincing.

28
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,420
I--

29
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,450
Your Highness,

30
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,570
you have your calculations,

31
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,570
and I have my own thoughts.

32
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,330
Our Xu family has always valued military discipline.

33
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,860
I know

34
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,610
that not everything

35
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,860
can be shared with a garrison commander.

36
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,290
But it's too risky

37
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,260
for a commander-in-chief

38
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,220
to put himself in danger.

39
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,110
I...

40
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,380
I'm very angry right now.

41
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:31,260
I don't want to say more.

42
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,220
You should get some rest.

43
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,350
Chuyun.

44
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,610
Chuyun,

45
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,980
I'm here to apologize to you.

46
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,680
I know why you're angry.

47
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,260
Besides

48
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:16,450
keeping it from you,

49
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,540
what you care more about

50
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,890
is that I didn't tell you about the plan.

51
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,660
Such a risky move,

52
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:30,010
♫Lighting a pair of red candles to shield the cold moonlight♫

53
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,880
I wanted to bear it alone.

54
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,540
I was afraid of involving you.

55
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:37,020
♫In the courtyard, intertwined crabapple blossoms stand together against the frost and wind♫

56
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,490
Jiang Yunsheng,

57
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,000
how sincere are you really towards me?

58
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:38,820
Or

59
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,370
♫But this time, falling for you is not a lie♫

60
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,940
do you see me in your heart

61
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,730
as someone who would abandon you in a pinch?

62
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,730
Of course I'm wholeheartedly devoted to you.

63
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:52,110
♫Yet I'm still in the game, so how could I dare proclaim?♫

64
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:47,570
It's just that I've been alone

65
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,079
in this palace full of deception

66
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,940
for too long.

67
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,290
To trust someone

68
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,370
♫Whose mask, whose labyrinth?♫

69
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,570
and trust with all my heart,

70
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:00,870
♫I bury my love and hate, just to share each dawn and dusk with you♫

71
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:01,000
I have to learn it all from the beginning.

72
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,510
♫I dare not long for you, so I can only hide my feelings♫

73
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,120
♫Within the shadow of a blade♫

74
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,790
What's wrong?

75
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,440
♫Whose springtime, whose soaring feather?♫

76
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,140
Didn't the poison of Bi Luo get cured?

77
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,870
♫I melt away my frozen walls, promising to be with you♫

78
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,370
I'm fine,

79
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:14,940
just feeling a bit weak.

80
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,579
♫Looking back, I see this love was a stratagem♫

81
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,019
Jiang Yunsheng,

82
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:18,930
you need to learn

83
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:24,710
♫Yet you have been by my side all along♫

84
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,220
not just how to love someone,

85
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,220
but more importantly,

86
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,250
to take care of yourself

87
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,660
for people who love you.

88
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,810
Since you were poisoned,

89
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,490
I've only known one thing for sure.

90
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,370
♫Through the mist, the light ahead grows ever clearer♫

91
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,290
That is,

92
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,780
I can't live without you.

93
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:50,540
♫And all along, you have been the truth I've been searching for♫

94
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,370
I can't watch you

95
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,690
die in front of me.

96
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,170
I'm willing to do it

97
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,130
for you

98
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,460
even it's the most dangerous challenge.

99
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:55,720
♫Whose mask, whose labyrinth?♫

100
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,220
♫I bury my love and hate, just to share each dawn and dusk with you♫

101
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,860
♫I dare not long for you, so I can only hide my feelings♫

102
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,050
Chuyun,

103
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,550
I understand.

104
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,470
♫Within the shadow of a blade♫

105
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,810
I promise you

106
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:09,790
♫Whose springtime, whose soaring feather?♫

107
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,420
from now on,

108
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,730
I will never put myself in danger again.

109
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:13,220
♫I melt away my frozen walls, promising to be with you♫

110
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,930
♫Looking back, I see this love was a stratagem♫

111
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:23,060
♫Yet you have been by my side all along♫

112
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,290
How dare you come to me?

113
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,130
Aren't you afraid I'll send you to the Court of Judicial Review?

114
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,810
Third Princess Consort.

115
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,930
I've come to ask for your help.

116
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,920
Ask me for help?

117
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,590
Third Princess Consort,

118
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:50,220
are you joking?

119
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,460
I know

120
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,260
I've harmed you many times in the past.

121
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,340
It's understandable that you hold a grudge against me.

122
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,980
But today I've come

123
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,490
to sincerely ask for your help.

124
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,610
Crown Princess, please

125
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,050
spare me and the Shen family.

126
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,460
Go on.

127
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,910
The Third Prince is no longer in his residence.

128
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,810
He has secretly gathered a large force.

129
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:26,900
In these two days,

130
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,980
he will find an opportunity to enter the palace

131
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,810
to force the Emperor's hand.

132
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,780
The Third Prince

133
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,930
is planning to usurp the throne?

134
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,880
Yes.

135
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,930
So why are you telling me this?

136
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,730
If he succeeds,

137
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,780
wouldn't you be the Empress?

138
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,020
It's true that I want to be the Empress,

139
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,460
but I don't need to

140
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,290
risk the lives of my entire family

141
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,730
to gamble on his success.

142
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,220
Not to mention that the Crown Prince is now powerful,

143
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,870
the military command token you hold

144
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,370
isn't just for show.

145
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,420
The Third Prince has no chance of winning.

146
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,580
I just want to save my life and protect my family.

147
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,690
Well, then I'll believe you

148
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,130
this once.

149
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,720
Xu Chuyun!

150
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,980
Why are you so lucky?

151
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,810
Your entire Xu family is dead.

152
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,490
Why can you still

153
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,930
sit in the position of Crown Princess?

154
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,780
Why do you get to live better than me?

155
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:50,100
It's truly sickening.

156
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,420
Shen Yuanyuan,

157
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,540
didn't you

158
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,050
choose your own path?

159
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,540
I think what Shen Yuanyuan said

160
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,690
is mostly true.

161
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,130
When I came back from the palace today,

162
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,870
I saw Jiang Yunhao on the way.

163
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,830
The streets were too crowded.

164
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,810
I thought I saw it wrong.

165
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,600
Jiang Yunhao has been planning for years.

166
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,380
Just in terms of money alone,

167
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,679
he must have amassed quite a lot.

168
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,770
Using it to recruit soldiers and buy horses,

169
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,730
and to recruit advisors,

170
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,490
should be enough.

171
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,940
Then what should we do?

172
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,730
Although I hold the Xu family's command token,

173
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,870
the 400,000 border troops

174
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,250
can't be mobilized immediately.

175
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,200
Some of the city's imperial guards

176
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,340
are old subordinates of the Xu family,

177
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,700
and perhaps I can

178
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,410
call a few of them into action.

179
00:08:59,010 --> 00:08:59,730
Xue Ping,

180
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,410
have Jiang Qi prepare as well.

181
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,980
Order people to be stationed at the residences of important court officials,

182
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,890
awaiting orders.

183
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,280
I'm

184
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,270
going to the palace.

185
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,410
Yes.

186
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:10,770
Wait.

187
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,730
Are you planning to go alone?

188
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,550
Yes.

189
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:18,860
Regardless of whether Jiang Yunhao is plotting a rebellion,

190
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,650
the fact that I was poisoned alone

191
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,080
is reason enough to see His Majesty.

192
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,130
I'll accompany you to the palace.

193
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,250
You stay outside the palace.

194
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:28,160
If Jiang Yunhao

195
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,160
really intends to rebel,

196
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,570
you'll hold the command token

197
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,700
and lead the troops to surround the palace.

198
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:32,990
Understand?

199
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:37,530
Su Zhu.

200
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:40,990
My Lady.

201
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,830
You heard what His Highness said.

202
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,550
Take the command token for me

203
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,760
and lead troops to surround the palace.

204
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,700
Yes.

205
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,130
I'll go into the palace with you.

206
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,060
Chuyun,

207
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,670
this is no small matter.

208
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,700
Are you going to leave me alone?

209
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,460
Alright.

210
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,620
You can come with me to the palace.

211
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,100
That direction

212
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,220
is towards the Hualian Palace.

213
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,560
Let's go take a look.

214
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,300
Third Brother,

215
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,220
what are you doing here?

216
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,500
Shouldn't you be under house confinement?

217
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,550
Jiang Yunsheng,

218
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,810
you're the one who killed my mother.

219
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,300
I want you dead.

220
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,610
Consort Shu is dead?

221
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,510
Yunxiu,

222
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,590
tell us.

223
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,960
Your Highnesses,

224
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,610
after Consort Shu suddenly fell gravely ill,

225
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,060
His Majesty granted mercy

226
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,040
and allowed the Third Prince

227
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,220
to come and see her one last time.

228
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,630
If that's true,

229
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,250
then that's really...

230
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,370
satisfying.

231
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,010
You bastard!

232
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,800
Say that again!

233
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:23,700
Let go of me!

234
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,680
Jiang Yunsheng!

235
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,980
I want you dead.

236
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:27,820
-I'll tear you to pieces!
-Let's go.

237
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,680
Let go of me!

238
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,100
We still need to go

239
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,250
thank His Majesty for bestowing medicine.

240
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:32,940
Jiang Yunsheng!

241
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,360
I'll tear you to pieces!

242
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,490
Go away!

243
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,300
Father.

244
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,820
Where is Father?

245
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,100
Father!

246
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,450
Guards!
