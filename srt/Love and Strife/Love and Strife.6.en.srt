00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,030
Do you think

4
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,730
I would believe your—

5
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:16,789
Real culprit.

6
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,400
If you dare move again,

7
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,280
I don't mind dying together with you.

8
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,039
My promise still stands.

9
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,760
Crown Princess, you can take your time to consider.

10
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:27,680
Get out!

11
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,470
The news from the Eastern Palace

12
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,840
these days all say that

13
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,920
the Crown Prince and Crown Princess get along well,

14
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:36,979
and they're in perfect harmony.

15
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,870
The Crown Prince even prepared

16
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,280
a music room for the Crown Princess.

17
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,840
The Crown Princess

18
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,870
makes nourishing soups for the Crown Prince every day.

19
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,810
Your Highness,

20
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,160
anger harms the body.

21
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,410
How could I not be angry

22
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:07,950
when that loser

23
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,520
easily took control of

24
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,080
the 400,000 Xu's Army?

25
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,430
Your Highness,

26
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,870
there's an old saying among the common folk

27
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,360
that goes,

28
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,240
"Money in a money box

29
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,680
makes noise

30
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,780
but can't be spent—

31
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,870
it's the same as not having it at all."

32
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,960
That's quite interesting.

33
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,710
Tell me more.

34
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,079
The Crown Prince is a loser.

35
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,750
Even if Xu Chuyun

36
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,590
has a bit of cleverness,

37
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,310
holding military power but being unable to use it

38
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:47,400
is the same as not having it at all.

39
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,190
Moreover, you're destinied to be king.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,360
Once you rise to power,

41
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,510
the whole world will be in your grasp.

42
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,400
What's a mere Xu's Army

43
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,930
compared to that?

44
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,800
To hold the power of the world while awake,

45
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,470
and to lie in the arms of a beauty while drunk—

46
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,710
with you by my side,

47
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,910
my wish

48
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,360
has already been half fulfilled.

[Eastern Palace]

50
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:44,870
Your Highness,

51
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,470
have some tea to calm down.

52
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,150
Darling, have some soup.

53
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,310
Honey, that's so thoughtful of you.

54
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,250
I'm truly touched.

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,890
I've tried a new recipe for this soup.

56
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,750
Please try it

57
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,070
and see if it suits your taste.

58
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,560
Honey,

59
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,920
it breaks my heart to see you

60
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,500
doing all this cooking every day.

61
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,600
As long as you're healthy,

62
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,510
I'm willing to do anything.

63
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,720
How did you get injured here?

64
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,190
I bumped into a teacup when I woke up this morning.

65
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,070
Nothing serious.

66
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,480
Honey, since you came to the Eastern Palace,

67
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,600
you haven't gone out for a stroll.

68
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,680
The imperial examination is coming up soon.

69
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,830
The capital is very lively.

70
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,950
Why don't we go out for a walk?

71
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,770
It's up to you.

72
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:57,800
Alright.

73
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,670
Honey, go get changed now.

74
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,600
Darling.

75
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,800
Please finish your soup

76
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,680
before we go out.

77
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,510
Alright.

78
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,159
The prosperity of the capital

79
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,480
is always delightful to see,

80
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,070
no matter how many times I visit.

81
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,070
If you enjoy it,

82
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,830
we can come out more often in the future.

83
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,240
It's just that every time I see

84
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,430
these prosperous scenes,

85
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,390
I'm reminded of the desolation at the border.

86
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,430
Darling, as you know,

87
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,480
I grew up in a small place

88
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,720
at the border.

89
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,600
Life there seems to be

90
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,120
just about surviving.

91
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,480
Aren't there any markets to visit?

92
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,630
The foreign merchants there

93
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,480
are different from the peaceful scenes

94
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,560
of the capital.

95
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,510
Are you homesick?

96
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,800
I'm the only one left in the Xu family.

97
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,590
I don't have a home anymore.

98
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,410
We are husband and wife now.

99
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,120
The Eastern Palace is your home.

100
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,680
You're right.

101
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,000
One day,

102
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,360
I'll take you back to the border.

103
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,070
Don't be afraid.

104
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,310
I'll be with you.

105
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,600
What exam papers?

106
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,730
Don't make false accusations.

107
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,240
Mr. Zhang, if you're willing to share,

108
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:56,630
I could even

109
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,430
cover half the cost.

110
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,430
Come with me.

111
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,980
Darling, I'll go take a look ahead.

112
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,490
Wherever you want to go,

113
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,680
I'll follow you.

114
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,070
Su Zhu.

115
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,310
Come and take a look.

116
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,190
Follow them and find out

117
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:20,970
what's going on.

118
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,630
Have Ding Er send someone to check

119
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,510
what's happening.

120
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:32,640
Yes.

121
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,720
Floral umbrellas. Come see the floral umbrellas!

122
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,920
Come on. Fresh steamed buns!

123
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,600
As Your Highness instructed,

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,310
we've disrupted the Guo family's plans.

125
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,040
Now half of the candidates

126
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,360
know that this year's imperial examination questions

127
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,360
are being sold.

128
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,800
My eldest brother

129
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,600
is such a fool.

130
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,660
He didn't inherit a bit of his maternal

131
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,720
grandfather's shrewdness.

132
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,830
He's quite stupid.

133
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,360
Except for Guo Daru, not any other one

134
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,870
in the Guo family noticed anything wrong.

135
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
Yes, Your Highness.

136
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,680
The last two times the Guo family cheated in the imperial exams,

137
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,160
you managed to suppress it.

138
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,270
They thought they were

139
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,720
perfect in their schemes,

140
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,920
which is why they're acting so boldly this year,

141
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,890
trying to make a big profit.

142
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,000
Let our people

143
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,360
encourage Guo Heng more

144
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,480
and get him

145
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,950
to be the chief examiner sooner.

146
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:29,950
This way,

147
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,110
they won't be able to

148
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,150
escape blame.

149
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,950
Remember, the bigger the scandal, the better.

150
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,650
The bigger the scandal,

151
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,760
the harder my eldest brother

152
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,909
will fall.

153
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:44,960
Yes.

154
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,370
[Eastern Palace]

155
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,550
Just as Your Highness predicted,

156
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,600
someone is indeed

157
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,150
selling the imperial examination questions,

158
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,270
and quite a few people are buying them.

159
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,840
However, the network of those sellers

160
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,870
is complex and intertwined,

161
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,480
and we can't trace the source yet.

162
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,240
Even the imperial examination's chief examiner

163
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,200
hasn't been determined yet.

164
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,510
Where did they get the questions to sell?

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,360
I've found out.

166
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,120
It's a pre-sale.

167
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,150
They collect money from the candidates first,

168
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,930
and once the chief examiner is confirmed,

169
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,390
they get the questions

170
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,750
from him and sell them.

171
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,480
I can't believe they can do this.

172
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:16,130
Your Highness, they are too bold.

173
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,080
It seems their people

174
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:19,270
can already

175
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,100
manipulate the selection of the chief examiner.

176
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,510
You mean the Guo family?

177
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,000
Not just them.

178
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,080
The Guo family is not

179
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,390
doing this for the first time.

180
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,200
They must be very cautious.

181
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,870
But why is the scandal

182
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,080
spreading on the streets

183
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,000
this time?

184
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,360
Keep a close eye on

185
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,600
Jiang Yunmo and Jiang Yunhao.

186
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,840
They're

187
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,600
both involved in this.

188
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:45,910
Yes.

189
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,870
Why would the Crown Prince suddenly

190
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:55,480
submit a petition to your father,

191
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,360
stating that you're already married

192
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,240
and requesting that you participate in court discussions?

193
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,480
He's even dragged you into

194
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,750
the troublesome imperial examination case.

195
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,390
Useless fool.

196
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,670
He's desperate and clutching at straws.

197
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,720
Yunhao,

198
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,240
your father has always valued you.

199
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,600
But you must understand,

200
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,280
those in high positions

201
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,320
should keep their emotions in check.

202
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,000
Your impatience

203
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:26,440
might give others

204
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,510
a chance to scheme against you.

205
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,750
Mother, please don't worry.

206
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,920
I've already married Minister Shen's daughter.

207
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,960
The important officials in the court

208
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,040
will natually know what to do.

209
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:40,090
Jiang Yunsheng wants to drag me down,

210
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,480
but he should be careful not to drown himself.

211
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,910
Now,

212
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,310
the Crown Prince has become useless.

213
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,630
Even if he marries Xu Chuyun,

214
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,720
what difference does it make?

215
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,510
Will he even

216
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,200
live to ascend the throne?

217
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,550
Instead of competing with him over this,

218
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,830
it's more important to

219
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,480
get rid of the eldest prince first.

220
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:11,790
Ding Er reported

221
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,840
that there's a big network in the capital,

222
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,000
collecting money

223
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,630
from candidates

224
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,840
to reserve this year's exam papers.

225
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,180
Reserve exam papers?

226
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
What's the point

227
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:22,320
of the imperial examination then?

228
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,270
Ding Er said

229
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,630
those who contact the candidates

230
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,050
are all low-level hooligans,

231
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,750
and they're not serious in their work.

232
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,480
Now almost half of the candidates

233
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,720
know about it.

234
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,510
Letting low-level hooligans sell exam questions—

235
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,120
who came up with

236
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,530
such a stupid idea?

237
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,960
It is indeed very stupid.

238
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,150
But Ding Er investigated and found

239
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,440
that their network

240
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,390
is so complicated

241
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:43,480
that it's hard to

242
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
trace the source for now.

243
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,320
Even exam questions can be pre-sold.

244
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:49,120
Cheating in the imperial examination

245
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,750
has reached a new level.

246
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,870
I suppose the imperial court

247
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,310
has become a total mess.

248
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,790
Well,

249
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,550
this situation is actually in my favor.

250
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,510
Tell Ding Er to keep a close eye on it.

251
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:04,200
No matter who's behind this,

252
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,670
as long as they don't interfere with

253
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,790
my plans,

254
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,000
I don't care if they're turning on each other.

255
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,000
It would be even better if a few more

256
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,360
princes get involved.

257
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,030
Yes.
