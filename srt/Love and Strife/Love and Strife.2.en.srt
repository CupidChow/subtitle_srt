00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,940
[Episode 2]

3
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,840
Not just that, right?

4
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,430
Your Highness,

5
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,590
your leg...

6
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,510
Your Highness, please spare my life!

7
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,310
I really don't know!

8
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,000
Is this how Consort Shu

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,789
taught you?

10
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,430
As expected,

11
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:21,560
your true master is the Shu family.

12
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:25,789
Get every word

13
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:27,000
out of him.

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,039
Okay, Your Highness.

15
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,050
Find someone to impersonate him

16
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,620
and send him back to my eldest brother.

17
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:39,090
I still have use for him.

18
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,789
He has no power or influence—

19
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,840
a Crown Prince in name only.

20
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,150
Marrying such a cowardly, incompetent Crown Prince

21
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,680
who is also physically impaired

22
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:52,310
works to my advantage.

23
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,660
The dragon pattern on that Black Armor Guard's mask

24
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,430
is identical to the one on the Crown Prince's robe.

25
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,680
How could such a useless person

26
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,350
have dared to target the Xu family?

27
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,310
After that day,

28
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,120
I investigated

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,000
as you instructed.

30
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,400
The princes in the palace

31
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,640
all have similar patterns.

32
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:08,870
I think

33
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,400
either this person is hiding very well,

34
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:11,960
or someone did it

35
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,080
in his name,

36
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,680
trying to frame him.

37
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,310
Revenge is my only purpose

38
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,920
in marrying into the Eastern Palace.

39
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,870
Whether he was framed

40
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,630
or is the real culprit,

41
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,630
I will drag out

42
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,400
those who have harmed the Xu family

43
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,960
one by one and make them

44
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,750
pay with their lives.

45
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,470
Father,

46
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,079
the Crown Prince's sudden appearance that day

47
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,240
was truly just an accident.

48
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,430
Whether it was an accident or not,

49
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,520
the mistake has already been made,

50
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,840
and His Majesty had no choice but to grant the marriage.

51
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,910
[Shen Yuanyuan, Daughter of the Left Prime Minister]

52
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:44,100
It was Consort Shu who immediately begged him for favor,

53
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,360
which is why you were granted marriage to the Third Prince.

54
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,870
Please rest assured, Father.

55
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,190
After I get married,

56
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,630
I will do my utmost

57
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,680
to plan for you and the Third Prince.

58
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,630
This is outrageous!

59
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,070
These sycophants

60
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,700
skipped the Eastern Palace's wedding banquet

61
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:00,660
and went to the Third Prince's Mansion.

62
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,550
I've already told you

63
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,870
that this younger brother of mine

64
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,050
wouldn't sit idly by.

65
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,720
He wants to compete for the throne,

66
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,440
so he won't be content to remain beneath me.

67
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,090
And this is just my third brother.

68
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,960
It's such a good opportunity.

69
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,450
Wouldn't my eldest brother

70
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,940
make a move as well?

71
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,030
Who are you?

72
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,800
Don't come any closer!

73
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,590
Or I'll kill you.

74
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,630
Is this how you treat

75
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,590
your lifesaver?

76
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,180
I'd rather not have a lifesaver

77
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,260
who hides in the shadows.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,750
Little leopard, your claws are quite sharp.

79
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,030
However,

80
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,870
it's not enough.

81
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,240
Who are you?

82
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,120
What do you want?

83
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,000
You'll find out who I am.

84
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,030
As for what I want...

85
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,430
Shameless!

86
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,390
Today, I'll just collect some interest.

87
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:31,540
In the future,

88
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,350
we'll have plenty of time to be with each other.

89
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,870
My Lady, are you alright?

90
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:43,950
I'm fine.

91
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,830
I arrived too late to protect you.

92
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,310
Your Highness, please forgive me.

93
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,600
How could there be an assassin

94
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,630
on the Crown Princess' wedding day?

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,920
If I hadn't learned a few moves

96
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,720
from the Xu family's martial arts,

97
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,560
our lady would have been harmed.

98
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,480
Crown Princess, please rest assured.

99
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,000
The mansion's security has been strengthened.

100
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:04,680
Guard Xue, is the Crown Prince safe?

101
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,560
The Crown Prince?

102
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,160
The Crown Prince is unharmed.

103
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,160
Your Highness, please don't worry.

104
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,160
Please wait a moment,

105
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,060
and the Crown Prince will be here shortly.

106
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,240
I thought she was just

107
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,630
a little cat with sharp claws,

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,120
but I didn't expect her

109
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,690
to be a newly grown leopard.

110
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,530
There were six of them in total,

111
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:28,600
and one was captured alive.

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,310
He has already confessed that they were sent

113
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,190
by the Eldest Prince.

114
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,680
Their plan was to make it seem as if the Crown Princess,

115
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,750
who resents the royal family,

116
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,300
turned the bridal chamber into a bloodbath,

117
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,100
stabbed you through,

118
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,720
and then killed herself to avoid punishment.

119
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,600
It seems my eldest brother

120
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,040
can no longer hold back,

121
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,240
sending me such a generous gift.

122
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:50,830
My Lady,

123
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,850
the Crown Prince has arrived.

124
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:08,720
My...

125
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,240
You are no longer needed here.

126
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,300
You may all leave.

127
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,560
Miss Su Zhu,

128
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,230
let's go.

129
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,870
I'm sorry you had to marry me.

130
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,920
Tonight

131
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,640
has thrown everyone into a state of panic.

132
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,370
I'm sorry you were frightened.

133
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,080
Seeing you safe and sound,

134
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,830
I'm relieved.

135
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,310
Do you need me to help you move?

136
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,000
Come on.

137
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,800
Four years ago,

138
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,870
-Father Emperor sought out the best physicians for me.
-Be careful.

139
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,870
But there was no improvement.

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,750
By now,

141
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,040
I no longer hold out hope.

142
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,040
I just feel that

143
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,680
having a girl as remarkable as you

144
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,430
marry me

145
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,430
is truly unfair to you.

146
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,260
You are so considerate.

147
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,760
I don't even know

148
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,830
how to respond.

149
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,870
What is this?

150
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,870
It's just a medicine to aid pregnancy.

151
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,510
Even if it's discovered,

152
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,680
it doesn't matter.

153
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,000
As a useless Crown Prince,

154
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,240
this is his greatest function.

155
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,540
Once I'm pregnant with his child

156
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,360
and secure control over the Eastern Palace,

157
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,400
he'll be nothing

158
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,030
more than a discarded piece in my game.

159
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,190
Ever since the incident in my family,

160
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,270
I've been having trouble sleeping at night.

161
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,750
Now that I'm married to you,

162
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,510
I fear I might disturb your sleep.

163
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,510
That's why I had the doctor prescribe some...

164
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,480
sleeping medicine.

165
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,720
Don't cry.

166
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,870
On such a joyous day, you mustn't cry.

167
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,430
Drink this wedding wine,

168
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,750
and we

169
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,150
will be husband and wife

170
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,730
who will face the rest of our lives together.

171
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,870
Whatever happens,

172
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:37,720
I, your husband, will face it with you.

173
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,010
My dear, are you drunk?

174
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,150
No.

175
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,880
It was just one cup.

176
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,630
How could I be drunk?

177
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,390
How could it be One Sip to Drunkenness?

178
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,190
What One Sip to Drunkenness?

179
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,480
How could one sip

180
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,360
make me drunk?

181
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,070
Miss Su Zhu,

182
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,150
please get some rest.

183
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,650
I'll keep watch here.

184
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,770
Mr. Xue, how could I let you keep watch alone?

185
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,570
♫The dazzling lights look like snow falling on my shoulders♫

186
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,890
As the personal maid of the Crown Princess,

187
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,550
how could I leave without permission?

188
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:52,180
♫Which line of poetry did it awaken, gazing at each other from afar with you?♫

189
00:09:54,020 --> 00:10:00,130
♫In the clouds, shadows flicker. Is it the faint glow of your lips♫

190
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:07,590
♫Or the rusted moon hidden deep within your heart?♫

191
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:14,340
♫The past still lingers in my eyes, refusing to fade♫

192
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,630
My dear, are you still awake?

193
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:21,460
♫When I bring love into the game, what does it matter to whom I confess my feelings?♫

194
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,890
I... I'm fine.

195
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:29,070
♫Countless tests, countless unspoken words♫

196
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:36,600
♫Concealing the longing I should express most openly♫

197
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,790
Don't force yourself.

198
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,390
Here with me,

199
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:36,890
you can always sleep peacefully.

200
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:43,070
♫When concealed hatred is locked away in royal halls♫

201
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,120
My great revenge is not yet fulfilled.

202
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,580
How can I feel at peace?

203
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:50,060
♫Only then can true love be returned to these rugged years♫

204
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:57,900
♫How could a mask hide the starlight in your eyes?♫

205
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,480
That day will come.

206
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:03,810
♫Playing the game of love, losing matters not at all♫
