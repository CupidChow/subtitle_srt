[Episode 16]

3
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,140
Be careful.

4
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,560
I'm fine.

5
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,350
Do you think

6
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,310
the underground bank he took us to

7
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,340
is the one we're looking for?

8
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,870
Most likely.

9
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:18,750
After all, with three million taels of official silver

10
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,620
to offload quickly,

11
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:20,750
anyone

12
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:22,990
looking for people to collect debts now

13
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,880
is a target of our suspicion.

14
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,640
Your Highness, you look truly

15
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,370
pitiable in that dress.

16
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,039
This is a one-time thing.

17
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:43,240
It won't happen again.

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,160
Alright.

19
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,270
What are you staring at?

20
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,960
Come with me now.

21
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,280
Okay.

22
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,380
These two young ladies are in urgent need of money.

23
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,910
Manager,

24
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,560
these two young ladies

25
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,620
need money urgently.

26
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,200
You two want to borrow money.

27
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,130
How much do you need?

28
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,250
What for?

29
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,120
To pay for medical treatment for my family.

30
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,280
Just 10 taels.

31
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,270
Is it okay to borrow 10 taels?

32
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,610
10 taels?

33
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,140
What collateral do you have?

34
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,660
We have a land deed.

35
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,980
[Land deed]

36
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,370
Okay.

37
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,720
But let me be clear upfront.

38
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,230
If you can't repay on time,

39
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,140
this land deed

40
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,800
will become ours.

41
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,120
I understand.

42
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,630
We know the rules.

43
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,750
Since you need it urgently,

44
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,190
the interest rate

45
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:30,890
is quite high.

46
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,820
If you can't pay it back...

47
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:37,710
As long as it solves

48
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,230
our urgent problem now,

49
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,400
anything is fine.

50
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:42,900
Good.

51
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,040
I'll write you a receipt right away.

52
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,520
Why are you just standing there?

53
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:47,870
Get some water

54
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,590
for these two young ladies.

55
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,470
This way.

56
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,730
Such an idiot.

57
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,880
This way.

58
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,140
Please

59
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,430
enjoy it.

60
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,760
Let me go! Let me go!

61
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:11,680
Let me go!

62
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,060
Let me go! Let me go!

63
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,370
I'm begging you!

64
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,350
Manager,

65
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,510
please give me back my land.

66
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,279
My entire family rely on it for living.

67
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,040
Give me some more time.

68
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,310
I will definitely repay the money.

69
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:25,330
Get out!

70
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,870
You've already delayed for so long.

71
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:27,570
You still want more time?

72
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,610
No way!

73
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,600
Manager,

74
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,290
please give me a few more days.

75
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,620
If my family loses the land,

76
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,560
how will we survive?

77
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,800
You can't let our entire family

78
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,040
be ruined.

79
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:37,720
Manager,

80
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,070
I'm begging you.

81
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,040
Let go of me!

82
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,790
Are you looking to die?

83
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,610
Throw him out!

84
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,230
Manager!

85
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:44,990
-Go. 
-Yes.

86
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:45,350
Go.

87
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,300
Manager!

88
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,580
What bad luck.

89
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,350
Here's the money

90
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:58,170
and the receipt.

91
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,060
Alright.

92
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:00,770
You can go now.

93
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,000
A bunch of paupers.

94
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:20,950
Chuyun,

95
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,630
are you alright?

96
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,150
I'm fine. Where are you?

97
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:23,780
Over here.

98
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,110
Over there.

99
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,530
-Sir!
-Sir!

100
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,160
-Sir!
-Sir!

101
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,460
I can't live like this. I'd rather die.

102
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,390
Sir,

103
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,290
are you alright?

104
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,230
Why did you save me?

105
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,250
Why?

106
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,180
Just let me die!

107
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,160
Don't talk about dying.

108
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,640
What's troubling you so much?

109
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,620
Isn't it because you have no money

110
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,110
that your family is falling apart?

111
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,560
Answer me a few questions,

112
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,730
and we'll give you money.

113
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,860
You'll give me money?

114
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:34,770
Here.

115
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,750
Take it.

116
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,890
Finally, I have money.

117
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,040
My child won't starve to death.

118
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,020
I can buy food for my child now.

119
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,290
Thank you.

120
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:50,780
No need.

121
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
Please get up.

122
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,970
Sir,

123
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,700
what exactly happened?

124
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,110
Well,

125
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,340
it's a long story.

126
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,800
A few days ago,

127
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,420
I got sick

128
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,160
and didn't see a doctor.

129
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:12,690
I didn't expect

130
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,720
the illness to hit so hard.

131
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,000
It costs a lot to see a doctor,

132
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,120
and we didn't have enough money.

133
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:23,380
My wife

134
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,880
had no choice

135
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,660
but to borrow money

136
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,790
from the moneylender to treat me.

137
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,880
So, sir, are you better now?

138
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,090
Yes.

139
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:35,880
As soon as I got better,

140
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,450
I started working,

141
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,260
saving money

142
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,230
to pay back the debt.

143
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:41,310
But who would have thought,

144
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:43,450
we agreed on 3% interest,

145
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,460
but when I went to repay,

146
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,659
they told me

147
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,370
it was 3% interest per month,

148
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:49,570
and the next month,

149
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,430
they'd add the previous month's total

150
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,690
plus another 3% interest.

151
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,240
In the blink of an eye,

152
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,800
several months had passed.

153
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:58,890
I ended up owing them

154
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,620
16 taels in interest alone!

155
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,330
The money I owed them

156
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,920
was just too much.

157
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,570
I couldn't possibly repay it.

158
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,210
Later,

159
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,570
they took my house,

160
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,250
my land,

161
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,240
everything.

162
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:12,850
My whole family

163
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,670
could only live in a dilapidated temple.

164
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,900
But that wasn't the end of it.

165
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,210
They still came after me for interest.

166
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:20,540
Tell me,

167
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,930
how are we supposed to live?

168
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,700
My child is starving.

169
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,930
This underground bank

170
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,630
truly live up to their notorious reputation.

171
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,440
Just for that small amount of money,

172
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,419
they can compound interest

173
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,240
to such an extent.

174
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,549
How can the people they've deceived

175
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:38,000
possibly survive?

176
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,940
From what the farmer said,

177
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,450
his land and house

178
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,730
have already been taken

179
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,299
by the underground bank.

180
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,100
They took them away.

181
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,450
But who could they sell them to?

182
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,900
Other farmers?

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,630
It was probably sold to the imperial court

184
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,650
as ownerless wasteland.

185
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,340
The underground bank

186
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,920
operates in such a way

187
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,020
that they leave no evidence,

188
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:57,550
yet they make several times the profit.

189
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:00,520
They lend the official silver

190
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:01,810
to the common people

191
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,300
and then collect

192
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,490
huge interest from them.

193
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,640
If the people can't repay,

194
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,690
they seize their land

195
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,300
and houses

196
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,540
then resell them to the imperial court,

197
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,660
earning another sum

198
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,780
from the court.

199
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,960
They've hollowed out the national treasury,

200
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,630
squeezed the common people,

201
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,200
only the mastermind's pockets have grown fat.

202
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,940
With such audacity

203
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,940
and power,

204
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:21,740
who could it be?

205
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:25,650
Jiang Yunhao?

206
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,990
You're clever.

207
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,120
So, how should

208
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,730
we find this place?

209
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,210
Follow me.

210
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,550
Here.

211
00:09:58,570 --> 00:09:59,300
Watch your step.

212
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,460
This should be the place.

213
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,450
We've already found

214
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,660
the real location of the official silver.

215
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,630
But now,

216
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,300
if we rashly raid

217
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,660
the underground bank,

218
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,890
I'm afraid we'll alert them.

219
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,390
Unfortunately, the fraud case

220
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,490
has already caused Jiang Yunhao heavy losses.

221
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,490
To catch him off guard again,

222
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,750
what we lack now

223
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,850
is the right timing and opportunity.

224
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,520
He will certainly be on guard against us.

225
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,140
No,

226
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,230
he's on guard against me.

227
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,450
The water temperature is just right.

228
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,460
Honey,

229
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,420
would you like to join me?

230
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:18,900
Darling, you've been

231
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,380
working so hard lately.

232
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,900
Since that's the case,

233
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,500
you should have some fun.

234
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,020
Alright.

235
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:36,930
Take your bath.

236
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,520
Call someone if you need more hot water.

237
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:01,450
♫Lighting a pair of red candles to shield the cold moonlight♫

238
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:08,640
♫In the courtyard, intertwined crabapple blossoms stand together against the frost and wind♫

239
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:15,710
♫But this time, falling for you is not a lie♫

240
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:23,450
♫Yet I'm still in the game, so how could I dare proclaim?♫

241
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,930
♫Whose mask, whose labyrinth?♫

242
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,450
♫I bury my love and hate, just to share each dawn and dusk with you♫

243
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,980
♫I dare not long for you, so I can only hide my feelings♫
