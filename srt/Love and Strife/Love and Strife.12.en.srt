[Love and Strife]

00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:55,900
[Episode 12]

3
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,240
[Notice]

4
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,110
I heard that

5
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,520
the Eldest Prince, in order to amass wealth,

6
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,920
teamed up with the Guo family to sell examination papers.

7
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,600
If it weren't for the Crown Prince's keen insight

8
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,600
and uncovering the truth,

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,230
who knows

10
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,640
how many corrupt officials would have emerged?

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,760
Indeed.

12
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,640
Even the examination papers were for sale.

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,870
Can you really expect these people

14
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:10,920
to do anything for the people?

15
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:11,510
Exactly.

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,560
His Majesty is really angry this time.

17
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,920
Not only did he strip

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,350
all the candidates involved from their official titles,

19
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,400
but he also decreed

20
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:18,950
that no member of their families for three generations

21
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,360
would be allowed to participate in the imperial examinations.

22
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,430
All the officials involved

23
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,430
were sentenced to death,

24
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,560
and their families

25
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,480
were exiled thousands of miles away.

26
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,150
With the Crown Prince,

27
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,470
who's devoted to the country and the people,

28
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,970
we'll have good days ahead.

29
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,360
Indeed.

30
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,350
Let's go, let's go.

31
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:35,920
We will have good days ahead.

32
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,150
Now, the Crown Prince

33
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,560
is rising to fame.

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,479
The Eldest Prince has been confined.

35
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,070
It seems he has lost his chance for the throne.

36
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,310
But why was the Third Prince

37
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,509
let off so lightly?

38
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,789
He even trafficked in official positions.

39
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:52,150
He was only fined three years of salary.

40
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,350
As long as Consort Shu remains in the Emperor's favor,

41
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,220
the Third Prince will be safe.

42
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,430
He was just trading official positions.

43
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,300
If this matter hadn't gotten so out of hand,

44
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,200
and if the Emperor hadn't been unable to cover it up,

45
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,230
even the Eldest Prince wouldn't have been in trouble.

46
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:07,860
Why?

47
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,310
My father said that

48
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,910
His Majesty

49
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,310
is particularly fond of cricket fighting.

50
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,750
The fiercer the crickets fight,

51
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,020
the more pleased he becomes.

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,910
Now, out of the blue,

53
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,470
he's lost one of his crickets.

54
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,140
How could he not be upset?

55
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,840
And in his eyes,

56
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,470
the Crown Prince

57
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,360
is now showing signs of revival.

58
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,450
Whether it's fortune or misfortune,

59
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,200
it's all up to fate.

60
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:43,910
[Eastern Palace]

61
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:49,110
Darling, you're back.

62
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:53,440
Thank you for taking care of things these days.

63
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,000
It can't compare to what you have done.

64
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,550
Have you been eating well these days?

65
00:02:59,090 --> 00:02:59,880
How about I

66
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,080
have the kitchen prepare

67
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,080
some nourishing dishes

68
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,470
and

69
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
tell Uncle Liu to come over later

70
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,360
to give you a massage?

71
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,390
These things don't matter.

72
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:10,560
Come.

73
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:14,100
Let me take a good look at you.

74
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,760
Have you missed me these past few days?

75
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,380
Honey?

76
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,750
Of course I've been thinking about you.

77
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,130
You're the most precious person

78
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,730
to me in this world.

79
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,280
And you're the one

80
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,960
I care about most

81
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,290
in this world, of course.

82
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,829
You must have been exhausted from the past few days.

83
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,430
I've already prepared

84
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,400
hot water and a soft couch.

85
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,930
After dinner,

86
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,080
you should get some rest early.

87
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,560
I'll go check on the kitchen again.

88
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,630
Alright.

89
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,630
You should get some rest too, Honey.

90
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,570
I'll come see you later.

91
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,310
My Lady, you've been

92
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:26,560
looking different lately.

93
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,990
How so?

94
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,320
You're much calmer.

95
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,510
Since the incident at home,

96
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,350
you've been tense.

97
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,000
Usually,

98
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,659
although you laugh and joke with others,

99
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,570
I can tell

100
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,000
that the anger in you

101
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,070
has never truly subsided.

102
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,600
But these days, you seem much calmer.

103
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,000
It hasn't subsided now either.

104
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,810
Until I get my revenge,

105
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:56,600
I won't be able to

106
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,630
calm down for even a moment.

107
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,430
But My Lady,

108
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,210
you've calmed down,

109
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,290
and that's a good thing.

110
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,720
Only when you're calm can you investigate everything thoroughly.

111
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:11,120
You're right.

112
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,000
Only when I'm calm

113
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,640
can I investigate everything thoroughly.

114
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,780
Your Highness.

115
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,810
Honey?

116
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,920
Why are you here?

117
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,560
Did I disturb you?

118
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,000
Not at all.

119
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,230
Please, sit down.

120
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,000
I've almost finished reading

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,190
all the books I brought here.

122
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,070
I want to find a few books

123
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:38,870
for leisure reading from your collection.

124
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,430
The second shelf on the left side of the bookshelf

125
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,990
has all kinds of travel logs.

126
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,360
Take a look

127
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,430
and see if there's anything you like.

128
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,270
In Eastern Palace,

129
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,920
there's nothing

130
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,980
you can't touch.

131
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,600
Have you found anything you like?

132
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,590
Did I startle you?

133
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,120
Not at all.

134
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,600
I was just too absorbed in my reading.

135
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,159
These annotations...

136
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,810
It's a habit I developed when my mother was alive.

137
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,710
Every time I copy books,

138
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,190
I write my thoughts

139
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,900
and reflections in the margins,

140
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:56,990
which

141
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,340
can help deepen my memory.

142
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,430
Darling, you're truly brilliant

143
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,270
and have really opened my eyes.

144
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,480
They're just some annotations.

145
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:13,760
How did they

146
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:16,210
surprise you?

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,750
My Lady,

148
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,950
are you saying

149
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,120
that the Crown Prince has never been

150
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,360
the good-for-nothing as rumored?

151
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,680
He could even find

152
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,070
governance strategies of small nations

153
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,070
in a travelogue

154
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,320
and analyze them.

155
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,750
How could such a person be a good-for-nothing?

156
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,380
But everyone says that,

157
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,080
due to the Crown Prince's poor health,

158
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,220
his studies are not profound.

159
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,000
Either everyone

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,360
has misunderstood him,

161
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,750
or he has been deliberately

162
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,920
hiding his true abilities.

163
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,040
If he's been hiding his true abilities,

164
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,390
then why is he not concealing them from me?

165
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,630
Be careful!

166
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,120
Isn't...

167
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,120
Isn't that the servant

168
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,920
who is responsible for cleaning the garden?

169
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,160
Why...

170
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,190
Su Zhu,

171
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,160
do you think

172
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,390
that the Eastern Palace we're seeing now

173
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,800
is its

174
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,830
true state?

175
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
How many secrets

176
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,870
are hidden in this palace?

177
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,170
It really is him.
