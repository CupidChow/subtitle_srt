[Episode 13]

3
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,510
Come out.

4
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,570
Xue Ping, clean it up.

5
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,490
Your Highness,

6
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:44,880
this is the fourth one this month.

7
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,160
Did the Crown Princess just come by?

8
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:09,889
Your Highness.

9
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,500
I originally wanted to take it step by step,

10
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,079
but it seems I've scared someone.

11
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,210
Where's Su Zhu?

12
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,840
I'm having a conversation with you,

13
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,780
so I had Xue Ping take her for some tea.

14
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,240
Jiang Yunsheng,

15
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,329
you're truly impressive;

16
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,470
I can't win against you.

17
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,329
Honey, it's not right.

18
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,530
When have I ever been against you?

19
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,970
Your body is perfectly fine,

20
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:13,070
and so are your legs.

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,630
You knew

22
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,960
I had already seen through it,

23
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,240
yet you still came to see me

24
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,750
in a wheelchair today.

25
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,690
Simply wearing a mask to toy with me

26
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,250
is no longer enough

27
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,790
for your amusement, is it?

28
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,710
The Eastern Palace may be under my control,

29
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:37,840
but

30
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,910
there are still lingering pieces on the board.

31
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,800
The play must go on.

32
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,770
I never intended to deceive you.

33
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,710
Never intended to deceive me?

34
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,030
Jiang Yunsheng,

35
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:48,150
do you enjoy watching me,

36
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,680
the orphan you wiped out my entire family,

37
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,360
struggle in vain?

38
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,840
Black Armor Guard?

39
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,240
I always wondered why

40
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,390
your hatred for me ran so deep.

41
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,890
You assassinated and poisoned...

42
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,409
So it was all because of

43
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,800
the dragon pattern on this mask.

44
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,550
What?

45
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,730
You admit it?

46
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,560
This dragon pattern belongs to me.

47
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,630
Just as I thought.

48
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:44,830
But I am not

49
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,830
the one who wiped out your Xu family.

50
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,120
The Xu family is completely wiped out,

51
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,620
so no matter what you say, you're right.

52
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,440
Jiang Yunsheng,

53
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,480
today, it's either you die

54
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,600
or I do.

55
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,350
Jiang Yunsheng, let go of me!

56
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,510
If you have the guts, just kill me.

57
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,200
Otherwise,

58
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,430
I won't stop until one of us is dead!

59
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,240
Honey,

60
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:15,750
what if I told you that

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,510
I'm not your

62
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,240
family's murderer,

63
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,070
but your savior?

64
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,840
Savior? That's bullshit!

65
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,310
You...

66
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,810
My mother's jade pendant…

67
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,010
Because I saved them.

68
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,870
♫The dazzling lights look like snow falling on my shoulders♫

69
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,409
I have

70
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,020
a letter written personally by your father.

71
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:53,480
♫Which line of poetry did it awaken, gazing at each other from afar with you?♫

72
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,420
♫In the clouds, shadows flicker. Is it the faint glow of your lips♫

73
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:08,880
♫Or the rusted moon hidden deep within your heart?♫

74
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,910
Stop crying.

75
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,630
♫The past still lingers in my eyes, refusing to fade♫

76
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,740
At that time, I

77
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,560
could only manage to

78
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
save a dozen members of your Xu family,

79
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,870
and I barely had time

80
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,040
to forge their deaths.

81
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,760
♫When I bring love into the game, what does it matter to whom I confess my feelings?♫

82
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,920
Are you blaming me?

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Don't touch me.

84
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:22,920
Liar.

85
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:30,370
♫Countless tests, countless unspoken words♫

86
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,070
Why are you still

87
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,240
sulking with me?

88
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:26,310
Haven't I

89
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,950
already proven it to you?

90
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,430
Your parents' token of love,

91
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,240
and the letter

92
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:37,900
♫Concealing the longing I should express most openly♫

93
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:30,950
your father personally wrote

94
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,720
to you.

95
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,190
That's a separate matter.

96
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,270
You've known all along

97
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,560
who the real culprit is,

98
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:44,360
♫When concealed hatred is locked away in royal halls♫

99
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,830
yet you've been deceiving me

100
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:40,870
ever since I arrived in the capital.

101
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,159
Did you find it amusing

102
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,680
to watch me go mad with grief?

103
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:51,360
♫Only then can true love be returned to these rugged years♫

104
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,750
I admit that

105
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,340
my approach was flawed.

106
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:59,200
♫How could a mask hide the starlight in your eyes?♫

107
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,000
But if I had told you everything from the start,

108
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,770
it would have raised suspicion

109
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,610
and exposed my intentions.

110
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,000
I did everything I could

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,120
to marry you into the Eastern Palace

112
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,330
just to protect you.

113
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:06,930
♫Love is a starlight in the wilderness♫

114
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,510
I never expected

115
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,270
you to find that mask

116
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,800
and misunderstand me.

117
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,480
No need to misunderstand?

118
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,480
You already look suspicious.

119
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,760
Wait.

120
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,090
You went to such lengths to marry me into the Eastern Palace?

121
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,290
So it wasn't my scheme that...

122
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,480
You...

123
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,720
If I hadn't played along,

124
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,630
Shen Yuanyuan's plan

125
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,630
wouldn't have succeeded either.

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,950
We're equally matched.

127
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,830
I want to see my parents.

128
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,630
Not now.

129
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,430
Your parents

130
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,310
and the rest of your family

131
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,310
have been placed somewhere safe.

132
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,560
My father has eyes and ears everywhere;

133
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,350
if he finds them,

134
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,630
he will surely have them killed.

135
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,600
Then… Then this letter…

136
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,420
could be a forgery too!

137
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,480
Even if I were all-powerful,

138
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,920
there's no way I could have known that

139
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
you fell into a dung pit

140
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,270
at the age of three while trying to steal bird eggs.

141
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,950
Stop talking.

142
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:08,720
I...

143
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll believe you for now.

144
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,020
But if you're lying to me,

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,480
I will definitely kill you.

146
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,660
We're in this together.

147
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:23,920
As a couple,

148
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,970
we must stand united, you know?

149
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,890
Who wants to stand united with you?

150
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,039
You don't have a choice.

151
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,570
You have to attend

152
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,950
the family banquet in the palace the day after tomorrow.

153
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,299
Don't slip up.

154
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,820
I'm excellent at

155
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,789
pretending.

156
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,480
Good.

157
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,190
Let's have a drink

158
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,200
with the children.

159
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,440
A toast to Father Emperor.

160
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,840
At the last family banquet,

161
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
the eldest was still here.

162
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,910
But now...

163
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,930
You'd all better not follow in his footsteps

164
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,000
and disgrace the royal family.

165
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,630
Yes.

166
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,960
I remember

167
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,610
it was your mother

168
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,330
who first suggested this family banquet.

169
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,630
Just our family,

170
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,920
setting aside old customs

171
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:32,820
and sitting down

172
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,120
for a simple meal

173
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,630
like common folk.

174
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,700
So many years have passed;

175
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,240
the banquet remains,

176
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,200
but your mother has been gone

177
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,670
for a long time.

178
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,960
Father Emperor, the departed cannot return,

179
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,420
and the past is beyond reach.

180
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,200
It's better to take care of yourself

181
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:55,320
and cherish those who are still here.

182
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

183
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,630
Now that Noble Consort is by your side,

184
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:03,110
we are all one family,

185
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,600
living in harmony

186
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
and unity.

187
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:08,480
Well said.

188
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,630
Well said.

189
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,160
Father Emperor,

190
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,440
I also raise a toast to you on behalf of Yunsheng.

191
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,510
Yunsheng is right;

192
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,740
festivals always bring memories of those we've lost

193
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,080
and make us cherish the good times of the past.

194
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,720
Yunsheng

195
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,910
is the bloodline left to you by the late Empress,

196
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,580
and Consort Shu

197
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,270
once served her

198
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,510
by her side.

199
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,910
They are both reminders that the late Empress left for you.

200
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,880
Father Emperor is right.

201
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:55,920
If only Mother were still alive,

202
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,510
how wonderful that would be.

203
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,660
I raise a toast to you.

204
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:08,460
Indeed.

205
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,380
If the late Empress could see this,

206
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:12,810
she wouldn't want

207
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,750
you or Sheng'er to be so sorrowful.

208
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,950
I think at the next family banquet,

209
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:21,370
we should add more members to the family.

210
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,580
My dear speaks wisely.

211
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,150
You two are already married;

212
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,790
do your best to grant me a royal grandson soon.

213
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,320
Got it.

214
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,430
Got it.

215
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:49,720
Shut up.

216
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,200
If you say one more word,

217
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,160
you won't be allowed in the palace anymore.

218
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,180
Drink slowly.

219
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,050
To the day I can finally hold my royal grandson,

220
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,470
let's drink another cup!

221
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,170
Come.

222
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,880
You're so rough;

223
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,960
you're hurting me!

224
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,560
Go away.

225
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,150
I'll be gentler.

226
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,750
I've been wanting to do this for a long time.

227
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,600
You can keep

228
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,720
pretending to be a cripple.

229
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,140
Go bring a bowl of bird's nest soup for your lady;

230
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:34,380
don't get in the way.

231
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,260
What do you plan to do next?

232
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,680
Honey, you're planning to help me?

233
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,870
The sooner I help you achieve your goal,

234
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,240
the sooner I can see

235
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,790
my parents and relatives.

236
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,600
Now that I've caught the attention of the court officials,

237
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,790
the Emperor

238
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,500
will choose to support me

239
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,080
to counterbalance Consort Shu

240
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,720
and Jiang Yunhao's power.

241
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,550
First,

242
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,840
I can no longer be

243
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,150
a crippled good-for-nothing.

244
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,710
It's time for me to stand up.

245
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,440
I can understand the Emperor showing no mercy

246
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,870
to outsiders,

247
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,000
but I don't get

248
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,520
why he'd treat you this way.

249
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,960
He keeps claiming

250
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,770
he still loves the late Empress.

251
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,320
The only person he loves is himself.

252
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,080
We princes

253
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,870
are not his sons,

254
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,290
but just pieces on his chessboard.

255
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,600
Everything

256
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,620
has to go exactly as he wants.

257
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:38,910
What a joke.

258
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:45,980
Everyone in the Jiang family is insane,

259
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,070
including me.

260
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,720
Are you afraid?

261
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,950
You think I'm not just as crazy?

262
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:00,060
If worst comes to worst, we'll go down together.
