00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,090
[Love and Strife]

2
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,960
[Episode 19]

3
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,660
By imperial decree.

4
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,600
The Third Prince and Third Princess Consort are

5
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,220
should reflect on your faults within your residence.

6
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,289
Do not forget His Majesty's grace.

7
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,130
Thank you, Father Emperor, for your mercy.

8
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:22,560
Seal the gates of the residence.

9
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,300
How could this be?

10
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,460
How could we be confined like this?

11
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:32,450
How is this possible?

12
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,330
Jiang Yunsheng.

13
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,170
We'll see about that.

14
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,160
How could His Majesty

15
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,320
treat me like this?

16
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,210
Your Highness,

17
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,759
if you cry any more, your eyes will be ruined.

18
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,890
It was just a small amount of money,

19
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,680
yet he treats Hao and me like this.

20
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,530
He's being too cruel.

21
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,759
Once His Majesty's anger subsides,

22
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,350
he will surely come to see you.

23
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,310
Yunxiu,

24
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,760
You think His Majesty

25
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,270
will definitely come for me.

26
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,140
Right?

27
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:17,960
He will surely come.

28
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,600
It's just that I am confined to reflect on my actions.

29
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,350
Your Highness,

30
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,370
let's first heal the wounds on your face.

31
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,320
Otherwise, you won't look beautiful anymore.

32
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,420
As expected of the Crown Prince,

33
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,079
he has managed to uproot all those underground banks in the capital,

34
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,430
completely eradicating them.

35
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,010
I heard that the owner of Zhen Miaoji on East Street

36
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,590
fell victim to those underground banks.

37
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,070
He lost all his ancestral properties and fields,

38
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,740
ending up with his family ruined and lives destroyed.

39
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,770
The owner himself went mad.

40
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,280
When the news of the underground banks being destroyed

41
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,310
spread,

42
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,460
his madness was largely cured.

43
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,250
Now that the Crown Prince

44
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,590
has recovered from his illness,

45
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,960
this must be the will of heaven.

46
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,410
[Ascending the Clouds, Gazing at the Moon]

47
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,580
My Lady, you must be careful with this wound.

48
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,790
It mustn't split open again.

49
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,040
And it can't get wet either.

50
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,580
The dressing needs to be changed daily.

51
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,830
Thank you for your trouble, Uncle Liu.

52
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,230
My Lady,

53
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,210
how could you be so harsh on yourself?

54
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,260
There's such a long cut on your arm.

55
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,360
It looks painful just to see it.

56
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,060
Well, if you're going to put on an act, you might as well go all out.

57
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,079
If I didn't have some injuries on me,

58
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,680
what I said in the palace today

59
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,130
would have lost much of its credibility.

60
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,520
Honey, if you feel painful,

61
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,450
please think thrice before doing this again.

62
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,220
Are you angry?

63
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,040
You can't catch a wolf if you're unwilling to sacrifice the bait.

64
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,030
At worst, next time

65
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,650
I'll make a shallower cut.

66
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,130
You're thinking of doing this again?

67
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,660
Let me take a look.

68
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,580
Tell me,

69
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,400
this time, the Emperor

70
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,010
only ordered Consort Shu to be confined

71
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,480
and Jiang Yunhao to be placed under house arrest.

72
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,550
It's not as decisive as before

73
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,850
when he would order the execution of entire families.

74
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,620
No matter how beloved his children are,

75
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,360
as long as they threaten his imperial power,

76
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,870
he can always

77
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,529
abandon them without mercy.

78
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,019
Fortunately,

79
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,190
you're now the only adult prince left.

80
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,650
The others are still too young

81
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,970
to pose any threat to you.

82
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,010
We can finally breathe a sigh of relief.

83
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,970
Who told you we could relax?

84
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,780
Isn't that so?

85
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,270
Who else would threaten

86
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,550
your position as the Crown Prince?

87
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,740
Weren't you supposed to come and kill me?

88
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,730
You actually know martial arts.

89
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,340
Assassin.

90
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,850
Go thank Uncle Liu for me.

91
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:26,950
The aromatherapy

92
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,050
used to neutralize the anesthetic worked very well.

93
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,020
It's so late.

94
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,050
Don't let him worry.

95
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:32,800
Yes.

96
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,330
Have some more calming tea.

97
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,220
Once Xue Ping has cleaned up the bedroom,

98
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,390
we'll go to sleep.

99
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:46,790
Here.

100
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,310
Tonight's assassin,

101
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,140
could it have been sent by Consort Shu?

102
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,490
Although Jiang Yunhao has been confined,

103
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,640
Consort Shu is only under house arrest.

104
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,190
We've caused her son

105
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,580
to fall into such a state.

106
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,450
She must hate us to death.

107
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,280
It's not her.

108
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,130
Why are you so certain?

109
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,190
Consort Shu will surely hate us,

110
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,390
but now

111
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,280
the most important thing for her is to regain power,

112
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,120
not to make a move against us.

113
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,380
Tonight's assassin

114
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,250
seems more like a test.

115
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,390
You mean

116
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,430
the Emperor?

117
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,630
Your Highness,

118
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:08,570
the food is here. Eat it while it's hot.

119
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,070
These damned servants.

120
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,930
I'm only under house arrest,

121
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,520
yet they dare to treat me like this.

122
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,159
Yunxiu, what happened to your face?

123
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,920
Who hit you, Yunxiu?

124
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,600
No one, Your Highness.

125
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:41,730
Yunxiu.

126
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,010
Let's not get angry.

127
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,640
How dare they hit you?

128
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,920
Your Highness,

129
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,180
I tried my best,

130
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,800
but

131
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:53,570
they only give me leftovers to eat.

132
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,580
How could they do this?

133
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:56,900
If...

134
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,820
If His Majesty were to see this,

135
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,720
how heartbroken he would be.

136
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,670
Yunxiu.

137
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,030
-Your Highness.
-Yunxiu.

138
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,100
Your Majesty,

139
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,970
Hao made a mistake.

140
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:21,030
It's my fault as his mother for not teaching him well.

141
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,660
His Majesty's rejection of me

142
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,010
is understandable.

143
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,780
I can bear all of this,

144
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,950
but when I think about

145
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,809
never seeing His Majesty again,

146
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,620
my heart...

147
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,640
My heart is so broken.

148
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,740
Yunxiu.

149
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,120
Your Majesty.

150
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,830
Your Majesty.

151
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,170
It's only been a few days,

152
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,080
yet someone dares to mistreat you like this.

153
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,630
Why didn't you have someone inform me?

154
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:13,680
Your Majesty,

155
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,050
I know I have let Your Majesty down.

156
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:20,910
How could I dare to bother Your Majesty with these matters

157
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,090
and risk annoying you?

158
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,690
My dear, don't cry.

159
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,150
I have never blamed you.

160
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,640
It's just that Hao

161
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,750
went too far this time.

162
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,990
I had to let the ministers

163
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,700
see my attitude.

164
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,590
Your Majesty,

165
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,490
I understand.

166
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,270
Your Majesty need not explain.

167
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,080
I promise you.

168
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:49,900
No one will ever dare to bully or insult you again.

169
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,220
Your Majesty.

170
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,480
The renovation of the Imperial Academy in the capital

171
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,790
has already begun.

172
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,780
It is expected to be completed by spring next year.

173
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:03,840
In various prefectures,

174
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,650
officials from the Ministry of Works and the Ministry of Revenue

175
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,210
have been dispatched to oversee the work.

176
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,390
Although the progress is slightly slower than in the capital,

177
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,440
however,

178
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,270
everything is proceeding

179
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,210
smoothly according to Your Majesty's wishes.

180
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,670
The Crown Prince's handling of affairs

181
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,580
naturally puts my mind at ease.

182
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

183
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,710
Your Majesty.

184
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,520
Today's court session

185
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,450
has been a bit too long.

186
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,010
You have all worked hard, my dear ministers.

187
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,250
Why don't you stay

188
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,140
and partake in the palace meal

189
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,280
before we continue?

190
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:49,400
His Majesty grants the ministers

191
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,260
a meal in the corridor.

192
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,870
We thank Your Majesty for your gracious favor.

193
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,200
Noble Consort Shu,

194
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,890
fearing that His Majesty's busy official duties might exhaust him,

195
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,570
has personally made some sweet cakes.

196
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,210
His Majesty is pleased.

197
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:07,630
His Majesty wishes to share them with all the officials.

198
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,730
So that's how it is.

199
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,340
Your Highness,

200
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:26,980
your letter.

201
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,580
My letter?

202
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,070
Please take your time reading it, Your Highness.

203
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,850
I'll go to the kitchen to check

204
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,040
how the dinner preparations are coming along.

205
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,920
My Lady, whose letter is it?

206
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,020
It's from my father.

207
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,570
It's a letter written by my father.

208
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,720
It's from the master.

209
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,250
My Lady,

210
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,680
what's wrong?

211
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,800
What did the master say in the letter?

212
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,640
It's nothing,

213
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,920
just expressing concern for my well-being.

214
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,780
Su Zhu,

215
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,740
go see if there are any fruits

216
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,200
and bring them here. I'd like to eat some.

217
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:23,940
Alright.

218
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:28,740
I know that you,

219
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,240
my child, have now been appointed as the Crown Princess.

220
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,120
But I'm worried about you,

221
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,400
and hopes you will think carefully.

222
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,530
The Jiang clan

223
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,660
has in the blood of its male members

224
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,560
an innate obsession.

225
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,840
They do not make good husbands.

226
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,450
How the current Emperor treats his first wife?

227
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
You must have heard.

228
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,890
The previous Emperor was the same.

229
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,350
The Crown Prince also has the blood of the Jiang clan.

230
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,520
It's hard to guarantee he won't hurt you in the future.

231
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,880
Although the Xu family is now cooperating with the Crown Prince,

232
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:01,890
I have obtained a promise from him.

233
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,950
If one day you wish to leave,

234
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,650
the Crown Prince must not stop you.

235
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,210
When the day comes for the Xu family to be cleared of wrongdoing,

236
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,410
I hope

237
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,450
you can return home with me.
