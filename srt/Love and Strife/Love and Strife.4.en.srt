[Love and Strife]

2
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,910
[Episode 4]

3
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,290
Yunsheng,

4
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,970
in the blink of an eye, you're already married.

5
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,480
If your mother knew,

6
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,250
she would be overjoyed.

7
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,120
Father,

8
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:13,840
I

9
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,120
was planning to pay my respects to you

10
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,080
and then go to pay tribute to Mother

11
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:19,560
to inform her

12
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,080
of this joyous occasion.

13
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:24,520
You should indeed go see her.

14
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,080
If your mother were alive,

15
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,280
how wonderful that would be.

16
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,770
I remember back then,

17
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,170
when you were born,

18
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,720
she kept saying

19
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,750
that she wanted to see you start a family and establish yourself.

20
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,820
She wanted to see you and your wife

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,280
dressed in formal attire and wearing ceremonial headgear together.

22
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,560
It's a pity.

23
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:46,650
She left us too soon.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,200
Father, please don't be sad.

25
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,000
Mother

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,320
wouldn't want to see you upset either.

27
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,270
You're a good, understanding child.

28
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:01,410
I also know that last night

29
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:02,840
you experienced some frightening moments.

30
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,560
The remaining bandits

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,610
outside Gongchen Pass

32
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,080
are unbelievably fearless.

33
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,729
They even intend to harm Chuyun.

34
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,400
It's truly despicable.

35
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,850
Yes,

36
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:15,250
it was all the work of bandits.

37
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,790
You don’t need to take today’s matter of Chuyun receiving instruction

38
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,770
too much to heart.

39
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,060
Alright.

40
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,890
Go and pay respects to your late mother first.

41
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,800
Come back later to dine with me.

42
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,420
I take my leave, Your Majesty.

43
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,300
How can this be a small matter?

44
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,000
I originally intended to use this instruction

45
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,370
to put the Crown Princess in her place

46
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,240
and boost the status of your

47
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,480
Third Princess Consort.

48
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,950
Unexpectedly,

49
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,810
that lowly maid seemed innocent

50
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,230
but kept saying I'm not the Empress

51
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,510
and have no right to lecture her,

52
00:02:57,690 --> 00:02:59,060
allowing her to establish her authority instead.

53
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,950
Let her establish her authority.

54
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,790
Mother, her triumph is only temporary.

55
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,100
Moreover,

56
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,870
this instruction

57
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,270
was ordered by Father Emperor.

58
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,040
He wanted to suppress

59
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,250
the influence of this

60
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,690
Crown Princess who controls military power.

61
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,380
Your Father Emperor has deep thoughts.

62
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,100
Surely,

63
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,100
he has long considered this matter.

64
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,910
He favors me exclusively

65
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,850
and shows some preference for you.

66
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,900
Previously, at your grand wedding,

67
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,470
the court officials have all taken sides.

68
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,750
That being the case,

69
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,870
our vision

70
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,220
should be set on the long term.

71
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,150
Mother, you speak wisely.

72
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,420
Furthermore,

73
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,470
this assassination attempt on the Crown Prince

74
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,420
was also dismissed by Father Emperor

75
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,470
under the pretext of bandits.

76
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,380
He forbade any further mention of it.

77
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,100
It's clear that

78
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:52,980
he's not in Father Emperor's favor.

79
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,260
In court matters,

80
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,070
he has even less say

81
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,380
and can't exert any influence.

82
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,190
This is excellent.

83
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,300
Then you should

84
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,330
perform well in court.

85
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,160
As for within these palace walls,

86
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,360
I've already informed Yuanyuan

87
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,670
that we absolutely won't let the Eastern Palace have an easy time.

88
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,980
Mother.

89
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:21,269
I'm

90
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,410
not alone anymore.

91
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,040
Without a mother's protection,

92
00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:36,650
in this palace,

93
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,020
he is indeed alone.

94
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,850
I, who voluntarily entered this imperial city,

95
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,980
am I not alone as well?

96
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,150
What does Your Highness wish to say to me?

97
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,950
"Your Highness" and "beloved consort"

98
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,510
sound so cold.

99
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,060
Why don't we,

100
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,110
in private, address each other according to common custom?

101
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,220
You call me Honey,

102
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,620
and I call you Darling.

103
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:15,520
How about that?

104
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:23,980
Darling.

105
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:26,790
Honey.

106
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,470
[Eastern Palace]

107
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,620
My Lady, I scouted around yesterday.

108
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,350
There are spies from several sides

109
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,100
in the Eastern Palace.

110
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,110
The identities of those assassins

111
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,659
are hard to determine.

112
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,390
I can't believe he's so tolerant.

113
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:44,909
I think what people say outside is right.

114
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,420
They say the Crown Prince is useless.

115
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,860
My Lady, you suffered such a great injustice

116
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,300
in the palace today.

117
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,150
He didn't even think about helping you

118
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,060
or standing up for you.

119
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,430
If he's really useless,

120
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,150
how has he survived until now?

121
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,980
Moreover, in the palace today,

122
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,660
I don't think he's as cowardly

123
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,830
as the rumors suggest.

124
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:10,150
That wine yesterday,

125
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,100
I really think there was something wrong with it.

126
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,550
Have you investigated it thoroughly?

127
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,190
Yesterday's wedding wine

128
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,470
was said to be brewed by the Wine King of Yan City.

129
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,470
It's called One Sip to Drunkenness.

130
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:19,380
After drinking it, you don't remember anything.

131
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,710
How could we consummate the marriage then?

132
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,350
The way he's acting,

133
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,540
it's as if he's guarding against me.

134
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,870
Did I say anything inappropriate while drunk yesterday?

135
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:32,909
You shouldn't have.

136
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,830
I was outside the window yesterday.

137
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,080
I saw you collapse after drinking the wine.

138
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,520
Then the Crown Prince went to sleep as well.

139
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:40,790
He didn't do anything else.

140
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:41,860
What about the medicine?

141
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,350
It's here.

142
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,680
You were summoned to the palace early this morning,

143
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,220
but the Crown Prince left later.

144
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,130
He specifically handed the medicine to me.

145
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,280
He didn't notice

146
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,420
anything wrong with the medicine, did he?

147
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,900
It doesn't seem so.

148
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,450
I don't see anything wrong with the Crown Prince.

149
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,480
He also said that the sedative has its effects,

150
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,650
it's not good to use too much.

151
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,650
He suggested you use less.

152
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,090
Your Highness,

153
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,160
the Crown Prince requests your presence.

154
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,790
Slow down.

155
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,220
Alright.

156
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:12,620
Move this way.

157
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:13,870
Gently now.

158
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,140
Everyone, take it slow.

159
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:15,910
These are all the lady's

160
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:17,380
favorite zithers and other musical instruments.

161
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,670
Be careful not to make any mistakes.

162
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,570
Take it slow.

163
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,320
Alright.

164
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,790
My Lady.

165
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,260
I didn't expect the Crown Prince

166
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,159
would prepare

167
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:33,870
a private room for you.

168
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,830
What...

169
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:39,150
What are you thinking about?

170
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,040
Su Zhu,

171
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,260
look.

172
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,060
It's already winter,

173
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,400
yet these maple leaves are still as red as blood.

174
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:10,870
Has the Crown Princess

175
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,500
started using the neighboring courtyard?

176
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,790
I can hear

177
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:14,670
the sound

178
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,990
coming from her side from here.

179
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,260
Yes,

180
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,030
the Crown Princess had people carry

181
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,260
many instrument cases over.

182
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,320
She said

183
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,710
she wants to use the room you prepared for her

184
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:23,900
as a music room.

185
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,600
Musical instruments?

186
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,780
She's actually setting up a music studio.

187
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,700
I thought

188
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,990
she would turn it into some embroidery room or treasure vault.

189
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,230
I've asked about it.

190
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:35,870
Miss Su Zhu said

191
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,110
the Crown Princess prefers to focus on musical instruments.

192
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,260
My Lady, you're the prettiest when you play with swords.

193
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,040
Even with lofty ambitions,

194
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,830
I'm trapped in this mire.

195
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,350
To avenge the Xu family,

196
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,330
I have no choice but to become

197
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,280
a delicate and dependent dodder flower,

198
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,760
being flattery.

199
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,030
I dare not forget the blood feud

200
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,910
of the Xu family for even a moment.

201
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,790
My Lady, you've suffered so much.

202
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:23,140
Put away my "instruments" quickly.

203
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,740
Lest we frighten that

204
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,710
delicate and pitiful Crown Prince.

205
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,260
Your Highness?

206
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,600
Today at the Hualian Palace today,

207
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,590
she seemed innocent and harmless,

208
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,320
but in reality,

209
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,010
she gave Consort Shu quite a setback.

210
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:46,900
Tell me,

211
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,710
is she playing dumb to outwit others,

212
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:53,070
or is she genuinely innocent and fragile?

213
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,500
Your Highness,

214
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,490
how would I know?

215
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,620
Why don't we go and see for ourselves

216
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:01,570
whether she's

217
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,050
putting on an act for us.

218
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,070
Is she truly virtuous...

219
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:05,540
Your legs...

220
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,870
Or a fake lady?

221
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:07,950
Legs, Your Highness.

222
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,130
Alright,

223
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,500
let's go.

224
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,520
Su Zhu,

225
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,330
what do you think

226
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,080
about hanging the yueqin there?

227
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,410
And hiding a pair of straight knives behind it?

228
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,290
We can use a screen to conceal them.

229
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:38,700
The red-tasseled spear...

230
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,490
can we put it under that zither table?

231
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,990
And those medicines...

232
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,660
Honey.

233
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,230
Your Highness.

234
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,340
What brings you here?

235
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,190
Are you satisfied with this courtyard?

236
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,500
I like it. I'm very satisfied.

237
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:01,990
I'm glad you like it.

238
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,130
If there's anything

239
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,440
you're not satisfied with,

240
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,540
just tell Xue Ping

241
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,020
to take care of it for you.

242
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,690
Thank you, Your Highness.

243
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,930
I thought you only liked books,

244
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,020
I never imagined

245
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,020
you'd be so fond of musical instruments.

246
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,470
I wonder what you have.

247
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,750
May I see

248
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,710
your collection?
