1
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,960
Where is the Crown Prince?

2
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,760
I heard that

3
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,040
recovered?

4
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,800
Is he sick again?

5
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,560
Your Majesty.

6
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,240
The Crown Prince is on leave.

7
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,240
He hasn't attended the morning court lately.

8
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,800
because the Crown Princess found a miracle doctor.

9
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,240
She said it could cure Crown Prince's leg.

10
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,080
That's why he took a leave.

11
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,320
Great.

12
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:24,000
Sheng's leg is finally saved.

13
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,600
Shuang'er will be happy

14
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,080
will be happy.

15
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,920
Pass my order.

16
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,960
Ask the head of the Imperial Hospital to treat him together.

17
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,759
Yes, Your Majesty.

18
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,120
How is it?

19
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,479
Do I get better?

20
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,360
Your Highness.

21
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,120
Physician Liu

22
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,280
is really amazing.

23
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,320
The silt in the Crown Prince's meridians

24
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,840
has been removed.

25
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,880
Can the healing ointment...

26
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,400
Master's secret technique

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,199
[can only be disclosed]

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,039
Don't leak it.

29
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,880
Understood.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,360
Congratulations, Your Highness.

31
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,480
Within two months,

32
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,040
within two months.

33
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,760
It's all thanks to

34
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,680
who brought me here.

35
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,720
As long as Crown Prince is safe,

36
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,680
I'm relieved.

37
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,920
Physician Liu, can you discuss

38
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,960
in case the prescription can help.

39
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,200
Of course.

40
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,200
Let's talk outside.

41
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,200
Of course.

42
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,280
Your Highness.

43
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,440
We'll take our leave.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,560
Come.

45
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,360
I didn't expect

46
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,480
you really can't see

47
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,040
your real condition.

48
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,280
If not,

49
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,840
I wouldn't have lived to this day.

50
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,440
But

51
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,920
thanks to Doctor Liu

52
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,280
changed the prescription.

53
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,080
It made my body

54
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,800
I'm recovering.

55
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,360
Of course.

56
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,280
Uncle Liu's family background.

57
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,240
He's amazing.

58
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,320
Indeed.

59
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,360
Even an immortal

60
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,840
the secret medicine of the previous dynasty.

61
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,680
The Crown Prince

62
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,000
is still recovering.

63
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
Your Majesty,

64
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,600
I've confirmed that

65
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
His pulse is recovering.

66
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,520
That girl from the Xu family

67
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,160
is really capable

68
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,120
such a person.

69
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,960
During the treatment of Crown Prince,

70
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,680
I want to know his recovery progress.

71
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

72
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,880
I don't know

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,080
you have so many weapons.

74
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,120
So what?

75
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,000
I still can't defeat you.

76
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,040
Chu Yun, don't compete with me.

77
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,440
My way of martial arts is different from others.

78
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,040
I have to pay a great price.

79
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,720
Can I take a look?

80
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:24,920
Of course.

81
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,240
If there is a chance,

82
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,480
I'll show you

83
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,960
The Eastern Palace.

84
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,760
I've prepared a training ground for you.

85
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,680
Later,

86
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,240
we can have a competition.

87
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,960
Sure.

88
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,280
The weather is great.

89
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,360
Can't the Crown Prince go to court?

90
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,120
Your brother is delicate and weak.

91
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,040
He might need to rest for a few more days.

92
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,040
A few days ago, I heard that

93
00:04:58,159 --> 00:04:59,680
the thin cotton curtain

94
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,600
the cotton curtains

95
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,320
It hasn't been removed yet

96
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,840
Look.

97
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,800
I have such a son.

98
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,000
Even the weak princess

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
a weak princess.

100
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,880
Here comes the Crown Prince.

101
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,000
This is a miracle.

102
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,360
Is your leg recovered?

103
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

104
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,640
I'm fine now.

105
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,120
I'm here to report to you.

106
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,720
Has your leg really recovered?

107
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,960
After Physician Liu entered the palace,

108
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,640
he used the secret acupuncture technique

109
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,200
with the secret technique of acupuncture.

110
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,440
Now the activity is no different from ordinary people.

111
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,520
I will never be absent from the court again.

112
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,800
Sorry for making you worry.

113
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,200
Yes.

114
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,080
This is your blessing.

115
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,120
Thank you, Father.

116
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,960
Third Brother.

117
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,360
This is my seat.

118
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,920
You...

119
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,040
should step aside.

120
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,320
Of course.

121
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,200
You must stand still.

122
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,200
Don't be paralyzed.

123
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,600
Why are you still so domineering?

124
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,159
If your father sees you,

125
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,280
he'll scold you. He'll scold you if he sees you.

126
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,200
It's up to you.

127
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,120
If it weren't for your incompetence,

128
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,640
and had something on you,

129
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,920
Why do I have to be a low profile?

130
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,000
to restore my reputation?

131
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,440
Or

132
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,840
you want to be like

133
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,920
like Jiang Yunmo?

134
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,160
to be confined.

135
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,280
Some officials

136
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,520
are just selling officers.

137
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,680
It's not a big deal.

138
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,920
Father punished me.

139
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,120
Mother kept mentioning it.

140
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,040
What are you doing?

141
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,400
Why don't you use your brain?

142
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,760
How dare you complain?

143
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,680
So what?

144
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,400
Father dotes on me the most.

145
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,680
Now that the Crown Prince has stood up,

146
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,880
A strong Crown Prince

147
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,520
is standing in the court.

148
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,640
You know your father.

149
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,840
He cares about dignity the most.

150
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:29,840
You know him.

151
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,120
he won't abolish it easily.

152
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,440
If you compete with him now,

153
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,360
to compete with him now.

154
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,960
So what?

155
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,960
Does he have a family to help him?

156
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
No.

157
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,000
The Zhao family is dying.

158
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,800
He's no match for me.

159
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,400
Even so,

160
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,040
no one knows what will happen in the future.

161
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,240
Hao'er.

162
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,280
Since you married Shen Yuan Yuan

163
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,480
you have the power of the Left State Councillor

164
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,440
you must seize it

165
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,600
Understand?

166
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,560
No.

167
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,280
You...

168
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,320
I know.

169
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,320
The renovation is made today.

170
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,080
We got some red

171
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,320
to get the money in time.

172
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,600
so that it won't delay the big deal.

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,760
But I didn't expect

174
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,240
is the Ministry of Revenue.

175
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,920
of the Ministry of Revenue.

176
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,400
The key to the warehouse

177
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,480
is divided into two.

178
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,919
Without the one in his hand,

179
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,880
I can't get in no matter how anxious I am.

180
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,520
Why hasn't the visitor come back yet?

181
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,600
You go too.

182
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,480
Go to the Minister of Revenue

183
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,440
the Minister of Revenue.

184
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,480
Yes.

185
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,040
My Lord! My Lord!

186
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,320
My lord.

187
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,360
He...

188
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:48,800
He...

189
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,600
What?

190
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,920
Dead.

191
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,400
The whole family is dead.

192
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,200
Dead?

193
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,160
My minister of Revenue

194
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,120
My family died from a hanging neck.

195
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,160
My cottage was stolen

196
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,040
Three million taels of silver

197
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,120
Fly away

198
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,480
Sure.

199
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,480
It's a legend.

200
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
Crown Prince, tell us.

201
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,840
How much money

202
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,400
every year?

203
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,840
Father, in the three years of Rui'an,

204
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,360
the taxes paid by 13 provinces

205
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,600
20 million taels in total

206
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,360
Among them,

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,640
the richest Rui'an

208
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,840
Three million taels.

209
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,240
Three million taels flew away

210
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,160
Did you lose money?

211
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,560
This is stealing my Rui'an Province.

212
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,760
and stole my country.

213
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,720
We are guilty.

214
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,120
Of course you are all guilty.

215
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,120
If you can't find the culprit,

216
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,040
I will confiscate my house and kill people

217
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,240
to make up for the shortage of three million taels.

218
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Chancellor Shen, wait.

219
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,320
Your Highness.

220
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,160
When His Majesty was dismissed,

221
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,800
he asked Prime Minister Shen

222
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,840
I think he wants you

223
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,640
recommend someone to investigate the official silver case.

224
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,880
But you seem calm and relaxed.

225
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,400
I think you have made up your mind.

226
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,080
The warehouse is heavily guarded.

227
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,440
Minister Lu

228
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,000
has no evidence.

229
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,200
This is obviously

230
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,440
Death cases, difficult cases.

231
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,040
The person who handles the case

232
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
even in front of His Majesty,

233
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,520
in front of His Majesty.

234
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,640
Yeah.

235
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,560
In that case,

236
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,280
we must

237
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,760
a distinguished man

238
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,760
can take the responsibility.

239
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,320
I won't let you down.

240
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,320
I won't let you down.

241
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,000
to satisfy Your Majesty.

242
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,480
and the Third Prince.

243
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,520
Okay.

244
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
Let’s go, Prime Minister Shen.

245
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,760
Your Highness.

246
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,000
What's the rush, Your Highness?

247
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,840
After the court meeting,

248
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,960
he asked me to look for you in the study.

249
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,560
Of course I have to receive the edict later.

250
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,720
Yes.

251
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,440
Here comes the imperial edict.

252
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,160
The disappearance of the treasury

253
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,720
to you alone.

254
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,400
This is not investigation.

255
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,080
I just want you to take the blame.

256
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,080
This kind of thing

257
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,400
and offended others,

258
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,000
it's my fault

259
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,840
the incompetent Crown Prince.

260
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,840
Besides,

261
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,320
my third brother

262
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,240
doesn’t like my success recently.

263
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,040
Of course you're trying your best

264
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,120
to trouble me.

265
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,120
It'd be better if you didn't do well.

266
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,680
and lose His Majesty's favor.

267
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,600
But I can't say

268
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,800
This pot

269
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,240
is only holding me back.

270
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,040
Who else will help you?

271
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,120
Of course it's related to me.

272
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,360
who relies on me.

273
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,160
Three months ago,

274
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,120
three months ago.

275
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,800
The money was there at that time.

276
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,920
No problem.

277
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,640
So,

278
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
the disappearance of the treasury

279
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,880
happened three months ago.

280
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,840
The silver is in the storage.

281
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,360
is no different from stones.

282
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,520
Once it gets out,

283
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,960
it'll be a big problem to make people suffer.

284
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,520
Within three months,

285
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:26,680
If that's the case,

286
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,280
a large sum of silver

287
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,040
How is that possible?

288
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,240
It has no effect at all.

289
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,960
June.

290
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,200
Shirogane is missing now.

291
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,840
What?

292
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,720
Your Highness.

293
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,120
I have an emergency.

294
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,160
Let's check it first.
