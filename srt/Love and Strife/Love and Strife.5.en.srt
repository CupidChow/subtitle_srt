00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,960
[Episode 5]

3
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,840
I thought you only liked books.

4
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:00,720
I never expected

5
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,140
that you would be so fond of musical instruments.

6
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,730
But I don't know what's in it.

7
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,789
I wonder if I can take a look at

8
00:01:09,289 --> 00:01:10,570
your collection.

9
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,590
Darling.

10
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,200
I haven't finished tidying up yet.

11
00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:23,500
After I organize everything,

12
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,130
would you mind coming to see it then?

13
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,090
This Qin has an exquisite timbre.

14
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,340
It's truly a fine piece.

15
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,170
Why don't I help you organize these things together?

16
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,870
Although I'm not an expert,

17
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,280
I do know a thing or two about musical temperament.

18
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,460
I'm also curious about your collection.

19
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,650
I wonder what kinds of musical instruments

20
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,030
are in those boxes.

21
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,300
Darling.

22
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,300
Darling.

23
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,400
Darling.

24
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,450
Last night was our wedding night,

25
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,540
but I got drunk.

26
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,870
Darling, the wedding night passed in vain.

27
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,680
Are you holding me responsible?

28
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,970
Why would you think like that?

29
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,910
What does it matter if there's a moment of regret?

30
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,020
In the future, you and I

31
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,880
will surely live well every day.

32
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,230
Your Highness,

33
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,320
Lord Jiang has arrived.

34
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,890
Got it.

35
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:57,270
Darling, you should go attend to your business first.

36
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,270
All right.

37
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,080
I'll talk with you later.

38
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:03,890
Let's go.

39
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,020
Are you all right, My Lady?

40
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:14,370
I'm fine.

41
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,550
This is the intelligence

42
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:22,579
from the informants placed on the Eldest Prince's side.

43
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,520
It contains

44
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,079
a list of officials who may be in charge of

45
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,030
the imperial examination this year.

46
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,510
Seems

47
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,950
my eldest brother

48
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,840
is going to interfere with the imperial examination.

49
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,900
I've reviewed the case records of the Court of Judicial Review.

50
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:46,390
In the past imperial examinations,

51
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,460
there were reports of

52
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,410
some imperial examination cheating

53
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,470
such as exam paper trading.

54
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,120
However...

55
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,310
However, in the end,

56
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,890
they were all dismissed without resolution.

57
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,500
The ability to cover up the truth

58
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,440
seems like the work of Consort Shu.

59
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,480
It's what she always wants to do.

60
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,350
But with the Shu family's influence,

61
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,290
she still can't affect the imperial examination.

62
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,620
The eldest brother's maternal family

63
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,000
comes from a scholarly background.

64
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,870
His maternal grandfather is even a great Confucian scholar of the current dynasty.

65
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:13,080
With disciples all over the world,

66
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,180
interfering with the imperial examination

67
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,410
would be a piece of cake for them.

68
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,380
Are you saying

69
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,890
that Grand Preceptor Guo is behind this?

70
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,010
It's not him.

71
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,580
He's advanced in years

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,070
and has long since retired from affairs.

73
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,480
He prides himself on being a great Confucian scholar,

74
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,000
showing his proud and unbowed integrity.

75
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:36,870
However,

76
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,909
given his advanced age,

77
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,870
he can no longer keep those under him in check.

78
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,020
Everyone thinks

79
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,400
I won't live to see my coronation day.

80
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:50,940
Although the third brother is quite favored

81
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,200
because of Consort Shu,

82
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:54,100
the eldest brother

83
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,970
also has a fighting chance.

84
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:57,720
It's perfectly normal

85
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,450
for the Guo family to want to do something

86
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,380
behind the scenes.

87
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,910
Then we...

88
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,910
If we can get this information,

89
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,800
others can too.

90
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,970
This is just the tip of the iceberg.

91
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:19,720
Acting rashly

92
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:20,920
would be counterproductive.

93
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,610
Let's keep an eye on it for now.

94
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,870
We must strike at the vital point.

95
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,320
Don't rush.

96
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,390
Got it, Your Highness.

97
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,980
Your swordsmanship has improved further.

98
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,250
You're just flattering me.

99
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,190
Since I entered the capital,

100
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,560
I haven't had a good,

101
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,409
satisfying practice session.

102
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,330
I can only practice secretly like this.

103
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,650
Why don't you leave the mansion for a good practice later?

104
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,480
I do have the idea,

105
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,310
but right now,

106
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,980
the current matter is most important.

107
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:52,460
You came to the capital with me,

108
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:54,270
so you naturally know my purpose.

109
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,060
You are a doctor,

110
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,420
so I'll speak frankly.

111
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,990
Over these days,

112
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,450
I have been consistently

113
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,280
preparing for the Crown Prince

114
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,810
ginseng soup and medicinal meals to nourish his body,

115
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,290
and I have already gained his trust.

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,880
I want to ask you

117
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,550
if there are any

118
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,640
colorless and tasteless slow-acting drugs.

119
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:14,140
There are various types of such drugs,

120
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:17,250
and there are indeed a few that are colorless and tasteless.

121
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,450
It depends on when you want to accomplish your goal.

122
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,720
Now that I've just married into the Eastern Palace,

123
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,590
my position is not yet stable,

124
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,540
and everything is uncertain.

125
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,600
I must at least wait until I'm pregnant with his child

126
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,380
and uncover the truth.

127
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,909
I understand.

128
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,770
Please wait several days

129
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,390
for me to make some preparations.

130
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:42,290
Also, Uncle Liu,

131
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,570
please

132
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,750
prepare some

133
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,380
nourishing medicinal meal recipes for me.

134
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:47,700
I

135
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,060
need to show

136
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,890
a gentle and caring attitude

137
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,800
to gain the Crown Prince's trust

138
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,750
and make him completely let his guard down against me.

139
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,130
I understand.

140
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,170
The recipes can be delivered today.

141
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,170
Thank you, Uncle Liu.

142
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,450
They wiped out the entire Xu family.

143
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,770
Let this empire be the payment.

144
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:22,360
[Eastern Palace]

145
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:22,970
Su Zhu,

146
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,450
about what I asked you to investigate last time,

147
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,830
do you have any leads on the man in black?

148
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,680
No.

149
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,750
The person seemed

150
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,950
to appear out of nowhere.

151
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,500
No matter how hard we tried to investigate,

152
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,929
we still don't have a single clue.

153
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,530
Do you mean

154
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:39,890
we should send more people to investigate?

155
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:40,809
No need.

156
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,390
There's no need to make a fuss.

157
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:45,060
Since he came to spy on me in disguise,

158
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,060
he must have a follow-up plan.

159
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,150
We are in the open now,

160
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:51,840
while he's in the shadows. We just need to wait patiently.

161
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,920
We'll surely catch him when he makes his move again.

162
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,270
The next time he shows up,

163
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,340
I'll definitely teach him a lesson.

164
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:01,710
All right,

165
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,670
let's go to the kitchen now

166
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:04,720
to check on the tonic

167
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,840
and see how it's cooking today.

168
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,450
Okay.

169
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,340
Let's go.

170
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,970
Darling,

171
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,890
hot pot is the best in winter.

172
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:14,190
I've specially prepared for you today

173
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,390
venison and deer blood.

174
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:18,030
They're all good ingredients for nourishing your body and boosting your energy.

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,360
My body

176
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,410
isn't that bad, is it?

177
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,750
Here, the meat is ready.

178
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,970
Darling, please try it.

179
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,360
Honey, there's no need for such formality.

180
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,610
I can do it myself.

181
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,060
Okay. Try it.

182
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:41,910
Let me cook a slice of deer blood for you.

183
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:42,810
Honey, I can do it myself.

184
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,090
You're busy outside all day.

185
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,440
Eating this will help prevent you from getting sick.

186
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,390
Eat it.

187
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:24,590
Okay.

188
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,710
This little girl is really troublesome.

189
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:25,860
Why

190
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,640
am I the only one suffering?

191
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,980
You have quite a temper.

192
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,550
You even hid a dagger under your pillow.

193
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,210
I was almost hurt.

194
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:56,770
It's you again.

195
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,720
How dare you come to the Eastern Palace again?

196
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,440
So what?

197
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,120
I come as I please.

198
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,270
As for you,

199
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
did you miss me?

200
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,110
Shameless!

201
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:08,950
Let go of me!

202
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,360
I saved your life.

203
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Do you just disregard

204
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,870
the feelings between us like this?

205
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,840
What feelings are there between us?

206
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,750
If you

207
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,200
get surrounded by guards here,

208
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,960
even with your high martial arts skills,

209
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,390
you won't be able to get away.

210
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,750
I don't mind,

211
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,720
but if you

212
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,960
want others to see us

213
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,030
in this state,

214
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,870
I don't mind

215
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,720
going even further.

216
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,960
What exactly do you want to do?

217
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,330
I'm here to help you.

218
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,150
Don't you

219
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,000
want the Crown Prince dead?

220
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,430
How about

221
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,540
I lend you a hand?

222
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,960
What do you say?

223
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,040
Nonsense.

224
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,020
You don't want to kill the Crown Prince?

225
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,960
Or do you want to

226
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,720
eliminate the entire royal family?

227
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,600
How about I help you?

228
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,600
On the condition that

229
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,390
you and I...

230
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,890
You think I'd believe your bull...
