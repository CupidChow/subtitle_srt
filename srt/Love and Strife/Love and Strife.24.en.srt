[Love and Strife]

00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,020
[Episode 24]

3
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,560
Even if I have to die,

4
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,760
I will drag that bitch's bastard

5
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,180
with me.

6
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,960
You're not like your mother at all.

7
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,350
You are

8
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,080
so...

9
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,970
So vigilant.

10
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,500
Mother never wanted me

11
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,759
to be like her.

12
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,600
Mother.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,910
Mother,

14
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,240
Mother, Mother!

15
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,590
The guilty woman, Consort Shu, has been executed.

16
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,410
Mother!

17
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,190
Let me go!

18
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,360
Mother!

19
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,050
Mother.

20
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,070
Father Emperor!

21
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,789
Kill him.

22
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,150
Did you see it?

23
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,130
Jiang Yunsheng!

24
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,830
Is the Emperor's health

25
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,760
really failing?

26
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,270
On the day Consort Shu died,

27
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,480
the shock was too great,

28
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,900
causing his blood to surge,

29
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,270
and the poison spread.

30
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:22,660
Now,

31
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,340
he's just clinging to life.

32
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,180
Why didn't

33
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,120
the imperial physicians prepare an antidote for him?

34
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,020
The only remaining Bi Luo antidote in the palace

35
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,329
was taken by the Crown Princess

36
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:36,060
some time ago.

37
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,250
Let's go.

38
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,530
Greetings, Your Majesty.

39
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:55,160
How is it?

40
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,730
All those involved in the rebellion

41
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,150
have been captured.

42
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,150
Especially Consort Shu,

43
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,340
she is sentenced to death,

44
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,410
along with her entire clan.

45
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,300
Why bother?

46
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,960
Her Shu family...

47
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,770
Father Emperor,

48
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,710
the Zhao family

49
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,120
doesn't have many left either.

50
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,910
Additionally,

51
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,079
I have something to report.

52
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,870
Speak.

53
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,000
I

54
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,540
have a dose of the Bi Luo antidote here.

55
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,980
Give it to me at once!

56
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,040
Father Emperor,

57
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,910
this is what I

58
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,040
obtained from the Crown Princess.

59
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,980
The Crown Princess has one question.

60
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,960
She wishes to ask for your enlightenment.

61
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,450
You want to coerce me?

62
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,230
Go ahead.

63
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,010
Your Majesty,

64
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,460
was it you who annihilated

65
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,640
the entire Xu family?

66
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,480
It was me.

67
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,620
Why?

68
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,110
The world says that the northwest frontier

69
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:37,040
can only prosper under the protection

70
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,770
of the hereditary Duke.

71
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,780
Is that reason enough?

72
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,540
The Xu family...

73
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,090
The Xu family never had any disloyal intentions.

74
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:49,950
Just because,

75
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,950
of such baseless rumors?

76
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,890
Is that reason not enough?

77
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:10,900
Father Emperor,

78
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,320
this confession of sins,

79
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,900
you should sign it.

80
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,760
Sheng,

81
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,490
what do you mean by this?

82
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,340
The people need to know the truth.

83
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,320
Whether it's the Zhao family,

84
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,120
or the souls of the Duke's mansion,

85
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,990
they all need to be appeased.

86
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,970
What a joke.

87
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,940
When the subjects are strong and the ruler is weak,

88
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,170
how can the empire last long?

89
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,159
If the deep-rooted illness is not eradicated,

90
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,030
how can I leave this land to you?

91
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,840
With my hands stained in blood,

92
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,700
you can be a wise and virtuous ruler for a lifetime.

93
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,760
According to Father Emperor's words,

94
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,170
your indiscriminate killings

95
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,510
are actually for my good?

96
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,840
Of course.

97
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:57,530
You are my son,

98
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,880
of course, I have to think for you.

99
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,950
This is also your mother's wish.

100
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,730
But before Mother passed away,

101
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,680
she only told me

102
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,390
not to be like you,

103
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,770
blinded by desire,

104
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,680
losing my true heart,

105
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,780
becoming a monster

106
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,510
only knowing how to manipulate power.

107
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:17,770
I

108
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,820
dare not forget day or night.

109
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,100
Jiang Yunsheng,

110
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,270
are you going to kill your father?

111
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,350
Father Emperor,

112
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,370
to live on

113
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,450
comes with a price.

114
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,290
[Confession of Sins]

115
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,990
Sheng.

116
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,120
Give me the antidote.

117
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,330
Quick.

118
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,850
Come.

119
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,500
Chuyun.

120
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,380
This antidote was originally yours.

121
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,550
You decide whether to give it to him or not.

122
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,180
Jiang Yunsheng.

123
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,900
I am your father after all.

124
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,020
The father who killed my mother,

125
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,650
and annihilated my maternal clan.

126
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,590
I have already signed the confession of sins.

127
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,350
Xu Chuyun,

128
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,400
quickly give me the antidote.

129
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:49,460
Give it to me.

130
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,680
Come,

131
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,130
give it to me.

132
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:58,810
Come.

133
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,010
Give it to me.

134
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,280
Father Emperor,

135
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
I believe,

136
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,020
in the court,

137
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,260
tragedies like those of the Zhao family

138
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,010
and the Xu family

139
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,250
must not happen again.

140
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,970
I take my leave.

141
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,660
Xu Chuyun.

142
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,260
Sheng,

143
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,620
bring the antidote back to me.

144
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,150
Bring the antidote back to me.

145
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,770
Sheng!

146
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,059
Give me the antidote.

147
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:40,970
Sheng!

148
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,850
It has been two months since the late Emperor passed away,

149
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,450
and all the guilty ministers have been executed.

150
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,000
I beg Your Highness to ascend the throne soon.

151
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,040
A country cannot be without a ruler for even a day.

152
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,600
Let the Ministry of Rites start the arrangements.

153
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,720
Your Highness,

154
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,350
should the coronation ceremony for the Empress

155
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,200
also begin preparations?

156
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,160
Approved.

157
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,860
The coronation ceremony for the Empress

158
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,510
shall be arranged according to the highest standards.

159
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,820
As you command.

160
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,070
Chuyun!

161
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,050
Where is the Crown Princess?

162
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,320
She was just here.

163
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,070
I will go find Her Highness immediately.

164
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,860
Master and madam,

165
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,570
are they going back to rebuild the Xu mansion?

166
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,840
Father and mother wrote in their letter

167
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,020
that they are already on their way back.

168
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,450
Speaking of which, after so long,

169
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,270
I somewhat miss

170
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,720
the days at the frontier.

171
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:04,480
My Lady,

172
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,570
don't you miss home?

173
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,300
Su Zhu,

174
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,890
you may leave first.

175
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,020
Yes.

176
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
You see it?

177
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,670
You want to

178
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:46,840
leave me?

179
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,810
I have thought about leaving you.

180
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,610
Your feelings for me,

181
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:03,120
I can feel them.

182
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,280
But Father Emperor and Empress Mother,

183
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,750
they were once so deeply in love,

184
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,720
yet later they...

185
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:11,880
I...

186
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,470
I promised General Xu,

187
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,610
if one day you wish to leave,

188
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,750
I definitely will not stop you.

189
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,660
To leave or to stay,

190
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,910
you decide for yourself.

191
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,680
Empress Mother,

192
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,270
I don't want to let her go.

193
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,300
I...

194
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,520
I can use imperial power,

195
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,500
yes,

196
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,000
I can use imperial power to control her.

197
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,550
I have this right.

198
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,200
But how would that be different

199
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,440
from my Father Emperor?

200
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:53,070
If I do this,

201
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,930
will I become

202
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,220
like him?

203
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:45,940
♫Lighting a pair of red candles to shield the cold moonlight♫

204
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:52,950
♫In the courtyard, intertwined crabapple blossoms stand together against the frost and wind♫

205
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:51,690
Chuyun?

206
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,560
Your Majesty.

207
00:14:54,330 --> 00:15:00,300
♫But this time, falling for you is not a lie♫

208
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,240
Raise.

209
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,290
You don't need to bow to me.

210
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,670
Don't you want to leave?

211
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:08,040
♫Yet I'm still in the game, so how could I dare proclaim?♫

212
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,630
Do you want me to leave?

213
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,200
How is that possible?

214
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,690
But that day...

215
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,260
I thought about it these days.

216
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:13,300
♫Whose mask, whose labyrinth?♫

217
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,560
If I let something

218
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,110
that hasn't happened yet

219
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:16,800
♫I bury my love and hate, just to share each dawn and dusk with you♫

220
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,570
affect the present,

221
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,640
what is the difference between this

222
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,440
♫I dare not long for you, so I can only hide my feelings♫

223
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:20,400
and what the late emperor did?

224
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,050
♫Within the shadow of a blade♫

225
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,510
Besides...

226
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,370
♫Whose springtime, whose soaring feather?♫

227
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:30,800
♫I melt away my frozen walls, promising to be with you♫

228
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:30,910
This is also

229
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:34,510
♫Looking back, I see this love was a stratagem♫

230
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,860
the reason I want to stay.

231
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:40,640
♫Yet you have been by my side all along♫

232
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,600
You're pregnant?

233
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,420
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

234
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,270
Congratulations, Empress.

235
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,710
Your Majesty is blessed with double happiness.

236
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,460
♫Through the mist, the light ahead grows ever clearer♫

237
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:06,790
♫And all along, you have been the truth I've been searching for♫

238
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:11,620
♫Whose mask, whose labyrinth?♫

239
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:13,150
Long live Your Majesty!

240
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,120
♫I bury my love and hate, just to share each dawn and dusk with you♫

241
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,760
♫I dare not long for you, so I can only hide my feelings♫

242
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,370
♫Within the shadow of a blade♫

243
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:25,690
♫Whose springtime, whose soaring feather?♫

244
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,120
♫I melt away my frozen walls, promising to be with you♫

245
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,830
♫Looking back, I see this love was a stratagem♫

246
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:38,960
♫Yet you have been by my side all along♫
