167
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,390

169
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,480
Six years ago?

170
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,000
You mean

171
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,059
the Zhao family was accused of colluding with enemy states

172
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,909
because letters of correspondence

173
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,169
were found in their residence?

but your residence

178
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:51,600

179
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,530
for him to act in secret.

180
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,170
So

181
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:02,120
that massacre at the hands of bandits happened instead.

182
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,140
When he couldn't

183
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,320
find a justifiable excuse to eliminate my father,

184
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,020
he simply chose to have us killed outright.

185
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,790

191

and try to leave it there.

192
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
We'll use it as bait

193
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,840
and put on a good show.

194
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,670
You're truly

195
