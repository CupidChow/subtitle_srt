[Episode 15]

3
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,660
I've examined the bodies of Minister Lu's family

4
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,450
thoroughly.

5
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,600
It's definitely suicide by hanging.

6
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:04,480
No signs of coercion.

7
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,690
And the Imperial Granary.

8
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,950
I've turned every corner inside out.

9
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,220
There's not even a mouse hole.

10
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,650
You are diligent and responsible,

11
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,870
a pillar of the court indeed.

12
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,680
Look,

13
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,039
even if Minister Lu embezzled money by taking advantage of his position,

14
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,320
there should be some traces at his home, right?

15
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:24,860
I've searched back and forth,

16
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:25,980
but still found nothing.

17
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,220
Where do you think he hid the money?

18
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,350
Where did he hide it?

19
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,590
Your High...

20
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,080
Young Master,

21
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,280
this case is crucial for your career.

22
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:38,070
Why aren't you

23
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,120
concerned about it?

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,229
Jiang Qi,

25
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,780
let me ask you,

26
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:44,550
where would you hide

27
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,150
a cup of water

28
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,789
to attract the least attention?

29
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,500
A cup of water?

30
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,310
Naturally, hiding it in a teapot

31
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,479
would be the least conspicuous.

32
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,120
Indeed.

33
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,120
Three million taels of silver,

34
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,040
only by flowing into

35
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,230
the market transactions,

36
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,000
perhaps,

37
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,640
would not draw attention.

38
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,260
I understand now.

39
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,400
That's why you sent someone

40
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,560
to investigate draft banks.

41
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,579
Such a large amount of official silver ingots

42
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,120
all have chiseled inscriptions.

43
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,230
To circulate in the market,

44
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,520
they must be exchanged for bank notes

45
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,400
in draft banks.

46
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,710
Not just that.

47
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,820
Exchanging silver for bank notes

48
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,310
will leave records of all transactions.

49
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,860
No matter who receives

50
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,100
or spends it,

51
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:35,190
we can always find some clues.

52
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,820
You're truly talented.

53
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,630
I'll just watch,

54
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,260
waiting for the case to be solved soon.

55
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,579
It's already the hour of the Rat,

56
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,510
and Xue Ping hasn't returned yet.

57
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,700
Has something happened?

58
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,790
Let's wait a bit longer.

59
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:07,750
How is it?

60
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,910
Have you found anything?

61
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:09,860
Your Highness,

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,510
Deputy Chief Jiang,

00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,660
I've sent people

64
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,790
to thoroughly investigate

65
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,790
all the draft banks in the city.

66
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,290
Nothing has been found,

67
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,790
and there's no excess silver either.

Nothing has been found out!

72
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,840
Is this all you have to tell me?

73
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,970
It seems His Highness's handling of this matter

74
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,940
has not pleased Father Emperor.

75
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,970
His Majesty attaches great importance to this case.

76
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,380
The progress has been slow.

77
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,680
Naturally, some urging is needed.

78
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,140
So, Minister Shen, do you think

79
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,070
that my second brother who dealt with my eldest brother

80
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:54,980
and then handled

81

requires evidence.

86
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,100
Without evidence,

87
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,380
it's nothing at all.

88
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,520
You have a point.

89
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,579
But don't worry, Minister Shen.

90
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,550
This time,

91
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,089
he won't find anything.

92
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,750
How could His Majesty do such a thing?

93
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,190
It's such a large inkstone.

94
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:45,780
He just smashed it right in your face.

95
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,110
It left such a big wound.

96
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,820
My father

97
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,159
hates it most when people take his things

98
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,280
without asking.

99
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:56,190
What he cares about

100
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,750
is not the three million taels of silver

101
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,110
but that someone is challenging his authority.

102
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,460

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,020
with nowhere to vent his anger,

105
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,140
he had no choice...

106
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,550
But to take it out on me.

107
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:21,700
Where is the Crown Princess?

108
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,950
Is she in the mansion?

109
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,500
My Lady.

110
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,380
This is a copy of

111
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,870
the military pay distribution register.

112
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,820
The original register is no longer available.

113
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,700
These past few days,

114
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,140
I've secretly contacted a few

115
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,550
elders who are still in the military.

116
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,990
I've also asked them about it.

117
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:45,260
Now, browsing through this register,

118
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,080
I'm more certain about it.

119
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,150
You mean...

120
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,510
Every June

121
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,040
is when the court distributes the military pay.

122
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,630
However, every time,

123
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,990
it was delayed for several months.

124
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,310
At the longest,

125
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,460
the pay wasn't distributed until the end of the year.

126
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,790
My father couldn't bear

127
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,940
to see the soldiers shed blood and cry for gaining nothing back.

128
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,580
So he used his own money to make up the difference.

129
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,260
General Xu

130
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,820
was so considerate of us.

131
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,990
Who would have thought it would become...

132
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,220
Would become...

133
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,220
It became evidence of our Xu family

134
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,460
winning over the army

135
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,190
with the intention of rebellion.

136
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,670
I remember clearly

137
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,580
that the annual military pay distributed by the court

138
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,310
is also around three million taels.

139
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:44,140
And the delay in distribution

140
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,140
coincides with

141
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,780
the time

142
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,430
of this treasury theft case.

you prepared for me?

156
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,190

Even a dog at the Crown Prince Mansion's gate

161
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:15,340
could be the Third Prince's informant now.

162

163

Even if you disguise yourself to go out now,

164
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,030
you might be followed for two blocks.

165
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,460
Is there any other way

166
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,630
besides disguising yourself

167
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,780
to go out and investigate?

168

170
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:35,860

combining the cases makes sense.

00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,340
If the person who stole the money

194
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,820
leaves three million taels unused,

195
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,150
what's the difference between money and a rock?

196
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,990
Since nothing has been found in draft banks,

197
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,910
it should be

198
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,410
in the hands of those loan sharks.

199
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,400
So you knew all along.

200
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,030
I'm useless

201
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,340
yet still somewhat clever.

202
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,070
Since we've hit a wall,

203
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:57,910
we need to find

204
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:59,460
another way.

205
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,340
Let's go.

206
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:04,820
Move it over there.

207
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,980
Young lady,

208
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,620
are you here to see us

209
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,860
at the Hongda Private Bank?

210
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,630
I want...

211
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,240
To borrow some money.

212
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,400
Borrow money?

213
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,400
That's easy.

214
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,860
Do you have any collateral?

215
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,910
I have a land deed,

216
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,180
but I need money urgently.

217
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,390
Can I borrow money today?

218
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:44,520
Today?

219
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,550
We are a legitimate private bank.

220
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,030
Lending money requires a process.

221
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,700
It takes at least four or five days

222
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,070
to verify your collateral.

223
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,510
You're in such a hurry...

224
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,740
Please, Sir, be kind

225
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,860
and make an exception.

226
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,660
Someone at home is sick

227
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,060
and in critical condition.

228
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,250
We can negotiate the terms.

229
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,670
Leave, leave!

230
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,500
It's a no, and that's final!

231
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,270
If you can't wait,

232
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,100
don't get in the way here!

233
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,500
Leave!

234
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,030
Hurry!

235
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,170
Come on.

236
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,050
We're being watched.

237
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,200
It doesn't matter.

238
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,610
He's the one we've been waiting for.

239
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,800
Sister,

240
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,460
what should we do now?

241
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,980
If we can't borrow money,

242
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,610
Father, Mother,

243
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,020
Big Brother, and Second Brother

244
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:36,560
will all die from illness.

245
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,580
Don't panic, Sister.

246
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,830
There must be a way.

247
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:40,820
Wait.

248
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,480
Ladies, please wait.

249
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,670
May I ask

250
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,310
if you're in urgent need of money for your family?

251
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,910
How do you know?

252
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:50,910
I saw you just now

253
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,950
go to the Hongda Private Bank

254
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:52,950
to borrow money.

255
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:54,920
They didn't lend money to you, did they?

256
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,580
I know a place

257
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,670
where you can borrow money.

258
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:01,180
But the terms are quite harsh.

259
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,220
What do you think?

260
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,710
Aren't you in urgent need of money?

261
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,930
Saving lives is the priority.

262
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,460
Then please lead the way, Sir.

263
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,190
Let's go.
