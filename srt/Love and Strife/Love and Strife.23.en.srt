[Love and Strife]

00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:55,970
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,020
Go check over there!

4
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,340
Shu Guifei has truly gone mad.

5
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,480
But

6
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,670
she and the Emperor

7
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,640
are a perfect match—

8
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,820
both ruthless and merciless.

9
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:33,950
Your Highness,

10
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,850
don't be too upset.

11
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:36,700
The Empress...

12
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,800
I've known for a long time.

13
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:39,860
The Jiang family

14
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,060
has always been cruel

15
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,050
and calculating.

16
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:45,180
Maybe

17
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:46,789
he did have real feelings

18
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:47,920
for my mother once,

19
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:49,710
but none of that

20
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,390
could ever compare to the power in his hands.

21
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,479
Whether it's me,

22
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,770
Jiang Yunhao,

23
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,750
whom he has favored all these years,

24
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,810
or your Xu family—

25
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,870
we are all just pawns

26
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,230
he can discard at any time.

27
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,160
The moment we become an obstacle in his eyes,

28
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,650
our fate

29
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:10,039
is nothing but destruction.

30
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,180
Your Highness...

31
00:02:16,329 --> 00:02:16,980
Chuyun,

32
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,600
you don't need to pity me.

33
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,640
That's the last thing I need.

34
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,130
Then what should we do next?

35
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,079
Honey,

36
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,180
can I have your

37
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,740
complete trust?

38
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,560
Your Highness, be careful!

39
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,080
Let's go!

40
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:00,620
Let's go.

41
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,500
Let's go.

42
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:49,630
♫Lighting a pair of red candles to shield the cold moonlight♫

43
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,900
Chuyun, go now!

44
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,630
♫In the courtyard, intertwined crabapple blossoms stand together against the frost and wind♫

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,770
Darling,

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,600
you'll be fine, won't you?

47
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:03,980
♫But this time, falling for you is not a lie♫

48
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,810
Of course, I'll be fine.

49
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,240
I'm still waiting for you

50
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,050
to bring reinforcements to save me.

51
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:11,730
♫Yet I'm still in the game, so how could I dare proclaim?♫

52
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,170
Chuyun, go!

53
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,310
Go quickly!

54
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,980
♫Whose mask, whose labyrinth?♫

55
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,480
♫I bury my love and hate, just to share each dawn and dusk with you♫

56
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,120
♫I dare not long for you, so I can only hide my feelings♫

57
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,730
♫Within the shadow of a blade♫

58
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,050
♫Whose springtime, whose soaring feather?♫

59
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,480
♫I melt away my frozen walls, promising to be with you♫

60
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,190
♫Looking back, I see this love was a stratagem♫

61
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:44,310
♫Yet you have been by my side all along♫

62
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,590
Brother,

63
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,370
you went through all that

64
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:06,580
just to help Xu Chuyun escape?

65
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,140
Don't worry;

66
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,740
I never intended to kill her anyway.

67
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:13,450
Jiang Yunhao,

68
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,640
it's not too late

69
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,130
to stop now.

70
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,000
Do you still think

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,480
you're the Crown Prince?

72
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,440
Once the morning court session begins,

73
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,680
everything will be settled then.

74
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,180
Since we are brothers,

75
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,090
I'll grant you the chance to take your own life—

76
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,630
at least I'll leave your body intact.

77
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,300
What are you laughing at?

78
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,200
I'm laughing at your foolishness.

79
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,830
What do you mean?

80
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,350
Do you really think

81
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,900
you've already won?

82
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,180
You don't actually believe

83
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,770
I would come here alone,

84
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,050
tricked by a few words from Shen Yuanyuan, do you?

85
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,750
Jiang Yunsheng,

86
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,310
are you still struggling

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,190
even in your final moments?

88
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,540
Don't worry.

89
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,520
Once you're dead,

90
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,450
I'll make sure to bring Xu Chuyun back

91
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:18,490
and take her into the palace

92
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,330
as a consort.

93
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,690
She was never someone you could covet.

94
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,070
How is this possible?

95
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:42,820
I already told you that

96
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,650
I didn't come here alone.

97
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,430
If that's the case,

98
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,250
they can all die here

99
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,560
with you.

100
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,310
Kill!

101
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,060
Kill!

102
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,540
Why are you panicking?

103
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:10,650
If you want to be the Empress,

104
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,270
you must carry yourself with absolute composure.

105
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,080
You're right, Mother.

106
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,370
I really did underestimate

107
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,480
that bastard.

108
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,070
And you...

109
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,270
You couldn't even convince your father,

110
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,800
just sitting back and looking out for yourself.

111
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:29,950
I...

112
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:30,700
Never mind.

113
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,730
It doesn't matter if he doesn't come.

114
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,809
Hao'er is going to win today anyway.

115
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,850
Jiang Yunsheng,

116
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,610
you're done for!

117
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,180
You talk too much.

118
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,790
Xu's Army, hear my command!

119
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,070
Follow me

120
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,250
in exterminating these traitors,

121
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,320
purging the court,

122
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,530
and rescuing His Majesty!

123
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,070
Exterminate the traitors!

124
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,340
Purge the court!

125
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,560
Exterminate the traitors! Purge the court!

126
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,890
Exterminate the traitors! Purge the court!

127
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,950
Exterminate the traitors! Purge the court!

128
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,860
Exterminate the traitors! Purge the court!

129
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,550
Exterminate the traitors! Purge the court!

130
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:19,580
How is this possible?

131
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,810
My Crown Princess

132
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,060
came to save me.

133
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,040
The Xu family's Tiger Tally?

134
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,220
Xu Chuyun actually took it out

135
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,560
for a loser like you?

136
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,200
Of course.

137
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,070
After all, we are

138
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,730
in this together.

139
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,210
You've lost.

140
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,150
Darling,

141
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,560
I'm late.

142
00:09:59,400 --> 00:09:59,970
Not late.

143
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:01,860
Just in time.

144
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:06,640
Jiang Yunsheng,

145
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,270
how can you act tough?

146
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,270
Minister Shen?

147
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,610
Minister Shen, you've come at the right time.

148
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,500
Jiang Yunsheng tried to assassinate the Father Emperor—

149
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,140
he's plotting to seize the throne!

150
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,310
Jiang Yunhao,

151
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,640
do you really think anyone

152
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,710
still believes a word you say?

153
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:25,660
Xu Chuyun,

154
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,540
don't be fooled by him!

155
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,640
He's just using you

156
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,570
to seize the throne.

157
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,320
Aren't you seeking revenge?

158
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,980
I can help you.

159
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,280
Father!

160
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:39,730
Father!

161
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,330
Please help the Third Prince.

162
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,490
The Crown Prince is rebelling and he's trying to kill the Emperor!

163
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,210
I greet Your Highness.

164
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,530
We await your command.

165
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:56,800
Shall we

166
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,550
arrest the traitor Jiang Yunhao

167
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,220
and take him to the Court of Judicial Review?

168
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:01,690
Father,

169
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,260
what are you saying?

170
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,270
Minister Shen!

171
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,770
Third Prince Jiang Yunhao

172
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,580
has committed the unforgivable crimes

173
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,150
of defying his sovereign,

174
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,810
regicide, and patricide.

175
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,950
However, I will spare your life.

176
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,640
You are stripped of your title and reduced to a commoner.

177
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,150
You will be confined for life

178
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,380
and forbidden from leaving the estate.

179
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,870
I

180
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,610
am grateful for Father Emperor's mercy!

181
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,310
Consort Shu,

182
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,270
I didn't treat you badly, right?

183
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,010
Yet you dare to try to kill me?

184
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,440
Not bad?

185
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,760
Do you really think so?

186
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,370
All these years,

187
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:08,510
you have been

188
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,290
the consort I cherished the most.

189
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,130
The consort you cherished the most?

190
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,480
Your Majesty,

191
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,580
after all these years,

192
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,850
have you ever gently

193
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,630
brushed my hair?

194
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,090
Have you ever drawn my brows for me?

195
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,080
Have you ever

196
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,810
carved a hairpin for me with your own hands?

197
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:38,740
No.

198
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,780
You have never

199
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,170
done any of these things for me.

200
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,490
These are all trivial matters.

201
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,430
I've given you wealth and glory.

202
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,330
Isn't that enough?

203
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,850
Of course it's not enough.

204
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
You've done all these things for the Empress.

205
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,050
You brushed her hair,

206
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,490
drew her brows,

207
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,280
even

208
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,860
carved a jade hairpin for her with your own hands.

209
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:05,010
Why could you do those things

210
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,950
for her

211
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,130
but not for me?

212
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,550
Couldn't you

213
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,520
have loved me just a little more?

214
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,590
Jiang Zheng!

215
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:14,550
You...

216
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,480
That bitch

217
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,050
should have died long ago.

218
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,550
Even if I die,

219
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,840
I'll drag

220
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,600
that woman's child

221
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,980
down with me!
