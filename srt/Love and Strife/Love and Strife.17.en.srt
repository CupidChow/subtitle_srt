[Love and Strife]

2
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,970
[Episode 17]

3
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,390
Your Highness,

4
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,560
this is an invitation

5
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,420
sent by the Third Prince.

6
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,069
It's for the Crown Princess.

7
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,430
For me?

8
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,539
Shen Yuanyuan

9
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,070
actually invited me to her mansion

10
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:21,810
to attend the Earth Worship Festival banquet?

11
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,039
Let's not mention

12
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:26,200
that we're at odds with each other,

13
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,950
but Jiang Yunhao didn't even try to stop her.

14
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,430
I've already told you

15
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,430
that the only one he's guarding against

16
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,440
is me.

17
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:35,560
Honey,

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,789
the opportunity has presented itself.

19
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,750
Su Zhu,

20
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:42,160
hurry up and go to the storage

21
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:42,750
to find

22
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,140
a nice set of jewelry for me.

23
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes.

24
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,030
Greetings, Third Princess Consort.

25
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,950
Please rise.

26
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,070
Although I am now a princess consort,

27
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,740
my friendship with you remains unchanged.

28
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,350
Sisters,

29
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,070
please don't feel distant from me.

30
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,310
Why haven't I seen the Crown Princess?

31
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:15,680
Has she not arrived yet?

32
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,310
Third Princess Consort, you invited me so warmly.

33
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,000
How could I not come?

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,900
Greetings,

35
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,610
Crown Princess.

36
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,190
Third Sister-in-law,

37
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,800
long time no see.

38
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,790
This is the first time

39
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,630
that you've greeted me since you became

40
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,360
the Third Princess Consort, right?

41
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,910
Greetings, Crown Princess.

42
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,000
Third Sister-in-law, please rise.

43
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,950
Everyone, please rise as well.

44
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,110
Today

45
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,660
is truly lively.

46
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,400
How have the things I instructed

47
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,120
been arranged?

48
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,560
Rest assured, Your Highness.

49
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,060
That's good.

50
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:37,860
Today, we must catch

51
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,329
that beautiful little sparrow

52
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,829
and lock her in this golden birdcage.

53
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,280
Alright?

54
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:51,800
Wonderful.

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,800
Great.

56
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,100
Third Sister-in-law,

57
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,560
what a grand display.

58
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,220
Mother has advised me

59
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,910
that as a princess consort,

60
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,280
I must always maintain proper demeanor.

61
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,540
Then it seems

62
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,800
I am the ignorant one.

63
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:21,130
Your Highness, you haven't been in the capital for long

64
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,240
and entered the Eastern Palace soon after.

65
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,390
It's understandable that you are unaware

66
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,630
of many things.

67
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,990
Seeking guidance from the Third Princess Consort more often

68
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,770
is nothing to be ashamed of.

69
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,680
Noisy.

70
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,380
You...

71
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,630
-You...
-What?

72
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,140
You're showing no respect.

73
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,900
What are you so smug about?

74
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,159
When the Crown Prince is deposed,

75
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,000
you'll be nothing more than

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,830
a soon-to-be deposed

77
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,600
Crown Princess!

78
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,070
Are you alright?

79
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,920
Speaking so recklessly about the Crown Prince—

80
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:10,940
how many lives do you think you have?

81
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,560
Your Highness,

82
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,210
she...

83
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,950
Third Sister-in-law, you allowed her to insult me like this.

84
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,950
Was it the Third Prince's instruction?

85
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,360
Does the Third Prince

86
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,260
harbor treasonous thoughts?

87
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,870
You're the daughter of Deputy Minister Qiao,

88
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,750
aren't you?

89
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:30,070
Is this how your father

90
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,430
taught you to behave?

91
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,950
Third Sister-in-law, please show me the way.

92
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,650
My dress is wet.

93
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,630
I need to get changed.

94
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:42,920
Ming Zhu,

95
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,370
send the Crown Princess to the side chamber.

96
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,870
The Crown Princess's demeanor

97
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:57,159
is truly different from when she first entered the palace.

98
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,680
You offended the Crown Princess

99
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,240
and spoke recklessly about the Crown Prince.

100
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:04,350
Guards!

101
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:05,870
Take her away.

102
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,560
Third Princess Consort,

103
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,000
you can't...

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,850
Let go of me!

105
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,990
Useless.

106
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:39,800
Crown Princess,

107
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,870
you're really so reluctant to see me?

108
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,360
Third Brother, why are you here?

109
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,500
Third Brother?

110
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,750
You actually address me the same way

111
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,740
as that loser?

112
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,510
Third Brother, mind your words.

113
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,270
He is the Crown Prince,

114
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,630
your elder brother.

115
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,870
Elder brother?

116
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,350
I have never taken that loser

117
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,660
seriously.

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,630
With the Ministry of Revenue's silver stolen this time,

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,070
he will surely be punished by Father Emperor.

120
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,510
Who knows

121
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,480
if he can keep his title

122
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,800
as Crown Prince?

123
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,450
Both favor and disgrace

124
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:20,550
are bestowed by the Emperor's grace.

125
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,800
Interesting.

126
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,680
Are you really this loyal

127
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,750
to that loser?

128
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,560
What if one day

129
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,800
he loses his power?

130
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,560
Don't worry.

131
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
By then, I'll definitely

132
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,630
take you in

133
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:41,920
as my...

134
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,430
concubine.

135
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,000
When I ascend the throne in the future,

136
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,640
there will always be a consort position for you.

137
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,440
Jiang Yunhao,

138
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,430
how dare you!

139
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,000
Let go!

140
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,620
Your Highness!

141
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
Instead of hosting the banquet outside,

142
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,360
why have you come here?

143
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,090
I just came to see

144
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,160
if the Crown Princess has finished changing.

145
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,600
But Your Highness,

146
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,940
why are you in a side chamber

147
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,280
prepared for female guests?

148
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,590
Do what you're supposed to do.

149
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,040
Xu Chuyun!

150
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,720
What?

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,320
You've gone too far!

152
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,960
Let me give you a piece of advice.

153
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,100
Don't think too highly of yourself.

154
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,200
Let's talk.

155
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,550
Alright.

156
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,960
Why haven't the Crown Princess and the Third Princess Consort

157
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,270
returned yet?

158
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,000
Indeed.

159
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,440
Let's go check on them.

160
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,000
The Crown Princess is missing!

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,750
Crown Princess!

162
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,360
Come and help me

163
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,910
find the Crown Princess.

164
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,080
How could she be missing?

165
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,670
Please, everyone.

166
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,840
Please help me find her.

167
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:14,790
Your Highness!

168
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,320
Let's go and find her.

169
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:15,720
Okay.

170
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,750
Crown Princess!

171
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:17,200
Your Highness!

172
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:17,970
Crown Princess!

173
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,200
Crown Princess!

174
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,910
Your Highness!

175
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:22,200
Crown Princess!

176
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,480
This...

177
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:28,270
What's going on here?

178
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,320
What's going on?

179
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,030
Your Highness!

180
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,240
Your Highness!

181
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,670
There's blood!

182
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,510
Why is there blood?

183
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:38,720
What happened here?

184
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,960
This is our Crown Princess's hairpin.

185
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,290
Father Emperor!

186
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,750
You must stand up for me

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,840
and make the Third Brother

188
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,120
hand over the Crown Princess.

189
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,240
What does this have to do with me?

190
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,630
My princess consort is also missing!

191
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,270
Third Brother,

192
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,440
we are brothers after all.

193
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,750
Why did you take it this far?

194
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,270
Even though I caused you to be punished

195
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,390
when I was investigating the case before,

196
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,910
you shouldn't have harmed Chuyun.

197
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,240
She is innocent!

198
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,200
Are you deaf?

199
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,960
I told you I didn't do it!

200
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,480
She disappeared from your mansion.

201
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:03,590
Third Prince's Mansion is heavily guarded.

202
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,360
How could someone just disappear

203
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,120
without a trace?

204
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,030
Are you a dog?

205
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,610
Father Emperor!

206
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,310
Enough!

207
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,480
You tell me.

208
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:26,600
Your Highness,

209
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,960
you saved my family.

210
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,430
I am deeply grateful

211
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,270
and will repay your kindness with my life.

212
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,060
What I want you to do is very simple.

213
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,870
Just do whatever

214
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,910
the Third Prince

215
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,510
asks you to do.

216
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,750
However,

217
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,600
when it comes to critical moments,

218
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,260
don't forget who you're working for.

219
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,670
Yes.

220
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,780
I don't know either.

221
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:55,870
It's just that

222
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,000
the Third Princess Consort ordered me earlier

223
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,510
that I...

224
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:01,850
that I must...

225
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,650
must...

226
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,870
must lead the Crown Princess into a secluded place

227
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,120
and ruin her reputation.

228
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,510
I didn't mean it!

229
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,870
I was just following

230
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,530
the Third Princess Consort's orders.

231
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,940
I think you're asking for death!

232
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,840
Quiet!

233
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,550
The Third Prince will be temporarily confined in the palace.

234
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,150
The Crown Prince will investigate

235
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,080
the disappearance of the Crown Princess

236
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,030
and the Third Princess Consort.

237
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,120
I permit you

238
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,320
to search Third Prince's Mansion.

239
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,560
Father Emperor,

240
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,670
I accept the decree.
