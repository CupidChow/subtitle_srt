1
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:33,200
You're here

2
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,120
Darn it.

3
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,920
Bai Wu Chang!

4
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,080
Damn you!

5
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,360
Xiang, you always do this.

6
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,960
Stop messing around.

7
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,720
If it weren't for you guys,

8
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,800
do I have to work overtime here every day?

9
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,480
Lin Chen.

10
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,320
Bai Wu Chang is your master.

11
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,200
Damn you!

12
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,960
I'm not talented.

13
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,639
I'm your old man.

14
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,360
Get lost!

15
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:19,000
What is this?

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,400
This

17
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,600
This is for our temple's morning class.

18
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,200
We need it tomorrow morning.

19
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,400
Come here.

20
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,680
Look at you guys.

21
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,640
You can't defend yourself.

22
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,760
You have to come in even if you dig a hole.

23
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,120
I can only lead the way

24
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,880
to avoid unnecessary casualties.

25
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,280
How can you lead the way?

26
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,360
You'll be scared if you don't fall.

27
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,720
You liar.

28
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,760
Don't blame others.

29
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,800
Who are you calling a swindler?

30
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,440
I'm practising Maoshan Magic.

31
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,800
A decent sect.

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,920
Humph.

33
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,920
It's a mirror.

34
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,940
It reflects everyone's face.

35
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,280
If you're guilty, you'll be scared.

36
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,079
I can only see the light

37
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,360
I can only see the light.

38
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,040
Friend,

39
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,720
You're dirty.

40
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,120
Aren't you just playing tricks?

41
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,850
Don't pretend to be confident.

42
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,360
Let's go. Okay.

43
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,130
Here, eat it while it's hot.

44
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,840
These dishes are our specialties.

45
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,079
I didn't expect

46
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,600
You're not good.

47
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Not bad.

48
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,280
Exactly.

49
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,600
There's heartbreak grass in this dish.

50
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,600
How does it taste?

51
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,280
I lied to him.

52
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,280
We should eat and drink.

53
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,680
You little...

54
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,800
You're so evil.

55
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,360
There are mountains here.

56
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,490
The plants are rich.

57
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,440
It's indeed a beautiful place.

58
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,000
Young lady, eat more.

59
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,040
You need to eat to get better.

60
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,840
There are Japanese priests

61
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,200
there were Japanese priests here to explore the mountain in the last century.

62
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,730
I don't know what he's up to.

63
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Japanese priest.

64
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,200
Are you talking about Onmyoji?

65
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,400
Yes. What's his name?

66
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,959
It's the first class.

67
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,480
In 1944

68
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,160
It's 1944 again.

69
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,920
[Great grandpa found out.]

70
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,280
Lin Chen's great-grandfather is missing.

71
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,960
[The Japanese sorcerer scouted the mountain.]

72
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,680
in 1944.

73
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,920
Is this a coincidence?

74
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,560
Hey, Xiang.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,659
Take a look.

76
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,360
Is something wrong with this medicine?

77
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,170
Are you serious?

78
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,400
This is western medicine.

79
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,360
I'm a priest.

80
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,560
You're making things difficult for me.

81
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,440
Qian is a priest.

82
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,040
Anyway, we're in the same boat.

83
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,000
Take a look.

84
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
Where did you get this medicine?

85
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,360
This is the medicine Xu Peiyu used.

86
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,480
But I always feel

87
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,480
it's not something serious.

88
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,160
She has been having nightmares.

89
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,120
I'm afraid...

90
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,320
The rich family is so bad.

91
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,920
I have something urgent to do.

92
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,960
You guys talk.

93
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,320
Go ahead.

94
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,800
what is the guard

95
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,600
guarding?

96
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,460
Is it really the deserted mountains and mountains?

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,200
Do you want to ask

98
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,520
or Jang Kyu-ho?

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,330
what's the difference?

100
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,480
Xu Peiyu, what do I want

101
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,600
What do I want?

102
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,800
I just want 700,000 yuan.

103
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,159
What about those people?

104
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,320
Why did they follow you all the way?

105
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,250
What do you mean?

106
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,480
Nothing.

107
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,600
Just tell Seo.

108
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,640
We have a lot of good stuff

109
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,170
there are many good things.

110
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,160
There are many heroes in Mount Causeway.

111
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,640
Emperor Taizu Song and Uncle Zhang had a good talk.

112
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,520
But when it comes to the guardian,

113
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,080
we need to mention Huang Nest.

114
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,240
Is it the Yellow King?

115
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,840
The Yellow Nest led an army to pass by the Copper Hill.

116
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,160
and left a treasure here.

117
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,440
Send someone to guard it.

118
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,300
was the ancestor of my Lin family.

119
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,640
My Lin family is prospering in Mount Causeway.

120
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,880
passed down from generation to generation.

121
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,800
guarding the treasure in the mountain

122
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,930
and the dragon vein.

123
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,560
and the spirit of the mountain.

124
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,650
Something is wrong with the medicine.

125
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,360
The mountain road is dangerous.

126
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,520
I'll go with you in the future.

127
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,480
Pack up.

128
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,140
I'll take you to the waterway.

129
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,159
Peiyu.

130
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,650
Here's the milk.

131
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
Sorry, sorry.

132
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,240
It's okay, Peiyu.

133
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,160
Let me pour you another cup.

134
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,760
It’s hard to digest with milk in the morning.

135
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,760
Miss Xu, drink hot water.

136
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,400
Drinking milk every morning is Peiyu's habit.

137
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,320
Some habits should be changed earlier.

138
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,360
Right?

139
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,280
Let's go.

140
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
Let's go.

141
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,280
A token.

142
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,680
