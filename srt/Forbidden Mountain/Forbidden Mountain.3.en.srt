00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:13,820
Global First Line (Beijing) Film and Culture Co., Ltd.

5
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,020
What happened?

6
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,420
The car can only stop here.

7
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,960
Peiyu.

8
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,120
We've been in the mountain for half a day.

9
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,240
You carry so many.

10
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,170
Are you going to treat me to a feast?

11
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,400
Let's go.

12
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,440
This Mount Causeway is in the chest of the Nangan Dragon Vein.

13
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,480
Zhong Ling is outstanding.

14
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,600
He's a famous man.

15
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,320
Are you interested

16
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,600
stay here for a few months?

17
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,000
I happen to have a hostel.

18
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,290
You even open a guesthouse?

19
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,280
If you're willing to stay, I'll open tomorrow.

20
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,160
A big discount for opening.

21
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,360
I'll give you 20% off.

22
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,560
I heard that the dragon vein is full of geomancy.

23
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,920
I don't know what it says.

24
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,520
Mr. Zhang is an expert.

25
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,240
The three dragons came from Kunlun.

26
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,320
Our South Dragon

27
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,520
is spiritual.

28
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,800
It's a beautiful place.

29
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,730
There are more scholars to assist.

30
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,340
Since it's on the Dragon Vein,

31
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,280
it should be a good place.

32
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,320
But why is Mount Causeway sealed for a thousand years?

33
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,320
Could it be...

34
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,320
something is inside?

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Mount Causeway.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,440
There are wild people.

37
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,800
Boring.

38
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,680
Don't you think the fog is weird?

39
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,960
It's like he doesn't want us to see what's inside.

40
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,000
Let's go.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,040
Wait.

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,920
The bamboo forest is foggy.

43
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,050
Sorry to bother you.

44
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,320
I'll turn back now.

45
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:54,160
You're playing tricks.

46
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,760
Just leave when I tell you to.

47
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,600
Go yourself if you want to die.

48
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,860
No one dares to enter the foggy mountain.

49
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,560
Peiyu.

50
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Am I a dragon or a human?

51
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,120
A dragon or a human?

52
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,530
Is it a dragon or a human?

53
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,640
It's Snake Fairy.

54
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,760
Miss Xu.

55
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,240
Say it's human.

56
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,080
What demon?

57
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,120
Bai Qi.

58
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,360
Bai Qi.

59
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,520
Bai Qi.

60
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,770
You're so annoying.

61
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,040
Wait here.

62
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,300
I'll go in and find him.

63
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,120
Peiyu.

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,960
Why are you here?

65
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,080
Bai Qi is mine.

66
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,160
There's evil.

67
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,800
Shut up.

68
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,200
Don't talk from now on.

69
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Let's split up.

70
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,440
Every five steps I take, I knock a few Bamboos.

71
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,520
I'll knock a few times.

72
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,720
You guys knock too.

73
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,159
Ah.

74
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,500
What are you doing?

75
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,810
You're asking for trouble.

76
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,600
It's so ugly.

77
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,240
Bai Qi.

78
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,640
Bai Qi!

79
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,440
Wake up.

80
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,840
Did you see what it was?

81
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,100
When I was mopping,

82
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,640
I was knocked out.

83
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,880
There's a spirit in Mount Causeway.

84
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,210
can tell good from evil.

85
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,400
It must be one of you

86
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,770
That's why Mount Causeway warned you in this way.

87
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,080
Xu Peiyu.

88
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,120
Tell me the truth.

89
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,450
If I don't make it clear,

90
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,770
I won't take another step forward.

91
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,640
Okay, I'll tell you.

92
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,960
Great-grandpa said there is a magical medicine in the Copper Rain Mountain.

93
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,400
can cure my nightmare.

94
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,580
We came here to find the medicine.

95
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,180
There is no magical medicine in Mount Causeway.

96
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,080
If you don't want to be the guide,

97
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,760
we'll find it ourselves.

98
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,920
Peiyu.

99
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,280
Wait for my 700,000 yuan.

100
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,280
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

101
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,040
There's no magical medicine in Mount Causeway anyway.

102
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,170
If you can't find it,

103
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,600
don't forget to pay the rest.

104
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,170
My great-grandfather won't lie to me.

105
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,240

This voice

110
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,530
Something is wrong.

111
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,360
Oh no!

112
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,640
