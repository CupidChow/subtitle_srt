5
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,200
The real key

6
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,920
is me.

7
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,640
The treasure of the Yellow King.

8
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,080
and confer Lin as the guardian.

9
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,480
Leave a team of guards

10
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,539
and follow orders.

11
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,360
The Lin family has guarded the mountain for generations.

12
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,080
[The guards practise magic]

13
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,060
and become a mountain protector.

14
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,410
To open the Dragon Cave,

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,360
The descendants of the Lin family and the mountain protector...

16
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,680
Both are indispensable.

17
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,720
This step is a secret code.

18
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,009
It can activate the mechanism inside the stone gate.

19
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,880
and change the position.

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,880
Move Yin and Yang.

21
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
I command you.

22
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,560
Open.

23
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,370
The lock hole is out.

24
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,479
Put the seal in.

25
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,200
In 1944,

26
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,880
Nine chrysanthemum first-class sorcerer sneaked into the Causeway Mountain

27
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,410
to destroy the Dragon Vein.

28
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,060
and change the situation.

29
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,840
and found the treasure hunter Xu Changyuan to cooperate.

30
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,760
Xu Changyuan deceived Lin Wenda

31
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,840
in the name of archaeological protecting the national treasure

32
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,570
and brought him to Janyin Cave.

33
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,850
I didn't expect the legend of the treasure to be true.

34
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,920
There are so many treasures.

35
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,440
It's a great merit to report to the higher-ups.

36
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:33,960
Hey.

37
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,020
What are you doing?

38
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,240
You can't take these away.

39
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,880
Put it down.

40
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,720
Damn Hashina!

41
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:43,840
Kill them!

42
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,840
Lin and the others have weapons.

43
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,360
We can't defeat them.

44
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,280
Leave now. I'm here.

45
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,320
You're all dead.

46
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,920
Go out and close the door.

47
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,080
Xu, go.

48
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,840
This is national treasure.

49
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,100
You can't take it away.

50
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,440
Fine.

51
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,440
Here you are.

52
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,680
Lin!

53
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,930
The scheme of a first-class magician can't succeed.

54
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,720
Although we were trapped in the cave,

55
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,000
we were still alive.

56
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,520
and recorded it here.

57
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,620
If any descendants see it,

58
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,010
you should take this as an example.

59
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,120
This is the truth.

60
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,760
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,080
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,700
It's great-grandfather who was blinded

63
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,730
and bear the consequences.

64
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,440
Lin Chen.

65
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,120
When we get out,

66
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,240
I'll let great grandpa reveal the truth

67
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,680
and bring justice to your ancestors and the guardian.

68
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,880
Xu Peiyu.

69
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,560
At this point,

70
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,090
you still don't understand

71
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,760
who the poisonous snake of the Xu family is.

72
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,480
I'm not the one who drugged you.

73
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,250
It's my great grandpa who loves you and loves you.
