1
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,560
I'm not the one who drugged you.

2
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:21,080
but the great-grandfather who loves you and loves you.

3
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,880
What did you say?

4
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,480
Do you think Xu Changyuan really loves you?

5
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,360
You did it for him.

6
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,240
for him

7
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,360
and a scapegoat.

8
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,759
After coming back from Mount Causeway,

9
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:36,280
the Xu family seemed to have been cursed.

10
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,720
Xu Changyuan's son and grandson never lived past 25 years old.

11
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,600
So he was afraid.

12
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:46,200
He was afraid that the Xu family would have no descendants.

13
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,920
So, he started to seek immortality.

14
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,280
Master Xu.

15
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,880
I've heard a lot about you.

16
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,840
It's just that it's better to meet.

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,360
It's an honor today.

18
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,759
Qian Yigua said

19
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,640
find the cursed cave,

20
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,920
Xu Peiyu’s life

21
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,540
to exchange for the curse on her brother.

22
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,440
He asked me to add plant poison in your medicine

23
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,440
to make you hallucinate.

24
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,200
Then I'll tell you.

25
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,600
There are spiritual medicines in Mount Causeway.

26
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,079
Take care of yourself.

27
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:31,520
Okay.

28
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,560
I'll be back soon.

29
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,320
Go.

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,560
It's almost time, Peiyu.

31
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,520
I’m leaving.

32
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,640
Take care.

33
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,540
He knows you value family.

34
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,970
and take good care of your brother.

35
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,050
You will take the risk to go deep into Mount Causeway.

36
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,200
When money changes the curse,

37
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,770
your brother will live a long life.

38
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,280
And the curse of the Xu family

39
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,400
will also end with your death.

40
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,840
Peiyu.

41
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,100
I'm the only one in the world who won't lie to you.

42
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,040
Come.

43
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,600
Come to me.

44
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,960
Peiyu, don’t worry.

45
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,400
I lied to him

46
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,400
I lied to him.

47
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,720
If I didn't lie to him, that old man wouldn't have told me about him.

48
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,400
How did he get rich?

49
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,000
Now we've found the Dragon Vein.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,160
The treasure place.

51
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,079
That loser Xu Changyuan

52
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,040
He can become the richest man with one or two national treasures.

53
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,960
We have so many treasures now.

54
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,040
We can build a kingdom.

55
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,240
And you are the only queen in that kingdom.

56
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,360
Why?

57
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,079
For this little money,

58
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,440
for this money.

59
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,700
You don't understand.

60
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,900
That's because you were born with

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,220
My mom raised me by selling wild wontons.

62
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,840
I climbed up from the bottom

63
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,960
and climbed to the foot of your Xu family.

64
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,680
for 20 years.

65
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,840
But in the end, I realized

66
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,800
you opened the door of wealth with blood.

67
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,000
You can do it.

68
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,640
Why can't I?

69
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,080
Come to me.

70
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,760
I'm the only one who's sincere to you.

71
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:35,820
Listen carefully.

72
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,080
I, Xu Peiyu,

73
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,520
will never be with you

74
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,159
I won't be with you.

75
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
Why?

76
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,159
Because of Lin, right?

77
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,320
I'll kill him now.

78
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,159
Bai Qi, what are you doing?

79
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,320
Sorry, Mr. Zhang.

80
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,820
I want to repay you.

81
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,440
No.

82
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,200
Bai Qi.

83
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
You fool.

84
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,800
I've put snake powder in Lin's bag.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,360
It worked just in time.

86
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,640
Hee hee.

87
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,560
None of you can escape.

88
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,960
Watch out!

89
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,159
Oh no!

90
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,200
The stone gate is collapsing.

91
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,130
Lin Chen, we need to get out of here.

92
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,760
Xiang.

93
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,520
Take them away.

94
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,360
Okay, I'll save them.

95
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,640
Lin Chen, hurry!

96
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,600
My treasure!

97
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,240
Lin Chen!

98
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,170
Qian Yi Fortune.

99
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,200
Jang Kyu-ho.

100
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,480
Let's go.

101
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,280
One fortune teller.

102
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,200
It's all mine.

103
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,240
Mine.

104
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,440
It's mine.

105
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,840
It's all mine.

106
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,120
All my babies are mine.

107
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,480
My baby.

108
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,440
Baby.

109
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,800
My treasure.

110
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,560
Is everything done?

111
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,360
Great-grandfather, it's me.

112
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,640
It's you.

113
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,610
Where's Jang Kyu Ho?

114
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,280
Tell him to answer the phone.

115
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,600
He's dead.

116
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,159
A reporter will interview you in a few days.

117
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,570
In 1944, about the past of Mount Causeway.

118
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,520
Can we sell our building tomorrow?

119
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,720
Chairman, we can't sell the building yet.

120
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,640
The slope under our feet is too big.

121
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,360
If we change it, it will take another month.

122
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,680
If we wait any longer,

123
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,360
we'll lose too much.

124
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,640
If we fail tomorrow,

125
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,120
all of you get lost!

126
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,280
Chairman.

127
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,240
You too.

128
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,400
Hurry.

129
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,320
Ladies and gentlemen,

130
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,600
Watch your step.

131
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,730
The bridge is shaky.

132
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,680
With the investment of Xu Group,

133
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,120
Mount Causeway finally opened up to you.

134
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,200
Come on, follow me.

135
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,480
We're going to Magpie Bridge Valley next stop.

136
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,440
Magpie Bridge means

137
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,240
you will meet a good marriage here.

138
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,120
Since the red string is set,

139
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,520
we'll grow old together.

140
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,920
Watch your step.

141
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,480
Bai Qi, drive the car to pick them up.

142
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,120
Okay.

143
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,000
Come with me.

144
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,920
Get in.

145
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,360
Mr Wu's

146
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,480
is a very famous spot

147
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,840
called Jiuxian Lake.

148
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,320
And this is our turtle peak.

149
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
Pen Mountain.

150
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,500
Magpie Bridge Valley.

151
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,000
Mr. Lin, you're here to inspect.

152
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,440
Are you tired?

153
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,440
Not bad. I was looking for you.

154
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,850
Someone is waiting for you over there.

155
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,160
Lin Chen, I have 2,000 chickens at home.

156
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,560
Is it enough to marry you?

157
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,800
If you keep doing this,

158
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,960
I'll tell Bai Qi.

159
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,240
Humph.

160
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,640
There's something I don't understand.

161
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,960
What is it?

162
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,800
Tell me.

163
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,640
Why didn't the snake in the cave bite us?

164
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,100
They only bite Jang Kyu Ho.

165
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,640
Well...

166
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,600
I'll tell you later.

167
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,560
You little...

168
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,400
Actor Team.

169
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:13,840

00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:16,600
Lanjingling, Ye Miaomiao.

179
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,160
Sophisticated leaves.

181
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,520
