00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,240

00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,360
Global Line (Beijing) Film and Culture Co., Ltd.

5
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,680
I did nothing.

6
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,080
I didn't say anything.

7
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,880
Hey.

8
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,320
Lin Chen is mine.

9
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,360
It's up to you.

10
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,620
Let's stay out of each other's business.

11
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,560
Lin, don't you want your bag?

12
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,240
Wait for me.

13
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,160
I think she saw it.

14
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Be careful of her.

15
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,560
She's just a little girl. She's following me recklessly.

16
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,320
If she really causes trouble,

17
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,200
let her be buried here.

18
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,000
Be careful. Be careful.

19
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,740
Be careful, Peiyu.

20
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,520
Are you okay, Peiyu?

21
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,120
Many things can't be done by others.

22
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,410
You'll only harm others and yourself.

23
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,720
Seal off Mount Causeway.

24
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,960
Many legends have been spread.

25
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,960
They are all lies.

26
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,120
I only heard that the Python Fairy and the Turtle Fairy

27
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,400
the seven fairies who coveted this place.

28
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,400
Finally, she became a mountain peak and stood here.

29
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,160
So this lake is called Jiuxian Lake.

30
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,360
So, as a human,

31
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,840
shouldn't be too greedy.

32
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,010
If you take something that doesn't belong to you,

33
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,210
you'll be punished.

34
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,240
What are you doing?

35
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,200
It's said that Mount Guilin is the best.

36
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,280
I didn't expect that Mount Causeway is not inferior.

37
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,160
It's a pity that

38
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,760
What a pity.

39
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,120
So you want to invest?

40
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,730
Do you want me to invest?

41
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,240
Of course I want you to invest.

42
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,560
You're profit-seeking.

43
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,480
Yes.

44
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,560
You're not.

45
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,480
Why do you have to pretend to be disrespectful?

46
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,890
You risked your life to save us.

47
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,680
for that money.

48
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,800
My lady.

49
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,400
That's all you have?

50
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
Do you know

51
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,720
to us people?

52
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,560
People in the mountains have no way out.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,260
About the investment,

54
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,160
If you're feeling better...

55
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,240
I forgot to take my medicine.

56
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,360
One vitamin C per day.

57
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,440
Vitamin?

58
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,800
I changed your medicine to vitamins.

59
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,640
Take it for a year and a half.

60
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,440
Why?

61
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,200
Why did you change my medicine?

62
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,600
Haven't you noticed that ever since I changed your medicine,

63
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,330
after I changed your medicine?

64
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,940
Who prescribed the medicine for you?

65
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,640
Ms. Xu who is ignorant of the world.

66
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,140
Aunt Lan is not like Zhang Gyu Hao.

67
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,570
She doesn't know your Xu family is so rich.

68
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Believe Auntie Lan or Zhang Kyu Hao?

69
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,760
Think about it.

70
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,000
Miss Leng is running away with Lin.

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,400
When we achieve our goal,

72
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,520
It's not up to her to follow me.

73
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,640
My mom said the secret room is deceiving the heart.

74
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,600
with sharp eyes.

75
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,080
What are you two mumbling about?

76
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
Go, go, go.
