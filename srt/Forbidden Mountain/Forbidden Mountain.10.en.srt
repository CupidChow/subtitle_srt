Snake. Sister Xu has a snake.

7
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,200
The road is right.

8
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,000
This is it.

9
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,320
Dry mountains and dries toward water.

10
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,960
Gather energy and hide wind.

11
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,760
There must be a treasure.

12
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,160
Silver Cave.

13
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,880
But the entrance is empty.

14
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,400
How did they get in?

15
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,320
Who knows?

16
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,240
You're the guide.

17
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
You take the lead.

18
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,960
Then we drop the rope.

19
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,560
You go in first.

20
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,720
Then you cut the rope to avoid any trouble, right?

21
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,240
You want to buy my life with a million?

22
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,400
Are you kidding me?

23
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,560
Good for you three.

24
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,760
Lin, I told you I should have taken them back earlier.

25
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,960
Back then, the pig...

26
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,120
Darn it.

27
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,920
Stop arguing.

28
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,080
Even if you put down the rope and send him down,

29
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,540
we may not be able to get in.

30
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,650
Let's think of another way.

31
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,240
Peiyu is right.

32
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,080
We'll bring the mountain climbing equipment and take a look.

33
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,320
No need.

34
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,760
Just today.

35
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,480
Today, I'll start divination

36
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,740
is an auspicious sign.

37
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,480
You can enter the cave today.

38
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,760
You can't escape even if you want to.

39
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,440
Who do you think you are?

40
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,760
How do we get in?

41
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,280
In my opinion, this is the dragon's head.

42
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,180
As long as we find the tail,

43
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,130
we can enter the cave from the tail.

44
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,520
Let's go.

45
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,440
Slowly.

46
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,450
Watch your step. Thank you.

47
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,360
Be careful. Be careful.

48
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,720
It's here.

49
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,540
There's a mark.

50
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,600
It's here.

51
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,280
In my opinion,

52
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,080
it's not necessarily true.

53
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,520
I guess you don't know Feng Shui at all.

54
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,400
So how do you have the right

55
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,480
to go with Xu Peiyu?

56
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,240
Who told you I watched the Xu family's haunted house?

57
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,570
I'm just reminding you.

58
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,000
A liar should know how to shut up.

59
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,680
How did great-grandfather get in?

60
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,080
This is...

61
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,040
My unfilial grandson, Lin Chen.

62
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,760
Greetings, Zeng Zu.

63
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,920
Take a look.

64
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,920
This is Great-grandfather's dagger.

65
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,440
Your great-grandfather died in 1944.

66
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,159
What do you mean?

67
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,400
Maybe you don't understand.

68
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,360
we mountain guardians will only die protecting the baby.

69
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,520
And your great-grandfather

70
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,170
has stolen the Chinese treasures.

71
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,760
This is national treasure.

72
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,020
You can't take it away.

73
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,480
Fine.

74
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,730
Take it back.

75
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,080
Impossible.

76
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,410
How do you explain that?

77
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,520
A snake hunter

78
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,920
He found something right after he went to Nanyang.

79
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,840
Sorry, bro.

80
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,980
I want to repay you.

81
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,440
Lin Chen saved you too.

82
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,840
Why didn't you repay him?

83
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,300
First come, first served.

84
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,120
Lin,

85
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,400
I've had enough of you.

86
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,720
Now I have the key.

87
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,440
You're useless.

88
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,760
Jang Kyu Ho.

89
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,160
It's been nearly 100 years.

90
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,840
people have never changed.

91
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
I told you

92
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,200
the real key

93
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,320
