I won't defend him by saying he was young or that he already did his time.

Seung Hee's case was very unfortunate.

Yeah, dude. Thanks to you, we all got to skip work.

00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,490
When Dong Hee said he'd work at Thirsty Deer,

187
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,880
I was against it.

188
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,700
I had negative feelings about Seo Ji Hwan,

189
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,230
plus, I thought people might have negative associations.

190
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,720

You like this one, right?

200
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:09,530
You must face a lot of challenges running a company.

Yes, I do.

210

I had such mixed feelings about it.

230

The feelings of those people who came to see us are more important.

00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:25,950
she would like you even more.

534
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,830
Nice memories with someone nice...

535
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:33,420
I don't want to ruin them for her.

536
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:36,730
The person Eun Ha remembers

537
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:41,390
is living a good, ordinary life somewhere.

538
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:45,370
That's all she needs to know.

539
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,780
Will you be okay to go inside alone?

540
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,160
If he wanted to kill me, he would have already.

541
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,670
It's still the Chairman.

542
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,930
He sent people so I would walk in here on my own.

543
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:18,790
He won't kill me until I bow down first. Don't worry.

544
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:24,810
[Meow Company]

545
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,430
He's waiting for you inside.

546
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:17,510
Eun Ha.

547
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:19,730
Is something going on?

548
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,560
Prosecutor, you said before

549
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:28,420
that you found Hyeon Woo.

550
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:33,300
I couldn't ask you then, but I think I need to know now.

551
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,220
The Hyeon Woo you had found...

552
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,860
Can you tell me who he is?

553
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:45,280
But...

554
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,140
why do you ask all of a sudden?

555
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,170
Well...

556
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:55,610
I think someone I know might be Hyeon Woo.

557
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:00,890
By chance...

558
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:06,490
is Seo Ji Hwan Hyeon Woo?

559
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:12,080
Long time no see.

560
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,580
The last time I saw you was at the trial.

561
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,150
Has it been nine years?

562
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,600
How have you been?

563
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,080
You're rusty.

564
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,900
You didn't even notice the private investigator.

565
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,590
I don't need to be as sensitive as I used to be.

566
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,760
A carnivore doesn't do well by eating plants.

567
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:41,820
Before you came looking for me, I was an ordinary kid.

568
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,190
I know that's what you want to believe,

569
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:49,770
but you've always resembled me.

570
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:54,330
You and I are different.

571
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,320
- You have my blood.
- I chose a different path.

572
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:04,230
By handing me over to the prosecution?

573
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:07,600
That was for your survival.

574
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:12,100
You betrayed the person who raised you so you could survive.

575
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:16,260
I've done that countless times to get here.

576
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,820
I did that to cut you out of my life.

577
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:21,820
How can a son cut out his father?

578
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,660
I'm rebuilding the Bulldog Gang.

579
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,180
Stop wasting your time and come back to where you belong.

580
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:34,010
I belong to Thirsty Deer. I don't want to come back.

581
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:36,200
Is it because of the girl?

582
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:44,300
You want to date and pretend to live your life like others do.

583
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:48,790
But you can't do that. You'll never change.

584
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:51,280
That's what you want.

585
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:59,390
You'll soon find out what I mean.

586
00:47:15,870 --> 00:47:19,390

[Go Eun Ha]

588
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:48,350
So, you ended up coming here, huh?

589
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:54,890
Then, I guess I'll settle things with your girl.

590
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:13,190

I'm glad.

00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:27,200
Looks like you have to go. I'll take it from here. Go ahead.

595
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,860
I can drive you.

596
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:32,580
I feel like walking. Take the car. I'm fine.

597
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,490
Thank goodness.

598
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:44,310
I didn't miss you.

599
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,950
What are you doing here? Where are you coming from?

600
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:50,820
There was an accident, but I didn't have time to turn the car around.

601
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:52,490
So I just left it there.

602
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:55,600
What? What accident?

603
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,360
Are you okay?

604
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,280
Yes, I'm fine. It's nothing.

605
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,330
What do you mean it's nothing? You're pregnant!

606
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:11,470
What did you just say?

607
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:13,150
Pregnant?

608
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,590
- I...
- You knew?

609
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,360
Since when?

610
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:24,660
Right after we got back from the trip.

611
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:32,870
That's when you suddenly pursued me. Asked me out and told me you liked me.

612
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,680
I'm sorry.

613
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:43,270
I knew something was off. There was no way...

614
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:46,550
You can't develop feelings you never had.

615
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,800
So what about it?

616
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:54,510
- Will you take care of me or something?
- Yes.

617
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:57,900
- What?
- I'm going to take care of you.

618
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:03,550
Who's going to take care of whom? Who asked you to do that?

619
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:06,660
Hey, I'll take care of myself.

620
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,890
I'm saying because it's you, stupid.

621
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,150
What?

622
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:21,200
I've never imagined having a family.

623
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:24,880
But I want to because it's you.

624
00:50:26,580 --> 00:50:29,230
I've never been comfortable around anyone.

625
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:33,100
I've never been loved by good parents

626
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,730
like you have.

627
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:37,860
But...

628
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,720
maybe it's because you're an honest person.

632

633

638

isn't someone who did bad things under his father.

He tries hard to be a role model for his brothers.

653
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:46,550
You told Hong Gi to keep his word when it comes to keeping promises.

654
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:51,220
You told Jae Soo to hold back his anger even if someone picks a fight first.

655
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:55,900
When you went to save Taek, you just took the blows.

You're right.

00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,910
Yes.

If it's really too difficult for you,

you could also develop feelings for someone else. That's another way.

00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:58,070
You're so pretty, my Eun Ha.

712
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:01,100
You're so pretty, my Eun Ha.

713
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:07,790
♫ Push away the time that felt like lies ♫

714
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:10,980
♫ Shine on me ♫

715
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:14,290
He never answers any of my questions.

716
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:17,230
Did he ever open up to someone before?

717
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:18,920
There was...

718
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,850
just one person.

719
00:58:21,850 --> 00:58:25,690
Maybe because I think we seemed similar.

720
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:28,320
She looked so alone.

721
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:31,730
So, I...

722
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:36,750
just wanted to be by her side.

723
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:40,260
What happened after? Do you still talk to her?

724
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:42,610
No.

725
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:47,190
I believe she's doing well...

726
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,210
somewhere out there.

727
00:58:50,090 --> 00:58:53,530
Wherever you are, I'll find you, Hyeon Woo.

728
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,600
I'll find you for sure.

729
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,040
Eun Ha.

730
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:18,390
How did you...

731
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:26,890
You thought I would never find out?

732
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:36,960
I've been looking for you forever.

733
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,450
I told you I'd find you. I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

734
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:48,460
I relied on you like I did before. Why didn't I recognize you?

735
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:57,160
I missed you, Hyeon Woo.

736
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:18,250
♫ The blurry stars in the night sky ♫

737
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:24,410
♫ You seemed like someone I could never reach ♫

738
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:33,300
♫ Your eyes are looking at me ♫

739
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:37,040
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

740
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:48,980
♫ You came back to my confused heart ♫

741
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:54,850
♫ I don't want to let go ♫

742
01:00:54,850 --> 01:01:01,660
♫ In my dream, every day ♫

743
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:06,880
♫ I want to spend every moment with you ♫

744
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,530
I missed you so much, too, Eun Ha.

745
01:01:09,530 --> 01:01:17,820
♫ In my way, every day, no matter where you are ♫

746
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:22,260
♫ I'll be by your side, I'll protect you ♫

747
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:26,920
♫ I'll always be with you ♫

748
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:32,790
♫ Forever ♫

749
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:36,750
♫ Like the spring snow at the end of winter ♫

750
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:39,860
♫ I hope you bloom ♫

751
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:43,160
[My Sweet Mobster]

752
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:47,950
Eun Ha, I'll always be by your side from now on.

753
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:51,430
Hyung-

754
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:54,430
They say the tamest kitty jumps onto the stovetop first.

755
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:56,960
Ta-da! E-Eun Ha...

756
01:01:57,770 --> 01:02:00,520
- We're going to get married.
- My child's life

757
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,500
comes before an unborn grandchild!

758
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,750
We need to get back what we're owed.

759
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:07,060
It's an emergency. The conference room is a mess.

760
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:09,780
This is the surefire way to destroy Seo Ji Hwan.

761
01:02:09,780 --> 01:02:11,690
Eun Ha!

762
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:16,740
♫ All the time has been colored by you ♫

763
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:19,090
♫ I'll always be with you ♫
