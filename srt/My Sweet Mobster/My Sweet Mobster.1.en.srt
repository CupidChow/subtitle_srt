Or, worry about yourself.

181
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:35,380
But we have a lot of views and more comments than usual.

182
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,120
They say I look good in a police uniform.

183
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,900
I think we'll keep getting better responses.

184
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,200
So, how much is a lot?

185
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,900
Five million views like Ye Na?

186
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,310
Not that much, CEO.

187
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,280
Minnie.

188
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,210
If you keep this up, we can't renew your contract.

189
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:59,320
- What?
- Your contract is about to expire, Eun Ha.

190
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,160
Listen to me carefully.

191
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,480
If you fail to follow orders one more time,

192
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,600
it's really going to be...

193
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,050
Over! Over!

194
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:12,570
- My throat hurts.
- Are you okay, CEO?

195
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:13,830
It hurts...

196
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,600
Get out.

197
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,530
Hyungnim is here.

198
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,580
Open the door.

199
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,000
Hello, Hyungnim.

200
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,030
Is that for me?

201
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:48,260
It must be for your recent trip to the police.

202
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:52,760
It was a quick trip, so we prepared silken tofu for you.

203
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,250
- Let's sit.
- Yes, sir.

204
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:01,280
- Whose turn is it to say grace?
- Me.

205
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,850
Dear Lord,

206
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,000
thank you for this food we are about to eat.

207
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,810
Please bless the pig's life that gave us its front and hind legs.

208
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,300
And...

209
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,860
Man Ho.

210
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,480
May it be free of pain

211
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,720
and live peacefully in heaven.

212
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,140
- Amen.
- Amen.

213
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,680
- Let's eat.
- Yes, Hyungnim.

214
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,580
Enjoy.

215
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,930
Hyungnim, the people who called the police on you...

216
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,580
Who are those fearless bastards?

217
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,850
Who do you think?

218
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:48,570
It must have been Lee Gang Gil, the right arm of Kitty Gang.

219
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,580
Gang Gil?

220
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,240
He must be out of his mind.

221
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,740
By chance...

222
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,520
is this what you saw?

223
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,700
It's a new drug from Thailand that has been circulating the clubs since last year.

224
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,150
I hear Kitty Gang is interested.

225
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,960
Wasn't Taek in some kind of group in Thailand?

226
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,070
This is the drug?

227
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,230
It looks like candy for kids, right?

228
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,950
Could you lift your foot?

229
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,660
Over there, too.

230
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,670
Thank you.

231
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,000
I did see it.

232
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:26,780

233
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,380
I'll do my best!

234

Can you stop? How much do you make anyway?

240
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,710
Probably more than what I made filming today.

241
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:51,500
What time are you done today?

242
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,710
This is going to take about four hours, so...

243
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,720
Mi Ho.

244
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,130
- I think I saw something.
- Huh?

245
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:04,100
What? What did you see?

246
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,960
- I'll call you back later.

You have the right to remain silent and to have a lawyer.

250
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,920
Anything you say can be used against you in court.

251
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,420
You're not a real cop, are you?

252
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,780
What? Why is that guy here?

253
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,220
Hey.

254
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,530
Get over here right now, will you?

255
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,990
How did he know?

256
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,050
Give it to me.

257
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,660
Under your shoe.

258
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:27,690
I have eyes everywhere, so don't think you have me fooled.

259
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,820

- Yes, sir.

260
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,750

00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:54,550
It wasn't me. It was that.

265
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,000
What a bastard.

266
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,700
Stealing money from little kids?

267
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,060
I should have hit him harder.

268
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,990
Hey.

269
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:31,130
Are you paying today?

270
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:34,380
You should lock the door when you go to the toilet.

271
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,330
Don't let little brats become thieves.

272

If they see something they need, they can take it.

273
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:42,740
It's a problem if I don't have anything to steal.

274

If it ends here, it won't be a problem.

That is not to say that you did anything right.

283
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,840
I know I haven't done anything right.

Tell me something I don't know.

Wow, you've grown up.

You know you've done no good with your life?

287
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:35,270
You might be ready to get married.

288
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:41,100
I shouldn't mess up someone else's life. I barely cleaned up mine.

289

Speaking of, want to meet a girl?

290
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:51,500
The daughter of the side dish store owner across the street.

291
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,310
I heard she's 30 or 31 this year.

292
00:22:55,310 --> 00:23:00,630
I heard she got a divorce last year. No kids.

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,180
What?

294
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,760
Are you turned off because she had been married before?

295

If she's that great, set her up with your grandson.
