00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,710
It took me 10 years to cut him off.

181
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:23,790
It took me 10 more years to get away from him.

182
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:29,070
Yet I'm still hearing his name from your mouth.

183
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,570
That's how afraid I am of him.

184
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,690
So, you're not in the picture with him.

185
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,890
Are you certain?

186
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,510
I cut him off with my own hands.

187
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,500
I never want to be associated with him again.

188
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,910
Ji Hwan!

189
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,520
I get why you're acting like this, but

190
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,100
will you be this cold whenever something like this happens?

191
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,930
You won't tell me what's going on or why you look so serious.

192
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,810
Are you going to push me away as if I wouldn't understand?

193
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,660
[My Sweet Mobster]

194
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,920
Gang Gil!

195
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,310
Welcome back. Let me take a look at you.

196
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:05,540
Let me see your faces.

197
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,890
You look better. Let's eat.

198
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:11,770
How about tofu stew? I know a great place. Let's go.

199
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,360
You heard the Chairman is out, right?

200
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,650
- Yes, I heard.
- About the botched deal...

201
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,650
don't tell him it was because of Seo Ji Hwan.

202
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:50,550
Just hearing his name will enrage him. No need to mention it.

203
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,310
It'll just upset the Chairman.

204
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,530
Okay? Got it?

205
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,700
Yes.

206
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,980
Why not answer me...

207
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,410
Hey.

208
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,820
Eun Ha.

209
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,700
What's with the ice?

210
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,600
Aigoo, still. The shaved ice is pretty.

211
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:42,410
At least put some red beans on top.

212
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,380
Oh, right.

213
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:55,240
We're not participating in the orphanage sponsorship event, right?

214
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,720
No. Donate what they need and tell them we can't be there.

215
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,340
What kind of event is it?

216
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,460
- Oh, that's...
- The sponsors visit every year

217
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,090
and spend time with them. That kind of thing.

218
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,800
- So why not go?
- We...

219
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,690
We're not role models. We can't show our faces there.

220
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,110
They don't like having us there, either.

221
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,730
Am I wrong, Il Yeong?

222
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,300
I didn't hate days like that.

223
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:23,500
It was usually boring, so it was nice to have lots of people over.

224
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,000
Oh, really?

225
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,050
I grew up in an orphanage.

226
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:34,150
He's a straight shooter now, but he used to be crooked.

227
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,060
Right, Hyungnim?

228
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,110
Hey, hey. Put some red beans on this.

229
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,220
So cold. So cold!

230
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,100
At least wash your hands!

231
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,210
Hurry up and put red beans on it now!

232
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,270
You want to apologize, right?

233
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,410
I'm sorry.

234
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:42,180
Just with words?

235
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,370
Here.

236
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,200
When did you get this?

237
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,740
Yesterday.

238
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,580
You skipped work just to give me this?

239
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,020
Yes.

240
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,060
I'm sorry. Well...

241
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:05,890
He and I have not been on good terms for a long time.

242
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:10,220
He's a dangerous person. I was worried about you.

243
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:14,970
I reacted sensitively at the moment.

244
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,470
I'm...

245
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:26,640
not just someone you need to be worried about or protect.

246
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,430
You can also share things with me.

247
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:34,170
So, I want you to tell me everything. Slowly.

248
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,180
I want you to.

249
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,670
Also, I'm not that fragile!

250
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:43,960
Didn't I tell you I learned self-defense? Want to see? Look.

251
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,730
Here we go...

252
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,210
There! Wait, that's not it.

253
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,510
- Eun Ha.
- Yes?

254
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,600
Isn't this just a hug?

255
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,120
No! Ow. Are you okay?

256
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,100
I don't want you to suffer.

257
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,470
I want you to share everything with me...

258
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:47,340
and discuss everything with me.

259
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,480
I want to be by your side.

260
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,710
Why is he tempting me?

261
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,200
Mom.

262
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,000
Come home? Why?

263
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,840
Her eyes were so big and pretty, even as a kid.

264
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,680
But after starting soccer, she became a tomboy.

265
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,940
Look. So mischievous, right?

266
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,040
- So cute.
- It's not just because she's my kid.

267
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:32,030
In terms of looks, she's second to none.

268
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,360
If we add your looks to the mix,

269
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:38,320
wow, our grandkids will be even better looking!

270
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,670
What's going on?

271
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:43,500
- Mi Ho.
- You're home.

272
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,280
Grandkids? What grandkids?

273
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,390
Who has your grandkids?

274
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,090
Why are you showing my pictures to a stranger without my permission?

275
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,820
I told you I'm not with him. Why can't you believe your daughter?

276
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:59,340
Stand up.

277
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,680
- No.
- Stand up.

278
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:07,170
- No.
- Stand up, I said!

279
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:18,600
- Come out right now.
- Hold on, Mi Ho...

280
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,880
Who the hell are you?

281
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,050
I thought you did well in school.

282
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,900
Don't you understand me, or do you think I'm a joke?

283
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,690
I told you no. Why do you keep showing up?

284
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,730
You're not going to come to me.

285
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,200
What?

286
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,580
I'll keep showing up until you welcome me.

287
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,590
Don't be too angry.

288
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,300
You just talked down to me.

289
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,900
You're younger than me!

290
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,340
Your pictures were cute. Bye now.

291
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,900
Hey, what about your car?

292
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,630
I brought it to give it to your mom.

293
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,360
Are you crazy? Hey!

294
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,260
Stop right there! I'll go get the car keys.

295
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,290
Hey! Stop!

296
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,440
What a nutjob he is.

297
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,600
Hey! Take your car with you!

298
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,790
Hey!

299
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,650
The CEO's not in, right?

300
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,900
- No.
- I'll take a nap here.

301
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,340
Okay.

302
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,700
If he gets back, don't let him in.

303
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,070
Lee Dong Hee.

304
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,750
Let's go. I want to see the ocean.

305
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,130
It's during class hours.

306
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,680
Whatever. You were skipping class, too.

307
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,220
Let's go. I want to see the ocean.

308
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,290
Let's go. Okay?

309
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,560
Is this the ocean?

310
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,940
Want to die?

311
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,290
There's water. There's sand.

312
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,450
There's music, too.

313
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,160
Over there, the horizon.

314
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,350
That's basically an ocean.

315
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,710
Does this look like the ocean to you?

316
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:37,930
- Want to die? Come over here!
- Don't hit me!

317
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,060
Isn't this fun? Next time, let's go to the real ocean.

318
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,030
Dong Hee!

319
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,740
Lee Dong Hee!

320
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,690
What are you thinking so deeply about?

321
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:58,340
Why is he passed out here?

322
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,530
He was tired and wanted to take a nap.

323
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:03,630
Hyungnim isn't here. Il Yeong is working off site.

324
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:05,600
I bought some snacks in case anyone's hungry.

325
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,940
Let's share.

326
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,530
- What are you doing here?
- Get up!

327
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,180
Hey. Why is Hyungnim WHF all of a sudden?

328
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,790
It's WFH, not WHF. "Working from home."

329
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,710
Would it be WHV if he was working from a villa?

330
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,870
What's WFH?

331
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:22,440
This morning,

332
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,080
when we had shaved ice, wasn't the mood icy?

333
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,010
Don't you think Hyungnim wants to butter up Sister-in-law?

334
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,210
Hey.

335
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,210
Do you think Hyungnim showed the thing to Little Rat?

336
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:36,210
The teacher is home. She probably saw it.

337
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,710
That could be.

338
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,020
That means that in the house,

339
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,590
it's just Hyungnim and Sister-in-law alone.

340
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,470
How nice. Nice. Hey.

341
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:50,720
Everyone, go home late today. After midnight.

342
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,340
Even better if you don't. Got it?

343
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,260
I do need to go home. I have nowhere else to go.

344
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,150
Eun Ha, close your eyes.

345
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,300
My eyes? Why?

346
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:08,280
It's nothing. Just close them for a second.

347
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,700
- Don't open them.
- Okay. What is it?

348
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,870
Okay, follow me.

349
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,780
Be careful.

350
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,970
There...

351
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:23,840
Stand here for a second. Don't open your eyes.

352
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,330
- Don't open them!
- Okay.

353
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,580
Eun Ha, when I count to three, open your eyes.

354
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,960
Okay.

355
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:39,190
One, two, three!

356
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,220
My gosh!

357
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,520
What is all this?

358
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,440
Eun Ha and Friends?

359
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,450
Is this...

360
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,990
- Did you set this all up for me?
- Yes.

361
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,890
Goodness...

362
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:02,110
This is a really nice camera! Nicer than what I had at Macaron!

363
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,810
How can I...

364
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:06,070
This mic is the newest model!

365
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,900
And lights?

366
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,200
But I don't know if I can accept this.

367
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,650
What do you mean, Eun Ha? You deserve this.

368
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,510
This isn't even good enough for you.

369
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:19,890
Also, I didn't do this by myself. The guys wanted to chip in.

370
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,850
We all came together for you.

371
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:24,090
Gosh, seriously...

372
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:28,520
You're part of our family, Eun Ha.

373
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,070
Thank you.

374
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,100
It's nothing.

375
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,640
What did you want to do first when you have your studio?

376
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,240
While teaching Man Ho, Jae Soo, and Hong Gi,

377
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,280
I thought of making content for kids who don't get the chance to study.

378
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,760
- Oh, studying.
- Yes.

379
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,900
Wow, this thing right here.

380
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:57,410
As a kid, I learned how to add and subtract while playing.

381
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:00,400
- These are called finger snacks.
- Finger snacks.

382
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,740
Oh, my, how did you know?

383
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:05,820
I used to do something similar.

384
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,330
You did that, too, Ji Hwan?

385
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,320
Eun Ha!

386
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,350
Oh, my, my.

387
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:49,620
Aigoo, are you okay?

388
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,100
- I'm okay.
- Shake it out.

389
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,980
How did I- Ji Hwan, I'm so hungry all of a sudden.

390
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,360
- You're hungry?
- Yes. Should we eat?

391
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,210
- Can I make you something?
- Sounds good.

392
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,900
Fried rice?

393
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,850
- Let's eat.
- Shall we?

394
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,790
The table feels so big today.

395
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:29,380
I know, right? It's just us two at home.

396
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,350
R-R-Right...

397
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:40,970
Just us two.

398
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,980
I'm sorry. One second.

399
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,430
- A-Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

400
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:00,230
- How about dessert?
- I love dessert.

401
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,380
Should we eat in the living room? It's bigger there.

402
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:05,610
The living room, good. Yes, I'll prepare.

403
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,320
It's sweet.

404
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,950
It's sweet.

405
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,780
Should we watch TV?

406
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,660
I've already seen that one.

407
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,450
W-W-What's wrong?

408
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,870
My spit.

409
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:10,640
I have spit stuck in my throat.

410
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,160
Why am I falling backward?

411
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,440
If she keeps going, she'll hit her head.

412
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:28,080
Eun Ha, I don't think you have a fever.

413
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,900
Oh, no!

414
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,650
Hyung!

415
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,360
I'm not hurt at all!

416
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,840
Hello? Yes?

417
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,450
What?

418
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,780
When did you get home?

419
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,840
I'm early, aren't I?

420
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:07,290
Are you? Really?

421
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,960
I forgot I had plans.

422
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,490
He and I have not been on good terms for a long time.

423
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:54,180
He's a dangerous person. I was worried about you.

424
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:58,150
I reacted sensitively in the moment.

425
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,950
- Are you going somewhere, Jae Soo?
- Oh, my God!

426
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,100
- You scared me!
- I was more scared.

427
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,890
- Why are you here?
- To drink water.

428
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:18,550
Drink, drink.

429
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,580
- Jae Soo.
- Yes.

430
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:27,410
- Do you know what Club Cat is?
- Club Cat?

431
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,570
Of course. The owner is our archnemesis.

432
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:32,700
Are you going there? Don't. Go somewhere else.

433
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,750
- Who's the owner?
- This sly asshole named Go Yang Hui.

434
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,500
He's the one who got Hyungnim when he went to get Taek.

435
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,220
- Really?
- He's out for Hyungnim's blood.

436
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,210
Why are they on such bad terms?

437
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,170
Why do you have so many questions? I'm busy.

438
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,240
Listen up.

439
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,230
When Hyungnim joined the Bulldog Gang,

440
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,680
Go Yang Hui was the Chairman's right-hand man.

441
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,480
A young kid shows up as the heir. Of course, he hates him.

442
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:03,190
I feel bad for Hyungnim. He was dragged in because of family.

443
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:07,260
If it wasn't for that, he would have lived an ordinary, quiet, awesome life.

444
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,170
Where did he live before that?

445
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:13,220
I think he said he lived with his mom.

446
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,720
I don't know the details. Stop asking questions. Got to go.

447
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,860
You never saw me.

448
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,170
I'm...

449
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:41,210
not just someone you need to be worried about or protect.

450
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,600
You can also share things with me.

451
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:50,600
So, I want you to tell me everything. Slowly.

452
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,780
Go Yang Hui's drug case you mentioned before.

453
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,190
They're investigating without arrest at this time.

454
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,990
They'll likely close the case without indictment.

455
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:14,920
I hear Prosecutor Jang Hyeon Woo tracked down the money.

456
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,320
The higher-ups just wanted to close the case with kidnapping and imprisonment.

457
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,760
That's why they took the case away from him.

458
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,240
If the other guys are out, we should see movement soon.

459
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,200
No matter what it is, they'll be moving together.

460
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,890
Report back as soon as you know.

461
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,220
Got it.

462
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,450
Oh, how's your back?

463
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:48,060
Why is there no news from the guys? Did they deliver the stuff?

464
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,800
Are you done yet?

465
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,690
This won't fit in the car.

466
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,410
This is it.

467
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,380
I see there's more.

468
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,060
Makes me happy just looking at them.

469
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:02,420
With the stuff we sent yesterday, they won't have room.

470
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,220
Are we refugees? We can send them over tomorrow.

471
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,990
Pick them up. Let's go.

472
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,850
Dong Hee, you like flowers. Get the flowers.

473
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:11,590
Sorry, sorry! One second!

474
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,810
I'm going with you.

475
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,570
- Go together where?
- Are you coming with us?

476
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:16,890
Of course!

477
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,670
Go together where?

478
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:20,840
I'm coming!

479
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,010
- What are you doing?
- Let's go!

480
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:24,570
That's the heaviest!

481
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:26,760
It is quite heavy.

482
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,370
It's good if she comes. Let's go, hurry!

483
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,670
It's been a while since we had an office dinner, right?

484
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:47,840
Not just a while. I can't even remember the last time.

485
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,570
Wait. Did we ever eat out?

486
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,410
We had Vietnamese food last month.

487
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:55,590
Pho doesn't count. We have rice and noodles every day.

488
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:59,600
The lobster we never ate last time still sings in my ears, "Under the Sea."

489
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:03,200
♫ I want to eat lobster ♫

490
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,530
Then, should we have lunch today?

491
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,040
A quick decision. Okay.

492
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,580
Wait.

493
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,000
It's not for work. It's for lunch. Got it?

494
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,730
Who cares what it is for? It's lobster we're talking about.

495
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,460
No way. No way.

496
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,680
Aigoo, what in the world? A place this expensive?

497
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,250
Prosecutor, you are so generous. The best.

498
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:30,310
You thought I'd say that, right? This is Go Yang Hui's restaurant.

499
00:41:30,310 --> 00:41:32,620
You said you wanted ocean vibes.

500
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:36,760
At somewhere exclusive, like here.

501
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,970
This place is really hard to get into.

502
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:40,020
I made reservations.

503
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,530
I said I wanted to eat with ocean vibes, not get buried in the ocean.

504
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,080
My stomach isn't feeling well.

505
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,340
If I eat something raw, I think I'll head straight to the bathroom.

506
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,780
I think I'll spend more time on the toilet than at the table.

507
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,660
So, why don't we skip the surf and go to the turf or the sky?

508
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:58,150
I brought medication. Don't worry.

509
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:00,550
You're the best.

510
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,680
Let's go in.

511
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:07,050
Being that calm at the brink of death means his heart already stopped beating.

512
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,330
We don't even have bulletproof vests.

513
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:11,540
I don't know if this would do.

514
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,860
What are you doing? Come in.

515
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,500
I'm coming.

516
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:21,750
Sol, your daddy is on the brink of death every day.

517
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,530
Excuse me.

518
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,240
Do you have a reservation?

519
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,300
Yes. At noon, Jang Hyeon Woo.

520
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:36,290
Right. Han Gwang Sik, Han Gwang Tae. You work here.

521
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:39,330
Yes. What are you doing here, Prosecutor?

522
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,450
What do you mean?

523
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,220
I'm at a restaurant to eat.

524
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:45,600
I see. I'm sorry.

525
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,230
We don't have any tables.

526
00:42:47,230 --> 00:42:50,160
Wow. Are you joking with me since we're outside the office?

527
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,540
All I see are tables.

528
00:42:54,410 --> 00:42:56,100
[Reserved]

529
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:58,910
- They're all reserved.
- Aigoo, too bad.

530
00:42:58,910 --> 00:43:01,810
We can't help it. We'll come back next time. Let's go.

531

532

Wow. Officer Song sure has sharp eyes.

533
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,120
Let's eat, then.

534
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,710
Not only does she have sharp eyes, she is quite gutsy.

535
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:14,600

- Hurry.

536
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,940

Aigoo! I hear a very important guest is here.

The building is in a good location.

564
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,290
Wow, how much does a building like this go for?

565
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:59,440
Should I ask Seo Tae Pyeong these questions?

566
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,780
A figurehead wouldn't know.

While the guys outside are getting eaten,

572
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:33,190
the guys hiding inside survive.

573
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,140
I already started fishing,

574
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,000
so I'll try to catch the guys on the inside, too.

575

But your fishing rod is broken.

576

602
00:46:56,590 --> 00:47:00,180

- 20 million won.

- Aren't you going to ask what for?
- The reason isn't important.

725

The important thing is the fact that you owe me now.

You're my son.

The things I did...

737
00:58:30,260 --> 00:58:33,110
weren't because I'm the son of a mob boss.

isn't someone who did bad things under his father.

746

He tries hard to be a role model for his brothers.

You told Hong Gi to keep his word when it comes to keeping promises.

You told Jae Soo to hold back his anger even if someone picks a fight first.
