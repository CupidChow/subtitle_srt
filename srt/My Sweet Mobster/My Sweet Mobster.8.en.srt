[8 years ago]
Isn't it nice?

7
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,770
I know it's an old house, but it's nice for a family.

8
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,400
A big yard, too. We just put down a new lawn.

9
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,110
- Look around.
- Thanks.

10
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:01,750
Hello? Okay, okay. Yes.

11
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,880
It's an old tree.

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,110
Why do you want to move into this house?

13
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,150
A long time ago...

14
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,380
I lived here for a bit.

00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,880

Hyeon Woo, thanks for always playing with me.

18
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,080
Is this what you're looking for?

19
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:21,430
How do you know that?

20
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,670
It looked like the whole tree might get pulled out.

21
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,410
I got the guys to dig it up.

22
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,700
Right. I'm sorry.

23
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,400
Thank you for finding it.

24
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,930
That box...

25
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,370
Is it one of the memories you were talking about?

26
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,380
Why are you putting it back?

27
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,300
You're not going to take it?

28
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,760
Yoon Hyeon Woo is dead.

29
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,440
Eun Ha.

30
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,320
There are memories better left buried.

31
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,250
Next time, don't go looking for them.

32
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,180
You could write a thesis and even get a Ph.D. on Seo Ji Hwan.

33
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,740
How did you miss something like this?

34
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,010
I didn't think of his personal history.

35
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,650
Seo Ji Hwan is Seo Tae Pyeong's son, but he was put on the family registry at age 16.

36
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,510
His mother was never legally his wife.

37
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:55,110
He may or may not have known that he had a son when they broke up.

38
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,730
Maybe he ran off knowing he had a kid, or he ran off but found out he had a kid.

39
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,600
There could be other scenarios, but seeing he moved every six months,

40
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,220
he probably was running from something.

41
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,550
So, when Seo Tae Pyeong was imprisoned, and Seo Ji Hwan started Thirsty Deer,

42
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,950
he moved into the house he used to live in.

43
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,540
Life is strange. I know it's a small world, but...

44
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,740
the person you're looking for is Seo Ji Hwan?

45
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,960
Seo Ji Hwan was

46
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,560
the same person I wanted to catch and was looking for.

47
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,010

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,160
I found something precious to me today.

00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,030
I really want to show it to you.

74
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:12,900
I want you to see it.

75
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,730
I'm Prosecutor Jang Hyeon Woo from the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office.

76
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,600
Hyeon Woo...

77
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,250
Hyeon Woo...

78
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,870
This is Ta Whan's hideout.

79
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,870
There will be at least seven in Ta Whan's camp.

80
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,380
More from Go Yang Hui's side.
[Jeyang-dong 25 (Asia Food)]

81
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:03,300
It might be best to call the police.

82
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,950
If we make a mistake, Taek will get hurt.

83
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,920
If something goes wrong, the hostage is the first to die.

84
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,910
It's a big drug deal.

85
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:13,430
If you go and get involved,

86
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,620
just the fact that you were there will be inescapable.

87
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,390
Il Yeong.

88
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,410
Do you know Prosecutor Jang Hyeon Woo?

89
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,710
From Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office?

90
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,230
Yeah. He went to your school. What's he like?

91
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:38,240
He has conviction. He doesn't compromise.

92
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,960
He's especially harsh on assault convicts.

93
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,370
Why do you ask?

94
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,060
I met him recently.

95
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,710
The prosecutor who followed you last time?

96
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,190
I think he saw me 10 years ago at the hotel.

97
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,390
- The hotel?
- Yes.

98
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,030
If Prosecutor Jang takes that into account,

99
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:01,320
- he may be more sensitive about this.
- Right.

100
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,940
From his point of view, it's understandable.

101
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,860
But still.

102
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:08,450
That incident was unavoidable.

103
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,820
How was that unavoidable?

104
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,840
It all started with me.

105
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:26,900
[10 years ago]
- Seo Tae Pyeong, the boss of Bulldog Gang,

106
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,890
has been operating an illegal gambling site worth 4 billion won.

107
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,620
He has been arrested for siphoning the funds to foreign accounts.

108
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,550
The prosecution is investigating him for overseas wealth evasion,

109
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:39,790
hiding criminal profit, and bribery...

110
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,450
We need to move before my dad does.

111
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,980
Freeze the assets that he hasn't laundered yet.

112
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,370
Regarding the hotel, get the shareholders together this week.

113
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,220
- Prepare to hold a shareholders' meeting.
- Okay.

114
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,940
What if people find out you ratted him out?

115
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,290
They'll be up in arms.

116
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,330
Don't you think you need to hide out somewhere for a bit?

117
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,130
I'm prepared for it.

118
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,910

120
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,340
I can take the bus.

121
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,000
I thought you had an exam today.

122
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,080
Get in, man. And show us around the campus sometime.

123
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,010
Are you worried I'd ask you to set me up with a girl?

124
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:35,260
It's not like that.

125
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,090
Can I go on a blind date, Hyungnim?

126
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,700
I'm sorry, Hyungnim. Get in, man.

127
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,310
Go now.

128
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,670
See you later.

129
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,100
Hello.

130
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,660
Why is no one working?

131
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,330
We're setting up. You can head to the event hall.

132
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,690
Go help the guests over there.

133
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,180
Yes, sir.

134
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,580
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry. Are you alright?

135
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:06,570
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

136
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,570
I'm sorry.

137
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:40,440
Hi! Have you eaten?

138
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,280
You know,

139
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:46,500
it's been 15 years.

140
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,200
I worked under Hyungnim like a dog for 15 years to grow us.

141
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,500
Then you got to inherit it because you're blood-related!

142
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:00,400
Damn it! It makes me so mad I could die!

143
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,020
Then, you hand off the whole thing to the prosecution

144
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,200
and finish off the group?

145
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,540
There's an event in here in two hours. Let's talk later.

146
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,080
There is no later.

147
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,440
I'm going to take over this hotel,

148
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,010
and you're going to die here.

149
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,290
Everybody get out!

150
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,170
Bye!

151
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:57,460
So cool!

152
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,130
Go ahead.

153
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,670
Hey!

154
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,580
If you don't kill him, I'll kill all of you!

155
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,650
Hyungnim.

156
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,830
Grandma!

157
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,180
Grandma...

158
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,370
Grandma, it's Mi Jin.

159
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,120
Wake up!

160
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,180
Wake up, ma'am...

161
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,880
Just a little bit...

162
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,400
Why is the door open?

163
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,600
I just saw the door was open. I was going to close it.

164
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,990
Have you been out?

165
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,700
- I was feeding the dog.
- In the middle of the night?

166
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,950
Yes.

167
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,090
What's the bulldog's name?

168
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,930
- Bulldog.
- I know it's a bulldog. What's his name?

169
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,290
His name is "bulldog."

170
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,890
Bulldog. Because he's a bulldog.

171
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,890
Yes.

172
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,270
Okay.

173
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,400
Excuse me, Mr. Seo.

174
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,970
Well...

175
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:47,360
You told me last night that some memories are better left buried.

176
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,620
- What did you mean by that?
- It's what it sounds like.

177
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:56,620
For some people, confronting the past is a difficult thing.

178
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,140
Everyone has a different story.

179
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,280
Does that answer your question?

180
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,720

00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:23,970
A prosecutor...

541
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:26,690
is someone...

542
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,730
who scolds the bad guys.

543
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:42,180
♫ Will that day come for me? ♫

544
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:50,830
♫ No matter how much time passes, it's always you ♫

545
00:46:50,830 --> 00:46:57,760

00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:06,750

547
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,900
- Can you walk by yourself?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

548
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,770
Thank goodness you're not worse.

549
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:15,410
Thanks for everything. Go take care of Taek.

550
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,630
Okay. Get some rest.

551
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,450
Seo Ji Hwan.

552
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:50,100
It's late. You shouldn't be outside.

553
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:51,430
Are you okay?

554
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:54,170
Let me see how badly you're hurt-

555
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,610
Go Eun Ha.

556
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:07,150
Do you like me?

557
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:09,830
- What?
- I don't like you.

558
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:15,260
You asked me what you were to me.

559
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,350
To me, you are...

560
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:24,690
a tenant. Nothing more, nothing less.

561
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:52,090
CEO.

562
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:53,330
Hyungnim!

563
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:55,060
Are you alright, Hyungnim?

564
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,610
Are you out?

565
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:58,430
How could you go there alone?

566
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:00,980
We were worried to death.

567
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:07,440
How could you bring her there when she's got nothing to do with it?

568
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,150
You really don't get the picture?

569
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:27,640
Hyungnim, we were worried-

570
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:07,330
Yoon Hyeon Woo.

571
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,720
Do you know someone named Yoon Hyeon Woo?

572
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,410
I don't.

573
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:41,930
You fed the dog at dawn, and you were totally fine.

574
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:46,550
Then, you come home at night hurt like this. Even if you were a stranger, I'd be worried.

575
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:49,790
You don't have to be cruel to me. I know it makes you uncomfortable.

576
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:52,810
Disinfect your wounds and put some ointment on.

577
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,200
- Whose turn is it to pray-
- Let's pray individually.

578
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:17,440
We don't share secrets. What's the point of praying together? Just do it alone.

579
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,640
Blah, blah, blah. Please. Yes.

580
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,320
- Please.
- Are you speaking in tongues?

581
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:22,750
Amen!

582
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:27,470
Sister-in-law, eat. Eat plenty.

583
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:34,580
Little rat, you like this. Right? Have plenty.

584
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,010
Jae Soo, you like this, right?

585
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:51,460
Little rat is so quick. This is my meal.

586
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:58,220
Have more. You like this one.

587
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:01,900
I need to pick up books for class. Why don't we all go to the bookstore tomorrow?

588
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:04,780
Sister-in-law, we've never been to a place like that.

589
00:53:04,780 --> 00:53:09,160
Of course. What time should we meet tomorrow? I'll get jjajangmyeon. Wait...

590
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,500
One, two, three, four,

591
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:14,680
five. I'll also get tangsuyuk.

592
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:16,640
Wow!

593
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,300
The five of us can split tangsuyuk.

594
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,390
Let's eat first.

595
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:23,670
What a day.

596
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:36,250
Wow, 150 billion won worth of drugs were found in Ta Whan's car.

597
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:41,030
Imagine if they were released onto the streets... Whoa, that's crazy.

598
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,970
Say something.

599
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,330
Since they weren't, I'm so grateful.

600
00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:47,210
Hate you!

601
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:52,560
We missed the deal, but we got Ta Whan.

602
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:56,190
You could also say we got Ta Whan but missed her customer.

603
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:59,630
Jeong Yoon Taek is a more trustworthy source anyway.

604
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:01,510
Among everyone arrested,

605
00:54:01,510 --> 00:54:04,060
get a warrant for Lee Gang Gil first, please.

606
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:05,740
Okay, got it.

607
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:11,250
Oh, the Chief Prosecutor is buying lobster for dinner. You're going, right?

608
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:13,320
I have some work left and another plan.

609
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,180
Why don't you two go?

610
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,230
What?

611
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:20,960
Do I need to go to a work dinner if the Prosecutor isn't?

612
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,960
Huh?

613
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,550
Then you can go by yourself.

614
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:28,200
Chief Prosecutor isn't going to treat me alone to lobster.

615
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,850
I'll be lucky if I get some baby shrimp.

616
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:32,680
Claw, claw, claw.

617
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,820
I should go fishing for some lobster.

618
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:37,060
I don't know if I'll get any.

619
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,550
I need at least three.

620
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,640
CEO.

621
00:55:07,990 --> 00:55:10,220
How are you feeling?

622
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,530
I'm sorry. All because of me...

623
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:17,580
Why are you sorry? I'm sorry I didn't get there sooner.

624
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,590
I will...

625
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:22,580
never forget what you did for me.

626
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,710
Just don't forget the promise you made to your sister.

627
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,020
- Oppa.
- Yeon.

628
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:53,160
Oppa, are you okay?

629
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,440
I'm okay.

630
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:57,540
Yeon, are you okay?

631
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,930
If you're not hurt, I'm okay.

632
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:03,470
I'm sorry for making you worry.

633
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:04,950
It's okay.

634
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:08,490
I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

I'm sorry I kept you waiting.

Eun Ha.

637
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,760
It's only been a few days, but it feels like it's been forever.

638
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,540
I know.

639
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:57,840
I'm sorry about canceling yesterday.

640
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,800
No, I had something come up, too. It's okay.

641
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,730
Prosecutor.

642
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:18,300
Do you find it uncomfortable when someone asks about your past?

643
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:25,720
Even if two people share an experience,

644
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:28,770
they might have different perspectives on it.

645
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:32,530
How I remember it may be different from how they remember it.

646
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:36,200
Maybe I kept digging for a memory that someone

647
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:38,260
would rather not recall.

648
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:41,700
I didn't think of how that might be out of place.

649
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:46,230
Did someone...

650
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,750
say something?

651
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:02,980
Eun Ha.

652
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,120
I have to tell you something.

653
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:10,250
About the person you're looking for...

654
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:12,240

655
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:30,730
Why...

656
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:34,220
Why are you carrying that around?

657
00:59:37,370 --> 00:59:39,030
Who are you?

658
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:40,900
Do you know me?

659
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:45,860
Weird. I don't know who you are.

660
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:54,170
You must have been drinking. You smell like alcohol.

661
00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:57,170
I had a few. I was in a good mood.

662
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:06,500
I found the person I buried this together.

663
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:22,810
Thanks for everything, Seo Ji Hwan.

She has nothing to do with me.

671
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:08,750
A blind date?

672
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,730
How could you do something so dangerous?

673
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:13,960
I forgot how sensitive and easily surprised you are.

- I did. So what?

Just be honest. You don't want her to leave.
