00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,830
Considering your history,

359
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:14,190
I get that being gentle has seldom worked for you.

360
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,480
But being harsh will only work at Thirsty Deer.

361
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:21,930
Talking to the average person like that hurts their feelings.

362
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,820
And when someone's hurt, they do things like going on blind dates.

363
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,600
What are you talking about?

364
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,830
I think it's happening right now.

365
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,860
At the café on the first floor.

366
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,900
Yes, Dong Hee. I'm here. Where are you?

367
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,760
I'll be right there.

368
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,160
Okay, I'll wait for you.

369
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,890
- Go Eun Ha?
- Yes?

370
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:45,530
I'm Go Eun Ha, but who...

371
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:58,680
Who knows. Perhaps a man who could be your destiny?

372
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:01,220
What?

373
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,560
A blind date? How could she do something so dangerous?

374
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,440
Meeting a stranger is so dangerous! This is so frustrating.

375
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,710
You have many questions about others.

376
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,080
Right. It's none of my business.

377
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,820
I don't need a guardian at my age.

378
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,750
Right, I'm not her guardian.

379
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:26,660
I don't like being confused.

380
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:28,160
I shouldn't be sending mixed signals.

381
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,830
- No, thank you.
- Okay, no-

382
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,700
No?

383
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:39,310
- Oh, my! Do it again!
- Peekaboo.

384
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,840
What?

385
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,890
My goodness...

386
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,620
- Eun Ha.
- Yes.

387
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,800
- Didn't it hurt?
- What do you mean?

388
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,310
- When you fell from heaven.
- Heaven?

389
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:56,900
- Seriously, you are too much.
- Eun Ha.

390
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,330
Yes.

391
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,500
- The tea.
- Yes.

392
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,300
- Give me a sip of tea.
- My tea?

393
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,270
Your beau-tea.

394
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,230
Because you're laughing so much,

395
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:10,380
I want to throw it to you.

396
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,720
Throw myself at you.

397
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:16,660
What a crazy nut.

398
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:18,230
- Sir.
- Stop it!

399
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:20,170
Can I take your order?

400
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,720
- One more.
- What is it now?

401
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,640
- A Sprite.
- Sprite?

402
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,330
Do you want ice with that or on the side?

403
00:29:29,330 --> 00:29:31,470
- On the side.
- Got it, on the side.

404
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,550
Coming right up.

405
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:36,430
My heart is beating so fast. Oh, no...

406
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:40,390
Stop. Stop. I get it.

407
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,330
So, how do you know Dong Hee?

408
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:50,870
Not Dong Hee. Team Leader Yang Hong Gi laid down the bridge of love.

409
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:53,430
So, do you work at Thirsty Deer?

410
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,840
Right, I haven't given you my card yet.

411
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,300
Sure.

412
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,030
What now?

413
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,990
What are you doing?

414
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:04,800
I'm sorry.

415
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,980
W-W-What?

416
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,080
Was that magic?

417
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,470
It's not magic. I hid it two hours ago.

418
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:16,960
On my way to work.

419
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,500
I'm sorry.

420
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,710
- You're just so funny.
- We were too loud.

421
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,690
Yes. Give it to me.

422
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:30,080
Oh, Manager Goo Joon Gyeong.

423
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,060
I didn't know someone so funny worked here.

424
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,650
So, do you know Seo Ji Hwan, too?

425
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,950
Oh, the CEO? Of course I do.

426
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,350
He's an amazing guy.

427
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,480
Here's the drink you ordered.

428
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,880
C... E... O?

429
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,750
He is a master of martial arts.

430
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,320
He has powerful charisma.

431
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,700
[Chilsun Cider]

432
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:20,030
He's someone I admire as a fellow man.

433
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,800
Except he's a loser in romance.

434
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,810
- A loser in romance?
- Disappointing, right?

435
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:34,000
No, not at all. Why would I be disappointed?

436
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,090
I see.

437
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,040
Seo Ji Hwan?

438
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:49,220
C-C-CEO?

439
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,560
What?

440
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:01,050
W-Who, why are you here?

441
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,150
What are you doing here, Kang Ye Na?

442
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,840
You're here. That's why I'm here.

443
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,670
Just because I'm here, why...

444
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,120
We're going on a date today. Remember?

445
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,560
A d-d-date?

446
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,500
This is not a bad spot.

447
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,200
N-N-No. I...

448
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,330
-W-When did I...
- Should we go get some lunch?

449
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:26,030
I love this kind of touch.

450
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,210
I'm so hungry.

451
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,690
Have a good time, CEO.

452
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:33,550
You have many stars in your eyes.

453
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:44,040
Damn it.

454
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:57,410
I'm sorry I made a mistake earlier.

455
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,530
I apologize.

456
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,600
What's going on with Eun Ha?

457
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,900
- Do you like Eun Ha?
- Why should I answer such a personal question?

458
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:15,820
Fine. I don't want to know. Let's talk about work, your favorite subject.

459
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:20,580
You saw, right? A creator who can't eat meat can still promote the product.

460
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,930
You take care of the product quality,

461
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:27,220
and I'll take care of the promotion. Right?

462
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:30,920
You're confident in your product, right?

463
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:36,450
Thank you.

464
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,710
Bye. Be safe.

465
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:48,100
My shoulders.

466
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,130
I mean, why am I still aching?

467
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,150
Aigoo. Why does it hurt so much...

468
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,680
You're so good at that.

469
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,410
Crazy bitch!

470
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:12,440
Why did I act like I was soaking in a hot tub?

471
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,600
Why did I make those noises?

472
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,290
I'm so embarrassed.

473
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,020
Gu Mi Ho.

474
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:25,920
Get it together. The dark ages can stay in the dark. Forget it.

475
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:32,470
Wait.

476
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:36,670
I shouldn't be sitting around. She's leaving their house.

477
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:49,800
Jae Soo said you were quite harsh with her.

478
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,600
- That night...
- That night was a mistake.

479
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:05,030
I'm one to talk.

480
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:10,010
[Gu Mi Ho]

481
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,350
- I thought he liked her.
- What?

482
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,610
I thought your Hyungnim liked Eun Ha.

483
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:25,470
You even took all her stuff. What changed his mind?

484
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,940
Well, it's complicated.

485
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,590
Complicated?

486
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:34,910
I'd like to hear what's so complicated in person.

487
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,840
I'm sorry. I lied to you to get you there.

488
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,120
It's okay. I had fun.

489
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,500
It wasn't supposed to be fun! You even had lunch with him.

490
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,020
It's fine, she had fun! Don't you know him?

491
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,510
Highest sales for five years straight. Super popular.

492
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:53,240
You're the problem, dude!

493
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,800
How can you set her up with an actual player?

494
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,600
- We were trying to make Ji Hwan jealous-
- It's not because of the CEO.

495
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,040
I'm going to start working again. Get a fresh start.

496
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,410
Damn it.

497
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,540
Sister-in-law, couldn't you get a fresh start here?

498
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,950
That's right. Do you need to leave to do that?

499
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,850
Thank you.

500
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,320
Hyungnim is home.

501
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,710
Get up.

502
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,530
Good evening, Hyungnim.

503
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:22,580
Could you say something?

504
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,800
- She's been waiting for you.
- Since when?

505
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,050
Go Eun Ha.

506
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:56,560
Well, I just wanted to say I don't care whether you go on blind dates or not,

507
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,610
but I'd personally prefer it if you didn't call up an employee during work hours.

508
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:08,110
It wasn't during work hours. It was at lunch, as I understand.

509
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:12,150
It seemed like you had no problem taking personal meetings.

510
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:16,390
Wait. No, that wasn't a personal meeting.

511
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,870
I see. Was it a work meeting to secure Ye Na

512
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:21,650
since she got your kids' sausages to blow up?

513
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,590
Hey, have some water.

514
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:27,290
That reminds me. Homeowner, the shower on the second floor is broken.

515
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:29,820
It needs repair. It's very uncomfortable as a tenant.

516
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,640
That's because the tenant, after using the shower head,

517
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,490
places it on the faucet instead of putting it back. I was that many times.

518
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,120
It breaks because it drops to the floor. It cracks.

519
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,280
- Hyungnim.
- Speaking of the shower head,

520
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,270
could you be mindful of the direction of the shower head?

521
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:45,080
I keep getting splashed with water whenever I turn it on.

522
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:49,000
I have one. When you close your bedroom door, please make sure you don't slam it.

523
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,920
- It startles me.
- Startled...

524
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,000
Right? I forgot how sensitive and easily startled you get.

525
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,180
I'm not sensitive...

526
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,480
You sang in the middle of the night because you were in a good mood, right?

527
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,600
Yes. I did. So what?

528
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:08,410
Try not to do it. It's not pleasant in the middle of the night.

529
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:12,060
This is over. This is how my girlfriend and I broke up.

530
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,060
I sang one time.

531
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,700
How sensitive can a person be?

532
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:19,380

It didn't seem like he knew what was going to happen.

00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,280
He went into the event hall,

568
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,130
then mobsters with weapons went in after him.

01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:33,950
Yes. I understand.

885
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:36,260
I don't think you mean it.

886
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:40,960
Wow. This is frustrating.

887
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:47,040
How's the new place? Do you like it?

888

Yes, I do.

889
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:53,490
My friend's place that I mentioned yesterday is nice too. It's empty for more than a year.

890
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:02,540
A person can get used to their environment so easily.

891
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:05,780
It's easy to forget how things were before.

892
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:10,100
I used to be fine by myself.

893
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:16,390
But to be alone again feels strange and empty.

894
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:20,090
If I lived in a really nice place, it'd be sad when I have to move out.

895
01:09:20,090 --> 01:09:22,870
I want to live within my means.

899

The park! Gajisan Park!

903
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:27,770
Go to Gajisan Park! Right now!

904
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:32,050
They were weirdly so good at math problems that day.

905
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:35,850
They even got 3-digit multiplications right. But turns out,

906
01:10:35,850 --> 01:10:40,620
they hid calculators under their feet. Isn't that funny?

907
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:43,800
So funny.

908
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:49,080
It sounds like you got really close to the people there.

909
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:50,770
Yes.
