What's up with the atmosphere at work this morning?

183
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:34,100
Haven't you heard? Thugs stormed the conference room yesterday.

184
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:36,560
The thug is the CEO's father.

185
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,120
All the executives quit because they're so scared.

186
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,080
My team leader didn't show up today.

187
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,170
What's going to happen to us now?

188

- Well, okay.

198

Yes, Hyungnim.

Am I being too greedy?

202

203
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,650
I'm wondering if that was wrong.

204
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:19,080
What's wrong with living an ordinary life like others?

205
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,700
That's a given, Hyungnim.

206
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,910
I thought I could protect her.

207
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,980
But I don't know anymore.

208

210
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,180

You took responsibility.

You led us here, being responsible for all of us.

216
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,000
That's why I call you Hyungnim.

217
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,720
Because you do things I can't.

218
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,050
Something impossible?

219
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:19,230
There's no such thing. You can handle it. You can get through it.

220
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,850
You got this.

221
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,280
Why?

222
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,830
Because you're Seo Ji Hwan.

Is that why he hurt his hand?

226

Yes.

227
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:07,090
Why does Ji Hwan's dad do that to Ji Hwan?

228
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:12,360
I'm not too sure, but I think he wants a different version of his son.

229
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,260
I thought a father would want his child to be happy.

230
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,330
Never mind being happy.

231
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:26,160
At least not make him suffer like he is now.

- No need to tell me.

- Who's in charge of the case?
- Prosecutor Bae.
