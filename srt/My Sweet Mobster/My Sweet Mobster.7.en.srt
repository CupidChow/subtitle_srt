00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,820
I'm so tired.

183
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,210
That's right. We've been here before.

184
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,550
Hyungnim!

185
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,580
We're coming in, Hyungnim!

186
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:53,990
How are you doing?

187
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,100
Get out! What are you doing, Dong Hee?

188
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,270
- I was going to put the cover on you.
- I'll do it.

189
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:00,380
Thanks.

190
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,380
- Get out.
- Get some rest, Hyungnim.

191
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,280
We'll get going.

192
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,400
They're gone.

193
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,190
I had no idea we'd end up like this.

194
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:18,340
- End up like what?
- What?

195
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:27,030
You know, the prosecutor who might be Hyeon Woo...

196
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,890
Is his last name Jang?

197
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,480
How did you know?

198
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,520
Have you checked? What did he say? Is it him?

199
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,790
I'm waiting to see.

200
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,800
Why is that so hard to answer?

201
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:41,660
Hey, maybe he's married and pretending to be single?

202
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,100
- It's not like that.
- What do you mean?

203
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,320
He's Hyeon Woo, but he can't say that he is.

204
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,010
He's not Hyeon Woo, but he can't say that he's not.

205
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:53,420
He must have a reason he can't say!

206
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,420
I can't tolerate this.

207
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,830
When he's here, I'll ask him myself.

208
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,770
Who's coming here?

209
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,370
The prosecutor? Here?

210
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,560
Let me just go check on the factory.

211
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,450
If you need anything, let us know.

212
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,850
They can't run into each other.

213
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,000
Thank you.

214
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,700
Prosecutor!

215
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,250
Eun Ha.

216
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:28,260
Thank goodness, I thought I might miss you.

217
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,590
Let's go somewhere else.

218
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,270
Where?

219
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,890
- Eun Ha...
- Yes?

220
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,470
Your hand.

221
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,980
I'm sorry.

222
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,070
I wanted to show you around the hospital.

223
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:49,610
You shouldn't be wandering around, Eun Ha.

224
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,100
It's fine. I'm not even that sick.

225
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,910
These are just nutrients.

226
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,750
Hemorrhoids...

227
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,230
are serious.

228
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,070
What? Hem... what?

229
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:04,520
75% of Koreans have it at least once in their lifetime.

230
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,320
You don't need to be embarrassed.

231
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,450
Who told you I had hemorrhoids?

232
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:15,040
The front desk when I asked for your room number. Isn't that right?

233
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,620
- Those guys...
- What?

234
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:23,270
Well, I'm anemic, so I just came in for some tests.

235
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,230
- You're anemic?
- Yes.

236
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,380
- Really?
- Yes.

237
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:34,120
I don't have hemorrhoids.

238
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,300
Okay. I believe you. That's good.

239
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,450
You don't have to believe me...

240
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,200
- You do look a bit pale.
- Minnie unni!

241
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,230
Yu Na! Jun! Cheol!

242
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:51,110
I haven't seen you in forever! Long time no see! Are you guys doing okay?

243
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,580
Yes.

244
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,260
Unni, are you sick?

245
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,810
I was a little sick, but now I'm okay.

246
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,930
Why don't you come by anymore?

247
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:04,650
We're bored watching the same videos over and over again.

248
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,410
I'm sorry I haven't been able to come.

249
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:11,310
I really missed you guys, Yu Na, Jun, Cheol.

250
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,600
Who are you, Ahjeossi?

251
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,140
Isn't it obvious? It's her boyfriend.

252
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,240
Wow!

253
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,220
- He's not my boyfriend...
- What do you think?

254
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,450
Do you think I look good next to Unni?

255
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:32,680
Ahjeossi, are you strong? I like men who are strong.

256
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,020
I think that describes me.

257
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,930
I'll show you how strong I am.

258
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:41,780
Here we go!

259
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,560
Aigoo. H-Hi, you're here.

260
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,240
Yes.

261
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,180
Oh, Eun Ha just went out to get something.

262
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,440
She'll be right back. Go on in.

263
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,960
It's okay. Here...

264
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,990
Her shoes were back there.

265
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,740
I just came to drop this off.

266
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,400
Eun Ha will be sad if you leave without seeing her.

267
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,270
I have to head out now to run an errand.

268
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,390
Wait inside. It's okay!

269
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,090
- Then...
- Let me open it for you.

270
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:35,250
Don't worry. Go on in.

271
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:48,840
Prosecutor, you're so good at playing with kids.

272
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,730
Oh, no. Compared to you, I'm not even close.

273
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,750
You're the professional at playing with kids.

274
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,930
It seems like you still love kids.

275
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,820
Are you done being a content creator?

276
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,970
A lot of things happened.

277
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,480
I'm scared of the fact that the kids could get hurt because of me.

278
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,950
I don't have the courage yet.

279
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:27,020
Everyone has those concerns. Including me.

280
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:35,500
But you must have started this work for a reason.

281
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:43,210
I'll go now. Don't come down. Get some rest.

282
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,170
- Get some rest.
- Okay.

283
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,420
The door is closing.

284
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,660
So, is there a break-in every once in a while?

285
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:35,910
No, that's not it. I'm just used to being alert.

286
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:08,430
♫ I remember a story from a long time ago ♫

287
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:18,100
♫ We were flowing like water ♫

288
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:26,430
♫ Will I ever hear your voice again? ♫

289
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,080
Close your eyes and count to ten.

290
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,320
Your videos. Keep making them.

291
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,470
Because I miss watching them.

292
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:41,770
♫ We said our final farewell ♫

293
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:45,150
♫ Now we meet each other again ♫

294
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:50,450
♫ This fated miracle ♫

295
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:54,220
♫ I hope it turns into love ♫

296
00:24:54,220 --> 00:25:01,880
♫ You ♫

297
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:09,060
♫ You ♫

298
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:17,120
Oh. I'm so sorry.

299
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,430
I dozed off while I was waiting.

300
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:23,030
It's okay. I just got here.

301
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,960
You don't look well. Get some rest.

302
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,440
I'm okay.

303
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,650
You really don't look well.

304
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,790
I'm totally fine.

305
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:33,050
How about getting a shot?

306
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,950
It's okay.

307
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,230
"It's okay, it's okay."

308
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,990
That means you'll get one, right?

309
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:44,130
No... I... really... am okay.

310
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,560
Get some sleep.

311
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:58,020
I'll sit here and be quiet.

312
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,640
Let me know if you need anything.

313
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,570
Aigoo...

314
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,170
Well, um...

315
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,790
- I'll just stay like this for a second.
- Okay.

316
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,830
CEO, what were you like as a kid?

317
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,130
Seo Ji Hwan now...

318
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,990
is sensitive to small noises,

319
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,980
can't sleep deeply, no matter how tired he is,

320
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,480
feels more comfortable in the dark,

321
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,470
and furrows his brows when he's sleeping.

322
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:47,620
I'm curious what Seo Ji Hwan was like 20 or 30 years ago.

323
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,730
Did he sleep well back then?

324
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:57,860
So deeply that someone could run off with him?

325
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:09,450
He never answers any of my questions.

326
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:12,170
Did he ever open up to someone before?

327
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,670
There was...

328
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,370
just one person.

329
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:19,560
Who was it?

330
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,080
When I was little,

331
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,370
I moved around a lot.

332
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,230
Even if I grew close to someone,

333
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:35,290
I knew I had to leave them.

334
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:39,230
That's why I didn't open up easily. But...

335
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,290
with that one person, that was impossible.

336
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,590
Why?

337
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:49,970
Maybe because I think we seemed similar.

338
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,510
In what way?

339
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:56,220
She looked so alone.

340
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,490
So, I wanted to be close to her.

341
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:06,020
I just wanted to be by her side.

342
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,700
What happened next? Do you still talk?

343
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,050
No.

344
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,920
That's the last I saw of her.

345
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,710
But...

346
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:22,570
I believe she's doing well...

347
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,200
somewhere out there.

348
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,730
My shoulders are still sore from working.

349
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,580
Dong Hee?

350
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,430
Are you okay?

351
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:48,560
Totally okay.

352
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,800
I'm still so tired, no matter how much I sleep.

353
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,420
I don't have an appetite.

354
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,820
Where's Hyungnim?

355
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,800
Well, he didn't come home.

356
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,570
Hyungnim spent the night elsewhere?

357
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,850
F-For real?

358
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,410
Oh, my, miss. Your purse is on the floor.

359
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,260
Thank you.

360
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:21,420
I'm having a neck spasm.

361
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,700
My neck won't move.

362
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:29,860
Hold on. No, no...

363
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,150
No...

364
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,900
You're so good at that.

365
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,710
You should be a masseuse. A little lower.

366
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,920
You're so good at that...

367
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,910
Mi Ho, are you okay?

368
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,350
Oh, no. Does it hurt a lot? Should we go to the hospital? Get an X-ray?

369
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:07,380
I don't need to be hospitalized for a neck spasm. Forget it.

370
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,650
Why did you sleep here? You should have gone home.

371
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,280
Il Yeong!

372
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:17,690
Here.

373
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,130
- I'm getting a cab.
- No way. You have a neck spasm.

374
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,650
Just take the ride. Il Yeong, please take care of Mi Ho.

375
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,020
I can go home on my own.

376
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,210
Il Yeong, Samcheong-dong.

377
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:29,580
- Please.
- No, no.

378
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:32,440
Hey. If it gets worse, go to the hospital right away. Close the shop for the day.

379
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,840
If you'll open, call me. I'll go and clean.

380
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,590
Be careful. Careful.

381
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,070
I'm not getting in!

382
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,640
Get in! It looks like it hurts!

383
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:44,100
- No!
- Take care of her, Il Yeong.

384
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,590
Sure.

385
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,650
Hey! I'm going to kill you!

386
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,460
Go like this. The other way.

387
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,070
Geez!

388
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,410
Bye!

389
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,300
How are you feeling?

390
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,490
Fine.

391
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:06,680
I'm sorry.

392
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,520
I didn't mean to scare you.

393
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,330
I'm sure it was a "mistake."

394
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,300
- That was actually a mistake.
- Damn it!

395
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:23,550
Are you a mistake maniac?

396
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:52,330
Thanks for the ride.

397
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:56,040
If you need to charge, let me know.

398
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,390
Stop right there.

399
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,760
Dad?

400
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,880
Hey.

401
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,150
You with XY chromosomes.

402
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:11,300
Move two meters to your left.

403
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,280
Dad, I think there's been a huge misunderstanding.

404
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,580
My daughter, who packed a bag to stay the night elsewhere without telling me.

405
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,080
Do not speak.

406
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,500
You have a good sense of distance.

407
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,820
To the left!

408
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,080
To the front!

409
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,990
That's your house, sir.

410
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,410
My house.

411
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:43,650
Go! Left foot, left foot.

412
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,550
Left foot, left foot.

413
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:50,120
Change feet. Left foot, left foot, left foot.

414
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,690
[Die before kneeling]

415
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,320
Age.

416
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,520
29.

417
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,000
You look young.

418
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,060
Your face looks way younger than that.

419
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,590
- Name.
- Joo Il Yeong.

420
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,440
What a nice name.

421
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,170
- Where do you belong?
- I work at a company.

422
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:18,070
Do you not know what "belong" means? Which company?

423
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:23,950
Dad, you're barking up the wrong tree. Totally wrong.

424
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,270
My daughter, who stayed the night elsewhere...

425
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:28,670
Have I ever told you I'm staying out?

426
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,480
Were you also with Mi Ho last week?

427
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:37,450
If you don't answer me within one second,

428
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,790
I will consider your answer a lie.

429
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,660
You're so good-looking.

430
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,470
Ow. I need to stand up.

431
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:47,470
Stand up. Oh, no. Your knee...

432
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,010
Mom, Dad! He has to go to work! What are you doing? Just go.

433
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,760
Stop right there!

434
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,000
Stay for breakfast. Sit. Eat breakfast.

435
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
- Pardon?
- Sit down.

436
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,040
Honey.

437
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,650
He has to go to work!

438
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:11,880
We just need to set the table. Grab a bite.

439
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,030
- Honey, fill it up.
- Sure, sure.

440
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,620
Mom, Mom! Don't!

441
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,950
- I-I...
- Do you like eggs?

442
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,830
Fish cakes? Lotus roots?

443
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,260
Sit, sit down.

444
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,940
- Sit down, sit.
- You should go.

445
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:28,000
- Sit down.
- Have a seat.

[Thirsty Deer Corp.]

447
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:37,530
Wow. It's huge.

448
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,830
Wow, it's a gigantic sausage.

449
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,060
Hello.

450
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:08,070
I'm here to meet with the CEO. I have something for him.

451
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:11,520
I'm sorry, but the CEO can't see you without an appointment.

452
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,490
Oh, right, right.

453
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,650
I...

454
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,010
know Mr. Seo Ji Hwan.

455
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,330
We're close. My name is Go Eun Ha.

456
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:27,070
If you call him, he'll know. Go Eun Ha.

457
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,930
You misunderstood. It's not like that!

458
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,610
- I just need to get this to him!
- Please leave.

459
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,790
- Let's talk outside.
- I'm not a weirdo!

460
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,160
Minnie unni!

461
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,620
Hong Gi!

462
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,510
This thing. This.

463
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,480
I heard from Marketing Team Leader Yang

464
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,980
that you don't need a model who can't eat meat.

465
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,750
Is breaking a contract this easy?

466
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:52,030
I'm sorry about that.

467
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:55,600
But I think you're partially responsible for not informing us in advance.

468
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,910
Can't you just use a body double for eating scenes?

469
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,250
I don't know about other places, but that's not how we work.

470
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,120
- I can shoot without having to eat.
- Ms. Kang Ye Na.

471
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,490
- Ms. Kang Ye Na.
- Yes, Mr. Seo Ji Hwan.

472
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:05,640
Do you even know what sausage tastes like?

473
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,360
When was the last time you had some?

474
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,770
How is our product different from others?

475
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,750
Are you able to explain?

476
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,470
If you need to take legal action,

477
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,800
go ahead.

478
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,500
I get what you're saying.

479
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,520
So if I can eat it, we can make it work?

480
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,500
The door is closing.

481
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,980
Dong Hee!

482
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,520
Teacher.

483
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:47,610
Wow, is this your desk?

484
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:50,660
You look so cool like this!

485
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:55,070
This is Mr. Seo's wallet. I wanted to hand it to him.

486
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,390
Is he inside? Oh, there.

487
00:38:57,390 --> 00:39:01,030
Wait. He's meeting with someone.

488
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:08,440
It's Ye Na.

489
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,010
Oh, about modeling.

490
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,720
Well...

491
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,840
Dong Hee.

492
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,180
I'll give it to him.

493
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:52,050
We didn't do anything wrong. Why...

494
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,950
I think I got my point across.

495
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:58,480
I hope we can stop talking about this now.

496
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:08,300
I won't take legal action.

497
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,400
I'll make you chase me, Mr. Seo.

498
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,930
Hyungnim.

499
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:24,170
Hey, what's going on?

500
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:26,100
Clean up!

501
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,410
- Sir!
- What?

502
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:30,060
Could you let me out just for a day?

503
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,550
I'm not asking you to let me go. I'll come right back.

504
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:35,660
Just a day. If not, just a phone call.

505
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,890
I'll just say I'm okay and hang up right away.

506
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:40,190
They got in via the port of Incheon around 3 a.m. today.

507
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:43,500
Look closely. It's blurry, but it's definitely Ta Whan.

508
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,410
Any movement since then?

509
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:47,100
She is as fast as they say.

510
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,810
She changed cars many times. Officer Yang lost her.

511
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:53,850
She showed up here herself.

512
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,240
Something is different about this deal.

513
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,220
When you hear from Officer Yang,

514
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,030
let me know.

515
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,290
- Got it.
- Okay.

516
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,860
By any chance...

517
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:06,070
how do you track down a person?

518
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:08,590
Who? Let me find them for you.

519
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,650
Name, age, sex.

520
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:14,300
Born in 1988, Hyeon Woo.

521
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:16,020
Hyeon Woo.

522
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,120
That's you.

523
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,400
Are you looking for yourself?

524
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,150
Are you trying to find yourself?

525
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:25,660
It might be faster to do that yourself instead of me.

526
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:31,640
I am finding myself, but it's a different person.

527
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,650
It won't be easy to find him without a last name.

528
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:38,010
We could use a private investigator, but that's illegal.

529
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:42,000
But we could use governmental powers, but that's also illegal.

530
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,200
Then, could I look at a list of households from a certain year?

531
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:49,050
I don't think that's illegal.

532
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,060
- Please.
- Sure.

533
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,030
What?

534
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,600
W-Why do you have this?

535
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,750
The teacher dropped it off.

536
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,830
Eun Ha was here?

537
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:15,040
- Yes.
- Why didn't you let her in?

538
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,810
So if I can eat it, we can make it work?

539
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,540
She saw that?

540
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:28,000
What part?

541
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:31,710
The hands.

542
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,910
Dang it.

543
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:42,150
I thought beautiful women were a nuisance.

544
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,940
That definitely did not look like

545
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,990
someone who found her a nuisance.

546
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:51,550
Where is that thing?

547
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:55,350
Everyone is on time today.

548
00:42:55,350 --> 00:42:57,670
Do you have your introductions?

549
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,800
No need for introductions.

550
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,140
Introduce us to where Hyungnim was last night.

551
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,520
Do you have to ask?

552
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:07,200
The torrid affairs between a man and a woman?

553
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,880
You were with him, right, little rat?

554
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,550
Your bratty friend said she wasn't with you.

555
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,440
What were you two doing?

556
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:18,520
What is there to do at night besides sleep?

557
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,280
You slept together?

558
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:23,800
So...

559
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,690
the two of you... "We just held hands."

560
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:29,450
Don't... Don't give me that cliché.

561
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,300
We didn't hold hands.

562
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:35,020
- You didn't hold hands?
- We didn't hold hands.

563
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,550
I can't do class today.

564
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:38,450
- Where are you going?
- Let me get him.

565
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,020
Where are you going?

566
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,400
- What's wrong?
- I'm sorry, but I need to make a phone call.

567
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:46,520
What? What's wrong...

568
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:59,400
You've heard our prayers.

569
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:14,050
- You're home late.
- Oh, hello.

570
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:18,890
Well...

571
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:22,120
well, you know...

572
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:26,660
- Have you eaten?
- You haven't eaten?

573
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:30,320
Thank you.

574
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,760
Fried rice.

575
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,780
I used some leftover stuff in the fridge.

576
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,040
Thank you so much. I'll enjoy this meal.

577
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,390
Did you get your wallet?

578
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,440
You looked busy, so I just handed it off.

579
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,330
That's right. Well, she was there for work.

580
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:55,750
You hold hands for work?

581
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,780
No. It wasn't like that.

582
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,090
She can't eat meat.

583
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,330
But she tried to eat sausage, so...

584
00:45:01,330 --> 00:45:04,570
She tried to eat sausage, so you held hands.

585
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:06,820
- No, I...
- Have some.

586
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:12,280
Are you sure you've never been with anyone at age 36?

587
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,270
The way you held her hand was so natural.

588
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,120
Go on.

589
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,050
Eat slowly.

590
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:33,270
Was I eating too fast?

591
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:35,350
CEO, could you answer my question...

592
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:37,350
About that...

593
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:41,120
Are you sure you've never been with anyone at age 36?

594
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,920
Oh, there's water.

595
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:50,040
You won't get a deep clean like that. Use more force.

596
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,280
It should be making clean noises.

597
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,440
Yes. That's right. Good job.

598
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:03,790
- I'm sorry, I'll wipe it off-
- No, it's okay-

599
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:06,200
I'm sorry. One second.

600
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,390
- Let me wipe it for you.
- It's okay.

601
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:10,030
- One second.
- I'm fine.

602
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,940
One second.

603

00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,370
What... What's happening?

605
00:46:27,370 --> 00:46:29,600
- What is that?
- It's now.

606
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,290
We're home, Hyungnim!

607
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:47,070
Oh, hey, guys. You're home.

00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:50,930
What are you doing? Cleaning, huh? Stand up right now.

Have you all eaten?

610
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,980
I made some fried rice!

611
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,770
Hey.

612
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:32,070
I think Taek stopped by often, though.

613
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:37,180
Their house is stocked, and repairs have been done.

614
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:41,140
He washed his hands clean after he learned he had a sister.

615
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:44,060
He must have taken good care of them.

616
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:45,420
Did something happen down there?

617
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:47,310
A prosecutor followed us.

618
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:49,740
Did Taek already get into trouble?

619
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:53,410
He wouldn't have followed us otherwise.

620
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:59,830
Did I call you at a bad time?

621
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,200
No.

622
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,590
- Have you eaten?
- Yes.

623
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,050
You ate?

624
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:14,120
I got some bread. The kind you like.

625
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:18,590
I had to run an errand around here and had extra time.

626
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:20,610
Take it with you later.

627
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,500
But why do you speak formally on the phone?

628
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:31,450
Did I? Did I do that?

629
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:38,710
I guess I was making an official inquiry as a prosecutor.

630
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:42,680
But seeing your face, it feels friendly.

631
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,950
That's why I'm speaking informally.

632
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,160
I mean...

633
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,810
should I speak formally again?

634
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,590
You want to know about Taek, right?

635
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:02,730
Well, that, too.

636
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,990
Nothing new.

637
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,760
Anything about him meeting with anyone?

638
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,990
No.

639
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:15,820
He only talks about important stuff with Il Yeong.

00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,870
Prosecutor.

641
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:29,910
The CEO won't do anything differently if I'm gone.

642
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:33,850
What does that mean?

643
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:40,510
He'll look for me, just the same.

644
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:48,120
Come in.

00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,680
Is it ready?

00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:52,330
You think I would be here without it?

647
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:55,140
Enough with the small talk. The location?

648
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:57,550
Where do you want him to send it to?

649
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,410
Do not play tricks with me.

00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:05,960

Yes. He is.

There's a deal tomorrow morning.

659
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:00,030
Taek didn't go by his own will.

00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:01,960
What are you talking about?

661
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:06,610
What Ta Whan wanted from the start was not Taek but his neck.

662
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:11,530
She became the boss because of Taek. But to quiet her opponents,

663
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:12,760
she needs a reason.

664
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:17,540
Taek wasn't the method but the condition of the deal.

665
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,650

00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:36,860
That means Taek kept his word.
