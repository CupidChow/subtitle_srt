You scared me.

What? When did you come in?

134
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,830
About five minutes ago.

135
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,800
Why didn't you say anything?

136
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,270
Are you a ninja? Make some noise.

137
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,080
I called you three times.

Didn't you hear me?

139
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,650
- What's up?
- Sister-in-law isn't coming home tonight.

140
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,020
Stop calling her that-

141
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,070
- Wait, why?
- She's staying over at a friend's place.

142
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:11,160
Something happened, right?

143
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,640
No wonder she's not coming home. You talked about cleaning there?

144
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,990
What else could I do? The prosecutor confessed his feelings first

145
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,840
and what could I say?

146
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,480
They were drinking at the park, all friendly...

147
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,300
"Get a headstart. Attack first. Don't let your guard down."

148
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,180
You used to say that all the time.

149
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,880
He stole your timing. What will you do now?

150
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,760
Are you rubbing salt in the wound?

151
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,840
I was trying to get advice.

152
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,230
If rubbing salt on you would work, I would've done it already.

153
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,440
If you know it so well,

154
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,240
did it always work for you without a hitch?

155
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,790
A guy who calls it a "mistake" like a coward?

156
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,650
I'm not into it, either.

157
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,110
If Eun Ha likes the Prosecutor, how could I hang onto her?

158
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:57,330
It's not like I'm ordinary like other people.

159
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:05,600
You seem to think you're special, but that's narcissistic.

160
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,980
Your face...

161
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,280
Your personality is a little below average.

162
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,510
You know what I mean. Stop kidding around.

163
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,700
I think the difference between you and that Prosecutor

164
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,890
is that he was honest about his feelings, and you weren't.

165
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:26,790
That's it.

166
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,020
If you like her, tell her honestly.

167
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,460
You don't know how she feels.

168
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,520
Why give up already?

169
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,910
Today was so fun, right?

170
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,340
You usually go easy on them.

171
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:47,170
You were merciless today.

172
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:49,360
Did it energize you to get a confession of love?

173
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,370
I got energy, and I got anger, too.

174
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:00,800
They say even a penguin woos another penguin offering a rock.

175
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,320
He even looks like a penguin.

176
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,290
How can he be worse than a penguin?

177
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,400
I'm the idiot for expecting something when his mouth is frozen shut.

178
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,980
Hey. It's a good thing.

179
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,350
I thought those people must at least have loyalty, but they don't.

180
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:21,320
Fine. They can stick together and live beautifully forever.

181

I'm so mad I did that for nothing. You get it, right?

185
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:38,570
I know. I mean, you know I rarely get this angry, right?

186

No use getting upset over someone who's impossible. It's my loss. Let's just sleep.

What guy?

204
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,570
I only saw him from afar, but he was tall and pretty good-looking.

That's the concern, dude.

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,210
He's not the only one who's nervous.

356
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:46,590
Those around him are nervous, too.

357
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,950
Let's just focus on our work.

358
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,690
Go Yang Hui's drug money

359
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:55,820
is likely the hidden funds from Seo Tae Pyeong that we couldn't track down 10 years ago.

360
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,960
Please find some clues by the end of the day.

361
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,930
You and me?

362
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,790
By the end of the day? All of this? On a Sunday?

363
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:05,780
It's Sunday. A holiday.

364
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,640
You, too?

365
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,120
These are the files you requested.

366
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,100
Thank you. Please.

367
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,860
Wow, I was going to kick back and watch baseball. It's more chaotic here.

368
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,620
No matter where I run, it's work, work, work, work.

369
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,520
Work, we need to break up.

370
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,110
Let's get this done today.

371
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,510
Is a trip supposed to feel like this?

372
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:40,620
I haven't gone on many trips.

373
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:44,310
Should we turn on the radio? It's so quiet.

374
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:49,460
That, that. That over there.

375
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,630
Can I eat it?

376
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,480
Here you go.

377
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,750
Thank you.

378
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:08,290
Hey, have one.

379
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,720
Thank you.

380
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,710
This is so good.

381
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:32,990
Eun Ha.

382
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,210
- Sorry.
- Man Ho, what are you doing?

383
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:40,450
I'm so sorry.

384
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:44,000
Eun Ha, I'm sorry. I didn't do it on purpose. Suddenly...

385
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,270
- the car...
- It's fine.

386
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:48,140
- Hey, one more!
- I'm sorry!

387
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,090
Seriously? Come on.

388
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,900
Hey, you!

389
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,480
You two!

390
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,960
- I'm sorry, Hyungnim.
- Get it together.

391
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,520
- Are you okay? Are you hurt?
- No.

392
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,800
I'll do better, Hyungnim.

393
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,630
What's with this...

394
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,980
Isn't the Prosecutor acting odd today?

395
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,420
He's throwing himself into work like someone who got rejected after confessing his feelings.

396
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,470
I can hear you.

397
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:24,810
You have good hearing.

398
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:28,920
You're not the type who would do that impulsively without buying flowers.

399
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,530
I wasn't rejected.

400
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,290
That means you told a girl you liked her.

401
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,060
Who is it? Who could it be?

402
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,140
Is it her? Minnie unni?

403
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:43,590
I caught you on a date.

404
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,430
I didn't realize what time it was.

405
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:48,820
It's weekend. I'll buy lunch. What would you like?

406
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,430
If it's Minnie unni, why are you in distress?

407
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:58,540
Maybe you have a rival, and she has feelings for your rival?

408
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,500
Wow! Chief Oh, you should go ahead and start a mind-reading business.

409
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,760
In terms of love, I have no competition in contemporary Korea.

410
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,100
Anyway, if it's a questionable confession, it's better not to do it.

411
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,900
Based on my experience,

412
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,130
girls could go, "Oppa, you're so funny! You're so fun!"

413
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,460
"Oppa, you're the life of the party! What would I do without you? You're the best!"

414
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,500
But once you tell her how you feel,

415
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,640
they ghost immediately.

416
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,530
That's why I can't remember any of my female hoobaes' faces.

417
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:34,900
If one can't return someone's feelings, cutting them off is the polite thing to do.

418
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:43,300
That's why one might choose to hide their feelings to stay in that person's life.

419
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,190
Weren't you aware you might never see her again?

420
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,160
I didn't think of that.

421
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,690
I just...

422
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:06,650
really wanted to tell her at the moment.

423
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,880
That's why I did it.

424
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:25,010
- This is nice.
- Where are we?

425
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,890
Let me carry that.

426
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,920
- Hyungnim.
- Let's go inside.

427
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,040
Noona, hurry up.

428
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,500
- Hurry!
- Let's go in.

429
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,760
- Hyungnim.
- Go on in.

430
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,390
- Aigoo, Sister-in-law. You don't have to do that.
- Hyungnim.

431
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,720
You don't have to lift a finger. Let me do it.

432
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,650
Where are you going? There are so many bags. Carry this one.

433
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,670
Carry this. Quickly.

434
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:49,520
- While we're here...
- Are all the bags out?

435
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,640
Oh, Hyungnim! Take this, too!

436
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,530
You have ketchup on your shirt.

437
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,110
I'm sorry, Hyungnim.

438
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,500
Hey, hey. Open the door.

439
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,430
Hey! What are you doing?

440
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,750
Whoa, whoa!

441
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:15,300
Have a seat. Relax.

442
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,790
Have a seat.

443
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,440
Noona.

444
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,930
Are you really a hairdresser?

445
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:26,190
What kind of hairstyle would suit me?

446
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,220
The shadow perm is not bad.

447
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,350
I think just toning down your color would be nice.

448
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,860
Tone it down?

449
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,700
- Is it a little too bright?
- Yeah, a little bit.

450
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,620
How about him?

451
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:44,890
Let me see.

452
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,360
- What's your personal color?
- I'm cool-toned.

453
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,910
- Aren't you warm-tone?
- I don't think so.

454
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,990
- He's good-looking tone.
- Come on.

455
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,430
- You'll look good with anything.
- You like pretty boys.

456
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,910
Il Yeong, is Hyungnim still in the shower?

457
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,970
Noona, I'll stop by the salon. Can I get your number?

458
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,650
Dude! Is he still in the shower?

459
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,460
Yes. He's taking a long time.

460
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,320
Why didn't you say so?

461
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,780
I'll look around for a minute. Mi Ho, want to come?

462
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,320
I'm going to get some rest. Go ahead.

463
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,700
See you.

464
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,930
Hong Gi, eat this.

465
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,750
Thanks.

466
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,860
If you like her, tell her honestly.

467
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,040
You don't know how she feels.

468
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,230
Why give up already?

469
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,480
You shouldn't eat uncooked ramen.

470
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,040
We brought all the groceries.

471
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,460
That looks good on you.

472
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,330
If the hanger is good, everything looks good on it.

473
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,860
Dong Hee, where's Eun Ha?

474
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,340
She went outside to look around.

475
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,820
Really?

476
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,290
W-W-Why isn't she back? It's been more than an hour.

477
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:56,490
- Hey, call her. Call her now. Right now.
- Yeah, call.

478
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,110
The phone is turned off. After the beep...

479
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,630
Her phone's off.

480
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,910
Her phone must be out of battery.

481
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,350
I tried calling her a while ago.

482
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,730
Why are you telling us now?

483
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,070
- Try her again.
- Hyungnim!

484
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,460
Where are you going?

485
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,370
Geez!

486
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,650
She's probably just circling around.

487
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,490
Circling around?

488
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,450
These people are impossible.

489
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,680
- Do you see her?
- Hyungnim.

490
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,850
- Do you see her?
- No.

491
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,580
Hyungnim.

492
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,420
I didn't see her on the way to the supermarket.

493
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,640
Where did she go?

494
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,640
Did she go home?

495
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,250
Drive, drive!

496
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:52,470
Hurry up and get in.

497
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,720
- Hyungnim!
- Where are you going?

498
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,190
Hyungnim, she's not over there.

499
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,660
Where are you going?

500
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,170
I told you she's not over there.

501
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:05,840
- Ow!
- Dong Hee!

502
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,770
Little Rat might come back.

503
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:10,200
Look for her around here. Okay?

504
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,820

- Sister-in-law!
- Noona!

507
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,110
- Do we really need to do this?
- Little Rat!

508
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,780
Sister-in-law!

509
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,150
I'm sure she'll be back!

510
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,630
Teacher!

00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,690

707
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,530
So good.

708
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:26,190
I'm okay.

709
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:35,780
Our household's youngest, Dong Hee.

710
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:38,450
We should take care of our youngest.

711
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:40,440
Good, right?

712
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,320
Try some meat.

713
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,120
Smell it. They're so flavorful.

714
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,600
- Later.
- You must not like meat very much.

715
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,450
You two came back together. Have you made up?

716
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:54,710
Do you need to ask?

717
00:44:54,710 --> 00:44:57,560
I don't think Noona is leaving anymore.

718
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,100
How do you know that?

719
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:02,870
She said, "Our household's youngest." Our household.

720
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:05,160
That's right! She said, "Our household"!

721
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,110
Right? If she's leaving in a day or two, she wouldn't say that.

722
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:11,130
Then she would say, "Your household."

723
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:13,630
Teacher, are you really not leaving?

724
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:17,590
Well, I mean...

725
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:21,120
How could I? When you guys want me to stay so much.

726
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,510
Yay!

727
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:24,580
You can relax now, Hyungnim.

728
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:28,350
Go Eun Ha! Go Eun Ha!

729
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:31,210
Go Eun Ha! Go Eun Ha!

730
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,670
He should stop drinking.

731
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:37,820
- Who fed him so much alcohol?
- He did it to himself.

732
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:38,820
Go inside.

733
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,860
- Go inside.
- Good night.

734
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,970
Go inside!

735
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,530
Are you okay?

736
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:51,410
Come on! What are you doing?

737
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:54,510
Geez! Let's go inside, come on.

738
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,850
Where did it go?

739
00:46:00,850 --> 00:46:02,510
Why do I not have it?

740
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:05,210
Where did I drop it?

741
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,810
Wait, it can't be here...

742
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,790
I'm going to lose my mind.

743
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:40,360
I'm going to lose it.

744
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,820
Where...

745
00:46:41,820 --> 00:46:44,730
Where did I put it?

746
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:48,830
What if someone saw it? I haven't even seen it.

747
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:52,210
Is it in there?

748
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:53,780
Mi Ho.

749
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,460
Are you okay?

750
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,970
Yes, I'm okay.

751
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,610
Are you looking for something?

752
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,210
No.

753
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:11,810
I'm not. I'm getting out.

754
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,090
Mi Ho.

755
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,620
Here.

756
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:28,690
I noticed you barely ate. It's for digestion.

757
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,470
Did you run to the pharmacy?

758
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:39,190
It's not fair if you don't get to eat on vacation.

759
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:44,140
Thank you.

760
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,070
- Mi Ho.
- Oh, and...

761
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:53,020
Seems like we'll see each other occasionally through Eun Ha.

762
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:56,950
Let's be comfortable around each other as friends.

763
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:43,270
So, are you together?

764
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:45,690
What do you mean, together?

765
00:48:49,870 --> 00:48:53,160
If we said "I like you" to each other, are we together?

766
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,670
- It's warm.
- I'm going to wash up.

767
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:06,910
Okay. You go first.

768
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:15,560
Eun Ha, can you come outside for a second?

769
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:27,870
Are you okay?

770
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:29,260
Yes.

771
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,780
Have a seat.

772
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:38,530
I...

773
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:00,160
- Why...
- I'm sorry.

774
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,150
This is for your ankle, Eun Ha.

775
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:05,000
Thank you.

776
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:11,130
You can p-p-put it on your ankle.

777
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,930
I will. But are you okay, Ji Hwan?

778
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:15,050
- I-I...
- Are you...

779
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:17,060
I'm s-s-so fine.

780
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:18,950
It's nothing. What's wrong with me?

781
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:21,630
I'm fine. I wasn't hurt. I'm okay...

782
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,940
But... w-w-why...

783
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:26,630
No!

784
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:27,980
Is there something on my face?

785
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,430
S-Stand up. You should go to your room and ice your ankle.

786
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:34,090
Already?

787
00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:36,200
Y-Yes... I-I'm sorry!

788
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,370
Wait...

789
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,660
She's so pretty.

790
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:56,730
What just happened?

791
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:06,910
Rock, paper, scissor, shoot!

792
00:51:12,890 --> 00:51:14,290
This is the last one.

793
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:16,830
Let me park and come up. Go ahead.

794
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:18,610
- Be safe.
- Okay.

795
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,420
What is this?

796
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,250
Does someone have Covid?

797
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:53,510
[Eun Ha, everything is okay, right?]

798
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:09,390
Prosecutor, are you free tonight?

799
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:14,060
Weren't you aware you might never see her again?

800
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:19,270
That's why one might choose to hide their feelings to stay in that person's life.

801
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,730
Going to work?

802
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,200
Oh, y-yes. H-How about you, Eun Ha?

803
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,890
I need to cancel my lease.

804
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:39,780
Right.

805
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:43,460
I'll give you the deposit since it was my fault.

806
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,280
No. I did it to myself. I'll take care of it.

807
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:48,020
Okay.

808
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,460
One second.

809
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:50,790
W-What's wrong?

810
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:53,100
Your tie is a little...

811
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:56,030
I'll do it. It's good now.

812
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,410
It's good.

813
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,440
What? Why is he avoiding me?

814
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,820
Does he think I'll hurt him?

815
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,610
Go, go, go...

816
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:16,960
That was dangerous.

817
00:53:17,810 --> 00:53:19,900
What's wrong with me...

818
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,170
Drive, drive!

819
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,480
Get in the car!

820
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,720
Geez...

821
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:47,270
Damn it.

822
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:52,940
Without Gang Gil, no one knows how to do their job.

823
00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:04,850
Geez, I need to have my revenge against Seo Ji Hwan.

824
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,960
That girl who plays with kids.

825
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:11,750
Is she still doing that work?

826
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:21,860
This is for your ankle, Eun Ha.

827
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,850
Thank you.

828
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:28,740
I will. But are you okay, Ji Hwan?

829
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,520
I'm s-s-so fine.

830
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:32,620
- One second.
- W-What's wrong?

831
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:34,640
It's good.

832
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:40,910
Why did he tell me he likes me when he can't even make eye contact?

833
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:45,000
So funny.

834
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,650
Should I see who wins?

835
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:55,460
CEO?

836
00:54:57,090 --> 00:54:58,620
CEO.

837
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,130
Could you sign?

838
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:04,260
When did you get here?

839
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:13,660
Hey, Il Yeong. When we were heading out yesterday morning,

840
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:16,010
I think I saw someone suspicious in front of the house.

841
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:17,060
Yesterday morning?

842
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:19,310
I didn't get a good look because I was getting in the car.

843
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:22,580
But you never know. So, check the CCTVs around the house.

844
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,380
Got it.

845
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:36,720
Eun Ha?

846
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,660
Peek-a-boo! Ji Hwan!

847
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:41,500
It's Eun Ha unni.

848
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,510
Do you like bunnies or me?

849
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:47,980
Do you like "Oppa" or "honey?" Ji Hwan! Honey!

850
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:54,030
W-W-What? What is wrong with me?

851
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,540
Why does this happen whenever I see her lips?

852
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,120
Get it together. What's wrong with you?

853
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,200
I can hold back. Oh, Lord, please answer my call.

854
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,230
Help me, Lord.

855
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,570
Ji Hwan! Honey!

856
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,310
Prosecutor.

857
00:56:56,560 --> 00:56:58,610
Eun Ha, you made it.

858
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:02,750
You haven't eaten yet, right? My treat. What do you want to eat?

859
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,560
Can I really tell you everything I want to eat?

860
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,950
Yes.

861
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,980
This was in the car?

862
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:13,630
At first, I thought it was a covid test, but Hong Gi said no.

863
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:14,600
So, I figured.

864
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,980
Two lines mean pregnant, for sure.

865
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:19,040
So whose is this?

866
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:27,240
Little Rat.

867
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,450
Sister-in-law?

868
00:57:28,450 --> 00:57:29,850
Teacher?

869
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:32,560
Why do you assume the perp is a woman?

870
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:36,390
It could be one of us's girlfriends.

871
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:40,830
In that case, Dong Hee, be honest. Do you have a girlfriend?

872
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:42,640
- No.
- Really?

873
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,850
- How about you?
- You know I broke up.

874
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,300
I don't think it's one of us.

875
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,940
When did you come out?

876
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:54,400
- What is that?
- Il Yeong.

877
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,390
This was on the floor of the car.

878
00:57:57,390 --> 00:58:00,310
It's not a Covid test. It's a pregnancy test.

879
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,320
So, whose is it?

880
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,760
If it has two lines, that means she's pregnant.

881
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,620
It has to be Little Rat.

882
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:09,690
She's the only girl in our house!

883
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:12,010
Try some meat.

884
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:15,180
Smell it. They're so flavorful.

885
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:17,270
Later.

886
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:19,020
Are you looking for something?

887
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,260
No.

888
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,950
I'm not. I'm getting out.

889
00:58:31,810 --> 00:58:33,420
It's so good.

890
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:37,840
Was ramen really the thing you wanted to eat the most?

891
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:42,590
I don't usually eat stuff like ramen.

892
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:46,290
But the ramen we had was so good that I kept thinking about it.

893
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:49,150
The supermarket ramen? That was really good.

894
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:53,590
I didn't tell you, but I was so flustered inside.

895
00:58:53,590 --> 00:58:58,060
All the places I looked up were closed, and my stomach was grumbling...

896
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:01,940
I was afraid you'd say you were going to leave.

897
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:05,470
Maybe that's why it was extra delicious.

898
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:07,960
Maybe.

899
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,490
- Prosecutor.
- Well...

900
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:15,020
Auntie, we're here.

901
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:17,840
- Hey guys, how many?
- Five more.

902
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,460
Give me a minute. I'll be right with you.

903
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,270
Should we get tteokbokki?

904
00:59:22,270 --> 00:59:24,640
It's a little loud in here.

905
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:28,460
Should we get some ice cream and talk?

906
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:29,820
Sure. That sounds good.

907
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:33,020
You bought the ramen, so I'll buy the ice cream.

908
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,120
Sure.

909
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:36,140
- Should we?
- Yes.

910
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,610
Thank you.

911
00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:42,080
Thank you.

912
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:45,220
Honey!

913
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,840
- Honey.
- Did you wait long?

914
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:49,930
- No, not at all.
- I'm sorry. We got out late.

915
00:59:51,830 --> 00:59:53,370
Ta-da!

916
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:55,920
What is this? They're so pretty!

917
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,530
I got them on the way because they reminded me of you.

918
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:00,280
So pretty! Take a picture of me with them.

919
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:01,590
A picture? How many?

920
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:04,030
- A hundred!
- A hundred? Got it.

921
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:06,320
They're so pretty.

922
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:17,670
Wow, it's so nice to walk like this.

923
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:19,110
The ice cream is so good, too.

924
01:00:19,110 --> 01:00:22,180
I guess sweet and salty is the way to go.

925
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:25,270
Prosecutor, you kind of eat like a child.

926
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:32,200
I actually wanted to see you to tell you something.

927
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:38,840
I realized I've never said thank you.

928
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:42,570
Isn't that weird? I have so much to thank you for.

929
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:46,340
At first, as a prosecutor.

930
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:49,610
Then, as someone who might be Hyeon Woo.

931
01:00:50,650 --> 01:00:52,610
And as Mr. Justice.

932
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:58,420
You have no idea how much comfort you've been to me.

933
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:03,480
Prosecutor.

934
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:11,360
I like someone.

935
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:16,270
So, I don't think I can see you like this anymore.

936
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:21,510
You're a good person.

937
01:01:21,510 --> 01:01:25,260
You'll meet someone much better than me.

938
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:37,150
Well...

939
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:39,400
Eun Ha.

940
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:44,080
You don't have to take it so seriously.

941
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:48,580
I'm good at moving on.

942
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:50,060
Instead,

943
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:53,830
even if you regret letting me get away,

944
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:56,270
I might not come back.

945
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:03,310
So...

946
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:07,720
call me whenever you need help.

947
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,620
To know a prosecutor in life...

948
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:13,360
might come in handy later.

949
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:18,720
I'm sorry I was weighing on you...

950
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,270
for the past few days.

951
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:32,630
Should we go?

952
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:13,360
I'll call it a night, Prosecutor.

953
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:17,420
Right.

954
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,080
I decided to keep living here.

955
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,460
Eun Ha.

956
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,550
It's not going to be awkward between us.

957
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:33,110
All right?

958
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:36,360
Yes, Prosecutor.

959
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:39,840
With that in mind...

960
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,200
Oh, my, Seo Ji Hwan!

961
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:49,400
Seo Ji Hwan.

962
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,480
What? What are you doing?

963
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,310
Let's go, baby!

964
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:55,720
What's with you?

965
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:59,030
Hold on. Wait. Prosecutor, wait.

966
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:01,930
Let's go, baby! Oppa will make you ramen!

967
01:04:01,930 --> 01:04:04,910
Baby? What's wrong with you? Prosecutor!

968
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:08,200
I'm sorry! I'll call you later!

969
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:10,220
Get home safe!

970
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:12,510
- "Let's go, baby"?
- My hand hurts!

971
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,340
Is he insane?

972
01:04:18,090 --> 01:04:20,660
What's going on? Am I "baby"?

973
01:04:20,660 --> 01:04:24,170
Does that mean you're honey? Honey!

974
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:33,500
Oh, you called me baby, so I thought I could...

975
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:36,610

Wow! What?

990
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:28,330
Little Rat! Why are you wearing that?

991
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:31,060
We're going to be late. Let's go.

992
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:35,170
Have you ever seen him smile like that?

993
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:36,090
Hello!

994
01:06:36,090 --> 01:06:38,340
Congratulations on opening the "Eun Ha and Friends" channel.

995
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:40,430
- Justice?
- Emperor Penguin?

996
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:43,590
A war broke out in your channel!

997
01:06:43,590 --> 01:06:46,480
I haven't given up on Eun Ha yet.

998
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,920
Who are you?
