All kinds of ex-cons gathered together.

178
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,270
It looks legit from the outside, but you could say

179
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,120
Seo Ji Hwan has all these dangerous individuals by his side.

180
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,960
Especially, this Jeong Yoon Taek is one of them.

181
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,420
You mean that Seo Ji Hwan wouldn't just have had

182
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,150
Jeong Yoon Taek around for no reason, right? I see your point.

183
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,960
You think Seo Ji Hwan will make a move?

184
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,430
I don't think so.

185
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,080
He will.

186
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,720
Without a doubt.

187
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,710
[Law and order is a promise we all make]

188
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,920
Have you eaten, Chairman?

189
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,510
On days like this...

190
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,120
I crave a cold bowl of blowfish soup.

191
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,680
We just finished expanding the restaurant menu.

192
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,400
It's going to bring our restaurant a lot of luck.

193
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,900
You'll have to wait and see whether it's luck or poison.

194
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,820
This menu won't fail. You can trust me.

195
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,410
In my days...

196
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,590
we didn't touch blowfish* unless it was a big one.
(Sounds like luck, fortune)

197
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:17,590
When we couldn't catch big ones, we had to use the little ones.

198
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,830
Those guys might be small, but they're quite poisonous.

199
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:33,000
There's a reason why fishermen speak of little blowfish as if they're the devil.

200
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,230
Fish or man, one must know its own size.

201
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,090
Our Chairman still seems to think of me as a figurehead.

202
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:52,070
I've run the restaurant for years.

203
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,910
Call Ta Whan.

204
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:01,530
Tell her to stop dipping her toes and come back.

205
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,450
Yes, sir.

206
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,530
Where are they? It's past 8 o'clock.

207
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,930
A boycott, huh?

208
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,970
If you're not here within five minutes, I'll tell the CEO.

209
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,560
Tell who? Traitor.

210
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,710
No sense of loyalty whatsoever. What's all this?

211
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,390
Today's the first class! Are you all coming from work?

212
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,960
We had a new product launch event.

213
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,390
- I have no strength to respond.
- Thank you.

214
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,190
What is all this?

215
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:48,400
Congratulations.

216
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,550
How did the event go?

217
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:55,490
If I may say so myself, it was very successful.

218
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,870
Something unplanned even became the highlight of the event.

219
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,870
- The highlight?
- Ms. Kang Ye Na was like this...

220
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,650
and was about to collapse when Hyungnim

221
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:10,970
took her in his arms and said, "Let me hold you."

222
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,210
Wasn't he sexier than Hyun Bin?

223
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,200
- He held her?
- Just like this.

224
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,850
Is Hyungnim going to get married?

225
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:23,840
Judging from today, it's possible.

226
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,470
- Kang Ye Na offered to model first.
- For real?

227
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:30,240
If this goddess is our sister-in-law, Hyungnim would look good.

228
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,810
Both ambitious.

229
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:34,210
If her guys and our guys combine forces-

230
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,130
Stop talking.

231
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:41,600
Okay, today is the first class, so we'll do a simple test.

232
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,180
It's not an evaluation. It's just to see where you are at, so don't stress.

233
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,670
Who are you to test us? I'm uncomfortable with this.

234
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:53,130
The questions contain the answers, so listen up.

235
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:54,880
- Okay.
- Here we go.

236
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,930
Something soft on the outside and strong on the inside

237
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,250
is called "A steel hand in a velvet glove."

238
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,800
Then, what about the opposite?

239
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,790
What do you call something strong on the outside and soft on the inside?

240
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:10,510
Stop insulting us. You think we don't know?

241
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,720
If you don't know this, you're not human.

242
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,880
Definitely not human if you don't know.

243
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,550
This is it, right?

244
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:17,210
[Crispy tenders]

245
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,070
This is it.
[Peking duck]

246
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,980
You think this is about chicken? Crispy tenders?

247
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,520
Where did pecking duck come from? You spelled it wrong, too!

248
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,580
All right, all right. Then...

249
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,700
we'll do a math question next. It's a simple factorial.

250
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,300
What's a factorial?

251
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,890
Like a meat factory?

252
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,870
You don't know what a factorial is?

253
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,430
- How about an equation?
- The guy who broke my arm was named Jeong Sik.

254
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,010
To this day, I can't bend my arm outward.

255
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,740
You must know division.

256
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,730
Don't mock us. We all did that in elementary school.

257
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:50,890
You never graduated from elementary.

258
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:52,680
Do you have nine lives?

259
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,450
No, no, no.

260
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,010
- What are you guys doing?
- Stop right there.

261
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:58,500
Stop. Stop. Go sit.

262
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:03,760
Then, let me start with an easy question.

263
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,080
Ji Yeon has four cherry tomatoes.

264
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,400
She wants to share 1/2 of those with her friends.

265
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,550
How many tomatoes is Ji Yeon left with?

266
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,900
What a great gal.

267
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,290
Sharing the few she has. Shows loyalty.

268
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:23,640
Dumbass, who wants half-sliced tomatoes?

269
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,010
She should just give up all of them!

270
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:30,440
Man Ho, let's see.

271
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,390
"Jeju-do's old name used to be Hanyeo Village."

272
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,460
A lot of Hanyeos live there.

273
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,110
Thank you for your hard work, Man Ho.

274
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,540
Hyungnim?

275
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,250
What? That's my writing. Even with a heart.

276
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,930
"Something strong on the outside but soft on the inside."

277
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:49,300
Your answer is Hyungnim?

278
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,280
You said "crispy tenders" was wrong.

279
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,290
- What the heck is "crispy tenders"?
- Isn't it right?

280
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:56,480
I can't talk to him.

281
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,390
It's the same difference. It describes Hyungnim!

282
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,430
Hey, little rat. You tell us.

283
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,740
Describe Hyungnim in two words.

284
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,970
"Shoulder thug."*
(Slang for someone with broad shoulders)

285
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,600
I get where you're at, so we'll end here today.

286
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,390
Here's your homework.

287
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,030
What homework? We're busy!

288
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,580
It's not hard.

289
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,750
Write a simple self-introduction.

290
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,390
For example, how I introduced myself the other day, write out your introduction.

291
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,970
Wow, this is so annoying.

292
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:37,580
Great job on your first class!

293
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,150
"Shoulder thug"?

294
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,190
[Shoulder = thug]

295
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,790
[Shoulder thug = thug + thug = thug x2]

296
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,400
I'm a thug twice over.

297
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,170
[Thug, thug, thug, thug]

298
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,430
[Thug, thug, thug, thug]

299
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,050
I heard you had a busy day.

300
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:18,950
The launch. Chauffering. You must be tired.

301
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,290
Well, it's not tiring...

302
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,220
for a thug...

303
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:29,730
The class went well. In case you were wondering.

304
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,650
What is there to wonder about? I'm just a thug.

305
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,600
Sorry for bothering you when you weren't wondering.

306
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,890
I'm not bothered. I'm a thug.

307
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,220
Why do you keep saying "thug"?

308
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,150
They're not fighting, are they?

309
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,990
What are you guys doing?

310
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:56,000
I think the teacher and Hyungnim have beef.

311
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:00,830
Am I wrong? I'm just calling a thug a thug.

312
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,800
Exactly. Why are you suddenly going on and on-

313
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,510
It's not because I called you a "shoulder thug," right?

314
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:17,750
Is it because of that?

315
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,070
Hey.

316
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,210
They were just fighting! Why is she laughing and flipping out like that?

317
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:34,680
What did you eat, man?

318
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:40,790
For real?

319
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:43,340
I wondered who, but the guys are just like you.

320
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:46,790
How are you so similar? You really are a family.

321
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,340
Excuse me.

322
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,930
You were just standing here laughing at me.

323
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:56,300
Are you going to tell me why?

324
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,090
Look it up yourself what it means.

325
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,570
What is she talking about?

326
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,880
[Shoulder thug]

327
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,800

T-That's what that means?

329
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:40,760
Geez!

330
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:45,120
Is it too late to eat?

331
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,840
This is what I usually eat. Hope you like it.

332
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,630
This is what you usually eat?

333
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:58,860
I don't have time to go out to eat when I'm working.

334
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,950
But I don't skimp on meals. Go ahead.

335
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,620
Thank you.

336
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:10,090
So, what do you do at Thirsty Deer?

337
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:13,150
Legal counsel, business strategy.

338
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,230
You could say I'm an executive.

339
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,940
Are you a lawyer?

340
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,000
I have a license.

341
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:26,000
What kind of sport did you play, Mi Ho?

342
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:33,300
- Soccer?
- I get so restless when I'm working.

343
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,640
Then how did you become a hairdresser?

344
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,440
I took a test and got a license.

345
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,370
How simple.

346
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,090
A public official takes the public official exam.

347
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,660
A lawyer takes a bar exam.

348
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,490
An athlete goes to tryouts to get in.

349
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,770
It sounds simple, but...

350
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,030
only the person knows what happened

351
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:58,400
between the test and becoming who they are.

352
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,160
No matter how smart or educated someone is,

353
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,830
it's not easy to become a lawyer.

354
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,480
You're right. It wasn't easy.

355
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,180
I owe a lot to the CEO.

356
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,830
I wanted to become someone useful to him.

357
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,830
It's a debt I could never pay back,

358
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,640
but I wanted to try, at least.

359
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:33,500
You can't live while owing someone, huh?

360
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,920
If you pay back a favor right away,

361
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,500
it could be a disappointing thing.

362
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,950
Because once you pay back, it's over.

363
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:47,820
I don't think your CEO helped you expecting you to repay him.

364
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,580
Maybe he did because he wanted to

365
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,710
have you in his life.

366
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,410
Thank you for dinner.

367
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,080
It was just what I had in the fridge.

368
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,670
Let me buy you coffee, at least.

369
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:07,950
Sure.

370
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,050
It's late, though, so we might have to walk a bit.

371
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,940
Over there.

372
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:16,460
If you go down this way, there's a field inside the park.

373
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,810
When I feel like kicking around a ball, I go there.

374
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,600
Sometimes I run around with kids.

375
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,110
It's so fun.

376

- It's dangerous. No.

00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,780
I want it!

381
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,560
They're loud, they cry,

382
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,110
they're stubborn...

383
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,310
But I'm not raising them, so they're fine.

384
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:42,770
You're so honest, Mi Ho.

385
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,960
I'm so sorry. Let me get you a towel.

You haven't worked out since your shoulder injury.

392
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,350
Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?

393
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,680
It's just for my health.

394
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,990
Since when have you cared about your health, Hyungnim?

395
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,660

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,230
Why would Hyungnim get so butt hurt over being called a "thug"?

403
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,210
He doesn't even let the milk delivery lady in

and he moves in a girl? I knew it was weird.

405
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,020
So, does that mean

406
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,470
we should call her "sister-in-law"?

should she be promoting sausages?

448

She can't model with a meat allergy, no.

527
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,160
It's so good.

528
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,440
It's the best ramen I've ever had.

529
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,250
Really?

530
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,140
[Chief Oh]

531
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,640
[Chief Oh]

532
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,210
Aigoo, have some sweet potatoes.

533
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,250
They're good.

534
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,310
- You didn't have to.
- Thank you.

535
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,710
Thank you.

536
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:42,020
She gave us some nice sweet potatoes.

537
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,990
We should eat them while they're hot. Here.

538
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,080
Take the big one, Eun Ha.

539
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,960
Hot...

540
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,120
Take the big one.

541
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,080
Thanks.

542
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,020
It's hot. Make sure you blow on it.

543
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,760
- It's tasty.
- It's tasty.

544
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,210
Prosecutor, the time capsule...

545
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,710
Excuse me...

546
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:20,150
Somebody keeps calling me.

547
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:23,040
- It's okay. Go ahead.
- I'm sorry.

548
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,780
Yes, Chief. I'm...

549
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,050
Yeon went missing?

550
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,810
Chief Oh!

551
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:43,590
You made it.

552
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,520
What happened?

553
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:53,020
Is she the unni from last time...

554
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,960
I'll explain later. What's going on?

555
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,330
I've been sending someone here to check it out.

556
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,910
Yeon and her grandma haven't been seen in a few days.

557
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,190
All their stuff is still here, and they're gone.

558
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,240
Eun Ha!

559
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,960
It's locked.

560
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,540
- Eun Ha.
- Where did Yeon go?

561
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:46,690
Yes, Officer Song. Her name is Jeong Yeon. Her grandmother is Kim Soon Hee.

562
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:50,040
Please find out where they are. Thank you.

563
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:01,870
Eun Ha, don't worry too much.

564
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,980
It's me.

565
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:07,150
Yeon's not home. Do you know where she is?

566
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:09,710
Eun Ha, how did you...

567
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,680
You already knew?

568
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:22,930
Are you with someone right now?

569
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:25,590
I'm with the prosecutor.

570
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:30,590
I can't tell you over the phone. Come to the house.

571
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,390
I'll get out here, Prosecutor.

572
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,640
Eun Ha.

573
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:41,830
Who were you just talking to?

574
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:45,180
I'll tell you later.

575
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,070
Was it Seo Ji Hwan?

576
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:53,960
I'm sorry. I'll find out where Yeon is and call you.

577
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,180
Hold on.

578
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,600
Let me take you home.

579
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,700
It's okay. I can get a cab.

580
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:37,440
Hello, Ji Hwan speaking.

581
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,800
Where is Yeon?

582
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,070
Are you really here to figure out where Yeon is?

583
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:55,790
Tell me where she is.

584
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:58,780
She's safe, but I can't tell you where she is.

585
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,350
- Is she really safe?
- She is.

586
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,350
- I guess you can't talk about Jeong Yoon Taek, either.
- No.

587
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,010
- I cannot.
- How about Go Eun Ha?

588
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:19,300
I heard she owes you one, but you're making her pay back slowly.

589
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,890
She paid back the favor a long time ago.

590
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:23,760
So, why are you still acting like she owes you?

591
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,830
You seem like you'd move on once a business is done.

592
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:29,340
It's none of your concern, Prosecutor.

593
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,740
I am concerned about it.

594
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,970
Are you concerned about Go Eun Ha or me?

595
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,200
You're the one I'm concerned about.

596
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,640
My concern for Go Eun Ha is none of your business.

597
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,140
Then, the reason for your concern for me...

598
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,260
Is it because my name is on the DNA database of ex-prisoners

599
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,740
that the Prosecutors' Office maintains?

600
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,170
No.

601
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:03,450
It's because I saw you at the hotel 10 years ago.

602
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,070
I...

603
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:08,890
was a witness to that incident.

604
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:28,050
CEO.

605
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:33,520
So, where is Yeon? What happened to Yeon?

606
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:39,530
Do you think I did something to Yeon, too?

607
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:40,990
What?

608
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:44,080
Nothing.

609
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:46,150
Yeon is safe.

610
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:49,820
Thank goodness. I was so worried.

611
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,920
Since when is the prosecutor your friend?

612
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,980
Well, that's...

613
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:09,210
So, you couldn't tell him where you live

614
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:13,340
because he's a prosecutor or...

615
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:16,480
because he's your friend and you felt awkward?

616
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,520
I mean, that's not it...

617
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:41,230
♫ It comforts my long day ♫

618
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:44,450
♫ It shines on my anxious mind ♫

619
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:47,230
Are you concerned about Go Eun Ha or me?

620
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:49,060
Aren't you...

621
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:51,270
afraid of Seo Ji Hwan?

622
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:53,740
I know I should be.

623
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:56,460
I thought I would be.

624
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:59,390
But I'm not.

625
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:05,550
♫ All these warm lights ♫

626
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:12,750
♫ I hope they embrace me again ♫

627
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:16,330
You're the one I'm concerned about.

628
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:18,840
My concern for Go Eun Ha is none of your business.

629
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,590
Since when is the prosecutor your friend?

630
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:29,950
♫ Push away the time that felt like lies ♫

631
00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:37,190
♫ Shine on me at the end of this road ♫

632
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:41,550
♫ Push away the darkness ♫

633
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:49,290
♫ I hope the bright light comes to me ♫

634
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:08,220
What's going on? What is this?

635
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,320
Is there a fire?

636
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,660
How many came in? That many?

637
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:16,970
Got it. Get the tools and wait.

638
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:18,750
What? Did something happen again?

639
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:20,700
- Where's Hyungnim?
- He went out.

640
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,410
Out of all days...

641
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:25,680
We'll have to stop this ourselves. Buckle up and get in the car.

642
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:27,240
Dong Hee, get the tools.

643
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:29,640
T-The tools? Why?

644
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:35,030
Good thing we sharpened them yesterday.

645
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,390
Two should be enough, right?

646
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:38,190
Get changed and gather.

647
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:42,140
Where are you going? Where?

648
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,910
What? Someone tell me!

649
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,280
Let's see the end of this today.

650
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,260
- Hey, Hong Gi.
- Yeah.

651
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,860
- This time- What?
- What?

652
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,180
- What are you doing here?
- You said everyone get in the car!

653
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:08,640
Anyway, where are we going? To fight, right?

654
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,590
Can we just go back?

655
00:47:10,590 --> 00:47:13,430
- Hey, drop her off.
- We have class this morning.

656
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:14,760
I'll mark everyone absent!

657
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,400
- What is she saying?
- Put that knife down.

658
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,740
- I'm going to lose my mind.
- What should we do?

659
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,980
- What else? Drop her off!
- Where?

660
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,130
- Out of the car!
- Pull over, then!

661
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:26,960
- Pull over, man!
- There's nowhere to pull over.

662
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,620
You guys are supposed to be good! I'm telling the CEO.

663
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:33,020
You don't know anything!

664
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:39,510
Wait. Where are we? Dong Hee!

665
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,140
Dong Hee, tell me!

666
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,770
What is going on with everybody? Huh?

667
00:47:43,770 --> 00:47:45,600
Me, too. Me, too...

668
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,750
Knives.

669
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:29,870
Hurry up. If you snooze, we'll have to work overnight.

670
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,240
- Yes, sir.
- Hey, we might have to work overnight.

671
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,800
Hurry up!

672
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,240
- Hello, sir.
- Let's go.

673
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,900
This way.

674
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:46,980
Where are we going?

675
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,070
Wait.

676
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:52,800
They came to get the meat?

677
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,090
- Are you new?
- What?

678
00:48:56,790 --> 00:48:59,610
- New?
- Why stand around? We're busy.

679
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:01,900
Are you praying? Follow me!

680
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:20,760
Here.

681
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,050
Over here. Move the meat.

682
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:26,030
You've put stickers on before, right?

683
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,130
Stickers?

684
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,590
Ever since I was little, yes.

685
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:31,220
Then you'll be great.

686
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:32,810
Stand here.

687
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:34,270
Put labels on them in order.

688
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:36,140
- Labels?
- Yes.

689
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,590
Are you just going to watch?

690
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:42,180
Get started.

691
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,330
You look like you're not even 30.

692
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:48,200
How did you manage to go to school*?
(Slang for prison)

693
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,370
School? I just took the collegiate exam.

694
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:54,690
Collegiate exam? What did you do?

695
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:55,990
Did you steal tests?

696
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:59,500
Aigoo, stop asking her.

697
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,630
Everyone has their own story.

698
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:05,250
Not that school. That kind of school.

699
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:07,490
Make sure you stay on the right path now.

700
00:50:07,490 --> 00:50:10,990
The CEO won't ask about your past, but he doesn't forgive twice.

701
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:12,920
You mean Mr. Seo Ji Hwan?

702
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:16,210
- How dare you say his name carelessly?
- What?

703
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:17,610
He's not your friend!

704
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:21,390
That's his name, Seo Ji Hwan. It's not like he's Hong Gil Dong*.

The guys are here helping?

706
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,040
There was a last-minute census.

707
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,870
Farms with more sows than they reported are in emergency mode.

708
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:30,190
Places that don't meet hygiene standards are losing their licenses.

709
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:31,670
That's not our problem.

710

Geez.

Move, move.

What are you doing?

717
00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:11,680
Look.

718
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:13,640

719
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:15,500
Take the fat out.

720
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,200

721
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,720

722
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,260
Geez...

723
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:25,050
Hurry up and take care of the meat before it defrosts.

724
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:26,780
Got it?

725
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,760
Where is that little rat?

726
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:39,100
Mr. Seo Ji Hwan- I mean,

727
00:51:39,810 --> 00:51:42,960
the CEO... what is he like?

728
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,860
Do you have a crush on him, too?

729
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:49,970
No way! Why would I have a crush on him? I have a crush on me!

730
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:53,970
Why not? I'd love to be with a guy like the CEO.

731
00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:57,840
He's manly and handsome and doesn't say much, but...

732
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,570
he's a softie inside, like custard.

733
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:01,940
"Strong on the outside, soft on the inside."

734
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:05,140
Not just soft. He's sexy, too.

735
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:10,410
- Sexy?
- Go on, put all your carts before the horse.

736
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:12,980
He has no interest in women.

737
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:16,590
He really has no interest?

738
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,690
"Kids, seniors, and beauties are nuisances."

739
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:24,670
That's his motto.

744

I can take him beating me up,

745
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,890
but I couldn't sit and watch him hit a five-year-old.

746
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:53,980
After five years in prison, I thought, "My kid and I can be happy now."

747
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,880
But no one wanted to hire a murderer.

748
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:02,020
I almost lost my kid while I was getting rejected from jobs.

749
00:53:04,030 --> 00:53:06,400
