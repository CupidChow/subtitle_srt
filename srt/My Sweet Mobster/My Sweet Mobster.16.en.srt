00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:08,230
Thanks to you, I got to know good people.

547
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:11,930
So many joyful days piled up.

548
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:15,700
Now, I'm doing what I want to do.

549
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:20,000
Oppa, you led me down a good path.

550
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,990
Thank you.

551
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,100
Eun Ha.

552
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,560
Oppa, you're getting a call.

553
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,500
[Joo Il Yeong]

554
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,760
- It's okay. Take it.
- I'm sorry. One second.

555
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:42,610
W-What? I'm busy.

556
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,050
Should I call you back, then?

557
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:47,490
Yes, call back later. I was about to say something important.

558
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:49,260
By chance...

559
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:52,720
that important thing isn't a proposal, is it?

560
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,000
You're not going to do that empty-handed, right?

561
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,420
Get out of there.

562
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,600
Get out?

563
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,710
- It's okay.
- You'll remember this moment for life.

564
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:08,970
You should do it after you're fully prepared.

565
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,720
Prepared?

566
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,510
Wow, Minnie unni.

567
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:21,410
I mean, Eun Ha unni is dominating kids' events these days.

568
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:25,150
In the play study arena, she's solidified her spot.

569
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,470
Her content is good.

570
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,630
You're still watching?

571
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:36,200
I mean, I'm a subscriber.

572
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,260
Instead, how about you go on the blind date you blew off ten months ago?

573
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,960
My cousin's friend's in-laws' second cousin is now divorced.

574
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,680
She got married right after, and it was over in six months.

575
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,650
That's in the past. I don't think I can go back on it.

576
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:53,700
Then, how about my cousin's friend's niece's daycare teacher's daughter's work colleague?

577
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:59,930
In terms of phrenology, MBTI, astrology, and even your blood type, you're a match.

578
00:42:59,930 --> 00:43:02,370
Then she's basically a stranger.

579
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:06,760
Six degrees of separation means you know everyone. Maybe you know her, too.

580
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,060
Meet her this time. I won't send anyone your way again.

581
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:10,500
I don't know.

582
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,850
Right now, I'm not interested at all.

583
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:16,260
You need to date for us to be happy.

584
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,490
Take your punishment for breaking your promise last time.

585
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,030
Right now.

586
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:23,280
- What promise?
- Write your name with your butt.

587
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,120
What are you talking about?

588
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,800
Since you enforce the law, you should keep your promise.

589
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,750
Officer, should he do it or not?

590
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:31,150
He must.

591
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,820
Please, write your name with your butt.

592
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,260
- Get up.
- Seriously?

593
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,260
Get up!

594
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,340
That's how we abide by justice. Turn around.

595
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,130
Is this related to justice?

596
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:43,320
Of course, it's about keeping your word. Start with "Jang."

597
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,030
- Write it!
- Like this?

598
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:47,480
Hyeon.

599
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,310
- She's asleep.
- She's asleep?

600
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:00,890
Good job.

601
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,400
It's been so long since we did something special like this.

602
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,960
Your parents are coming tomorrow, right?

603
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,270
Of course.

604
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:18,470
They're probably soaking in the hot springs right now.

605
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,370
Then...

606
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,440
since it's been too long...

607
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,890
Gosh, too long?

608
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:30,840
It was yesterday.

609
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:41,820
What's that?

610
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:47,010
What? Dad?

611
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:49,140
Mom?

612
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,910
If you say that there, what do I become?

613
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:57,040
Was it so bad that we didn't even dip our feet in the hot springs? After we paid?

614
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,970
If you're that upset about money,

615
00:44:58,970 --> 00:45:02,390
you should've soaked it until your skin got wrinkled. Why follow me home?

616
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:06,410
You took the bag with my clothes and left yours!

617
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:09,840
What happened? I thought you were coming back tomorrow. Why are you here?

618
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,060
I'm coming back to my own home. Do you have a problem?

619
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,990
Should we move out now?

620
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:18,230
Are you threatening me with that?

621
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:21,110
I like living with you, Father.

622
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:25,340
See! Our son-in-law likes it!

623
00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:29,820
Right. I forgot something I need to buy.

624
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,550
Come with me.

625
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:33,380
It's late. Let's get it tomorrow.

626
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:37,050
Hurry up and follow me.

627
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,270
Wait.

628
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,080
Is that wine?

629
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:45,550
Wow. How did you know I like wine?

630
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:49,590
No, this isn't yours! This is expensive. Very old!

631
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,520
It's expensive?

632
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:52,840
Really?

633
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,600
No. You don't know anything about wine.

634
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,200
Mother, I'll get it for you tomorrow. Have a drink.

635
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,980
Wow! Sit.

636
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,510
This is really expensive! It's 7- I mean, it's so expensive.

637
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,770
Read the room!

638
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:07,660
Aigoo, when did you even notice?

639
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,730
- Wow!
- Sorry.

640
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:13,450
To our family!

641
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:41,740
[Proposal, remember for a lifetime, be prepared, how?]

642
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,620
Do you want help?

643
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:59,810
I don't need help. I have a plan.

644
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:06,360
Dong Hee passed his GED and needs to prepare for his collegiate exam.

645
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:07,630
What should we do about his job?

646
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:10,250
I already told him that this week is his last.

647
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,550
You and Eun Ha have helped him so far,

648
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:16,010
but he needs to go to the academy and focus.

649
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:17,350
Let me talk to Dong Hee.

650
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:22,140
I think we could restructure the company's education support system while we're at it.

651
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:26,030
On top of tuition, we should provide living expenses.

652
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:29,750
See if there's a way to benefit those who want more education.

653
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,360
Work on it.

654
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,790
Got it. We'll work on it.

655
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,960
Hey, Man Ho.

656
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,820
It was 4 p.m., right?

657
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:45,850
I think so, but we've been here since noon.

658
00:47:45,850 --> 00:47:47,900
We finished our teas.

659
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,800
Hey, Man Ho. I can't see out of my right eye.

660
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,050
I can't see out of my left eye.

661
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,980
The hairdresser said this looked good.

662
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,200
But do we have to do this to get married?

663
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,870
Right, Il Yeong said Hyungnim is proposing, so we should get mentally ready.

664
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:02,220
It's not him, right?

665
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,600
- Can't be.
- No.

666
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:04,540
Don't look at them.

667
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:05,640
What is this?

668
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,200
I don't have one. I'll use this.

669
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,890
How's this?

670
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:11,640
Looks good.

671
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,970
They're here. Hello, sir.

672
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:15,830
Hello. Ma'am.

673
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:17,400
Sisters, sit here.

674
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,220
Right here!

675
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,380
- Right here. Have a seat.
- So pretty.

676
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:24,150
Have a seat.

677
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:27,220
You're early.

678
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,220
Thanks for coming all the way here.

679
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,500
Let me introduce myself. I'm a man full of affection.

680
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,580
Jung* Man... Ho-ho-ho-ho.
(It means "affection")

681
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:39,550
I'm quack, quack, Kwak Jae Soo.

682
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:42,800
Your names?

683
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,800
I'm Choi Cham Sarang.

684
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:48,570
Choi Cham Sarang.

685
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:50,700
- How about you?
- Kim Shen.

686
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,770
- Pardon?
- Kim Shen.

687
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:54,850
You're Chinese. Kim Shen.

688
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,590
Oh, yes.

689
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:58,570
We love Chinese people.

690
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:04,050
Now that we've met, let's be frightened... no, no...

691
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:06,250
let's get frisky.

692
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,250
I mean, let's be friendly.

693
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:14,080
I prepared some jokes that ladies like.

694
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:18,090
Chinese people are working on knives.

695
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:20,720
Guess what another Chinese person said to them?

696
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,750
Oh, yes, I do.

697
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,580
Hey, she's Chinese! Of course, she knows!

698
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,480
But we don't know. Tell us.

699
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,020
The person next to them goes...

700
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,580
Slice-zhuan!

701
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:37,710
What do French people say to make laundry dry faster?

702
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:39,890
- What?
- Dry Jour!

703
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:42,180
That'll make it dry!

704
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,900
- You know the actor Nam Do Gu, right?
- Yes.

705
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:49,020
She can't get on an elevator. You know why?

706
00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:51,380
Do-ors are Gu-rosing.

707
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:59,170
We're out of time. We need to go.

708
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:00,420
You haven't eaten yet.

709
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:01,810
It's okay. Something came up at work.

710
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:04,120
- Bye.
- Wait, wait.

711
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,410
We'll take you.

712
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:07,300
Have some coffee.

713
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,490
Excuse me! Cham Sarang!

714
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:11,990
You left this behind.

715
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:14,490
Keep it. Such schmucks.

716
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:15,580
Schmuck?

717
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,340
Man Ho!

718
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:20,500
They said you're a schmuck. Hong Gi said that's a good thing!

719
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:24,260
Wow! Congratulations. You became a schmuck on your first meeting. Congrats.

720
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,650
She called me a schmuck as soon as she met me.

721
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:27,610
