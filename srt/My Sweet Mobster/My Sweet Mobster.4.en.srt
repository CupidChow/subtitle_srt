Gosh.

00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,170

How about the person over here?

11
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,510
Is she happy?

12
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:18,650
Well...

13
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,120
I'm a little bit happy now.

The videos.

17
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:41,609
Don't stop making them.

Are you talking about "Play With Mini?"

20
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,980
Didn't I tell you I'm taking time to repent?

21
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,319
Keep making them even when you're taking time to repent.

22
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,959
How can I do that when I'm repenting?

23
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,699
What should I do?

24
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,900

miss you.

Wait, what's the time?

29
00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:04,560
I should head home.

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,039
Ms. Mini,

32
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:21,210
you're heavier than you seem.

34
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,310
I blame you...

35
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:30,750
for having needlessly long legs.

36
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,750

(Joo Il Young)

41
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,568
He only had one glass to drink,

42
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:51,439
so I don't know how he got so wasted.

43
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,800
Tell me about it.

44
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:54,710
He drank himself to the point of sweetness.

45
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,409
Sorry? The point of sweetness?

46
00:03:56,939 --> 00:03:58,539
He becomes a sweetheart when fully intoxicated.

47
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,650
One drink would do that and then some.

48
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,849
I see.

49
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,049
You should come with us. I'll drop you off.

79
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:21,379
Hold on. Was the soda drugged?

80
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,989
Only that explains why I was drunk.

81

On March 20 at Club Cat,

138
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,909
you reported Seo Ji Hwan on charges of assault.

139
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:13,439
Well... My friend was the one who called the police,

140
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,509
and I handcuffed him...

141
00:11:16,049 --> 00:11:18,979
Were you perhaps one of us?

142
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,319
- Sorry? - Do you remember...

143
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,820
the faces of those who were involved in the scuffle?

144
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,859
I remember the employee who was on the floor.

145
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,190
- It's the police. - There was also Mr. Seo.

146
00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:33,000
And...

147
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,299
- Go on. - The police?

148
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:40,909
There was also a man with a scar on his face.

149
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:45,879
Is this the man?

150
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:48,148
Yes, that's him.

151
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:52,148
Do you know what this man and Seo Ji Hwan...

152
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:53,980
talked about?

153
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,690
I arrived at the scene...

154
00:11:56,789 --> 00:11:59,018
after the scuffle had taken place,

155
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,490
so I can't say I witnessed anything.

156
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,859
Mr. Seo was holding a broken bottle...

157
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,600
which led to a misunderstanding on my part.

158
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:10,669
I'm sorry for asking, but is Mr. Seo an acquaintance of yours?

159
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:12,439
- Sorry? - You've been...

160
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,669
saying his name with ease.

161
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:15,470
Oh, that.

162
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:19,879
We ended up crossing paths a few times after that incident.

163
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,648
I heard a video of yours...

164
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:24,918
created bad blood between you and Thirsty Deer.

165
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:27,489
Did they make threats or retaliate?

166
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,888
You must be on top of everything being a prosecutor and all.

167
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:31,059
Do you know about that too?

168
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,889
But not at all.

169
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:36,590
The video incident was all a huge misunderstanding too.

170
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:37,960
That might not be the case.

171
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:42,168
It being a misunderstanding that day...

172
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:43,970
doesn't mean that's the case for other days.

173
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:46,099
The employees are all ex-cons.

174
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,440
That means on one of those days,

175
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,940
they were guilty.

176
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,949
Okay, Man Ho. What's our company motto?

177
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:01,349
- Flesh from Bones. - Yes, Flesh from Bones.

00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,648
In short, FB.

(Company Motto: Flesh from Bones)

180
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:06,518
It's all good, but the wording is harsh.

181
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,628
The company image is too harsh.

182
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:11,999
So I propose a brand ambassador who children take a liking to...

183
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,129
and funwash our image...

184
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:17,298
I mean, differentiate ourselves from other companies.

185
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:18,470
For instance,

186
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:21,710
a brand ambassador on Kang Ye Na's level...

187
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:23,768
will help people view our products...

188
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,309
as those that are promoted by her and not...

189
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:29,179
And not...

190
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:36,919
by us.

191
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:41,360
But that will never happen.

192
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:45,699
Anyway, starting a video content channel for kids...

193
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,258
that introduces a cooking series...

194
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,600
with our products is also in the planning stage.

195
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,340
But to be honest, even that...

196
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,989
Did you get home all right last night?

197
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,990
What?

198
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,889
Gosh, yes.

199
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:15,158
Shamelessly enough, I made it home all right.

200
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,489
I... I'm so sorry.

201
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,499
I should've taken you home myself,

202
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,459
and I apologize for that.

203
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,600
When can I...

204
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,240
give back your coat?

205
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,539
My coat? Oh, right.

206
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,638
If you tell me where you live, I'll come by for it myself.

207
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,239
No, wait. My asking for your home address...

208
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,849
would be burdensome and somewhat scary.

209
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:35,878
What should I do, then?

210
00:14:35,879 --> 00:14:37,579
Maybe we can meet at a halfway point.

211
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,879
Then...

212
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,878
A halfway point seems good.

213
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,518
But to bring it over, you might...

214
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,989
be scared... No, not scared.

215
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,158
Gosh, sorry about that.

216
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:48,289
You won't be scared, but the coat will be heavy.

217
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:50,059
No!

218
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,829
And that wraps up my presentation...

219
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,329
for how to promote Frank Sausages for Kids.

220
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,470
(Frank Sausages for Kids)

221
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,070
I should first ask how she is.

222
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,969
Yes, that seems right.

223
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:03,970
Boss.

224
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:06,740
Boss?

225
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,379
- What? - The presentation is over.

226
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,179
I see.

227
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,418
Hong Ki, you did great.

228
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:18,388
Good job. You may go now.

229
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:20,090
(Company Motto: Flesh from Bones)

230
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
What?

231
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,460
(Yes, you sh...)

232
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:26,860
You f...

233
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,370
Hold on. What...

234
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:33,340
What the...

235
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:35,610
Why did I...

236
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,079
No!

237
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,109
(Frank Sausages for Kids)

238
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,879
That seems to be enough for today.

239
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,610
Come to think of it, I didn't give you my card.

240
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:48,849
Please give me a call if there's anything else...

241
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,990
that comes to mind.

242
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:51,789
Sure.

243
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:53,720
Thank you for your time.

244
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,960
Gosh, watch your step.

245
00:15:58,529 --> 00:16:00,259
One step at a time.

246
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,970

(Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo)

248

Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo.

249
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:18,480
Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo.

250
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,110
What's your dream?

251
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:51,980
I'm going to grow up and become...

252
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:53,779
a prosecutor.

253
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,519
Really? That's so cool.

254
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,519
("Play With Mini")

255
00:17:01,289 --> 00:17:03,259
- Are you all right? - Prosecutor?

256
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,230
Wait, this umbrella.

257
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,930
("Play With Mini")

258
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,839
Do you remember me?

259
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:15,709
Take it. You'll catch a cold if you get soaked in the rain.

260
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:16,740
I have another one.

261
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:22,049
Wait, are you the one who got rejected that day?

262
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,518
Sorry?

263
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:26,219
Were you the guy from that day?

264
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,989
No way. This is fascinating.

265
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,749
Did you get home all right that day?

266
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,750
Take it. You'll...

267
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:34,829
- Didn't you bring your car? - Well, no.

268
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:36,130
I'll get going, then.

269
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,400
I'm the one rejecting you.

270
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,170
That's right. Anyway, I owe you one.

271
00:17:50,609 --> 00:17:51,879
That's a relief.

272
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,449
It'd be too sad to get caught in the rain after being dumped.

273
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:57,249
- I wasn't dumped but... - That happens.

274
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,619
We can't all be favored and loved by everyone.

275
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:02,788
You must have the wrong idea because I don't get rejected...

276
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:05,289
Did you bring the umbrella knowing that it was me?

277
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,858
How did you know though?

278
00:18:06,859 --> 00:18:08,730
Are you a subscriber?

279
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:13,429
I can't say I'm an avid fan, but...

280
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,869
Did you perhaps leave any comments?

281
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,569
I've memorized most of the usernames, you see.

282
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:21,140
Don't tell me you're Justice.

283
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,268
Justice. Articles 307 and 311 of the Penal Code...

284
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,979
deals with defamation and slander.

285
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,740
They are subject to criminal punishment.

286
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:30,779
So please think once again before writing your comments.

287
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,778
"Justice?"

288
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:35,989
Gosh, no. A prosecutor wouldn't be that obvious.

289
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,119
It's fascinating though.

290
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,390
"Justice?" Goodness.

291
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,900
I have work to get back to, so...

292
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:46,829
- Prosecutor. - It isn't me.

293
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:51,568
You said I should call...

294
00:18:51,569 --> 00:18:53,568
if anything else came to mind.

295
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:54,609
Right.

296
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,410
Actually, there's something I want to ask you.

297
00:18:58,009 --> 00:18:59,109
Regarding what?

298
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:02,779
Can you excuse me?

299
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,750
Yes, Chief Oh?

300
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,190
Right now?

301
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:13,460
I see. Got it.

302
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,389
I'm sorry, but I'm still on the clock.

303
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,159
Can you tell me over the phone sometime?

304
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,400
I'll call you.

305
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:22,929
- Sure. - Good.

306
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:24,000
Also,

307
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:27,369
this is a gift, so keep it with you.

308
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,210
- A gift? - Yes.

309
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,750
Sure. I'll call you, then.

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,160

Oh, no. Darn it.

327
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,660
- Hello, Boss. - Right.

328
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:23,289
Shoot.

329
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Okay.

00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,369
Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo.

331
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,108
- Hello? - Yes, hello.

332
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:42,349
I'm afraid I made a huge mistake.

333
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:45,618
- Sorry? - It's nothing serious,

334
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:48,249
but the text just now was a typo,

335
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,449
so please delete it without reading it.

336
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,589
What do you think you're doing?

337
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,419
I'm sorry. I'm also clueless as to what I'm doing.

338
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,758
This is my unit.

339
00:20:55,759 --> 00:20:57,058
I live here, you know.

340
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,098
But I'm at the office.

341
00:20:58,099 --> 00:20:59,630
Why are you moving out my things?

342
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,230
Hello?

343
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,930
- Do you live here? - Yes.

344
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:04,899
I was told to move everything out.

345
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,640
- By whom? - Your boss.

346
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,778
Mr. Ma, what's going on?

347
00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:12,809
Hush.

348
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,150
Eun Ha,

349
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,309
- what's the date today? - The 10th.

350
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,979
What day was it a year ago?

351
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,420
- The 10th. - Exactly.

352
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,119
Exactly one year ago,

353
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:25,318
you signed a contract with Macaron Soft.

354
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:28,089
As of today, your contract expired.

355
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,930
But... Does that mean...

356
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:35,929
- I'm fired? - Gosh, no.

357
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,098
I'm not an arsonist who sets people on fire.

358
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:40,598
All you have to do is return your key...

359
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,210
and walk out of the office like you normally do.

360
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,679
Was it your plan to dismiss me all along?

361
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,879
Not from the start.

362
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,048
We can't tell dung and doenjang apart from the start.

363
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:53,118
Of course not. I'm not a psychic.

364
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:55,749
You only figure it out after time has passed.

365
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,089
Whether that person is worth keeping...

366
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,289
or should be flushed out.

367
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:03,429
Are you saying I'm dung?

368
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,199
No, what I mean is that...

369
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,499
you went ahead and dunked yourself in the toilet...

370
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,869
which makes you dung.

371
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,200
That's just my opinion.

372
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:16,369
It was fun while it lasted.

373
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,380
So long.

374
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:25,680
Seriously?

375
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,519
So long.

376
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:29,549
So long?

377
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,190
Mr. Ma, wait!

378
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:36,529
He swore at me for sure.

379
00:22:37,329 --> 00:22:40,259
If you don't like my idea, then just tell me.

380
00:22:40,329 --> 00:22:41,699
Throughout the meeting,

381
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,028
you were frowning scarily and ripping paper.

382
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,739
Am I supposed to keep working on this or not?

383
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,140
(Chief of Marketing Yang Hong Ki)

384
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,240
Hello?

385
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,910
Hello, Chief Yang.

386
00:22:56,849 --> 00:22:57,910
This is Kang Ye Na.

387
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,278
You should also tell me your affiliation.

388
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,990
It's not like Korea only has one Kang Ye Na.

389
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,720
Kang Ye Na?

390
00:23:05,721 --> 00:23:08,758
Mr. Ma, you can't do this while I'm taking a break to repent.

391
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:10,729
Eun Ha, the reason for that is...

392
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:13,229
- How about lunch tomorrow? - Don't you get that?

393
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,028
But you can't let me go like this.

394
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:16,699
- Director Lee, stop her. - This is wrong.

395
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,568
- Director Lee, wait. - Eun Ha!

396
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:20,199
- But... - Stop it, will you?

397
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,709
I'm sure Mr. Ma has his reasons.

398
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,369
Mr. Ma, I didn't get to say goodbye to the kids!

399
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,979
Today, she was notified of her termination of contract...

400
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,450
and was kicked out of her apartment unit.

401
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,380
Does she have a family?

402
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,219
Isn't she from Seoul?

403
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,750
I don't know about the details,

404
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,589
but she doesn't have any family in Seoul.

405
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,838
- What now? - Hey. What is it?

406
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:25,939
Aren't you at the salon?

407
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,008
It's my dad's birthday today, so I closed up early.

408
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,808
Is it his birthday?

409
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:33,139
Wait. If it's Eun Ha, invite her over for dinner.

410
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,348
- We cooked more than enough. - Eun Ha, is that you?

411
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:37,548
Come over for a drink!

412
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:38,618
Exactly.

413
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:40,479
He has already had a few bottles to drink...

414
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,449
and is in the best mood.

415
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,919
Put me on the phone.

416
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,390
- Stop it. - Give it here.

417
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:46,759
Anyway, why did you call?

418
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,028
I can't believe I forgot that it was his birthday.

419
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:51,490
It's nothing.

420
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:53,598
Wish him a happy birthday for me as well.

421
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:55,400
- What? - Give it here.

422
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,798
I can't hear you properly,

423
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,500
so I'll call you back later.

424
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:00,400
Sure.

425
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,109
Gosh.

426
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,009
What are you going to have?

427
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,749
- Hamburger! - Hamburger. And what else?

428
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,890
- And cake. - Cake.

429
00:26:02,869 --> 00:26:03,930
Hyun Woo.

430
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:05,970
Hyun Woo!

431
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,339
Hurry on up.

432
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:13,480
Is it exhausting? Why don't we slow down?

433
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,740
Sure.

434
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,960
It's been a while.

435
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:39,500
I can't believe it's still here.

436
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,409
It's hot, so be careful.

437
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,140
- Thank you. - Sure thing.

438
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,210
I'll give you half.

439
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,818
- This is for you. - Thanks.

440
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:56,250
- It's hot, so cool it down first. - Sure.

441
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,960
- It's tasty. - That's nice.

442
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,029
It's still here.

443
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,210
Hyun Woo.

444
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,549
It's me.

445
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,349
Hyun Woo?

446
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:58,779
Hyun Woo!

447
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,950
What's going on, Eun Ha?

448
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,700
Are you all right?

449
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:16,200
Let's get you inside.

450
00:28:31,349 --> 00:28:32,380
Hyun Woo.

451
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,089
Come on.

452
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,890
It's all right.

453
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,390
Listen to me carefully.

454
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,859
Starting now, we'll play hide and seek.

455
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,900
So don't leave this box until I find you.

456
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,309
- Got it? - Sure.

457
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,150
(Snow Removal Equipment Box)

458
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,919
No, let go of me.

459
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,089
- No... - Let go!

460
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,690
It's been blocked.

461
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,599
Mr. Seo?

462
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:31,539
Ms. Mini.

463
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,278
What are you doing here?

464
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:35,549
I could ask you the same thing.

465
00:29:38,049 --> 00:29:39,849
Hold on. First, take this.

466
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:41,680
You're drenched.

467
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:44,348
- Gosh, thank you. - Let me take that.

468
00:29:44,349 --> 00:29:46,160
Right.

469
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:49,329
I used it to shield myself from the rain.

470
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,858
I'm sure the plastic kept the coat dry.

471
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,960
I tightly secured it on both ends.

472
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:55,670
That doesn't matter right now.

473
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,768
I'm going on a vacation,

474
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:04,740
but I had to change my plans due to the rain.

475
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:08,278
You must live around here.

476
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:10,049
Yes, I live up there.

477
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:13,380
- This house? - Yes.

478
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,518
What? Since when?

479
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:17,150
From about eight years ago.

480
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:18,859
Eight years?

481
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:22,130
I see. So you must have moved to this neighborhood.

482
00:30:22,789 --> 00:30:25,829
I can't believe this is where you live.

483
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:29,569
Anyway,

484
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,430
thanks for this. I'll get going.

485
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,170
Ms. Mini,

486
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:41,739
this coat is quite expensive,

487
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,578
and I need to check if the stain has properly...

488
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:46,220
been removed.

489
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,480
I see.

490
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,420
Let's head inside for a bit.

491
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,529
- I'm sorry about this. - It's all right.

492
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,799
I'm glad to hear that. Sure thing.

493
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,710
I'll take my time, then.

494
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,108
What did he say? Did he find her?

495
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:15,808
Where is she?

496
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:16,950
Is she all right?

497
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:19,119
You don't have to worry.

498
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,919
She's with my boss.

499
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,720
Right, your boss.

500
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,190
That's a relief.

501
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:29,359
Wait. Your boss as in...

502
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,758
that man from before?

503
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:33,230
He may seem scary,

504
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:34,700
but you can trust him.

505
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:38,329
There's nothing more doubtful than one of his people...

506
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,700
saying he's trustworthy.

507
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,939
Are you his right-hand man?

508
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,380
Well, I guess you can say that.

509
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,720
Then are you also...

510
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,660
Am I an ex-convict too?

511
00:32:02,329 --> 00:32:05,359
I'm not, but I might as well be one.

512
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:08,099
I see.

513
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,929
Is it like how people argue that they weren't driving drunk...

514
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,568
when they drove after drinking alcohol?

515
00:32:11,569 --> 00:32:14,440
I drank and did drive intoxicated.

516
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:17,038
But I just didn't get caught. I got lucky.

517
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,979
What? That's not getting lucky. You know?

518
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,449
You should've been caught and faced the consequences,

519
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,509
so you wouldn't repeat the same mistake.

520
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,990
You're right.

521
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,828
I'm sorry for the inconvenience on a rainy day.

522
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:37,859
You should get back inside.

523
00:32:40,599 --> 00:32:41,660
Did you...

524
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:44,670
eat?

525
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:46,768
Did I eat?

526
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:48,808
You must have been looking for her all day.

527
00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:50,970
If you haven't eaten anything, come in and have some food.

528
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,439
My family was celebrating today. So we've got so much food at home.

529
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,679
I see. I don't have much of an appetite.

530
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,880
You don't need an appetite to have a meal.

531
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,619
Don't people eat when it's time?

532
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:06,019
I see. Okay.

533
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:08,589
If you get an appetite, come back then.

534
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,059
All right then.

535
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:12,130
Bye.

536
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,670
("Play With Mini" posted a new announcement.)

537
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:55,508
("Play With Mini" will take a break.)

538
00:33:55,509 --> 00:33:56,910
(We'll come back after we regroup!)

(Ms. Mini, you really have to come back.)

540
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:18,090
Ms. Mini, you really have to come back.

- I'll always root for you. - Please come back soon.

547
00:34:29,769 --> 00:34:32,110
- Hang in there, Ms. Mini. - Ms. Mini, cheer up!

548
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,609
Everyone, it's Ms. Mini.

549
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:40,819
Today, we're going to play with sand today!

550
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,589
Yes! This is so fun!

551
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:44,149
Fill it up with sand.

552
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,518
Press on it.

00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:25,549
We will block out the ratholes...

730
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,519
and use the traps and glue traps to catch the rat...

731
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:30,090
in order to bring back peace to our house.

732
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:31,860
- Amen. - Amen.

733
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:34,428
- Let's eat. - Thank you for the food.

734
00:46:34,429 --> 00:46:36,469
- Would you like some coffee? - Gosh.

735
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,699
Sir, I cannot eat at the same table with my enemy.

736
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,539
I thought you cleared up the misunderstanding that day.

737
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:45,339
Ms. Mini posted the original footage for us,

738
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,209
so it was much easier to get the articles published.

739
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:48,879
I'm sorry. About that...

740
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,510
Gosh. I heard the CEO of your agency was behind it.

741
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,079
Big Boss told us everything.

742
00:46:56,989 --> 00:46:59,760
If you can't appreciate this meal and enjoy the food,

743
00:47:00,119 --> 00:47:02,118
leave the table. Don't disturb other people.

744
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:03,429
I'll enjoy the food, sir.

745
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:13,469
Are you also going on a protest?

746
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:15,239
No.

747
00:47:15,469 --> 00:47:17,969
I just can't believe that there's a woman in our house.

748
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:23,079
Go ahead. Try it.

749
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:24,710
Try it.

750
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:34,590
Let me wash the dishes.

751
00:47:35,659 --> 00:47:37,889
I don't let other people handle my kitchen.

752
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:40,800
This is Man Ho's hobby.

753
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,500
Leave them and come out.

754
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,670
Let me help you.

755
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,840
It's fine. I'm almost done.

756
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:54,940
Should I help you?

757
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:57,650
No. Getting out of my way is helping me.

758
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:58,809
I see.

759
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,058
- Let me help you. - Gosh, you startled me.

760
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:09,089
Gosh, you spat on me.

761
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:10,759
You got to eat Hanwoo for free. That's enough.

762
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,630
Do you want some free liquor too?

763
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,098
You have no conscience.

764
00:48:15,099 --> 00:48:16,699
- Go away. - I'm sorry.

765
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,079
You'll go alone?

766
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:30,510
Yes. Everyone is busy. I should go alone. Why?

767
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,280
What will you say when you get there?

768
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:35,018
I should ask where Taek is.

769
00:48:35,019 --> 00:48:36,049
You'll ask that to a seven-year-old girl...

770
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,090
without any explanation?

771
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:39,489
Well, we don't have a choice then.

772
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:42,190
When was the last time you talked to kids under ten?

773
00:48:43,329 --> 00:48:44,629
- What? - How about smiling...

774
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,690
at a random kid on the street?

775
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:51,699
You made a kid cry before, though. Right?

776
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,980
Isn't that yours, kid?

777
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:02,880
Here. You dropped that.

778
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:04,849
Yes?

779
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:06,679
What?

780
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:10,150
What?

781
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:18,789
Gosh.

782
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,429
I'm certain this trip will be a waste.

783
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,670
Why don't we get some help from someone who's good with kids?

784
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:26,130
Like who?

785
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,639
Do you need my help with anything?

(Prosecution Service)

787
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:47,860
Yes. Go ahead.

788
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,760
Today?

789
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:55,929
I can come with you.

790
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:00,138
You don't even know where I'm going. Why do you keep saying that?

791
00:50:00,139 --> 00:50:02,669
You're going to an employee's house where a seven-year-old kid lives in.

792
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:04,468
You let me crash at your place for free last night.

793
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:06,138
I had a free Hanwoo breakfast.

794
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:07,409
If I don't help out, I'd be a thug.

795
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:11,349
When I went to her house, I didn't see anyone suspicious.

796
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:13,280
It won't be dangerous.

797
00:50:13,849 --> 00:50:15,679
But... Gosh.

798
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,848
Then let me take Dong Hui at least.

799
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,320
I need his help for something.

800
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:22,289
I didn't finish going over the meeting materials.

801
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,360
But...

802
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:44,150
Gosh. This is...

803
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,218
It'll be a long one. Be safe.

804
00:50:53,219 --> 00:50:54,260
Okay.

805
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:08,539
You can take today off.

806
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,440
- Take today off? - Yes.

807
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:25,090
- The weather looks great. - Should I play some music?

808
00:51:27,619 --> 00:51:28,860
- Anything... - The weather... Gosh.

809
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:32,429
Okay. Anything.

810
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,599
Last time...

811
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:36,468
Gosh. Hold on.

("Easy Version of Heart Sutra for Peace of Mind")

813
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,769
Yes. Go ahead.

814
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,969
I wanted to apologize to you about the incident at the club.

815
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:46,440
I got the wrong idea that you assaulted him.

816
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,979
I don't think I properly apologized for that.

817
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,809
Oh, that. I'm sorry about that too.

818
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:55,050
- You're apologizing to me? - Yes. Well...

819
00:51:58,849 --> 00:51:59,860
The candy...

820
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,920
We both had the wrong idea about each other.

821
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:05,760
So there really are drugs that look like candy?

822
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:09,229
Drugs are dangerous.

823
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:11,968
They shouldn't look cute or resemble something people would crave.

824
00:52:11,969 --> 00:52:14,598
Some people might have them, thinking they are real candy.

825
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:16,098
Kids might end up taking them too.

826
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:18,170
Right. You're right. I agree too.

827
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,709
The employee you're looking for...

828
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:27,919
He used to be involved with drugs.

829
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,989
But he vanished into thin air. So I'm looking for him now.

830
00:52:30,949 --> 00:52:33,119
He especially adored his younger sister.

831
00:52:36,929 --> 00:52:40,359
But why are you only hiring ex-convicts...

832
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,559
to run your company?

833
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:45,729
It's easier for ex-convicts...

834
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,940
to go back to committing crimes than other people.

835
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:49,968
They've gone down that road before.

836
00:52:49,969 --> 00:52:51,209
Given their environment and connections,

837
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:53,280
it's easier for them to give into temptations.

838
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:55,539
Despite that, do you still trust them?

839
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:58,379
Because you trust your employee,

840
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:00,219
aren't you going on this long journey to find him?

841
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:02,880
To be honest, I don't.

842
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:06,518
Because I don't trust him, I hired him.

843
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:08,559
Because I don't trust him, I'm going to his house.

844
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:15,460
I'm Chief Yang Hong Ki.

845
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:21,539
Well, why did you want to see me?

846
00:53:21,769 --> 00:53:23,869
- Excuse me. - Sure.

847
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:27,239
Yes, Mr. Park.

848
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:30,650
Sausages for kids?

849
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:33,280
That's not a bad deal for me.

850
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:35,579
It's not just any company. It's Great King Meat.

851
00:53:36,219 --> 00:53:38,388
- Great King Meat? - I'm in a meeting right now.

852
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:40,920
Let me call you back later. Okay.

853
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:46,698
If you don't mind me asking,

854
00:53:46,699 --> 00:53:49,928
were you just on the phone with Mr. Park from Great King Meat?

855
00:53:49,929 --> 00:53:51,730
You must know him too because you're both in the same industry.

856
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,738
They are going to release a sausage product for kids.

857
00:53:54,739 --> 00:53:56,400
They asked me to endorse their product.

858
00:53:56,809 --> 00:53:59,840
Gosh. Those jerks. They always seem to copy our strategy.

859
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,550
Gosh. You're not going to accept the deal, right?

860
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,549
What reason do I have to turn it down?

861
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:06,650
They're the number one meat company.

862
00:54:09,019 --> 00:54:10,019
Number one...

863
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:15,158
Well, there is one reason I could think of, though.

864
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:16,159
Pardon?

865
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:18,730
What's that reason?

866
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:23,969
I do have a personal debt to settle.

867
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,639
- Let go of me. - You're so loud. Be quiet.

868
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,900
I didn't borrow any money. Why must I pay it back?

869
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:31,610
I didn't do anything wrong.

870
00:54:32,039 --> 00:54:33,738
Let go of me!

871
00:54:33,739 --> 00:54:34,809
Hey.

872
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,848
This proves your father owes us 80,000 dollars.

873
00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:39,808
Your father ran away without paying off his debt.

874
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:40,848
Of course, his daughter ought to pay it back.

875
00:54:40,849 --> 00:54:43,150
How could 20,000 dollars turn into 80,000 dollars in 2 years?

876
00:54:43,179 --> 00:54:45,119
- Give it to me. - No.

877
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,690
It's not something you can easily rip it to pieces.

878
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:54,860
That was pretty easy.

What do you want?

884
00:55:15,949 --> 00:55:17,549
Are you trying to buy me with this debt?

885
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:19,219
People can't be bought with money.

886
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,929
Do you expect me to believe that...

887
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,428
you helped me without wanting anything in return?

888
00:55:26,429 --> 00:55:27,900
You said it wasn't your debt.

889
00:55:30,699 --> 00:55:31,699
Just go.

Yes.

00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:58,090
Wait.

894
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:01,129
Oh, sorry.

895
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:02,259
It's okay.

896
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:03,598
Could you stay in the car for a moment?

897
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,400
Let me go out first and take a look around.

898
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,500
Okay.

899
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:29,320
Don't come in here.

the owner of the company your brother works for.

00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:09,158
We need your permission.

908
00:57:09,159 --> 00:57:11,630
If you don't give him permission, he won't come in.

909
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:14,138
My brother didn't do anything wrong.

910
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:15,469
I see.

911
00:57:17,539 --> 00:57:20,379
That man isn't here to take your brother away.

912
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,739
He came to find your brother.

913
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:26,449
In my opinion, he's quite worried about your brother.

914
00:57:33,789 --> 00:57:34,789
She gave us permission.

915
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:36,389
Okay. Thank you.

916
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:41,760
Gosh. Is this a kite?

917
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,130
Did your brother make one for you?

918
00:57:44,469 --> 00:57:46,769
But it's broken. You must be so sad.

919
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:48,469
Should I fix it for you?

920
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,569
I might not look like it,

921
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:52,409
but I'm a magician who can fix anything.

922
00:57:53,309 --> 00:57:54,739
Let's do it together. Come.

923
00:58:23,909 --> 00:58:25,038
(Grandma's clothes: Pajamas, underwear, socks)

924
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:26,840
(Taek's clothes: Pajamas, underwear, socks)

925
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:37,689
(Lee Geum Yi)

926
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,150
(Jung Yoon Taek)

927
00:58:59,409 --> 00:59:00,879
(Written Promise)

928
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:02,479
(I pledge not to do bad things ever again.)

929
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,510
(Big Brother Jung Yoon Taek)

930
00:59:04,849 --> 00:59:07,618
I would like to work diligently at this company.

931
00:59:07,619 --> 00:59:11,519
The easiest and fastest way to ruin someone's life...

932
00:59:12,989 --> 00:59:14,690
is drugs. You know that, right?

933
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:18,089
You must be used to making easy money.

934
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:20,558
How could I trust you that you wouldn't go back to the old way?

935
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:23,300
Sir, hold on!

936
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:26,300
I have a younger sister.

937
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:29,038
The age gap between us is over 20 years.

938
00:59:29,039 --> 00:59:30,439
(I pledge not to do bad things ever again.)

939
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:31,440
I...

940
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:34,110
don't want to be an embarrassment to her.

941
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:36,210
Even if I can't be a cool brother,

942
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,920
I don't want to disgrace her.

943
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:51,730
A long time ago, an older boy made a kite for me.

944
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:56,860
He always wrote his wish on the kite.

945
00:59:58,969 --> 01:00:02,070
He said the wish would reach the sky when we flew the kite.

946
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:05,139
Would you like to write down your wish too?

947
01:00:06,409 --> 01:00:07,679
Let's write it here.

948
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:18,250
(I want my brother to come back...)

949
01:00:19,289 --> 01:00:21,158
Gosh. What if your wish does come true?

950
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,718
(I want my dad to come back to me quickly.)

951
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,960
We must write it big, so they grant us the wish.

952
01:00:26,329 --> 01:00:29,659
Fly!

953
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:40,239
(I want my brother to come back to me quickly.)

954
01:00:51,719 --> 01:00:53,789
We're going to fly the kite. Do you want to come with us?

955
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:56,960
Yes!

956
01:00:58,659 --> 01:00:59,960
Let's go!

957
01:01:45,309 --> 01:01:48,110
There it goes.

958
01:02:06,659 --> 01:02:07,699
Prosecutor Jang.

959
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:11,030
Eun Ha.

960
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:55,239
(My Sweet Mobster)

961
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:58,980
Don't trust or follow someone like me again.

962
01:02:59,179 --> 01:03:01,320
Seo Ji Hwan isn't a typical CEO of a company.

963
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:02,718
Sir.

964
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:04,349
Gosh. I'm sorry.

965
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:07,388
Is there a special reason why you came to this house?

966
01:03:07,389 --> 01:03:10,459
Of all the people I've met, he was the kindest person.

967
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:11,489
Let's go.

968
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:14,259
I'm going to teach you.

969
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:15,599
Three syllables.

970
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:18,869
Eun Ha. I like you.

971
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,539
Why are you so nice to me?

972
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:24,070
What am I to you?
