We will not allow it!

182
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,580
Talk!

183
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:08,010
Well, Il Yeong is a really nice guy, Dad.

184
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,160
He went to S University, your favorite.

185
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,300
He's tall, handsome, has a great personality, and is so polite to adults.

186
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,940
Son-in-law Joo is handsome.

187
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:21,300
"Son-in-law Joo"?

188
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,820
Hold on.

189
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,450
Who is that?

190
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,960
Mother and Father, hello.

191
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,880
I'm sorry to show up unannounced.

192
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,080
I'm the oldest hyung Seo Ji Hwan. I live with Il Yeong.

193
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:14,080
I'm here to get your approval in place of his parents.

194
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,330
Are you a mobster here to take money?

195
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:20,650
Do we owe you our approval? There's nothing to get from us.

196
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,700
I'm sorry.

197
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,780
I took him in when he was young since he had nowhere to go.

198
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:31,240
He hasn't said or done a single bad thing in those 16 years.

199
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,490
He finished graduate school and paid his own way.

200
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,900
He won't let his own family or someone else's go hungry.

201
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,480
He's fundamentally a kind and diligent person.

202
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:49,370
If the issue was just between these two, I wouldn't butt in.

203
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,770
But now, it involves three people.

204
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,130
I would be grateful if you could reconsider it once more.

205
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:13,500
Your hyung seems so trustworthy.

206
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,350
My husband is also the oldest of six siblings.

207
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:20,890
Every time one of his siblings got married, he went around

208
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:24,390
to ask for permission in place of their parents.

209
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:26,420
For me...

210
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,510
my child's life is more important

211
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:32,180
than an unborn grandchild.

212
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:35,990
I'm going to have a good life with Mi Ho.

213
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,890
I'll be a proud dad to our unborn child.

214
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,460
At this point...

215
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,420
just saying "All right" will make you look cool, Dad.

216
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,070
You. Be quiet.

217
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,510
All right. You guys have done enough.

218
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,740
Sit comfortably, please.

219
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,530
Son-in-law Joo. Stretch out your knees.

220
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:07,540
I'll bring out some food. Have lunch before you go.

221
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:10,620
- Honey.
- You stand up, too.

222
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,470
You're the best at making pancakes!

223
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,950
- We said we'd say the same thing. What's this?
- Stand up.

224
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,820
Stand up!

225
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,020
- You-
- Come on.

226
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,200
- Follow me.
- It's okay.

227
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,290
Don't worry. They're going to have a good life.

228
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,800
So, you never knew your parents and grew up in an orphanage.

229
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,580
Yes.

230
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,800
It must've been so hard to go through that alone.

231
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,120
You turned out so well.

232
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:53,300
He did inherit something huge from his parents.

233
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,070
His face.

234
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,980
Seriously, you're so...

235
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,760
- My head hurts.
- Oh, no.

236
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,870
Mother and Father, please take good care of Il Yeong.

237
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,420
He's drunk.

238
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,960
You're drunk. Sleep. It's okay.

239
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,500
Wow! How can he get so drunk after one drink?

240
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,290
- He's a lightweight.
- I see that.

241
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,400
I told him to go sleep inside, but he won't.

242
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,320
He...

243
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,380
is someone I really love and care about.

244
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,850
Mother and Father, isn't he so good-looking?

245
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,020
Please take good care of him.

246
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,800
- Wrong direction. Just sleep.
- Please take care of him...

247
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,680
- It's okay.
- They've met once before.

248
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,460
They're neighbors.

249
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,400
Hey, Joo Il Yeong.

250
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,100
You thief!

251
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,340
When did you get a perm?

252
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,830
You thief!

253
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:53,340
Ji Hwan! Wrong direction.

254
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,790
Il Yeong...

255
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,990
You'll be a good dad, for sure.

256
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,810
- Gosh, they must be similar!
- Okay.

257
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,770
That guy...

258
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,690
- He must resemble Il Yeong.
- No, he doesn't!

259
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,870
Just a little more.

260
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,230
Wait.

261
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,950
Just a little more.

262
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,760
Oh, my gosh!

263
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:28,240
What? You're totally sober. You're doing this on purpose.

264
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:33,310
Oppa, you got down on your knees so easily.

265
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:37,380
No. I don't easily bend my knees.

266
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:40,830
No. It looked pretty automatic.

267
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,180
How do you feel, Oppa?

268
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:47,000
- About what?
- About Il Yeong getting married.

269
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,460
Aren't you sad?

270
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,470
- No.
- You're not sad?

271
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,580
No.

272
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,900
He's grown enough to have a family.

273
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,140
I'm just happy for him.

274
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,430
I feel a little weird.

275
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,580
Mi Ho getting married

276
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,750
or becoming a mom.

277
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,070
It hasn't quite sunk in yet.

278
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,980
Oppa, have you ever thought about getting married?

279
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,150
Marriage?

280
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:25,260
You're not that young, Oppa.

281
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,830
Jae Soo is older than me.

282
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,620
Il Yeong is seven years younger than you.

283
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:32,050
Il Yeong has a baby, though.

284
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,560
But is marriage

285
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,430
something you do for a baby? It's for love.

286
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,170
Because you love someone and don't want to be apart.

287
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,960
Really?

288
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:52,770
- I don't know. I've never thought about it.
- What?

289
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,620
But the guys need me. So they all need to get married first.

290
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,810
- They all, what? Get them married off first?
- Yeah.

291
00:21:59,810 --> 00:22:03,090
But Dong Hee is only 22.

292
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,820
If you wait for him, you'll be over 50 when you get married.

293
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:11,360
Well, is that so? Am I that old already?

294
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:20,580
Well, fine. People live to be 100 these days. It's doable.

295
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,570
Take care of your health, Oppa. Don't drink like today.

296
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:28,440
Take care of your health and live long and well.

297
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,310
Hey, Eun Ha.

298
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,730
Sleep.

299
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,580
Why so suddenly...

300
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:54,940
He didn't used to be this clueless.

301
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,020
He's changed.

302
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,500
[Eun Ha and Friends: 10K subscribers]
- Gosh! 10,000 people?

303
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,840
10,000 people? 10,000 people!

304
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,040
- Gosh! 10,000 subscribers!

305
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,660
Man Ho! I have 10,000 people!

306
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,490
- What?
- I have 10,000 subscribers!

307
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,980
10,000? Already?

308
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,190
- Wow!
- What's going on?

309
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,650
- 10,000 subscribers!
- Wow!

310
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,670
- What's going on?
- Don't be shocked.

311
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:31,240
Sister-in-law has accomplished 10,000 subscribers.

312
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,280
Applause!

313
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,150
Little Rat is "Cure for all"!*
(Sounds like 10,000 people)

314
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,600
- Congratulations, Noona.

- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

316
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,860
- Congratulations.
- Noona, should we organize an event for 10K?

317
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,350
That's a great idea!

318
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:53,430
I've been wanting to do an offline event. Now is the time!

319
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:56,070
- Right! That's a great idea!
- Thank you!

320
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,820
That's great!

321
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:00,190
Good morning, Hyungnim. Hyungnim!

322
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,050
Little Rat has more than 10,000 subscribers, Hyungnim!

323
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,920
- What are you saying?
- She has more than 10,000 subscribers.

324
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,540
More than 10,000 subscribers?

325
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,830
- Yes, Hyungnim.
- More than 10,000?

326
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:14,190
- You have more than 10,000 subscribers?
- Yes!

327
00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:19,830
Congratulations! Congratulations!

328
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,450
Congratulations!

329
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:25,690
I don't know. I've never thought about it.

330
00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:29,840
But the guys need me. So they all need to get married first.

331
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,040
10,000 people!

332
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,430
Wait, wait.

333
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,210
Right.

334
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,890
- Huh?
- I need to get ready for the event,

335
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,110
and I'm having lunch with Mi Ho. See you later. Enjoy breakfast.

336
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,330
- Sister-in-law!
- What?

337
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,830
- What?
- Eun Ha.

338
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,930
- Sister-in-law...
- What?

339
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,730
The vibes were pure honey! Why did you ice it out, Hyungnim?

340
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,760
W-Why is she acting like that?

341
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,720
You're the source of 10,000 troubles, Hyungnim!

342
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,030
Hyungnim.

343
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,560
What? Are you sure she has 10,000 subscribers?

344
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,090
Is he a matchmaking company?

345
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,430
Think about it after marrying off Jae Soo, Man Ho, Hong Gi, and Dong Hee?

346
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,660
He's saying he doesn't want to get married.

347
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:16,140
What's all this marriage talk all of a sudden? Do you want to get married?

348
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,060
It's not that I want to, but he's not thinking about it at all.

349
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,480
I'm just disappointed.

350
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:24,510
So, you call him something else now.

351
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,940
"Oppa" sounds so natural.

352

- What? Really?
- Yeah!

357
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,000
- It wasn't just a feeling? He really is Hyeon Woo?
- Yes!

358

Hey, that doesn't make any sense.

360
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:49,060
He's so different from what you've told me.

361
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,730
Look. You said Hyeon Woo is fair. Almost like a prince.

362
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:55,270
And sensitive and tender?

363
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,550
Hey. Seo Ji Hwan is sensitive and a prince, too!

You just haven't looked up close.

365

He has dark eyes, a nice nose, plump lips. He's good-looking!

- What?
- Hey, to be good-looking...

Look.

368
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,690
This is what good-looking looks like.

369
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:13,500
Or a face like Il Yeong's.

370

You're so weird. What's wrong with Ji Hwan?

371

Of course. But please don't fight.

Did something happen yesterday?

378
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,040
Yesterday? We talked about Dong Hee.

379
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,890
Before that, we talked about age. Before that, marriage.

380
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:49,430
She didn't ask you, "Do you ever want to get married?" Right?

381
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,250
How did you know?

382
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,420
Did you say no?

383
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:57,900
It's not that I don't want to. I just said I've never thought about it.

384
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,790
What, what?

385
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,680
Did I make a mistake?

386
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,640
You did, but this kind of mistake will only upset her more if you apologize.

387
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,830
I think you should approach it from a different angle.

388
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,710
- How?
- "I haven't thought about marriage,

389

390

I love you with all my heart."

391

That's what you need to express.

00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:21,260
She's a kids' content creator. She just got 10K subscribers.

527
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,860
She's really pretty and cute.

528
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,950
Yes, she is. Cute and pretty.

529
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:29,210
How about this one? I think it'll look good on her.

530
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,940
Get in line.

531
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:42,840
Can we have a hot Americano, a hot chamomile tea, and...

532
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,960
a piece of cheesecake?

533
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,380
Wait.

534
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:51,100
We don't need the cake. Just the two drinks, please.

535
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,800
- I thought you liked cake.
- You know...

536
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,860
we have wedding prep, find a place...

537
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:06,140
- We need to save.
- It's just 7,000 won.

538
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,950
See? I knew you'd be like this.

539
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:14,210
- You've never kept a budget, have you?
- No.

540
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:17,480
This is a reality now.

541
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,380
Kids cost a lot of money.

542
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:24,510
Since we're having a baby before getting a place,

543
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,750
we need to be on alert more than others.

544
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:32,940
As soon as the baby's here, we'll need milk, diapers, clothes, and...

545
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,570
toiletries, and what else...

546
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:40,530
Toys! We'll need a lot of toys. So...

547
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:46,950
You don't need to worry about paying for milk or diapers.

548
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,500
What is this? Why are there so many numbers?

549
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:54,750
One, ten, hundred, thousand, hundred thousand-

550
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,590
One hundred million won?

551
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,940
Are these your savings?

552
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:04,520
You saved all this money? At your age?

553
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,130
Didn't I tell you?

554
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:08,370
You can trust me.

555
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,870
Then...

556
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:21,130
- can I order cake now?
- Yes!

557
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:23,380
Cheesecake- wait.

558
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:26,000
I want something more expensive. Strawberries and cream!

559
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,350
- Strawberries and cream?
- Yeah.

560
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:28,740
Got it.

561
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:34,400
Hey. How am I supposed to hug a kid like this?

562
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,050
Is it to protect my back from carrying the baby?

563
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,440
It looks like a parachute.

564
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,710
Do I carry the baby and run?

565
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,480
- Hyungnim.
- Good evening, Hyungnim.

566
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,910
What?

567
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,610
Hyungnim.

568
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,290
What's with the flowers?

569
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:53,660
You know how to buy flowers now. You're practically a terrorist!

570
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,900
Terrorist? You mean a romantic.

571
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,150
What is all this?

572
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:02,200
Hyungnim, we bought some stuff for our nephew.

573
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:07,820
We don't know if it's a boy or girl, so we prepared both.

574
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:18,110
Are you guys seeing anyone?

575
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:19,530
- No.
- A girl, you mean?

576
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:23,830
You're old now. You should think about getting married. What's all this?

577
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:25,160
I'm 32.

578
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,740
What nonsense. Don't lie to me.

579
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,680
I'm actually 32.

580
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,920
You're that young?

581
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,490
Yes. I'll wait until you guys are married.

582
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,750
I think I can take my time.

583
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,500
No, don't take your time.

584
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,100
The order doesn't matter. Whoever's ready goes next.

585
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:48,500
Stop sticking together all the time, you two! Stay apart!

586
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,210
- We're apart right now.
- More!

587
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:51,780
We're...

588
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,060
Don't stick together.

589
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,170
Did you ever go out with a girl?

590
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:12,100
Dong Hee isn't the problem. It's those two. Those guys...

591
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,760
Eun Ha.

592
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,820
Eun Ha?

593
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,760
Where did she go?

594
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,820
Ta-da!

595
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:08,830
E-E-E-Eun Ha. It's you. One second.

596
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,480
E-Eun Ha, one second.

597
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:16,870
You can turn around now.

598
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:19,040
- I can?
- Yes.

599
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,130
I was going to surprise you, then I was surprised.

600
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:26,120
A surprise.

601
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,190
Want to sit down for a second?

602
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,380
Here.

603
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:36,810
What is this?

604
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:39,010
Wow, is it for me?

605
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,560
There are two hearts inside.

606
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,300
I-Is this for me?

607
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,700
They're for the event tomorrow. I made some for you.

608
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,160
Really?

609
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,470
Thank you.

610
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:53,000
Eun Ha.

611
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,500
I have something for you, too.

612
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,260
Flowers?

613
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:05,180
Congratulations on 10K subscribers for "Eun Ha and Friends."

614
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,070
Sunflowers.

615
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,480
You remembered that I like sunflowers.

616
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,580
Of course. I remember everything about you. I don't forget.

617
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,590
Also, the important stuff is happening now.

618
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,910
What?

619
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,240
Eun Ha.

620
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:07,390
From now on,

621
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:10,770
I'll always be by your side.

622
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:15,550
Don't you dare go anywhere.

623
00:44:16,370 --> 00:44:18,570
I'll stick by you.

624
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:31,520
- Are you ready for the event tomorrow?
- Yes.

625
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,940
If you're curious, come check it out.

626
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:44,890
I don't have anything after my morning meeting. I'll be there.

627
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,370
Good.

628
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:50,440
- It's tasty, right?
- So tasty. How did you make them?

629
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:53,970
Dong Hee helped me. We did it together.

630
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:13,150
♫ I saw her once, twice, I want to see her more ♫

631
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:20,190
Watch out! Move!

632
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:21,790
Hey!

633
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:27,380
Ahjussi! You can't ride your bike here!

634
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:30,320
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay, Dong Hee?

635
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,530
This looks like our spot.

636
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:39,120
I think so, too.

637
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:41,980
Hello. Hello.

638
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:44,830
Everything is ready. Let me know when you're done.

639
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:46,850
Thank you.

640
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:49,010
Should we put them up, Dong Hee?

641
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:05,130
We have a group meal after today's meeting!

642
00:46:05,130 --> 00:46:08,530
Man Ho is treating!

643
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:14,160
Quick correction. Kwak Jae Soo is treating today!

644
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,220
Applause!

645
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:37,170
Everyone's in the conference room, right?

646
00:46:37,170 --> 00:46:40,070
You need to see something before you go.

647
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:52,230
Director Nam Pil Ho and Goo Choong Bae are in touch with Go Yang Hui's gang.

648
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,460
Got it. I'll meet with them after the meeting. Let's go for now.

649
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:33,260
What's going on?

650
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:36,490
What's going on?

651
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:40,330
What are you doing here, you bastards!

652
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:15,990
It's an emergency. The conference room is a mess.

653
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:18,780
That guy is here. Your father!

654
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,450
What do we do?

655
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:23,710
Go Yang Hui and the guys stormed in. People are on their knees.

656
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:26,620
I'm so scared I can't even leave.

657
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:33,700
[What do we do...]

658
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,290
Do something.

659
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:53,150
I'm going to lose my mind.

660
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:06,750
Hyungnim!

661
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:35,060
What are you doing at someone else's company?

662
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:40,980
If you're not associated with Thirsty Deer, please leave right now.

663
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,260
Returning after 10 years,

664
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:53,500
I noticed there were so many new faces, so I came to see them.

665
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:59,460
It looks like everyone's been well here.

666
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:07,570
"From bone to flesh."

667
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,020
Bone to bone,

668
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:17,830
flesh to flesh!

669
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:21,890
We need to get back what we're owed.

670
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,550
I'm sorry, Hyungnim! Please spare our lives!

671
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:27,990
Hyungnim, I'm sorry.

672
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:31,860
Damn it. What are you doing?

673
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:35,190
Have you all lost your mind? You traitors!

674
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:37,030
Who betrayed the Chairman first?

675
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:40,270
Hey, bastard. Are you calling the CEO a traitor?

676
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:42,410
Tell it like it is. He did betray him.

677
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:44,260
Shut your mouth, bastard.

678
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:46,290
Are you going to hit me, bastard?

679
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:48,040
What a well-run company.

680
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,830
- Who's calling who a traitor?
- You're the traitor!

681
00:50:57,250 --> 00:50:58,720
What do we do...

682
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:14,070
What the hell is this?

683
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:18,690
Stop it!

684
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,910
The meeting is adjourned for today.

685
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:36,260
If you don't have business here, please leave.

686
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,220
Let's go.

687
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:03,890
Gosh. Your hand is bleeding.

688
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,640
Why did you do that?

689
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,320
To be honest...

690
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:28,490
I'm scared of the Chairman.

691
00:52:28,490 --> 00:52:31,390
I've trusted and followed you until now.

692
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,340
But I can't anymore. I'm too scared.

693
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:37,700
I'll turn in my resignation letter, so process it.

694
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:42,960
Could you stay?

695
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,170
Do you think we have two lives?

696
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:50,580
I'd rather not get involved than stick it out and die.

697
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:54,220
Don't do that.

698
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:56,400
Please trust me just a little longer.

699
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,200
No one who turned his back then has slept well since the Chairman got out.

700
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,000
CEO Seo, I mean, Ji Hwan, the reason we supported you back then

701
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:07,860
was because the Chairman was in jail and not around.

702
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,240
That's why you turned him in.

703

Let's go.

707
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,700
Director, why are you doing this?

[Letter of Resignation]
You can't do this right now, Director.

709
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:13,230
Chairman, I have something to tell you.

710
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:16,960
- What is it?
- I meant to report to you a while ago.

711
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:20,630
Seo Ji Hwan has a girl.

712
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:26,800
Someone he's known since childhood. He's crazy about her.

713
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:29,010
So?

714
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:34,190
Her job is to play with kids. She's doing an outdoor event today.

715
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:40,020
This is the surefire way to destroy Seo Ji Hwan.

716
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,510
If we kidnap that girl and blackmail him-

717
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:46,160
You know what the difference is between you and Ji Hwan?

718
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,780
- Pardon?
- If I tell you to bring me something,

719
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,910
you push and try to steal it.

720
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:54,510
Ji Hwan made the other person give it to him.

721
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:57,890
That's why you're inferior, man.
