11
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,510
What about you? What brings you here?

12
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,409
Well,

13
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,208
If I were to tell you I happened to be in the neighbourhood...

14
00:01:47,209 --> 00:01:48,480
on a trip to get some fresh air,

15
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:51,719
you wouldn't believe me. Right, Mr. Seo?

16
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,119
Oh, right. He's...

17
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,989
I'm Prosecutor Jang Hyun Woo from Seoul Central DPO.

18
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,299
- Well, I am... - There isn't a prosecutor...

I can get your name and resident registration number.

24
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,989
If I wanted, I could run a DNA test with yours.

25
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,719
Yet, you're giving me your business card?

26
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,560
This is interesting.

27
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:37,759
Well, sir...

28
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,330
Did you get home safely yesterday?

29
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,030
Yes. I got home safely.

30
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,400
That's good to hear.

31
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,110
Gosh. That's a beautiful kite.

32
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:52,979
I think I can guess this lovely young lady's name.

33
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:57,120
You're the beautiful Yeon Hee, aren't you?

34
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:04,360
I came here because I was worried that bad guys would bother you.

35
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,360
But luckily, you were with another beautiful lady.

36
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,829
One of his employees has gone missing.

37
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:12,159
So we came here to look for him.

38
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,729
Did he tell you about the history of the missing employee?

39
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:20,169
You might not have known about it,

40
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,909
but I'm sure Mr. Seo here must have known...

41
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,680
how dangerous it would be for you to come here.

42
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,050
I can think of at least three possibilities...

43
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,759
how she could have gotten hurt here.

44
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,530
Here's the first one.

45
00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:44,430
If it was a member of another gang getting out of the car, not me.

46
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:46,159
Here's the second one.

47
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,168
If it was another prosecutor...

48
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:50,469
or a police officer getting out of the car, not me.

49
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,300
Here's the third one.

50
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,539
If you had a different agenda or an ulterior motive,

51
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,879
she could have been an accomplice...

52
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,310
or a victim by coming here.

53
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,399
You got it all wrong.

54
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,160
Sir.

55
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,970
She has nothing to do with me.

56
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,568
She owed me a small favour.

57
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:28,209
So I brought her here. That's all.

58
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,410
This all worked out. You two can leave together.

59
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,449
- You want me to leave? - Yes. Your debt is settled now.

60
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,149
Mr. Seo. Still...

61
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,279
Let's go back together.

62
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,829

When I headed down there,

67
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:15,689
it never crossed my mind that I would see you there.

68
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,790
To be honest,

69
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:19,959
I was a bit flustered.

70
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:25,600
How did you end up following him there?

71
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:28,930
How did you end up being in his debt?

72
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,439
You really didn't know anything about the employee?

73
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,310
Or...

74
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,479
is he blackmailing you...

75
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,009
No. He didn't do anything like that.

76
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,379
Aren't you scared...

77
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:48,490
of him?

78
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:53,519
I should be scared of him.

79
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:56,329
I thought I would be scared.

80
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,329
But he doesn't scare me.

81
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:06,369
Mr. Seo simply went there to look for his missing employee.

82
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,139
It might not be a simple disappearance case.

83
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,209
I see your point.

84
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,948
But to me,

85
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:16,648
he looked like an ordinary CEO who was worried about his employee.

86
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:18,720
Mr. Seo isn't an ordinary CEO.

87
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:26,188
Why do you hate him so much?

88
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:27,860
It's not that I hate him.

89
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,529
I've seen things...

90
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,730
and experienced things as a prosecutor.

91
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,730
People like him won't change that easily.

92
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,879
In your eyes, what kind of man is Mr. Seo?

93
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:48,750
He's the most dangerous man I know of.

94
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:05,259
A man you should never keep close.

I see. I had a crazy day yesterday.

99
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,458
So I forgot to check my phone. I'm sorry about that.

100
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:38,500
I see.

101
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,529
If you want,

102
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,300
you can ask me that question.

103
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,610
Can I ask you on another day, not today?

104
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,240
I don't want to ask you on a day like today.

105
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,980
I'd like to ask you in a more suitable setting and time.

106
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,649
I see. Is that so?

107
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:02,120
Well, I have plans tomorrow.

108

00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,278
What? It was you?

160
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,178
Who said you could call me by my name? We're not friends.

I'm sorry.

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,989
I thought you were a suspicious man.

163
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,119
You look even more suspicious.

164
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,658
Why are you peeking through our house?

165
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:00,489
I came back to get my backpack.

166
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,028
Then, press the bell and ask for it.

- Come on. - Oh, no.

169

- Close the gate. - Right.

170
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,840
Why is she asking me to bring her backpack?

171
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,820

Thank you.

I met him when I went to make a statement as a witness.

176
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:51,109
He said he needed my statement for the Club Cat Case.

177
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,778
So I went to his office yesterday.

178
00:12:52,779 --> 00:12:54,350
You don't have to explain anything to me.

179
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,249
You're not required to explain how you're acquainted with a prosecutor.

180
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,690
But when you're acquainted with an ex-convict,

181
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,490
you're required to explain that.

182
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,129
Go to the prosecutor and give him an explanation.

183
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:11,860
It was my fault for letting this happen today,

184
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:13,860
but you should never trust...

185
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,730
or follow someone like me again.

186
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,038
Just like the prosecutor said, no one would have predicted...

187
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:22,570
what could have happened there.

188
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,309
By that, are you talking about...

189
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,509
how I met Yeon Hee, made a kite, and played with her?

190
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:32,879
I'm not so naive to trust random people and follow them.

191
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:35,849
Well, if you think you made a mistake, just apologize.

192
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,990
Was it necessary to be that harsh?

193
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:46,360
Thank you.

194
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,470
Wait.

195
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,639
Is your name...

196
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,110
Eun Ha?

197
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,610
Yes. Ko Eun Ha.

00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:20,129
- One sikhye, please. - What's your number?

201
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:23,470
- Number 8. - Okay. Sikhye for number 8.

202
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:29,109
The CEO of the company you posted a video about...

203
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,639
used to be a former member of the Bulldog Gang or something.

204
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,980
How dangerous could he be?

(Bulldog Gang)

206
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:42,989
Excuse me. Here's your sikhye.

207
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,460
- Thank you. - Thank you.

208

(Baekdusan Dry Sauna, Open all year round)

209
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:54,599
My gosh. I'm sorry.

210
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,969
- Are you okay? I'm sorry. - Darn it.

211
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,029
Gosh.

212
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:58,740
- What? - What?

213
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:07,610
You might not have known about it,

214
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:10,679
but I'm sure Mr. Seo here must have known...

215
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,289
how dangerous it would be for you to come here.

216
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,860
Did you have a good trip down to Yeon Hee's house?

217
00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:21,090
Yes.

218
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:24,659
Her room was empty.

219
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,128
That room had always been empty.

220
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:29,070
But it doesn't have to be empty at this hour.

221
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:30,329
It's pretty late.

222
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,500
The street will be safer than here.

223
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,969
Did something happen on the trip?

224
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,370
A prosecutor came down too.

225
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,439
Don't tell me Taek already caused trouble.

226
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,279
Then, he wouldn't have come down to Taek's house.

227
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:43,908
Instead of focusing only on Ko Yang Hee,

228
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,120
send more people to Thailand to look for him.

229
00:15:50,419 --> 00:15:51,788
Why is my seal missing?

230
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:52,918
You stole the seal?

231
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,459
I didn't steal it. I only borrowed it.

232
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,059
I put it back after using it.

233
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,940
We finished early today.

234
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
How about fried chicken and beer?

235
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,909
Fried chicken and beer? Gosh, that sounds amazing.

236
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:11,508
- Okay. - Where's the number? Wait.

237
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:13,579
No. You know what? Let's get some tuna instead.

238
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,548
Tuna? Then are you the tuna man?

239
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:16,779
That's a crime.

240
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,379
Well, that's why I'm hiding out here.

241
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,350
Were you charged with fraud?

242
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,059
What about you?

243
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:27,419
You left with the boss this morning. Why are you here all alone?

244
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:30,029
Did you get kicked out?

245
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:32,959
I didn't get kicked out.

246
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,329
I left on my own free will.

247
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,229
Gosh. You have no place to go.

248
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,969
My friend isn't answering her phone.

249
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,699
It's not that I don't have a place to go.

250
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,999
- So she didn't answer her phone. - Right.

251
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,709
That means you don't have a place to go.

252
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,178
Gosh. Big Boss is so cruel.

253
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:46,878
He wanted to spare you a room because you had no place to go.

254
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:48,109
So he made so much space for you.

255
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,678
What is this? Come on.

256
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,619
- He shouldn't discriminate people. - I didn't get kicked out.

257
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,179
Then what about you?

258
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,990
How did you end up living there?

259
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,759
It's a long story.

260
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:03,889
Watch me.

261
00:17:06,029 --> 00:17:07,059
Pretty please!

262
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,798
You just thought I was cute, right?

263
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:10,868
Sure.

264
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,298
See? I'm still so cute.

265
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,368
Imagine how much cuter I must have been when I was a kid.

266
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:16,539
When I was a kid, the ladies in my neighbourhood...

267
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,839
would do anything to pat me on my bottom.

268
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,608
Then my father had a business mind.

269
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:24,578
All right. Have your pick

270
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,719
Have your pick, just grab it

271
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,689
It's not every day you get to see my products

272
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,548
So hurry up and pick it up

273
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,318
Hurry up and pick it up

274
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,460
- Gosh. - Goodness.

275
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,430
So he brought me along...

276
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,758
to sell jade mats, honey from Mount Jiri, or acer mono sap.

277
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:40,199
There wasn't anything he wouldn't sell.

278
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,829
- So cute. - Over here.

279
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,338
He taught me at a young age how to make money in this world.

280
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:48,339
I see.

281
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,338
As an aspiring con artist.

282
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:51,939
But this was the problem. My old man...

283
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,449
should have been happy, selling the acer mono sap.

284
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,409
But he expanded his con to an investment fraud.

285
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,119
Then gangsters were involved in this con.

286
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,249
Gosh. What could he do?

287
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,990
The gangsters were about to take him...

288
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:06,089
and beat him to death.

289
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,720
Then what happened?

290
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:13,200
He sold off his own son all of a sudden.

291
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,470
He said the kid wasn't his son...

292
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,099
and the woman he was living with had brought the kid.

293
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:23,910
Gosh.

294
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:25,609
Isn't that ridiculous?

295
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,910
Gosh. I had lived my entire life, calling him my dad.

296
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,920
But he conned his own son.

297
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,619
After listening to the secret story of my birth,

298
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,559
I didn't want to live anymore...

299
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:41,019
because of that stupid secret.

300
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:46,528
So I was begging the gangsters to kill me instead.

301
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:49,069
That's when Big Boss showed up.

302
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:50,829
He paid back all of my dad's debt.

303
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:53,500
He brought me out, so I could keep living.

304
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,910
He's your lifesaver.

305
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,140
Well, not really. He's more like a bank.

306
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:02,149
Well, I'll forever be on probation...

307
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,048
with my life as collateral.

308
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:05,380
That was one sick analogy.

309
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
Wait.

310
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:10,819
Hello?

311
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:12,588
Are you here?

312
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:14,420
No, I'll come to you.

313
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:15,759
Stay there.

314
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,700

Can't you see where you're going?

317
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:35,180
I clearly couldn't.

318
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:39,549
Are you all right? I'm sorry about that.

319
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:41,319
I'm good,

320
00:19:41,549 --> 00:19:43,750
so I hope you're all right.

321
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,789
That's a nice phone you have.

322
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:47,420
This is the model I needed.

323
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,259
Then you should keep it.

324

Take it, please.

00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,569
Take care.

326

No wonder you seemed familiar. You're one of Seo Ji Hwan's boys.

327

Who's that? I don't know who you're talking about.

- You don't know Seo Ji Hwan? - I don't.

329

- Say it. - Say it again.

Sorry, sis.

342
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,219
I was going to get some,

343

Hold on. Is that Pikachu?

346
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,939
It doesn't have its lightning pouch though.

347
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,969
The red circles on its cheeks.

348
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,538
Those harbour lightning.

349
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:10,739
It needs that to fire its lightning bolts.

350
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,338
The ears should be longer,

351
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:13,479
the mouth should be flipped,

352
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,710
and this should be an M and not a W.

00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,099
Give us back what belongs to us and...

365
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,400
(Baekdusan Dry Sauna)

366
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,839
(Entrance to Baekdusan Dry Sauna)

367
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,539
Where on earth are you? I'm waiting at the entrance.

368
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,880
I said I was at the entrance.

369
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,720
Wait. He's coming!

370
00:22:25,849 --> 00:22:26,849
- What? - Hurry.

371
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,618
Goodness.

372
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:33,759
It was hot inside, and I needed some air.

373
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,759
- Are you Yang Hong... - Beef tripe.

374
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:41,499
That famous beef tripe restaurant?

375
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,029
It's somewhere over there.

376
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:44,868
- Let me show him the way. - I'm here for Yang...

377
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:47,768
Just a second. I'll take that instead.

378
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:49,339
It was a man who answered the phone though.

379
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,809
I'll take that.

380
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:55,079
I should hand this to Yang Hong Ki.

381
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,450
Yang Hong Ki.

382
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:03,119
Get out here this instant!

383
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:09,829
Goodness me.

384
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,630
Big Boss, the rumours were true.

385
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,700
They say you have eyes on the back of your head and...

386
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,269
Are you the real Yang Hong Ki?

387
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,910
Yes.

388
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,640
Couldn't you have gotten here sooner?

389
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,358
(Brand ambassador: Kang Ye Na)

390
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,129
I was going to tell you,

391
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,798
but time was of the essence.

392
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,028
Losing her to none other than Great King Meat...

393
00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:52,298
would've hurt our pride.

394
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:54,970
Do you value your pride and not your conscience?

395
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,068
I may work with those who sell meat,

396
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,140
but not with those who sell their conscience.

397
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:05,579
Boss.

398
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,749
I didn't do this for my sake only.

399
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,160
I went about it the wrong way, but this will benefit us immensely.

400
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,029
Keeping the order of things should be most important to you.

401
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,799
A promise is an unpaid debt.

402
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,200
Yang Hong Ki.

403
00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:26,269
You failed to pay your debt.

404
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,069
Boss, please.

405
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:30,440
One.

406
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:32,809
Two.

407
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,480
Take it already.

408
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,049
Come with me.

409
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,420
Me? But...

410
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,529
I'll...

411
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:00,170
(Entrance)

412
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,640
(Baekdusan Dry Sauna)

413
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,909
You said you were going on vacation.

414
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:11,078
Was a dry sauna the best you could do?

415
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:13,519
Since I can't go to Mount Baekdu, I thought...

416
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,118
Anyway, they have hot spring water.

417
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,118
Are you not scared of anything, or are you being reckless?

418
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:19,159
Shouldn't you know better?

419
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,588
Don't you know what those people are?

420
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:25,299
Just so you know, I'm a scaredy-cat. I'm intimidated by you right now.

421
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:38,808
- Let's go. - Where?

422
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:42,079
I was wrong to think that you were safer on the streets.

423
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,979
Maybe my place is better.

424
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,018
Your place?

425
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:47,519
That's right. Stay until you find a place.

426
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:50,920
How much is the rent?

427
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:52,789
I hope it's cheaper than 200 dollars.

428
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:54,088
You don't have to pay me.

429
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:55,730
I can't be a freeloader.

430
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,689
Let me clean at least. I'm good at that.

431
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,058
We do that by ourselves.

432
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,059
I could wash the dishes.

433
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,598
Washing the covers will be a hassle considering all the residents.

434
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:03,868
I'm certified to do a lot of things.

435
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:06,868
Art therapy, story-telling, and anger management.

436
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:09,009
I bet there are many people who can't control their anger.

437
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:12,910
Can you also...

438
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:15,779
teach academics?

439
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,420
You came to the right person.

440
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:21,250
- What? - What did you just say?

441
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:22,749
Is this for real?

442
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,058
She'll be staying with us for the time being,

443
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:26,088
so be considerate of each other...

444
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:27,359
even though it may be uncomfortable.

445
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:31,089
Boss, could she...

446
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,369
also be an ex-con?

447
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,000
You may introduce yourself.

448
00:26:40,839 --> 00:26:43,569
I'm your private tutor who will help you with your studies.

449
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:47,539
A private tutor and not a housekeeper?

450
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:51,348
Why do we need a private tutor at this age, Boss?

451
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:53,720
You need to take a test in order to be promoted.

452
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,518
Others are studying in college and getting their doctor's degree.

453
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:57,889
Is a middle school or high school diploma...

454
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,119
the best you're ever going to get?

455
00:26:59,589 --> 00:27:02,089
Boss, if I'm being honest, I don't think...

456
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:05,099
I need a promotion.

457
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,129
Who says there will only be promotions?

458
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,299
If one can be promoted, one can also be demoted.

459
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:12,568
Keep at it if you want to go back to being regular employees.

460
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:15,369
Boss, this is wrong!

461
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,009
I hope we get along.

462
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,318
A blue sky And a dream as blue as a sky

463
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:34,690
Are set on a green garden

464
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:39,028
There, a number of goons play While enjoying their meet

465
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:42,470
With the brightest smiles

466
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,670
(The feet of a mountain)

467
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,799
The bell rings to signal the class

468
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:50,569
- What should it be? - Class begins

469
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,538
No to the alphabet

470
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:54,479
No to one, two, three, and, four

471
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,079
To that, we frown

472
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:02,288
When the bell rings for lunch

473
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:05,319
We must have awaited this hour

474
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,018
A game of buck buck

475
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,959
A squid game

476
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,529
The baby goons have fun

477
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,000
Forget it!

478
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,599
Why should we decorate the mouse's room?

479
00:28:22,309 --> 00:28:23,409
If you don't like this,

480
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,209
get your GED in one month.

481
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,639
One month, my foot.

482
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,150
I can't study with her not even for a day. I won't.

483
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,818
I don't know how that minx coaxed Big Boss,

484
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:34,919
but I won't let her walk all over me.

485
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,318
I'm Kwak Jae Soo, darn it.

486
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:38,690
I like the fact that she'll be tutoring us.

487
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,358
How can she tutor us...

488
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,419
when all she did was have fun with children?

489
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,689
She just said what came to mind...

490
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,189
because she knew she couldn't stay here for free.

491
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,799
Where did Hong Ki go on a day like this?

492
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,338
A successful man enters.

493
00:28:54,339 --> 00:28:55,339
Welcome, sir.

494
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,079
Improving one's image is part of a man's life.

495
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,190
What I need right now is recognition.

496
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,259
- What I need is freedom. - Freedom.

497
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:18,599
You're getting a call.

498
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:22,630
(Dung Hui)

499
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,200
Darn.

500
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:27,169
Gosh.

501
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:28,670
How is it this comfortable?

502
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:30,369
Goodness.

503
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,509
Please try out the features.

504
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:38,079
My gosh.

505
00:29:38,849 --> 00:29:41,480
Gosh, that's good.

506
00:29:42,349 --> 00:29:43,650
What I need right now...

507
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,420
is a break.

508
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:52,160
Stop calling, will you?

509
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,369
This is what I'm talking about!

510
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,598
Who says only he can have a sweet ride?

511
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,210
I can have one too.

512
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,048
Are you kidding me with all the calls?

513
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:11,710
Stop calling me and leave me alone!

514
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,389
You agreed to live there?

515
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,219
You weren't picking up,

516
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,119
and I couldn't stay at the sauna.

517
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:21,758
Besides, it's not everyday...

518
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:23,089
you get a job offer that comes with housing.

519
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:26,630
You're living with a bunch of guys. How can you trust them?

520
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,529
Actually, this is where Hyun Woo used to live.

521
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,670
What?

522
00:30:32,671 --> 00:30:35,769
Hyun Woo used to live in the basement unit of this house.

523
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,470
You're not making any sense.

524
00:30:37,539 --> 00:30:39,739
Didn't you say you were at that CEO's house?

525
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,008
Yes, he's the current owner.

526
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:44,549
Also, I met a guy whose name is Hyun Woo.

527
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:49,189
Are you saying you met Hyun Woo at that house?

528
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,818
No, not at this house.

529
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:54,220
It's frustrating to talk over the phone.

530
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,259
Let's talk in person.

531
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,630
Welcome.

532
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,798
That reminds me.

533
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:02,268
Il Young will stop by to collect the things I left there.

534
00:31:02,269 --> 00:31:05,440
Couldn't you have told me that sooner?

535
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,000
Hello.

536
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:09,339
Hi.

537
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:14,779
This is all of it.

538
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,750
She might need these,

539
00:31:17,309 --> 00:31:18,849
so we'll keep them in storage.

540
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,289
Right.

541
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,170
They're heavy, so allow me.

542
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,700
Right.

543
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:43,710
They're heavy no matter who carries them. I'm good.

544
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:46,579
You're right about them being heavy.

545
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,710
Gosh.

546
00:31:58,789 --> 00:31:59,859
Give me the address.

547
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,629
- Sorry? - I roughly know where the house is,

548
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:05,029
but I should have the exact address since she's my friend.

549
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:06,960
Right, the address.

550
00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:11,230
You came to get your hair done...

551
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:13,140
to ask about Eun Ha, didn't you?

552
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:15,670
You came looking for her when it rained as well.

553
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,339
Does your boss...

554
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,579
like her?

555
00:32:22,279 --> 00:32:23,549
Well, you see...

556
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:26,980
Just so you know, I used to play sports.

557
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:30,819
I'll bring her home if anything happens to her,

558
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:32,619
so know that.

559
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:34,059
Sure.

560
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,240
You've been here three times now,

561
00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:54,180
and they were all to run errands for your boss.

562
00:32:58,349 --> 00:32:59,420
I'm just saying.

563
00:33:05,589 --> 00:33:06,788
(Chief Oh Chul Min)

564
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:07,959
He should tell us what happened...

565
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,058
since he took the day off to go there.

566
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:11,858
All he told us was that he ran into Seo Ji Hwan.

567
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:14,299
Is he trying to make me die out of curiosity?

568
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,769
I'm sure there was more to it than just the encounter.

569
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:22,069
Well...

570
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:25,710
He was handsome in a manly way.

571
00:33:27,009 --> 00:33:28,379
- Is that all? - Yes.

572
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,949
You should've asked him on a date while you were at it.

573
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:31,108
We should settle on a date.

574
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:32,680
- Seriously? - When should it be?

575
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:35,990
Could he have lost his mind?

576
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:38,518
Ms. Song, please ask Lieutenant Yang...

577
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,618
to share the progress regarding the investigation...

578
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:41,919
into the Thailand drug case.

579
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,659
Chief Oh, please look further into Jung Yoon Taek's house...

580
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,400
and his grandmother's place.

581
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,558
Even if he leads us to nowhere, we might get something...

582
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,068
from Ko Yang Hee or Seo Ji Hwan,

583
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,929
so keep an eye on their movement.

584
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,039
What about our informant?

585
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,240
I'm sure our informant will make contact soon.

586
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,940
Where are you going?

587
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,180
Are you sure you have somewhere to go?

588
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,800
Is this also a bedroom?

589
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,619
I see there are a lot of rooms.

590
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,829
Is this a deer?

591
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,289
It only used to be a door that led inside from outside.

592
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,619
I see he installed a staircase.

593
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:56,760
Gosh.

594
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:01,099
Boss!

595
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,268
You brought that mouse into our home,

596
00:36:03,269 --> 00:36:05,169
and now we're supposed to let her tutor us.

597
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,899
How can you do this to us?

598
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,739
How can you be this cruel?

599
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,169
Also, that Kang Ye Na or Christmas or whatnot...

600
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,439
is the top content creator.

601
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,510
You should be rewarding Hong Ki for signing a deal with her.

602
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:16,949
I should reward him?

603
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,719
Those at Great King Meat have been looking down on us...

604
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:22,249
since they are currently the leading company in this field.

605
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:25,218
Hong Ki only wanted to do well which led to making this mistake.

606
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:26,219
A mistake?

607
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,939
It may be a mistake on our end,

608
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,610
but will others also see it that way?

609
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,549
Also, when has our goal...

610
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,880
been to be the leading company in the field?

611
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,219
Should we con others to rise to the top,

612
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:57,989
sell our conscience,

613
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:01,289
and live the way we used to?

614
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:10,570
Guys,

615
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,699
didn't the recent event teach you anything?

616
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:17,269
People don't see us the same way.

617
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,719
Even if we make the same mistakes, they will be viewed differently.

618
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:47,368
Let's be honest.

619
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:50,210
Will parents allow their children to eat our products?

620
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:51,840
No way.

621
00:37:52,409 --> 00:37:54,440
If we wait for people to let us in,

622
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,178
we'll be left at the door.

623
00:37:56,179 --> 00:37:59,050
Keeping the order of things should be most important to you.

624

625

00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:58,510
I'm sure you don't feel good about it, either.

You may be scary,

636
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:06,619
but you're not narrow-minded. Are you?

637
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,550
You scold others when necessary...

638
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:13,619

00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:50,218
- Good morning, Mr. Seo. - Morning. Did you sleep well?

727
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:52,218
- I did. Are you going to work? - Yes.

728
00:45:52,219 --> 00:45:53,260
By the way...

729
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,729
It's nothing much,

730
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:59,130
but if you are free tonight,

731
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,959
why don't I officially introduce you...

732
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,999
to everyone?

733
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,238
- Is it a hazing? - Not really.

734
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:08,099
It's close to a welcoming party.

735
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:10,239
I'm in. It sounds fun.

736
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:11,868
What should I prepare?

737
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,980
You don't have to prepare anything in particular.

738
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,949
Your hand is on my head, Mr. Seo.

739
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:30,690
I'm sorry. Why did I do that?

740
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:32,929
Anyway,

741
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:34,729
- I'll see you in the evening. - Okay.

742
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:36,059
- Good luck today. - Thank you.

(Thirsty Deer Corporation)

744
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:49,710
Last month's sales dropped by 17 percent.

745
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:52,078
Compared to around this time of last year,

746
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:53,579
it dropped by 20 percent.

747
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:58,190
As Thirsty Deer has been exposed to those who didn't know about us,

748
00:46:58,289 --> 00:47:00,119
a negative impression has been settled.

750
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:08,098
Pay extra attention to quality control at a time like this.

751
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:10,230
We can fix the rest one step at a time.

Later, the PR team...

753
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:14,468
How's Hong Ki doing?

754
00:47:14,469 --> 00:47:15,599
You know him.

755
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:17,869
Let him loose, and he runs wild.

756
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:22,780
It looks amazing.

757
00:47:25,449 --> 00:47:27,550
Now then, let's dig in.

758
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:40,659
Darn it.

759
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:45,030
How can I help you?

760
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,238
- Which company is the meat from? - Pardon?

761
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:51,138
A good bone-in sirloin...

762
00:47:51,139 --> 00:47:54,779
is a harmony of chewy fat and juicy meat.

763
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,578
It needs to have a smoky flavour.

764
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:58,849
It's supposed to be really tasty.

765
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:01,780
But this is dry and hard to chew.

766
00:48:03,219 --> 00:48:04,419
It's from Great King Meat, isn't it?

767
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,649
Let me check.

768
00:48:05,650 --> 00:48:07,459
The meat is all about its condition.

769
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:09,190
At Thirsty Deer, we...

770
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:10,690
Yes?

771
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:12,658
There's a company called Thirsty Deer.

772
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:14,828
Check that place out. Their products are tasty.

773
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:15,960
My apologies.

774
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,509
What?

775
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:26,038
If this isn't a coincidence, my personal information is leaking.

776
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:27,078
How did you know I was here?

777
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:28,408
It's hard not to know.

778
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:30,480
You posted everything for everyone to see.

779
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:34,578
Can I take a selfie with you?

780
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:36,719

783
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:45,359
Gosh. I wondered how Mr. Seo came to the sauna the other day.

784
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,799
I just didn't ignore...

785
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,229
my followers' right to know.

786
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:51,769
- Why are you here? - To get the fee for the delivery.

787
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,300
You are persistent.

788
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:03,050
I don't carry around cash.

789
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:05,610
Here. Write down your bank account number.

790
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:06,880
I'll deposit it later.

00:49:13,059 --> 00:49:14,618
I heard you moved in.

792
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:15,619
Where?

793
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:19,428
Right. Gosh. It's a nice place.

794
00:49:19,429 --> 00:49:21,729
I have a gorgeous breakfast every morning.

795
00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:23,969
The room is spacious. The garden is exquisite.

796
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:26,969
And the blanket is so soft that I fall asleep right away.

797
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:30,639
But the hotel must be better.

798
00:49:33,809 --> 00:49:34,880
Well...

799
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,448
Didn't Big Boss talk about me?

800
00:49:38,449 --> 00:49:39,510
About what?

801
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,519
Of course not.

802
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:43,719
He wouldn't worry about me.

803
00:49:44,889 --> 00:49:47,319
Are you talking about what he said...

804
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,360
about the house feeling empty without you?

805
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:51,789
That it felt like a lively house when you were there?

806
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:55,300
Did he say things like that?

807
00:49:57,429 --> 00:50:00,940
Honestly, Mr. Seo had to speak harshly to you.

808
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:03,308
You tried to do better...

809
00:50:03,309 --> 00:50:05,010
because you knew about that, right?

810
00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:06,739
Gosh.

811
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:09,809
I did it because I thought it was for the better.

812
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,449
But he said I failed to pay his debt.

813
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,549
As if he was a loan shark.

814
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,619
A real loan shark only cares about the money,

815
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:18,789
not the person.

816
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:22,590
But Mr. Seo only cared about you.

817
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:28,658
As you already know, this contract was...

818
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:30,969
To break the contract, you have to pay three times more.

819
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,439
I can sue Mr. Yang...

820
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,500
for forging a document, right?

821
00:50:38,139 --> 00:50:39,980
Let me finish.

822
00:50:40,179 --> 00:50:42,678
No matter the process, we've already put a stamp on it.

823
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:44,609
It's my fault that I couldn't control my staff.

824
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:47,619
We'll proceed with the contract as is.

825
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:51,789
Please be a good model for our kids' products.

826
00:50:57,659 --> 00:51:00,499
We don't have to keep our distance because we'll see each other often.

827
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,929
I don't think we'll necessarily see each other often.

828
00:51:04,969 --> 00:51:07,570
Haven't you read the special provisions on the contract?

829
00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:08,699
"Special provisions?"

830
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,468
"Mr. Seo always has to be present on the shooting of the ads."

831
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:13,279
Well, he doesn't really have to be there.

832
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,939

833
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,479
"after the shoot."

834
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,980
Do you want him to be your driver?

835
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:25,989
If you put those in the contract, I'll do the ads for free.

This alone will help your declining sales.

841
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:40,940
Why do you act so aggressively for a mere 20,000 dollars?

842
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:44,840
How did you know it was for 20,000 dollars?

843
00:51:49,179 --> 00:51:50,549
The contract said...

844
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:53,679
It said 80,000 dollars on the loan contract.

845
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:56,690
You paid the principal of 20,000 dollars for me.

846
00:52:00,989 --> 00:52:02,619
You did remember me?

847
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,328
Wait, Prosecutor Jang.

848
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:12,868
The documents on your desk want your signature.

849
00:52:12,869 --> 00:52:14,138
But where are you heading all by yourself?

850

Well, I'm done today.

851
00:52:16,909 --> 00:52:18,038
I'll take care of them tomorrow.

852
00:52:18,039 --> 00:52:19,509
These documents are evil.

853
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,509
They will make a scene if you don't look at them.

854
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:22,839
I'll take care of them the day after tomorrow.

855

886
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,329
Right.

887
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,429
No. It's nothing.

888
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,630
It's nothing.

889
00:55:34,269 --> 00:55:35,300
Right.

890
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,369
What is it that you wanted to ask me?

891
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,340
Well.

892
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:49,849
I've been looking for this person for a long time.

893
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:53,889
He's an older guy I used to know when we were young.

894
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,460
But I've never heard from him since he went away.

895
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,530
When was this?

896
00:56:00,130 --> 00:56:01,460
When I was seven.

897
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,800
His name was Hyun Woo too.

898

I see.

899
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:16,510
If you were seven, that's a long time ago.

900
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,880
Can I ask why you have been looking for him for so long?

901
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:28,119
Because of the mistake I made,

902
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,190
we had to split up.

903
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,329
So,

904
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,000
I really want to see him.

905
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:50,149
Darn it.

906
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:53,820
Hong Ki's not here when we're short-handed.

907
00:56:53,949 --> 00:56:55,279
He doesn't even pick up his phone.

908
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,948
Hey. Forget about him.

909
00:56:56,949 --> 00:56:58,888
He'll come crawling back when he's hungry.

910
00:56:58,889 --> 00:57:00,759
Anyway, where is the freeloading parasite?

911
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,988
She should be the first to come and help us.

912
00:57:02,989 --> 00:57:06,659
Does she think she's a heroine when it's a hazing?

913
00:57:07,429 --> 00:57:10,499
You said it was a welcoming party. But was it a hazing?

914
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,428
Now it really feels like we have a new family member.

915
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,869
"A family member," my foot.

916
00:57:33,789 --> 00:57:36,089
Hey. Why are you being so slow?

917
00:57:36,090 --> 00:57:37,558
The 3-star and 4-star generals are already here,

918
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:39,428
but you came last...

919
00:57:39,429 --> 00:57:41,658
when you're a private. How rude!

920
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:44,230
I brought someone with me.

921
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:48,269
Come on out.

922
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:52,969
- Who is it? - Surprise!

923
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:55,639
Hey. Where have you been?

924
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,880
He wanted to join the hazing.

925
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:04,988
You can go first.

926
00:58:04,989 --> 00:58:05,989
Okay.

927
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:09,190
I want to report myself.

928
00:58:09,789 --> 00:58:12,489
With shallow tricks, I deceived Big Boss...

929
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,960
as well as Jae Soo, Il Young, Man Ho,

930
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:17,098
Dong Hui and the entire company.

931
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:18,530
I won't make excuses.

932
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:20,340
But...

933
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:24,639
I really want you to know that I'm so sorry.

934
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,538
Hey, punk.

935
00:58:29,539 --> 00:58:31,709
I don't care about the report. I'll break you with my own hands.

936
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:33,549
- Hey. - You're really...

937
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:35,250
- For goodness' sake. - Don't do it.

938
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:37,289
Gosh.

939
00:58:37,789 --> 00:58:38,789
Boss.

940
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:41,489
He turned himself in.

941
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,130
Will you take that into consideration?

942
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:47,129
He can't turn himself in after getting busted.

943
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:49,159
It's too late to say he turned himself in.

944
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,829
How about a letter of apology?

945
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,769
Will you take a letter of apology into consideration?

946
00:58:58,340 --> 00:58:59,570
"A letter of apology?"

947
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:01,239
- That's too much. - "A letter of apology."

948
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:07,820
"A letter of apology?"

949
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,320
Write it down on a paper and turn it in.

950
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:19,489
- Boss. - Pardon?

951
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:23,630
Are you going to forgive me if I hand in the letter of apology?

952
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:28,000
I'll do my best to write one down and turn it in.

953
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:31,570
Can I join the party, then?

954
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:38,909
What?

955
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,179
Thank you, Boss.

956
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,150
Is it my turn now?

957
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:49,219
Hello. You'll probably know me as Ms. Mini.

958
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:52,159
But I'm no longer Ms. Mini. I'm Ko Eun Ha.

959
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,030
I'm 30 years old.

960
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:57,129
I love children. I love children's books.

961
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:58,698
I love snacks too.

962
00:59:58,699 --> 01:00:01,969
Just be brief about it. No one wants to know.

963
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:03,300
- Come on. Let her speak. - I see.

964
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:06,070
Why? I want to know.

965
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:07,579
What do you hate?

966
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:10,210
I hate...

967
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:11,909
fighting,

968
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:13,849
and lying.

969
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,618
I also hate the strong bullying and threatening the weak.

970
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:18,249
Who gave you the goods?

971
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:19,718
Sorry? What goods?

972
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:22,158
The red, yellow, and blue thing you gave out at the club.

973
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:23,659
"Red, yellow, and blue thing? At the club?"

974
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:25,888
Do you think a guy like me, who beats a man to a pulp,

975
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:27,599
won't beat up a woman?

976
01:00:28,699 --> 01:00:30,828
I hate when people don't think of others,

977
01:00:30,829 --> 01:00:32,598
and when they are screaming and swearing.

978
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:33,630
A 50m distance!

979
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:36,269
He must be crazy.

980
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:40,408
Actually, I don't like people drawing on their skins.

981
01:00:40,409 --> 01:00:43,280
Dragon tattoos and others are scary and gross, aren't they?

982
01:00:43,949 --> 01:00:47,179
Honestly, I don't like people calling each other "Boss."

983
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:49,249
It sounds like authoritarianism.

984
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,988
Why do you hate so many things?

985
01:00:50,989 --> 01:00:52,919
Just tell us you don't want to be here.

986
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,419
No. She should say everything she wants to say.

987
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:57,459
It's a democratic society, after all.

988
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:59,090
Then...

989
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:01,928
should I write them down on paper and turn it in too?

990
01:01:01,929 --> 01:01:04,468
Sure. If you can write them down,

991
01:01:04,469 --> 01:01:06,968
- we'll read them around. - Okay.

992
01:01:06,969 --> 01:01:08,239
Boss!

993
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:09,769
Welcome.

994
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,039
- What... - Take a seat already.

995
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:13,369
Move on to part two.

996
01:01:13,409 --> 01:01:15,279
(Cheongju, soju)

997
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,309
Okay.

998
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:19,150
I made these grain wines myself.

999
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:20,880
Cheongju, soju, and takju.

1000
01:01:21,019 --> 01:01:24,150
Choose the one you like and pour it as much as you want.

1001
01:01:24,219 --> 01:01:25,689
Fill the bowl up...

1002
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:27,658
and drink from it.

1003
01:01:27,659 --> 01:01:29,559
Please enjoy it.

1004
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:30,789
Thank you.

1005
01:01:31,659 --> 01:01:33,429
Pour it.

1006
01:01:34,659 --> 01:01:37,569
Hey. We no longer do the drink-from-the-bowl ceremony.

1007
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:39,570
Just help yourselves.

1008
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,899
But we all went through the ceremony.

1009
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,939
- Hong Ki and Dong Hui did it too. - That's right.

1010
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,968
Women and men are equal in democracy, aren't they?

1011
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:47,879
That's right. We all went through it.

1012
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,808
But how do you know what democracy is?

1013
01:01:49,809 --> 01:01:52,448
- Darn it. - I'll drink it.

1014
01:01:52,449 --> 01:01:55,579
I forgot to say, but I love drinking.

1015
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:58,219
I used to be a heavy drinker.

1016
01:01:58,849 --> 01:02:01,590
But it's not fun to drink it as is.

1017
01:02:01,659 --> 01:02:03,460
Should we play a drinking game?

1018
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:06,529
- The 3-word game. - The 3-word game.

1019
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:07,959
- In the morning. - I ate meat.

1020
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,699
- The meat was. - Taken by others.

1021
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:11,099
Who was it?

1022
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,130
- It wasn't me. - Wasn't it you?

1023
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:14,500
I said it wasn't me!

1024
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:17,268
- "I said it wasn't me!" - It's more than three words.

1025
01:02:17,269 --> 01:02:19,138
But I said it wasn't me.

1026
01:02:19,139 --> 01:02:21,839
- Chug. - Chug.

1027
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,340
- Keep going. - Keep going.

1028
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,979
Since we are drunk, let's play the "Love It" game.

1029
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:30,488
- I love it. - I love it.

1030
01:02:30,489 --> 01:02:31,550
Drink.

1031
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:34,190
Let's go!

1032
01:02:35,019 --> 01:02:37,159
Zero, zero, seven, bang!

1033
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:43,659
Why is it always me?

1034
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:54,079
Why am I the only one drinking?

1035
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:02,280
- Why can't he understand me? - Right.

1036
01:03:03,849 --> 01:03:08,059
That tiny rat made me drink...

1037
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:25,170
Eun Ha.

1038
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:28,239
Hey. It's Ji Hwan.

1039
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:31,010
What are you doing out here?

1040
01:03:33,449 --> 01:03:35,948
I wanted some fresh air because I was feeling good.

1041
01:03:35,949 --> 01:03:38,119
I think you drank too much.

1042
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:40,218
Why don't you go to bed now?

1043
01:03:40,219 --> 01:03:43,489
No. What are you talking about? I'm not tipsy at all.

1044
01:03:43,889 --> 01:03:47,090
Take a seat. We have lots of drinks. Have a can.

1045
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:48,929
No.

1046
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:51,630
You can't really drink.

1047
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:54,039
Should we play?

1048
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:56,499
Let's play.

1049
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,968
What do you want to play this time?

1050
01:03:57,969 --> 01:04:01,139
- Eun Ha, it's late now. - Let's play.

1051
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,079
Not like the last time, though.

1052
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:05,678
Eun Ha, it's getting...

1053
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:07,919
Play with me.

1054
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,149
- It's late. - Play with me.

1055
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:12,949
You should go in and sleep.

1056
01:04:17,289 --> 01:04:18,329
Oh, my.

1057
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,730
Your eyeballs...

1058
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:31,940
They are shining brightly.

1059
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:36,579
- What? - Your eyeballs.

1060
01:04:38,449 --> 01:04:43,019
They are shining...

1061
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:18,889
My goodness.

1062
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:59,059
(My Sweet Mobster)

1063
01:05:59,329 --> 01:06:01,259
I thought it was strange when he let a woman...

1064
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:03,658
in the house when he even rejected the yogurt lady.

1065
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:07,268
Should we call her our sister-in-law from now on?

1066
01:06:07,269 --> 01:06:09,368
What? You tiny rat. What are you looking at?

1067
01:06:09,369 --> 01:06:11,010
- You sly fox. - I didn't look at them.

1068
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:14,010
Did you check on the one who's most likely Hyun Woo?

1069
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:16,309
What is the other word for Big Boss?

1070
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,480
(Gangster shoulders)

1071
01:06:18,481 --> 01:06:20,578
Gangster shoulders?

1072
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:21,579
"Gangster."

1073
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:22,849
Yeon Hee went missing?

1074
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,519
Is Ms. Ko Eun Ha really all right?

1075
01:06:26,989 --> 01:06:28,518
The doors are locked.

1076
01:06:28,519 --> 01:06:30,360
Eun Ha, stay with me.

1077
01:06:31,059 --> 01:06:32,090
Help!
