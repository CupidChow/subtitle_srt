or does the issue begin from there?

182
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,370
It begins from there.

183
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:57,940
Then, go apologize and change her mind.

184
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,600
You can't scratch your own back, huh?

185
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,080
You're so good at giving advice, but you don't know what you need to do?

186
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,010
You told me, "Be honest."

187
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,300
You can think about whether you qualify after that.

188
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,480
- Hello.
- Welcome.

189
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,240
This must be new.

190
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,610
Do you have another box of this?
- Yes, we do.

191
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,500
I'll take this.

192
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,000
- Sir.
- Aigoo...

193
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,410
- Hello!
- Long time no see.

194
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:42,310
- Long time no see.
- We have lots of new things.

195
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:45,650
Really? It's been too long.

196
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,740
You have new stickers.

197
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,830
Yes, we have lots. Look around.

198
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,800
This comes in two colors?

199
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,660
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,550

202

210
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,530
I figured it out because I wanted to see you.

- Yes, I'm okay.

213

Don't worry about me. Keep doing your thing.

214
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,690
I'll just buy a couple more things, then.

Okay, I'll carry your bags.

- Yes.

- It looks exactly like a real sky!
- Can't believe that...

275
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:50,930
This must be the field you were talking about.

00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,890
Oh, yes.

Usually, no one is here at this hour.

279
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,110
I thought about what you said about being friends.

280
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:14,150
I don't think I can be friends.

I'm not interested in you anymore.

292

By the way, where did you learn that thing?

The shadows. You were so good at it.

297
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:47,620
When I was little, I used to do it when I was bored.

298
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,350
Kids are so scared of the dark.

299

But no one cried. You were amazing.

300
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:03,600
I had an Oppa who used to play with me when I was young.

301
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,760
Whenever I was sad or lonely, he played with me.

302
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,610
Thanks to him, those days weren't always so lonely.

303
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,800
So I wanted to be someone like that for kids.

304
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:33,400
Eun Ha, is he the reason you started this work?

305
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,830
That's right.

306
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:40,460
Just like how Oppa gave me the strength to live,

307
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,550
I wanted to make memories like that for kids.

308
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,830
Though I have a long way to go.

309
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,440
Let's go.

310
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:02,800
I think he must feel the same way.

311
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,250
Those memories must have

312
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:10,150

00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,780
made him strong,

314
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,370
and helped him survive.

315
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,850
Thanks for saying that.

Okay.

What else can you make with shadows?

320
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,510
Quite a few.

321
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,900
- What about a deer?
- Yeah, a deer...

322
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,500

327
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:18,760
Wow! I turned into a butterfly when I woke up from my sleep!

328
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,470
Friends, the caterpillar that used to crawl on the ground

329
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,770
became a butterfly with pretty wings.

330
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:28,830
That's why you shouldn't judge another friend by their first impression.

331
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:31,870
I hope you can be the kind of friend

332
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:36,760

00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:30,740
I thought there was no more to it. Why aren't you wrapping it up?

542
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,850
While investigating the drug money,

543
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:36,600
we discovered suspicious cash flow from Club Cat.

544
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,340
I think we need to further investigate.

545
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,490
- Money?
- Yes.

546
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:43,180
I think the money we couldn't retrieve from Seo Tae Pyeong

547
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,210
is flowing into Club Cat.

548
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:51,800
Got it. You can go.

549
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,670
Okay.

550

Wow, this is so nice.

Thanks, Dong Hee.

Oh, okay.

565
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:04,340
Oh, you did!

566
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:08,640
I guess you change three times a day. Breakfast, lunch and dinner.

567
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:13,760
We recommend the course menu.

568
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,030
This course starts with a salmon crepe,

569
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:19,500
di mare tomato, followed by sangria and steak.

570
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,310
This course has shrimp arancini...

571
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,380
That's course A?

572
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,910
Yes. It's a good combination.

573
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:28,110
Wait, do you like salmon?

574
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:31,560
If you like salmon, the salmon crepe...

- I'm sorry.

577

That scared me.

578
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:50,990
Since the placemat is here, I'll move slightly over...

579

You were dazzling.

Now that we have proper ads, our profits will go up, right?

If I may say so myself, but when this video hits?

588
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:34,900
It's going to cause a riot. Thanks to Kang Ye Na!

589
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,100
She hasn't changed at all.

Yes. I started one on my own.

Eighty-seven people in a day is amazing! That's not far off from hers.

You've thought of all that before starting, right?

616

Every time things were hard, and I wanted to give up,

I thought of him and kept going.

627

are less than yours.

636

Rather than be jealous that you're modeling for his company,

637
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:40,560
since you're a great model and a great content creator,

638
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,470
it's a good thing for Seo Ji Hwan.

he seems like a good guy the more I see him.

895
01:00:56,530 --> 01:00:58,240
Do you think...

896
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:01,400
do you think, by any chance,

897
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,910
if things work out between him and Sister-in-law,

898
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:07,060
we'll get a prosecutor in our family, right?

899
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:08,780
Hey, damn it.

900
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,410
It feels reassuring.

901
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:16,350
Reassuring? Noona and Ji Hwan are...

902
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:19,800
Geez, seriously.

903
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:30,740
Why was Prosecutor Jang Hyeon Woo here?

904
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:34,530
I was with Dong Hee when we ran into him.

905
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:38,590
Turns out Dong Hee and the Prosecutor know each other.

906
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:42,170
One thing led to another, and we were home...

907
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:46,560
one thing led to another, and we were inside...

908
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:57,550
Did you get all the materials you needed?

909
01:01:57,550 --> 01:01:59,810
No. I didn't.

910
01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:04,050
I think I need to go again with Emperor Penguin.

911
01:02:06,490 --> 01:02:08,940
Okay. Let's go together tomorrow.

912
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:10,460
Okay.

913
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:58,800
Mi Ho.

914
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,630
I was about to call you.

915
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:07,340
I guess I just did.

916
01:03:09,810 --> 01:03:11,700
Have you been drinking?

917
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,110
Yes.

918
01:03:13,110 --> 01:03:15,540
I took a cab. That was good, right?

919
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:20,180
If you're drunk, you should go home. Why are you here?

920
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:22,210
Oh, that's...

921
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:28,540
I got some stuff for you. I didn't know what you like, so...

922
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:31,010
I got fruit, and...

923
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:33,690
Some nuts...

924
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,600
- Supplements.
- What's all this?

925
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:48,100
I forgot to apologize.

926
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:54,920
I'm sorry.

927
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:57,880
But...

928
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:03,020
do you really not like me?

929
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:06,140
Is that why you don't

930
01:04:06,990 --> 01:04:09,480
want to go out with me?

931
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:16,630
I like you, Mi Ho.

932
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,690
Stop right there.

933
01:04:57,050 --> 01:04:58,530
Dad.

934
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:00,200
You.

935
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:06,080
We have to go.

936
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,690
- Hyungnim isn't out yet?
- No.

937
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:10,740
Did Il Yeong come home and then leave, or not come home?

938
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,660
I don't know. I never see him at home these days.

939
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,280
Dong Hee!

940
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:20,670
Have some while you work.

941
01:05:20,670 --> 01:05:23,610
Why just for him? Where's ours?

942
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:27,570
Sister-in-law, this makes us sad. You have some for us, right?

943
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:30,970
- I got everyone the same thing.
- Right?

944
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:32,650
Man Ho, Jae Soo...

945
01:05:32,650 --> 01:05:34,290
That's right.

946
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:35,770
- Hong Gi.
- Thank you!

947
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:39,550
- "Have a great day."
- Let's eat them here.

948
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:41,310
- What?
- We'll spill crumbs all over the car.

949
01:05:41,310 --> 01:05:44,170
- They don't clean.
- Hyungnim, we'll wait outside.

950
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:46,480
- Fighting!
- We'll spill crumbs in the car...

951
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:48,280
Go, go, go.

952
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,420
I can't eat this. It's too precious.

953
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:52,710
- Fighting!
- Thank you for this. Fighting!

954
01:05:52,710 --> 01:05:54,980
Go turn on the car!

955
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:57,790
Wow!

956
01:06:00,930 --> 01:06:02,990
This is yours, Ji Hwan.

957
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:07,270
You get a special heart.

958
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:09,040
Thank you, Eun Ha.

959
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,950
When did you prepare all these?

960
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:15,970
I'll come pick you up when we're done.

961
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:18,530
If anything happens, call me right away.

962
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:20,800
I'll call you first.

963
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,750
- Okay, then.
- Fighting!

964
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,580
Yes, fighting.

965
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:27,060
- Bye.
- Bye.

966
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:29,180
Get some rest. Have a good day at work.

967
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:31,660
Okay, have a good day!

968
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:36,300
- Why is my hand stuck?
- Is there glue?

969
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:38,660
- Bye.
- Okay.

970
01:06:38,660 --> 01:06:41,200
- Okay.
- Bye.

971
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,160
Did you forget something?

972
01:06:45,160 --> 01:06:46,490
I did.

973
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:48,160
What is it?

974
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:53,360
We just opened. Take a cookie. Thank you!

975
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:57,070
We just opened. Take a cookie. Thank you!

976
01:06:58,140 --> 01:07:01,800
Our cafe just opened. Take a cookie. Thank you!

[Dong Hee, let's go! Fighting!]

978
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:12,890
- Have you eaten?
- Yes.

979
01:07:14,590 --> 01:07:18,170
- How's work going these days?
- It's going well.

980
01:07:19,830 --> 01:07:24,160
I heard you and Prosecutor Jang Hyeon Woo know each other.

981
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,650
How do you know him?

982
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:29,420
He helped me a long time ago.

983
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,710
Helped you?

984
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:33,220
Yes.

985
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:38,460
He was looking after me yesterday.

986
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:39,800
It was my fault.

987
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:42,050
It wasn't your fault.

988
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:46,440
You're doing just fine, so don't worry about it.

989
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,550
Okay.

990
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:50,350
Bye.

991
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:52,120
See you later.

992
01:07:55,710 --> 01:07:57,690
Prosecutor.

993
01:07:57,690 --> 01:08:01,010
Prosecutor, have you heard?

994
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:14,580
We just opened. Take a cookie. Thank you!

995
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:18,520
We just opened. Take a cookie. Thank you!

996
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:24,380
We just opened. Take a cookie.

1007

You mean, it's just him and Sister-in-law alone at home.
