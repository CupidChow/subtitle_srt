Miss, you forgot to pay!

9
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:55,289
Right.

10
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,130

Boss. We loaded the car.

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,200
- Right. - Get in.

There have been multiple posts,

22
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,409
complaining about having food poisoning symptoms,

23
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,578
such as diarrhoea and stomachache,

24
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,449
after drinking milk promoted by a kids' content creator...

25
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,510
at the recent Kids Food Festival.

00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:49,979
The controversial creator...

27
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,920
promoted it as a safe and kind milk.

28
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:55,590
You said we could give it to our children!

29
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:01,590
How will you take responsibility for this?

30
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,029
You'll pay if something happens to my kid.

31
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,260
- I'm sorry. - Darn it!

- What are you doing? - Who are you?

37
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:24,610
Save the milk, and throw it to the milk company.

38
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,549

Were you going to wrap me up to send somewhere?

42
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:41,089
The only wrap I know is a lettuce wrap with pork.

43
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,259
I just brought you out before you got roasted.

44
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,728
Why did you bring me out?

45
00:03:44,729 --> 00:03:48,029
You were about to get hit by all the milk cartons in there.

46
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,599
That was why I brought you out.

47
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,240
They'll throw it to me. It's none of your business.

48
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:00,509
I guess you were leaving the hospital. Go ahead.

00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:07,150
What are you going to do inside?

50
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:10,490
Are you going to take all the blame by yourself again?

51
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,589
The actually responsible ones haven't even shown up.

52
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,628
Why are you trying to take all responsibility?

53
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:19,560
They had the milk after watching my video.

54
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,230
I'm also responsible for it.

55
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,779

56
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,649

62
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,209
I trusted them based just on how they looked.

63
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:13,579
It's so stupid that I made the same mistake twice.

64

67
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,869
They were not there to fight.

68
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,269
They were just upset because their children were sick.

69
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,069
Because it was organic milk...

70
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:41,008
Because it was good milk from the milk cows...

71
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:42,550
fed with clean water and good feed,

72
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:44,879
they gave it to their children with confidence.

73
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:48,089
But their children got sick.

74
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:52,689
So, they got upset.

75
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,810
You're hurt too.

77
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:14,749

No, it's all right.

93
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,479
I was just curious.

94
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,849
- Please go in. - Is it really okay?

95
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,619
Yes. I just wanted to check it.

96
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,689
You can go in.

97
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,389
We're sorry.

98
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:13,730

00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,139
Yes, it's Australia!

101
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,969
I'll dry-clean it for you.

102
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,708
No. It won't cost much.

103
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,039
I spoke too loud, didn't I?

104
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,939
I'm sorry. You can go now.

105
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:27,480
Is it Australia? Maybe not.

106
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,410
I'll get going.

Hey, Il Young.

109
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,590

110
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,899

114
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,289
Just tell me.

- How do you... - How do you comfort a woman...

00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:16,590
when she's upset?

117
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:18,529
Do you read minds?

118
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:22,100
I don't have to read minds. It's written on your face.

119
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,769
- Is it written on my face? - Let me tell you one thing.

120
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,398
Usually, people don't care about pain relief patches...

121
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,440
when they're injured.

122
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,340
Rather, you empathize with them and try to understand them.

"Does it hurt?"

124
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:34,110

130
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,529
on the organic milk launched by one company on the 27th,

131
00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:54,569
the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety inspected the company.

132
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,230
The results showed...

133
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,700
some products contained...

134
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,768
Why are you turning it off? It wasn't over.

135
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:01,209
Are you going to watch every news out there about it?

136
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:04,239
- They are about to explain why. - They reponed the package to...

137
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,778
What are you going to do after finding out about everything?

138
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:06,879
Are you going to write an article about it?

00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:10,779

140
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,549

142
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,860
Tell me what's going on with those deers.

143
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,230
What happened?

144
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,329
Did you make up and suddenly become friends?

145
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,959
Why did they drop you off here?

146
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,299
Right, also...

147
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,669
Did he buy the whole pharmacy?

148
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:34,469
He just went a little too far.

149
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,470
What?

150
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,979
Are you taking his side already?

151
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,139
That's not it.

152
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,279
Gosh.

153
00:10:45,049 --> 00:10:47,278
Hey. Let me see it.

154
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,590
Goodness. There's no need. I just twisted my ankle slightly.

155
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,960
Come on. Let me see.

156
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,819
I told you I was fine.

157
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,629
Gosh. Stay still.

158
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,959
Hey. If you only twisted your ankle slightly,

159
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,970
why do you look as if you broke your leg or something?

160
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,399
You didn't...

161
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,898
break your leg.

162
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,269
You just twisted it slightly.

163
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,210
Gosh.

164
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:18,049
Mi Ho. You see,

165
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,750
no one ever played with me until I was seven years old.

166
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:29,960
My mom was always busy, exhausted, and tired.

167
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,129
There were more days I didn't see my dad...

168
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:36,929
than days I did.

169
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,100
Tell me where your husband is! Tell me right now!

170
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:42,710
I don't know where he is either!

171
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,240
I don't know!

172
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:46,539
Stop it!

173
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,048
I don't know where he is either.

174
00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:50,350
I don't know!

175
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,620
On the other hand, to a seven-year-old girl,

176
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,649
her day felt so long.

177
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,220
She kept climbing up the stairs again and again.

178
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:00,960
Then she repeatedly climbed down the stairs.

179
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,559
But time moved ever so slowly for her.

180
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:07,429
Then she met Hyun Woo.

181
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,940
What?

182
00:12:15,669 --> 00:12:16,669
Gosh.

183
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,250
I wanted to be someone like Hyun Woo to other kids.

184
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:26,449
Someone who would tell them...

185
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,590
a pocket with a hole was not a big deal.

186
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:31,388
When their coins fell on the ground,

187
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:32,889
- they could play a coin game. - Odd or even?

188
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:35,288
When there were holes in their socks,

189
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,528
they could use the socks to make earmuffs.

190
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:37,758
I wanted to be someone who could tell them what to do.

191
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,628
- You can't hear a thing, right? - No.

192
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:42,269
If scary guys come to your house again,

193
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,139
put these on. They won't hear them.

194
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:48,110
So creating videos for kids...

195
00:12:48,909 --> 00:12:50,539
brought me joy.

196
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,210
I was thrilled.

197
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:58,379
But I shouldn't have treated it as a thrilling job.

198
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:04,389
The weight of this career was...

199
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:08,960
a lot heavier than I thought.

200
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:12,559
But I didn't know that.

201
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,190
"Are you hurting?"

202
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:37,789
"I'm hurting too."

203
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,620
"Are you upset?"

204
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,090
"I'm upset too."

205
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,830
"Are you hurting?"

206
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,929
"I'm hurting too."

207
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,299
"Are you upset?"

208
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,100
"I'm upset too."

209
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,629
Doctor.

210
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,229
(Accident and Emergency)

211
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,158
- Yes? - The kids from yesterday...

212
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,459
What happened to them? I don't see them here now.

213
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,529
They all went home except for one.

214
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,928
They did?

215
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,769
Luckily, their condition wasn't severe.

216
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,870
(Accident and Emergency)

217
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:44,559
Here.

218
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,570
Will this be safe to drink?

219
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,409
Because you bought it at the hospital,

220
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:03,340
will it be safe to drink?

221
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,610
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

222
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,220
My daughter was your fan.

223
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,259
I don't have a husband.

224
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:30,600
Raising a daughter on my own is tough.

225
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,600
This coin...

226
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,709
helps the flying dish spin...

227
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,878
- smoothly. - Luckily, I can work from home.

228
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,509
So attach it thoroughly.

229
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,750
Sometimes, she distracted me from my work.

230
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,750
So I let her watch online videos.

231
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:49,689
- We only have one more left to go! - At first,

232
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,159
I played videos from another channel.

233
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,389
But she kept asking me to buy toys for her.

234
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,070
Odd or even?

235
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,100
Even.

236
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:05,940
Ta-da. You got it right!

237
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,869
Yes! It's spinning!

238
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,940
Look at it spin!

239
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,279
It's spinning! Look at it spin!

240
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,980
Yes! Nice.

241
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,249
One, two, three.

242
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,850
Ta-da!

243
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,888
It's spinning!

244
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:28,189
Isn't this fascinating? Look at that spin!

245
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,789
We finished!

246
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,700
After I started playing your videos,

247
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,970
she started to play alone.

248
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:42,370
I was grateful to you.

249
00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:49,649
What that man said was true.

250
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:53,980
It was my responsibility to play with my child.

251
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,120
But I pushed my responsibility to you.

252
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,289
I also put the blame on you...

253
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:05,359
when my daughter got sick.

254
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,869
She's my child.

255
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,000
Why did I want to do that to you?

256
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,839
You must have trusted my videos to be safe. I'm sorry.

257
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,109
I should have done a better job.

258
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:26,150
I should have looked into the company more.

259
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,519
"I should have done a better job."

260
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,019
"I should have looked into the company more."

261
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,960
That's what I want to tell myself.

262
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:45,940
Thank you...

263
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,640
for playing...

264
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:52,279
with my daughter.

265
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:21,409
We didn't make her promote it. It was her decision to promote it.

266
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,808
- It was her own decision. - Yes.

267
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:24,778
- Our company had no part in this. - No.

268
00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:25,880
- We don't... - What?

269
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,420
How...

270
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,349
will you take responsibility for this?

271
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,219
Why don't we post an apology video?

272
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,558
- Director Lee. - Yes?

273
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,028
Do you think an apology video will make this go away?

274
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:44,058
Our company got close to being mentioned...

275
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:46,129
in the current affairs sections, not the entertainment section.

276
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,629
The festival agency hasn't made any announcement.

277
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,329
It's a bit odd for us to make an announcement.

278
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,399
We merely made a video about the product.

279
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,399
Hey. Listen to me carefully.

280
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,368
If this had been her first time getting mixed up in a scandal,

281
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:56,740
people wouldn't have blamed her.

282
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:58,639
But this is her second scandal.

283
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,980
So you're partially responsible for getting mixed up in this!

284
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,108
You were the one who got this sponsorship.

285
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:04,950
- Gosh. You... - I'll take a break to repent.

286
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,549
As this is a serious matter, I'll apologize thoroughly too.

287
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:15,960
I'll stop posting videos for the time being too.

288
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,699
- Good work. - Okay.

289
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,399
Should I drive you to your house today?

290
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,400
- Yes, please. - Okay.

291
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:43,049
Have you already finished filming?

292
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,220
I started early in the morning.

293
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,759
I heard you were taking a break.

294
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,459
How did you already...

295
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,828
Don't you know that whatever is discussed in his room...

296
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:52,160
spreads even before you leave the room?

297
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,170
You're stubborn too.

298
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,400
This would've blown over with time.

299
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,298
I didn't think that was a proper way to handle this.

300
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,910
Or maybe, you're not desperate for your job.

301
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:07,409
Eun Ha. You're not going to have anything to do for a while.

302
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,180
Do you want to clean my house?

303
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,180
Clean your house?

304
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,180
I was joking.

305
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:15,920
Didn't that sound like a joke?

306
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,588
No.

307
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:22,789
That sounded more genuine than a confession.

308
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,200

312
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,409
He's the CEO of a company whose employees are ex-convicts.

313
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,839
He rarely attends public events.

314
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,149
There's no picture of him on their website...

315
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,750
or in the articles about the company.

316
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:46,480
He's turned down all the awards from the government.

317
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,519
Is there anything you know about him other than this?

318
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,319
No.

They were discharged after their condition was treated.

325
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:16,809

00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,950
Well, you must be upset.

366
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:37,189
Would I be crossing the line if I asked why you were...

367
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:38,759
taking a break for now?

368
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,430
I no longer have the confidence.

369
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:49,029
Things you started with good intentions...

370
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:52,670
might bring about bad results.

371
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:54,809
Yes, you're right.

372
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:59,210
Because the result is bad, it feels like everything was bad.

373
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:00,808
If the results were good,

374
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:03,250
even the tough times would've been delightful.

375
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:06,920
But results aren't everything for Ms. Mini, right?

376
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,328
Do you even train in counselling or something?

377
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,028
I almost fell for that.

378
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:19,730
Did you also do a background check on me?

379
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,068
Why are you using such a talent to scam people?

380
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,598
You'll pay for it later, you know?

381
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:27,470
Go further, and it might look like I'm really deceiving you.

382
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,439
Listen, Ms. Ko.

383
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,009
You do know about the assault at Club Cat, yes?

384
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,379
How do you know about it?

385
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,880
I called since you were a witness to the incident.

386

(Channel Closed: Play With Mini is closed for the time being.)

387
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,759
Wait. Let me answer it.

388
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,970
Yes, you've called the Prosecutor's Room.

389
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,009
Who are you?

390
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,239

00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:10,950
No.

394
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:13,278
I do watch it occasionally.

395
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,719
- And yet, you don't know me? - Must I know you?

396
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,149
It's natural for people to know me.

397
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,690
I was everywhere on TV.

398
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,759
I came to settle my debt.

This isn't our company.

403
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,618
Opposite this building is Kitty Money's office.

404
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:49,390
Settle your debt over there.

405
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,929
Do you truly not remember me? Eight years ago...

406
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,089
Countless people have borrowed money from me.

407
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,099
Excuse me. I have prior plans.

408
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,200
Look, Mr. Seo.

412
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,680
Oh, a chicken costume.

413
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,650
Isn't there anything else than eating?

414
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:22,048
You're right.

415
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:23,990
Most costume-related works involve eating.

416
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:26,690
Eating is really not my thing.

417
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:29,490
I can do everything other than that, regardless of the day.

418
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,660
Yes. I leave it to you. Bye.

419

Excluding sample tasting events, there are practically no jobs.

I can't get a different part-time job.

Or maybe, you're not desperate for your job.

You're not going to have anything to do for a while.

00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:00,220
No, forget it.

Fine.

I can finally get the picture.

444
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,338
It made me wonder why she uploaded such a thing.

445
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:22,808
So, there was a backstory we didn't know about.

446
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:25,739
Either way, she got deeply involved with Seo Ji Hwan twice.

447
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,640
Those two must be fated.

448
00:28:27,809 --> 00:28:29,980
It's usually called an ill-fated relationship...

449
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:32,119
and not fate.

450
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,979
Why didn't you tell me?

451
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,348
I didn't tell you he wasn't here.

452
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:37,719
I really hate you.

453
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,859
Did you look into it?

454
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,460
There was a reason I returned late.

455
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:43,059

The worker from Thirsty Deer who went AWOL is Jung Yoon Taek.

459
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,499
I investigated, and he had two drug convictions.

460
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,299
This guy belonged to a drug ring in Thailand.

461
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,039
He got a plea bargain by exposing all members of the ring.

462
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,170
And?

463
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,838

00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,049
The candy drugs.

466
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:04,409
Isn't this the drug Lieutenant Yang from the Seoul Police Agency...

467
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,349
has been investigating since last year?

468
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:09,450
A new ring distributed this very drug.

469
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,890
This person, Dawin, is the leader.

470
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:15,829

"Corner?"

472
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,899
It's Jung Yoon Taek.

473
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,629
The only member Jung Yoon Taek didn't disclose...

474
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,640
was Dawin.

475
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:42,189
Did you come empty-handed when it's been ages...

476
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,420
since we last saw each other?

477
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,489

(Mild Caffe Mocha)

479
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:49,058
I brought a total of 120 sticks of coffee.

480
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:50,460
So how am I empty-handed?

481
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:53,430
Really, punk.

482
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:56,328
You should've bought something more sophisticated.

483
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:58,869
But don't we both like instant coffee?

484
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,539
I don't hide my childish appetite.

485
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:04,909
Hold on.

486
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,879
Who's the one acting all clean now after serving time in jail?

487
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,480
Do you not wash yourself?

488
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,720
It's very important in this day and age.

489
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:28,669
Stop trying to drag him into it. He washed his hands off.

490
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:30,369
Let him go.

491
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:35,338
Why are you looking for your guy here? Darn it.

492
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:37,609
Isn't this the very method you always used?

493
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,349
I came knowing you looked into a route to Thailand.

494
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:44,809

00:30:48,619 --> 00:30:49,690
Ji Hwan.

497
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,390
You think you know everything, don't you?

498
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,930
I only need to know what I want to know.

499
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:11,670
Jung Yoon Taek.

500
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:17,309
I came to tell you that...

501
00:31:19,819 --> 00:31:21,619
I will soon take him back.

502
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,170
So this was where you were.

503
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,809
You wouldn't answer your phone.

504
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,609
Have you dropped by Taek's house?

505
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,119
The kid is alone when his grandmother is at work.

506
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:58,960
With how wary he is, he refuses to talk.

507
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:02,529
- He's seven years old, yes? - Yes.

508
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:05,430
It seemed like Taek visited quite often.

509
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,900
There were plenty of daily necessities.

510
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:11,170
The house was thoroughly repaired.

511
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,768
He even cleaned up...

512
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:16,769
when he learned about his younger brother.

513
00:32:19,609 --> 00:32:21,279
I'm sure he's taking good care of him.

514
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,819
Do you think Taek decided to go on his own?

515
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:31,049
I don't know that.

516
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:36,430
I'm sure there were many temptations.

517
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,960
It's so easy to go back on your decisions.

518
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:47,339
If we could all live the way we wanted, we'd all be saints.

519
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:50,210
The fact that we cannot do that is what makes us human.

520
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:54,140
We always change our minds.

521
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,089
Close your eyes and count to ten.

522
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,828
Am I a sack of rice or something?

523
00:33:10,829 --> 00:33:12,559
Why would he pick me up like that?

524
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,299
Is the stain gone?

525
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,779
His shoulders are broad.

526
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:08,320
His arms are long.

527
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,920
Why do I feel a breeze?

528
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:24,269
Come to my house by 10am tomorrow.

529
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:29,969
What?

530
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,808
Why are they all gone?

What?

535
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:40,619
Gosh.

536
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,320
Oh, my.

537
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,130
Is this it?

538
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,440
You really came.

539
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,119
Oh, my.

540
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:16,789
Gosh. Your house is so nice.

541
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:18,320
Oh, my.

542
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,889
You can just come in.

543
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:25,030
- I can just come in? - Yes, just come in.

544
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:28,530
Oh, it's American style.

545
00:35:29,269 --> 00:35:32,030
Gosh. Your house is so nice.

546
00:35:33,139 --> 00:35:34,170
That picture...

547
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:35,869
It's so cool.

548
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:38,570
Is there a second floor too?

549
00:35:39,809 --> 00:35:41,779

550
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,510
Oh, right. Here's a present.

551
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:51,349
Someone might think this is a housewarming party.

552
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,690
The vase is a bit small, right?

553
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,829
I have to leave right away.

554
00:35:56,059 --> 00:35:58,360
This is the bedroom. Inside, there's a bathroom.

555
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,659
That's the walk-in closet, and this is the study.

556
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,328
Study? Okay.

557
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:03,968
I have many clothes in the walk-in closet.

558
00:36:03,969 --> 00:36:05,198
Take clothes that need cleaning to the cleaners.

559
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,468
Okay. Don't worry and go ahead.

560
00:36:06,469 --> 00:36:07,769
The walk-in closet is over there.

561
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:10,739
Okay.

562
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,509
I can understand why you're still at the company.

563
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,550
I didn't know you'd make an opportunity out of a joke.

564
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,348
I told you.

565
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:21,550
It sounded more sincere than a confession.

566
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:23,320
Aren't you running late?

567
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:26,090
- I'll get going. - Have a good shoot.

568
00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:29,130

I'm going to head out. Do you need something?

583
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:11,530

Did anyone call?

587
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:23,009
I want to go out too, but I don't have a coat.

588
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,808
I can only go out with a coat.

589

590
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:27,920

591

It's a creator gathering, so I invited her too.

00:41:59,489 --> 00:42:00,619
Aren't those...

655
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,959
garbage bags in your hands?

00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,989

00:42:05,429 --> 00:42:07,230
Did you clean this place?

658
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:12,199
Yes, I cleaned it.

659
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:15,670
I heard Ye Na would have guests today.

660
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,440
I made it especially clean, so please enjoy yourselves.

661
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,039
I'll go.

662

00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:31,690

I came to pick up my coat.

668
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:49,610
I didn't come with other intentions.

669
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:52,010
I came to pick up my coat.

670
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,209
Have you been well?

671
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:55,440
I'm here for my coat.

672
00:42:56,349 --> 00:42:57,380
My coat...

673
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,380
Take your pay for the day.

674
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,090
Right.

675
00:43:04,989 --> 00:43:06,460
I almost forgot.

676
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,329
- Gosh. - Here.

677
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,170
Thanks.

678
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,409
(1,000 dollars)

679
00:43:23,969 --> 00:43:25,209
This is 1,000 dollars.

680
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,538
It seemed like you needed money,

681
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:27,909
so I thought I'd be generous.

682
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:30,849
Well...

683
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,949
It's true that I need money,

684
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:36,849
but this is too much.

685
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,448
I don't have any money on me,

686
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,759
so can I give some back when I get home?

687
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,959
Why aren't you saying anything...

688
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,190
when you know I invited them here on purpose?

689
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:45,288
- What? - You need to show a reaction...

690
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,860
for me to find this fun.

691
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:55,769
It wasn't even subtle, so I had nothing to say.

692
00:43:56,769 --> 00:43:59,809
I don't think I wronged you in a way to warrant this kind of hate.

693
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,309
I'm sick of it, that's all.

694
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,980
I hate that people like you make this job look like a joke.

695
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:14,820
I got into this line of work hoping it would seem light and fun.

696
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:19,030
I wanted children to play along easily.

697
00:44:20,059 --> 00:44:21,199
Maybe I succeeded in that sense.

698
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:24,300
I'll make sure to wire you some money back.

699
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,039
I'll get going.

700
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:33,010
- Mr. Seo? - What the...

701
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:35,179
What on earth?

702
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:39,209
- Are you here to see me? - Not really.

703
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:40,618
How did you know where I live?

704
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:42,119
Did you contact my agency?

705
00:44:45,889 --> 00:44:48,059
Are the two of you not on good terms?

706
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,789
I'll get going.

707
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:56,099
Where are you going when you just got here?

708
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,468
- You should head inside. - Mr. Seo.

709
00:45:00,469 --> 00:45:01,539
But...

710
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,719
Sir, it's me.

711
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,320
- You're here. - Hey.

712
00:45:16,849 --> 00:45:19,959
What should I have today?

713
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,320
Rolled omelet, spicy stir-fried pork...

714
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:30,469
- A table for two? - No, it's just me today.

715
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,869
What?

716
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,239
Why on earth are you here?

717
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,780
Weren't you at Ye Na's place?

718
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,650
Let me see.

719
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,960
- But... - I'll have a soda, thanks.

720
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,698
You're having soda at a tent bar?

721
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:03,070
I can't... I mean, I don't drink.

722
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:05,599
I see you can't hold your liquor.

723
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,598
Weren't you holding a beer bottle that one time?

724
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,510
Anyway, is this where you're going to sit?

725
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,480
There aren't any empty tables.

726
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:19,250
Well...

727
00:46:19,449 --> 00:46:20,820
Allow me.

728
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,159
Why didn't you go home...

729
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:29,459
and come here at this late hour?

730
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,529
How is it late when it's only 8pm?

731
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:32,928
- The night's still young. - Gosh.

732
00:46:32,929 --> 00:46:33,960
Allow me.

733
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:37,929
Thank you.

734
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,469
Do you also like Ye Na?

735
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,009
My gosh.

736
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,840
Oh, dear.

737
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,949
Are you all right?

738
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,090
I only asked because even I would be interested in her.

739
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:03,529
She's pretty, smart, popular,

740
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,460
and has an average of 100,000 likes.

741
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:07,199
Gosh.

742
00:47:08,429 --> 00:47:10,369
I didn't hit like on her channel.

743
00:47:11,769 --> 00:47:13,340
Don't you watch videos for kids?

744
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,038
What do you watch, then?

745
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:16,510
Are there channels you've subscribed to?

746
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,779
There's one.

747
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:24,079
Which one is it? One about mixed martial arts?

748
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,590
No.

749
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,489
Anyway, it's no longer active.

750
00:48:18,269 --> 00:48:21,098
You must be busy being a prosecutor.

751
00:48:21,099 --> 00:48:22,440
Sorry? Oh, right.

752
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:25,339
I actually came from work, so I have to head back in.

753
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:28,578
Prosecutors don't earn a lot of money.

754
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:30,709
We don't get paid as much as we work, but there's honour.

755
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:32,078
I take it you own a house, though.

756
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,319
Yes, I need one if I'm to sleep and have a life.

757
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,349
Is it in your name?

758
00:48:36,949 --> 00:48:38,989
Where is it? In Gangnam?

759
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:40,218
I'm sorry,

760
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:42,118
but interrogations are what I do most of the time,

761
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:45,230
so a conversation is what I want outside the office.

762
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,559
Not something that mimics an interrogation.

763
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,329
We're not here as suspects.

764
00:48:54,469 --> 00:48:57,110
When did it start to rain?

765
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:02,710
Didn't you bring your car?

766
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:06,719
I work nearby, so...

767
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,619
I'll get going, then.

768
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:15,389
I'm the one rejecting you.

769
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:28,599
Darn.

770
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:30,210
Take this.

771
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,710
It's all right.

772
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:34,138
Take it. You'll catch a cold if you get soaked in the rain.

773
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:35,179
I have another one.

774
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:38,949
- I see. Then... - Go ahead.

775
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:40,179
Thank you.

776
00:50:02,539 --> 00:50:04,739
("Play With Mini")

777
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:27,960
I'll get to see her tomorrow.

778
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:51,989
Why don't I...

779
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:54,389
let you in on a secret.

780
00:50:58,329 --> 00:51:00,500
I hate thugs and mobsters.

781
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,429
They'd come by...

782
00:51:04,869 --> 00:51:07,469
and always leave something broken in their wake.

783
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,238
One time it was glass,

784
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:12,110
and one time it was my piggy bank.

785
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,510
Did you know...

786
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:18,079
that something broken...

787
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,050
can never be mended?

788
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,719
All you can do is sweep up the broken pieces.

789
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:32,860
I'm sorry about that.

790
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,658
Why would you be sorry?

791
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:37,269
Were you at my house when I was young?

792
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:40,269
Were you really a mobster though?

793
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,039
Why do you want to know?

794
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:49,440
I would've liked it if you weren't.

795
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:09,130
I would've liked that...

796
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:13,239
as well.

797
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:33,288
I'm too drunk to walk.

798
00:52:33,289 --> 00:52:36,090
Why did I stuff myself? I feel queasy.

799
00:52:36,489 --> 00:52:38,089
Darn.

800
00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:39,460
Where do you live?

801
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:42,400
I live far from here.

802
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:45,828
It's way over there...

803
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,940
across the street and...

804
00:52:48,769 --> 00:52:50,840
And now I... My gosh!

805
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,050
Shall we?

806
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:01,880
Isn't that how it's supposed to go?

807
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,590
Can you please wake up?

808
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:06,759
Don't tell me a single drink knocked you out.

809
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,590
Walk on your own two feet.

810
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:10,658
Talk about being a lightweight.

811
00:53:10,659 --> 00:53:12,659
I would've liked it if you weren't.

812
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:22,569
Just a second. Try walking properly.

813
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:24,639
Hold on. Just a second.

814
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:25,940
Oh, no.

815
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:28,639
He's literally twice my size.

816
00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:31,079
Wait. I should call a taxi.

817
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:34,949
We're...

818
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:36,889
No. This is no good.

819
00:53:37,719 --> 00:53:38,949
It's dangerous.

820
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:54,400
Wait. Where did he go?

821
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,869
What?

822
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,538
Mr. Seo.

823
00:53:57,539 --> 00:53:59,610
Where is he? Mr. Seo.

824
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:01,539
Where did he go?

825
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,750
Mr. Seo.

826
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,150
Mr. Seo Ji Hwan. Where are you?

827
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,119
Do you hear me?

828
00:54:12,989 --> 00:54:14,260
Mr. Seo.

829
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:16,019
Where on earth is he?

830
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:30,038
Are you ready?

831
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:31,210
Mr. Seo.

832
00:54:34,539 --> 00:54:36,239
Okay. Landing.

833
00:54:36,409 --> 00:54:37,510
Mr. Seo.

834
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,280
I mean... What is this?

835
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,989
Wait, you are Ms. Mini!

836
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,260
What are you doing here?

837
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,119
Why did you take off your shoes?

838
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,760
- This one. - Gosh.

839
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:56,899
Actually, I spin this really fast.

840
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,099
Right.

841
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:02,070
Yes. It's a roundabout, so it spins well.

842
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,609
I called a cab. It's getting late. Let's go home.

843
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:05,769
- Hurry. - No.

844
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,479
- Let's go. Try it once. - What?

845
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,110
Here. It's safe here.

846
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:13,380
Look.

847
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,519
I'll give you a safe ride.

848
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:20,389
Mr. Seo.

849
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,320
Okay.

850
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,530
Ms. Mini, how is it? Do you like it?

851
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:31,299
- I'll get off now. - Why?

852
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:33,029
I feel like throwing up because I'm drunk.

853
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:34,069
Okay.

854
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,400
- I really feel like throwing up. - Here.

855
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,069
- Ms. Mini. - Yes.

856
00:55:39,070 --> 00:55:40,639
- Are you all right? - Yes.

857
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,308
Let's go home now.

858
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:44,979
No, Ms. Mini. Hold your vomit for now.

859
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:46,819
- I want to throw up. - Okay. Ms. Mini.

860
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,049
There are so many things to play with.

861
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:49,349
Should we try the slide?

862
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:50,718
Follow me.

863
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:51,820
Hold on.

864
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,690
Aren't you going to go home?

865
00:55:53,889 --> 00:55:56,389
One, two, three.

866
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,260
My shoes are off. Here I come!

867
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,530
Okay. Mission complete.

868
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:04,570
Goodness.

869
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:07,738
Gosh. One drink has changed him completely.

870
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:10,670
Transformation. Earth Defence Force, Flashman!

871
00:56:14,179 --> 00:56:15,439
Mr. Seo.

872
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,480
My neck.

873
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,309
Gosh. Are you all right?

874
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,980
Let's go home now.

875
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,879
- What? - We have to defeat the bad guys.

876
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,590
- What? - Go. Transform!

877
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:26,690
Okay.

878
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,320
It's slippery.

879
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:38,769
- Hurry up. - Okay. I'm coming.

880
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:42,599
Hurry up.

881
00:56:42,969 --> 00:56:44,670
- I'm exhausted. - Hey.

882
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,539
Okay. Ms. Mini.

883
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,980
- Yes. - Get on.

884
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,650
- Gosh. It's been a while. - Be careful.

885
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:01,019
- Gosh. - Is it fun?

886
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:02,518
I'll ride it myself.

887
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:03,529
- Will you? - Yes.

888
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:04,630
In that case...

889
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,729
Are you all right?

890
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:12,070
I'm fine.

891
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:14,969
I need to take a rest.

892
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:18,340
Good gracious.

893
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:30,949
Hyun Woo, can you do this?

894
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:33,118
I can stand on it to ride it.

895
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:35,460
Hey. It's dangerous.

896
00:57:47,469 --> 00:57:48,469
Mr. Seo.

897
00:57:49,539 --> 00:57:50,539
Yes?

898
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:54,309
Can you do this?

899
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,880
One, two, three.

900
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,050
I can ride it standing. Look.

901
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:03,320
It's been a while.

902
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:05,320
So, it's a bit scary.

903
00:58:06,619 --> 00:58:08,659
- Yes. - Be careful.

904
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:15,360
Gosh. It's high.

905
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,510
You're good.

906
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,320
Now, you're sitting. Good job.

907
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:41,019
Yes. I'm good.

908
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:43,190
"Good job."

909
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:49,159
No one has said that to me.

910
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:53,840
I'm bad with chopsticks.

911
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:55,570
I'm a bad cook too.

912
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,010
I'm not even good at studying.

913
00:59:00,909 --> 00:59:02,308
Since I'm not good at anything,

914
00:59:02,309 --> 00:59:04,480
I thought I should do what I enjoyed.

915
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:09,380
I have to be good at what I enjoy to continue doing it.

916
00:59:12,989 --> 00:59:14,119
That's not true.

917
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:17,530
You are good at so many things.

918
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:21,099
You're good at making bubbles.

919
00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:24,000
You're good at drinking too.

920
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,670
How did you know I was good at making bubbles?

921
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:36,610
Did you see other videos too?

922
00:59:37,809 --> 00:59:39,479
- Ms. Mini. - Did you see others too?

923
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,650
You said you don't watch videos for kids.

924
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:44,618
Can you hear me? Let's hurry and move on.

925
00:59:44,619 --> 00:59:47,159
- Hurry up. - You saw them.

926
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,919
- Where are you going now? - Hurry up.

927
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,759
Are you going to try all the rides here?

928
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,760
Hurry up!

929
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:53,960
Gosh.

930
00:59:53,961 --> 00:59:56,329
- Alley-oop. - Oh, dear.

931
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,129
Alley-oop.

932
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:59,269
Isn't it fun?

933
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:06,239
Wait, Mr. Seo.

934
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,949
It's so much fun. This is a fun moment.

935
01:00:21,219 --> 01:00:22,360
Stop right there.

936
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,269
That was a blast.

937
01:00:38,039 --> 01:00:39,739
That was a blast.

938
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:42,380
It was fun, wasn't it?

939
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:44,679
"It was fun, wasn't it?"

940
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:46,679
I feel a bit better now.

941
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,550
"I feel a bit better now."

942
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:53,590
It's been so long since I played like this.

943
01:00:53,889 --> 01:00:56,219
"It's been so long since I played like this."

944
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:59,260
Why are you mimicking me?

945
01:00:59,429 --> 01:01:00,598
What? Am I?

946
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:02,529
You mimicked me just now.

947
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:03,559
When did I?

948
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:04,869
Whatever.

949
01:01:06,969 --> 01:01:09,699
Look. An airplane is passing by.

950
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:15,780
Gosh.

951
01:01:20,619 --> 01:01:22,849
They must be happy up there,

952
01:01:24,219 --> 01:01:26,090
looking down on us over the clouds.

953
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:34,429
How about the person over here?

954
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,329
Is she happy?

955
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,440
Well...

956
01:01:46,739 --> 01:01:47,980
I'm a little bit happy now.

957
01:01:57,590 --> 01:01:59,090
Keep doing the videos.

958
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:01,760
What?

959
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:03,159
The videos.

960
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:06,289
Don't stop making them.

961
01:02:07,659 --> 01:02:08,699
Oh, that...

962
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,269
Are you talking about "Play With Mini?"

963
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:15,570
Didn't I tell you I'm taking time to repent?

964
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:18,869
Keep making them even when you're taking time to repent.

965
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:24,949
How can I do that when I'm repenting?

966
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:34,889
What should I do?

967
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:37,989
Why?

968
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:40,230
I...

969
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,760
I...

970
01:02:47,969 --> 01:02:49,199
I want to see them.

971
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:16,099
(Thanks to Oh Na Ra and Wang Ji Won for their special appearances.)

972
01:03:34,849 --> 01:03:37,489
(My Sweet Mobster)

973
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:38,819
Why did I do that?

974
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:39,888
Darn it.

975
01:03:39,889 --> 01:03:41,090
Was the drink drugged?

976
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:43,319
Did you get home safely yesterday?

977
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:44,360
Goodness!

978
01:03:45,159 --> 01:03:46,860
Is your name really Jang Hyun Woo?

979
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,558
Are you firing me?

980
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:50,198
Her contract was terminated today.

981
01:03:50,199 --> 01:03:52,500
If it's all right with you,

982
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:54,340
- do you want some ramyeon? - What?

983
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:56,969
Did you sleep with her?

984
01:03:57,239 --> 01:03:58,570
What? You tiny witch.

985
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:01,710
Aren't you scared of Seo Ji Hwan?

986
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,578
Why don't we get some help from someone...

987
01:04:05,579 --> 01:04:06,710
who is good with kids?

988
01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:08,980
Can I help you with anything?
