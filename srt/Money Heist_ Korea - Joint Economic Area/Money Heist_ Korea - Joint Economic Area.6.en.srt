[soft guitar music playing]

00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,431
[Tokyo] I found out later
that the Professor

3
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:17,475
was actually a real professor
until a few years ago.

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:21,104
His main topic of research was
the economic impacts of reunification.

5
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:24,232
Tell me, why are we living
in a divided country?

6
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,026
What has kept us separate

7
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:29,070
for more than 70 years?

8
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,907
It's complicated involving
political, cultural, and economic factors.

9
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:36,995
To find answers,
we originally developed a spiral model.

10
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,247
However, it clearly has its limitations.

11
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,000
Let me share my theory.

12
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:46,046
Reunification is bound
to transpire immediately

13
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:50,383
as long as both countries
can share the same dream.

14
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,677
So what should that dream be?

15
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:55,889
A peace on the Peninsula?
A cultural consensus?

16
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,018
It has to be desire.

17
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:04,731
A desire to make
both South Korea and North Korea…

18
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:07,817
wealthy.

19
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,361

Where are we going?
Where are you taking me?

23
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:23,208
I'd like to introduce you to someone
who can turn your ideas into reality.

24
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,556
Thank you for coming all the way out here.
I'm Oh Jaeyun.

25
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,560
Of course, sir.
I'm well aware of who you are.

26
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,855
Well then, I suppose
I'll leave you two alone to talk.

27
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,779
[Jaeyun] Have you been here before?

28
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:57,033
[clears throat] Uh, no. First time.

29
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,035
What do you think?

30
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,539
Don't you think this place
is more inefficient rather than tragic?

31
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,418
Sir, can I ask why you wanted to see me?

32
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,671
Well, it's still highly classified,

33
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,885
but North Korea is planning to implement
a full open-door policy.

34
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,638
But for economic development,
two things are required.

35
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:19,848
Capital and a plan.

36
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,393
Our group will provide capital
and you, Professor,

37
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,979
will develop an economic cooperation plan.

38
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:29,107
Your work will be key
for the reunification of the Peninsula.

39
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,485
What do you say?
Will you join us, Professor?

to become Oppenheimer.

43
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,043
You may be asking yourself,
"Who is Oppenheimer?"

44
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,213
He's the scientist
who developed the first atomic bomb.

without even telling me?

165
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:59,825
Your misjudgment and lack of foresight
killed one of our agents!

166
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,787
-[sighs]
-I have nothing to say.

167
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,457
Oh really? So you don't have anything
to say to Agent Park's family either?

168
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,541
[inhales deeply]

169
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,836
[exhales]

170
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,214
[sighs loudly]

171
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:17,885
Why did you do this?
I thought we were a team.

172
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,355
[dramatic whoosh]

173
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,860
You think they targeted me?

174
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:39,657
So then,

175
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,951
do you still suspect me?

176
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,703
If you were really a spy,

177
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:47,081
you wouldn't have such fury in your eyes
as you tried to chase him down.

178
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,791
[sighs]

179
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,294
Captain, I understand the situation
left you with no other choice.

180
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,589
But from now on,
the two of us have to trust each other.

181
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,675
I understand.

182
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,761
I hoped to spend
my last days at work at ease--

183
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,013
Oh, you're back.

184
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,683
-I was briefly on the overall updates.
-Uh, let me--

185
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,768
First, let's solve
the matters at hand. Okay?

186
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,478
[exhales]

187
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:13,315
The suspects are trying to conceal
Agent Park's death.

188
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,650
Why would they do that?

189
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,776
[Chief] Isn't that obvious?

190
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,863
If his death is confirmed,
they would be admitting they're murderers.

191
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,865
They could've revealed
he's a police officer.

192
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,117
But hours have passed,
and there's no reaction.

193
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,493
That's why this is so strange.

194
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,079
In a standard armed robbery case,

195
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,416
there are almost always bound to be
a few deaths in a hostage situation.

196
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:33,794
And they had all the more reason to not
hesitate since he was an undercover agent.

197
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,839
And it would show they're willing
to go all the way if the plan goes awry.

198
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:40,342
Yes, but it's not just any bank.
They've taken over the Mint.

199
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:42,011
A major national facility.

200
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,053
And what's happened?

201
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,390
Multiple days have passed
without any casualties.

202
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,559
And how did they respond
when the Director got shot?

203
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,811
They let a medical team come in
to save him.

204
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:54,273
Are they trying to act like
some kind of Robin Hoods or something?

205
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,483
Well, maybe.

206
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,859
We know one thing for sure.

207
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,237
It's that they really care a lot
about public opinion.

208
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,783
[tense music playing]

209
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,664
We have two cards hidden up our sleeve.

210
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,000
One is to stir up public opinion.

211
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,585
[Chief] What's the other one?

212
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,462
[Woojin] We now know that.

213
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,131
The Professor isn't in the Mint

214
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:24,053
so we need to use both cards to reclaim
the upper hand in our negotiations.

215
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,096
Okay, but how?

216
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:31,477
I need to go into the Mint myself.

217
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:37,775
[Chief] What should we do
about the press out there?

218
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,360
They're holding their ground.

219
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:42,112
[Woojin] Tell them we'll have
a briefing in two hours.

220
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,657
And from now on,
let's have three briefings a day,

221
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,200
all of them on a schedule.

222
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:47,993
[Chief] That seems
a little excessive though.

223
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:51,330
[Woojin] If we stick to the basics
and give them the information as needed,

224
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,041
the public is gonna finally realize

225
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,919
that they shouldn't
target their anger at us

226
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,547
but at the Mint.

227
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,093
[grunts]

228
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,721
[breathing heavily]

229
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,266
-[Denver] Ah shit. Ow!
-Ahh! Toughen up, crybaby.

230
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,893
-[laughs]
-That's enough. Come on, stop! [groans]

231
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,020
Aren't you supposed to be
an expert at fighting?

232
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,898
-Hey, that attack was out of nowhere.
-[laughs]

233
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:21,861
This wouldn't have happened if you had
really been monitoring, you lil' shit.

234
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,572
[chuckles] Yeah. My bad.
You're all set now.

235
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,741
[sighs] Forget it.

236
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,536
What's this on your forehead?
Is it cracked or something?

237
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,872
-Right here.
-Hmm? [screams]

238
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,623
-[laughs]
-That hurts! Stop it!

239
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,167
Now I'm the one
who got attacked out of the blue.

240
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,169
Well, it wasn't me. [laughs]

241
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,504
-Ah shit.
-[phone ringing]

242
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,630
-Huh?
-Huh?

243
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,717
[ringing continues]

244
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,476
Hey, boss. What's up?

245
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,313
What are you doing up here?

246
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,941
Why do you look so bummed out?

247
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,360
Tokyo?

248
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,654
This is not your fault.

249
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,741
It was that asshole cop
who put the hostages in danger.

250
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,619
You think so?

251
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,997
I'm not sure.

252
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,540
[sighs

253
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,251
Come on, I'm trying to cheer you up.

254
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:21,587
You can at least pretend
to play along. Hmm?

255
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,009
Oh, here you are.

256
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,719
The Professor called.

257
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:31,013
The car. Did he take care of it?

258
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,475
Mm-hmm. Turns out Tokyo was right.

259
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:35,893
Oh good.

260
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:38,646
Lucky you knew
those car dealers were shady as fuck.

261
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,357
We would've all been totally fucked
if it weren't for you.

262
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,483
Am I right?

263
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,656
And the way you handled the situation
with Misun.

264
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,866
There's a reason the Professor trusts you.

265
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,243
Now, come on.

266
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,539
[chuckles]

267
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,876
Stand tall.

268
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:08,592
[sighs]

269
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,764
If I hadn't stepped up,

270
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:17,017
Tokyo would be dead and
the violence wouldn't have ended there.

271
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:21,105
[sighs] You're right.
I was thinking about it…

272
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,359
I think that Berlin
should be in charge again.

273
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,112
[Rio] What? But what if
something bad happens again…

274
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:32,074
All this happened under my watch
and I know it's my fault.

275
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,284
Maybe Berlin was right.

276
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,037
Instilling fear in the hostages
might be the best way

277
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,498
to keep them under control.

278
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,458
Berlin, what do you think?

279
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,544
[breathes deeply]

280
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,551
I don't really know if I agree.

281
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,303
There's that old saying,
"Don't change horses midstream."

282
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,764
And if she gets the ax
for a mistake like this,

283
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,933
I probably should've gotten
chopped up long ago.

284
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,269
Are you sure?

285
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,604
[Berlin] Professor, I only want one thing.

286
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,606
For our plan to succeed,

287
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,735
whether it's through superficial peace
or blood-curdling fear,

288
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,278
I don't really care how it gets done.

289
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:13,657
We walk out from the Mint alive
with a handsome load of cash in our hands.

290
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,908
That's all thatI want.

291
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,459
[contemplative music playing]

292
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,085
[phone ringing]

293
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:35,512
-[Rio] Professor?
-Put me through, for now.

294
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,604
[Woojin on phone]
What was all that gunfire?

295
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,897
It was just shooting practice.

296
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:48,442
Why is he hiding it?
It was all in self-defense.

297
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,195
[Woojin] Please don't tell me
you've killed anyone?

298
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,448
I told you before.
We do not intend to hurt the hostages.

299
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:56,992
But I'm guessing
that didn't go as planned?

300
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,120
It's chaos outside the Mint right now,

301
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:03,499
from the hostages' families
pleading for us to check if they're alive

302
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,460
to the public demanding
that we take forceful action.

303
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,880
Have you seen the news?

304
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,632
We practiced shooting
because we got bored.

305
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,300
It's suffocating in here, you know?

306
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,512
Is that so? You really didn't kill anyone?

307
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,766
Why? You want me to put every hostage
on the line to check in?

308
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:23,519
Or maybe just a video message?

309
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,978
I'll just go in myself.

310
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,897
That way, I can be sure.

311
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:28,774
[Professor scoffs]

312
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,820
I'm sure you know
that I just can't allow that.

313
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,990
You can't calm the public outrage.
It's already reaching its breaking point.

314
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,159
Soon we'll both be in a tight spot.

315
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:43,247
And I can't guarantee the food deliveries
as a promise anymore.

316
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,921
I guess there's no choice. But…

317
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,842
no playing games like last time. Okay?

318
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,886
Of course. I'll go in by myself.

319
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:00,222
But let me bring
a camera inside to broadcast live.

320
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,141
Because if you're the type
to keep your word,

321
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:04,059
then the public should know that too.

322
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,020
If you refuse, we have no choice
but to do a press release

323
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,689
for the reporters waiting outside.

324
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:13,152
We'll tell them you refused
to confirm who's alive in there.

325
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,950
And at noon, when the supplies come,

326
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,369
-I'll let you enter the Mint.
-[disconnects call]

327
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,414
[Tokyo] Inspector Seon Woojin
fully grasped our situation

328
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,958
And that the reason
that we were so adamant

329
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,294
about the safety of the hostages

330
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,462
was how the public would view us.

331
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:36,175
And once we were completely cornered,

332
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:40,554
she decided that it was time to stab us
with the knife of public opinion.

333
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,811
[sighs, tsks]

334
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:52,441
[clatters]

335
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,406
Guys, come on, it's simple.
We just line all of them up in a row,

336
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:02,201
let her see them,
and then send her right back outside.

337
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,662
No, we should let her check
the hostages one by one.

338
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,748
We need to be prepared
for anything unexpected.

339
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,750
At least time is already
on our side anyway.

340
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,668
Why didn't you just ignore her request?

341
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,671
I didn't want anyone to die
because of how we'll look to the public.

342
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:19,176
Having them on our side
is the important last piece of the puzzle.

343
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,011
And if the public starts to believe

344
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,847
that we're homicidal maniacs
or even reactionaries--

345
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,307
They'll storm in armed.

346
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:28,393
There's nothing to be scared about.
All the hostages are safe and alive.

347
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:31,772
Yeah, but what if they find out that we've
been printing money during the check?

348
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,941
We need to make sure no one talks.

349
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,068
[Professor] Right.
About what we're doing in the Mint,

350
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,444
or what happened to Park Chulwoo.

351
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,072
We can't risk a leak
of any information whatsoever.

352
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,368
So be well-prepared for the hostage check.

353
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,203
-[cameras clicking]
-Hello. Welcome, everyone.

354
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,622
The Task Force decided
to hold this press briefing

355
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:52,834
to calm the worries of the families
of the hostages and the general public.

356
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:57,339
First of all, regarding the gunfire
that was heard this afternoon,

357
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,174
the suspects confirmed and reiterated

358
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,343
that they are committed
to their initial stance

359
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,762
on keeping all of the hostages
that are inside the Mint safe.

360
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,597
You're saying there aren't any casualties?

361
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,890
How can we really trust them?

362
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,351
In response, the Task force

363
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:13,188
insisted that we need to confirm
the safety of the hostages in person.

364
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,481
They accepted our terms.

365
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,984
And as a result of this negotiation,

366
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,069
Task Force leader Seon Woojin,

367
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:22,072
will personally go inside the Mint
with a camera

368
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:25,367
and will be capturing a live broadcast
you can view.

369
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:28,120
-That will be all.

You know what? Don't worry.

00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,186
If anything happens,
I'll take care of it. Okay?

380
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,822
That's hard to believe, right?

381
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,741
So do your best.

382
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:08,994
Because I believe in you.

383
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,877

00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,091
Get the hostages to the lobby.

387
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:25,093
Uh-huh.

388
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,388
[Helsinki] Come on. Get up right now!

Ah shit. Just fuck off!

391

They want everyone. Get up now.

392
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:39,900
What? Do they want to gather all
the traitors for some kangaroo court, huh?

393
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,026
I'm not going!

394
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,070
No, it didn't seem like that.

395
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,489
-But suit yourself.
-Hey.

396
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:49,326
If you hadn't set out to evacuate
the hostages at that exact moment,

397
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,912
we would probably be home
in our beds by now.

I'm regretting it too.

00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:57,417
If I had stopped him myself,
that police officer would still be alive.

At noon today, a police officer
is going to enter the Mint

427
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,315
to check if all the hostages are safe.

428
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:46,318
Your families are very worried
after hearing the gunshot.

429
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:50,280
So we've made an exception.
I'm asking you all for your cooperation.

430
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,616
And what happens to the dead policeman?

Anne.

432
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,998
Shouldn't you at least
give them his dead body?

433
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,210
[Berlin] What dead body?

434
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,878
Did something happen?

435
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,798
All we did was have
a little shooting practice.

436
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,885
-My director friend.
-Yeah.

437
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,553
Do you know anything?

438
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,597
Uh, not really.

439
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,640
[Berlin] That's right.

440
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:19,476
Can I say a few words to all of you?

441
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:25,732
It may be a little late,
but let me introduce myself.

442
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,527
My real name is Song Jungho.

443
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,903
I'm 41 years old.

444
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,781
Born in Taechon, Pyongan-do.

445
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,408
I got caught escaping North Korea
when I was nine,

446
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,994
and spent 25 years in a prison camp.

447
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,789
I won't go into details
about how I got out of there.

448
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,544
But now that everyone in this Mint
knows my real identity,

449
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,505
there's a much higher chance
I'll get caught

450
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,258
even if I manage to get out of this place.

451
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,679
This is not just a punishment for myself
for threatening you this whole time.

452
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:58,890
It's a warning.

453
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:05,689
My colleagues are gonna continue

454
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,149
in their efforts to try
and treat you all humanely.

455
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,026
But for me, I've got nothing to lose now.

456
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,988
So I expect you all to be
on your best behavior.

457
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,579
[Tokyo] There will be a camera in here.

458
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:24,249
Your families haven't seen you
in a while, so everyone better go wash up.

459
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,752
Move. Come on.

460
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,684
Uh, the line for the men's room
isn't this long,

461
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,811
so those of you in the back,
come this way.

462
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,191
I need to talk to you. Come with me.

463
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,448
[sighs]

464
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,246
-[Anne] What do we do?
-What do you mean?

465
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,706
They said the police are coming in.

466
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,583
-We've gotta do something.
-[sighs]

467
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,502
We can't just stay silent
when a person died. They need to know!

468
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,297
They warned us about this.

469
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:15,967
If we do anything to irritate them,
things will only get worse.

470
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,762
[sighs] I mean…

471
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,513
[Youngmin] It's okay
if we don't get caught.

472
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:25,769
What do you mean?

473
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,065
We can secretly pass them a note.

474
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,193
Tell them about the dead cop, the number
of bank robbers, what they look like

475
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,403
and that they're in here printing
brand-new money.

476
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,990
And if we get caught? You think they're
gonna tolerate another stunt like this?

477
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,326
[Youngmin] Don't you think
it'll be different?

478
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,578
Depending on who will get caught?

479
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,792
[sighs] You're not implying…

480
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:52,170
Look, even if we get caught,
they can't do anything to you

481
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,589
because you're the daughter
of the US ambassador.

482
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,800
How could you ask a child to do that?

483
00:27:56,883 --> 00:28:00,136
I'll do it. Since I was part of the reason
the policeman died.

484
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:05,642
How about instead of using paper, we write
everything on a newly printed note?

485
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:09,229
It can't be me. I'm on their blacklist.
There's no doubt about that.

486
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,523
So what you need to do is
go and ask the printing team

487
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,608
to sneak out a bill for us to use.

488
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:17,654
Yeah, let's do that. If we get caught,
it's safer for me to take the fall.

489
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,827
But if it all gets to be too much
at any point, just give up, okay?

490
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,620
Hmm.

491
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:30,834
We will enter, but please understand
that for security reasons

492
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:34,921
we'll only bring one camera operator
and no reporters inside the Mint.

493
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,841
However, the recordings taken
from the scene

494
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:41,052
will be shared
with every outlet that is interested.

[Sangman] As we think

held as captive hostages nearby,

497
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,811
I've invited all of you here to discuss
how we can best demand their safety

498
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,021
and enact prompt solutions.

499
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,691
And here with us today
we have the family members

The contract security guard,

00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:50,619
Park Chulwoo. A 33-year-old male.

[Chief] So you're saying she put
Agent Park's name on the hostage list?

627

The identities of SOU agents
are classified. No one will find out.

All eyes are on the Mint right now,

634
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,412
and Inspector Seon can use a sway
of the public's perception

to rescue all of the hostages.

when we heard the gunshots, right?

637
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,920
I'm telling you nothing happened.

638
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,339
My director friend, do you know anything?

639
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,549
[Youngmin] Uh… Um…

640
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,219
It was a shooting practice.

641
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,430
If you think you can get away with this
by shutting them up. You're mistaken.

642
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,308
-This man. Where is he?
-How in the world would I know that?

643
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,144
When I've never seen that face
anywhere inside the Mint.

644
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,898
Come on, has anyone
seen him before? No one?

645
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,787
You really haven't seen him?

646
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,589
[sighs]

647
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,718
I saw that man yesterday!

648
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,470
-[muffled speech]
-[Woojin] What?

649
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,848
I saw him too!

650
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,435
[Woojin] Where is he?

651
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,602
Tell me!

652
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,522
-Did you kill this man?
-[crowd murmuring]

653
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:44,483
If you didn't kill him,
then bring him out.

654
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:50,030
Did you think this kinda bullshit
would actually work?

655
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:52,450
That son of a bitch on your list
was a fucking cop and you--

656
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,494
So that means you're admitting
that you killed him? Do I have that right?

657
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:58,581
[Berlin] You're the ones who
broke your promise and sent in an agent.

658
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:01,417
-We were defending ourselves.
-Yeah, maybe that's what you think!

659
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,712
But what really matters is that you broke
your promise of not hurting anyone

660
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:05,713
and you killed someone.

661
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,923
Even now, the majority
of the public thinks

662
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,675
that we should use force to stop you.

663
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:13,220
We're trying our best to negotiate
for the sake of the hostages' safety.

664
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,598
But with the way
things have escalated now,

665
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,224
I don't think we can solve this

666
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,851
with conversation alone.

667
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,854
So if you want to avoid
the worst-case scenario,

668
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,400
you need to set the students free
right now.

669
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,820
[indistinct chatter]

670
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,323
Give me a justification
to continue negotiating.

671
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,657
[scoffs]

672
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,242
[claps]

673
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,953
Justification? Let's be honest.

674
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,289
You're trying to free
the daughter of the US ambassador,

675
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:42,791
so that you can bulldoze this place?

676
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,169
I see us storming in by force
does scare you.

677
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:47,796
[grunts] I can just stay in here!

678
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,632
[panting] Did you hear that?

679
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,801
Then what do you think about maybe,
aside from Anne,

680
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,512
us sending the other students home?

681
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:56,722
[sighs]

682
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,016

[knocking]

685
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,527
-What's up?
-[man] Someone dropped this off.

686
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,404
ANONYMOUS TIP

687
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,406
I guess we have no choice.

688
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,201
Looks like we just have to see
for ourselves to find out who is right.

689
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,579

[gasps]

693
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,485
What? They didn't kill him?

694
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,863
[Tokyo] The thing we were hiding
so thoroughly

695
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,700
wasn't Park Chulwoo's death,

696
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,910
but the fact that he was alive.

697
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:04,415
[Woojin] If we stick to the basics
and give them the information as needed,

698
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,834
the public is gonna finally realize

699
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,253
that they shouldn't
target their anger at us

700
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,754
but at the Mint.

701
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:14,133
So what happened, Professor?
Were you able to take care of the car?

702
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:16,427
Yes, I did. What happened at the Mint?

703
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,178
A rat crawled out and we caught it.

704
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,389
So did you kill him?

705
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:24,518
[Tokyo] Of course, Berlin's bullet
was aimed straight at the cop's heart.

706
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,561
[gun clicking]

707
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:29,440
He desperately wanted to blow
the man's head off right then and there,

708
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:32,276
but he settled for letting
his anger out on him instead.

709
00:43:32,985 --> 00:43:34,820
He was still alive.

710
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:39,617
Berlin had followed the rule the Professor
emphasized over and over again.

711
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,952
[Professor] Because Berlin stuck
to our principles,

712
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:45,414
we now have an opportunity
to turn public opinion back to our side.

713
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:48,208
The police are all certain
that Park Chulwoo is dead.

714
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,128
We'll use that to our advantage.

715
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:54,715
[indistinct chatter]

716
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,344
Breaking news
from the standoff at the Mint.

717
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:01,388
An anonymous tip was
just delivered to our production truck,

718
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,557
which contained a drive with a video file.

719
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,060
Surprisingly, the video
contained footage of what happened

720
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,437
inside the Mint
at the time of the gunfire yesterday.

721
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,440
[Berlin] Agent Park Chulwoo
infiltrated the Mint

722
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:13,484
dressed in the same outfit as the hostages

723
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:17,363
and caused a major disturbance
in an attempt to kill our leader.

724
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:20,240
-Sure, let's say that's all okay.
-[hostages yelling]

725
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:23,369
After all, he's a cop.
But what about afterwards?

726
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:26,080
Agent Park Chulwoo!
What was the next part of your plan?

727
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:29,208
Should I say it for you?

728
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,627
While we were panicking
over losing our leader,

729
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,545
they were planning
to storm in here with guns.

730
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,047
[indistinct chatter]

[cameras clicking]

732
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:41,470
[Berlin] The hostages
didn't know anything about this.

733
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,514
What do you think would've happened
to the hostages

734
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:47,226
if I hadn't caught Park Chulwoo,
and if they had stormed in here for real?

735
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,978
Do you think anyone is going to believe
a word of what you say?

736
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,773
The word of cops who only pretended
to care the safety of the hostages

737
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,525
while planning to use them
as human shields,

738
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,193
all the while shamelessly lying about it!

739
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,570
[crowd yelling]

740
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,707
[shouting]

741
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:12,960
You all know that we are criminals,
and that we came here to steal money.

742
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,921
But we know better than anyone else
that human lives matter.

743
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:18,090
At least, better than the police here.

744
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:21,969
If someone has to lose a life
inside the Mint, take it from me,

745
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,555
I will be the first to do so.

746
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,475
Until then,
I will not let anyone else die.

POLICE USE OF HOSTAGES AS HUMAN SHIELDS
INDISCRIMINATE RAID REVEALED

750
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:47,453
As the presumed leader
of the group of suspects said,

751
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,371
so far, there haven't been any casualties

752
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,124
that have occured in the hostage situation
taking place at the Mint…

753
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,084
-What are you doing?
-[sobbing] I feel betrayed.

The Professor said not to watch the TV.

755
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,006
Agh! Don't bring up the Professor so soon.

756
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,175
Hey, we're enjoying the moment a bit.

757
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,676
Don't be so uptight.

758
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,221
Right? We totally got the police.
We destroyed them in there.

759
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,015
See? It's insane right now!

760
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:11,185
Especially Berlin at the end!
You totally killed it, man!

[all laughing]

762
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,525
If the leader says turn it off,
we turn it off.

763
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:20,569
[Nairobi] Aw.

764
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:24,531
Come on, man.
You were having fun watching it too, huh?

765
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:28,118
So, I guess with all this,

766
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:31,663
it's safe to say that the precious public
opinion is gonna be on our side now.

767
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:33,582
You did a great job, Berlin.

We're almost done printing money too.

In three days, we can finally get out
of this fucking Mint! [laughs]

Finally, we can see the end.

Yeah, of course.

Once you get out, I hope you can forget
about everything that happened here.

794
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:28,322
You're right.

795
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:31,033
You don't go through this every day.

796
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,162
I'm sorry.

[exasperated sigh]

798
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:40,959
No, no, that's not what I--

799
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:44,922
You know, just keep working
like nothing ever happened.

800
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,466
And I hope you can date
a decent guy this time, huh?

[exasperated sigh]

802
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,061
I'm going to

803
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:01,313
quit the Mint.

804
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:06,610
Why?

805
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,615
Oh shit. Is it the Director?

806
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:14,326
That son of a bitch, I'll make sure
that asshole doesn't say a word--

I can't accept this. I'm the one
who should take responsibility.

820
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,400
[Chief] What can we do?

821
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:15,572
Public opinion's against us.
It's not like I have any say in this.

822
00:51:16,948 --> 00:51:20,035
The higher-ups have taken a lot into
consideration to end things like this.

823
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:24,122
No, it's because if you fire me
you can't find a replacement.

824
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,291
[sighs]

825
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:29,377
Please tell those people at the top

826
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:33,340
that if they replace Captain Cha,
I'll quit too.

Ma'am.

831
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:48,522
You don't have to do this.
I agreed with their call.

832
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,274
We both know that I'm the one responsible,

833
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,902
so it's only right for you to stay,
rather than me.

834
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,322
[Woojin] Are you just going to give up?

835
00:51:57,405 --> 00:52:01,326
Who said anything about giving up?
Listen, I'm planning to track him down.

836
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,037
[Woojin] Is there a way to find him?

837
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:07,290
This may not be
the best time to bring this up,

838
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:10,544
but when did you first seeing
that man Park Sunho?

839
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,962
[Woojin] Sunho?

840
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:14,798
[Moohyuk] He barged into the
Task Force tent that one time, didn't he?

841
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:16,007
Captain Cha, please!

842
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,137
[exhales sharply] He, uh…

843
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:24,724
It's true that I haven't known him long,
but he's not the type to hurt anyone.

844
00:52:25,433 --> 00:52:28,562
And more than all of that,
he's someone that I trust and love.

845
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,647
[Moohyuk] But still, I--

846
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,859
[Woojin] Just go get some sleep.
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

847
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:38,321
Well, they can't fire both of us,
so they'll probably just call it off.

Are you okay? Drinking like that?

00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,697
I've got to shake it off

You told me I can rely on you, right?

00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,186
You just wait.

876
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:37,565
I might get real, real drunk
and cry my eyes out.

I don't know.

880
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:49,911
Maybe I should get drunk first.

881
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:58,461
That won't be easy though. [chuckles]

[Tokyo] Woojin was able
to forget about reality

884
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,888
for a little while when she was with him.

885
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,308
It was the same for him too.

886
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:15,937
He could forget about being the Professor
and just be an ordinary café owner.

887
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:19,983
And in that moment,
sitting across from her,

888
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:23,111
he didn't feel any confusion or guilt.

889

Walking together like this,
doesn't it feel like we're a real couple?

I can hear music coming from somewhere.

00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,480
About the situation at the Mint…

898
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,402
Maybe you should
just forget about this case.

899
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,241
What do you mean by that?

900
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:12,994
It's just that…

901
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:15,914
you seem tired.

902
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,086
[Tokyo] The Professor
was completely shocked

903
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:24,005
when he heard those words
slip out of his mouth.

904
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:27,133
because if Inspector Seon
really did quit the case,

905
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:29,219
it would derail our entire plan.

906
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,345
Maybe I really should?

00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:32,180
I know this sounds strange,

908
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:35,183
but I've had a few tough days

909
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:37,185

that they'd just fire me.

the Professor couldn't smile back,
