[Professor] If a bullet hits vital organs

like the brain, heart,
or any major artery,

00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:15,932
there isn't really anything we can do
in terms of first aid.

5
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,226
It'll be good
to learn the types of first aid

when a bullet hits someone in soft tissue.

Let's say that Denver got shot right here.

9
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:26,985
You'd need to know
the major organs located in that spot

10
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,154
to understand the extent of the damage.

Liver.

12
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:34,492
It's his liver. Am I right?

part of the small intestine right there.

So why are we even doing this again?

Do you want us to just leave
the bullet in you when you get shot?

28

Better to leave the bullet in

29
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:19,412
than to have a newbie like you
digging around to get it out.

No way. Were you really a doctor?

32
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,756
I'm not. I quit medical school ages ago.

what you brought me in to do.

Was there a fight between the suspects,
or what?

164
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:45,543
We just tried to keep everyone safe.
And it's you… [sucks teeth]

165
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,587
It's you who shot a hostage.

166
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,464
There's no time for us to point fingers.

167
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,508
You don't want anyone to die either.

168
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,093
How about you be more honest?

169
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,929
Who do you think is gonna be in trouble

170
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,515
if the police kill a hostage?

171
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,850
It'll be both sides.

172
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,561
Especially if the media finds out
what happened.

173
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:07,106
So what exactly is your plan
to handle this?

174
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,942
[sighs] The best plan is to transfer him
to a hospital.

175
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,820
-You and I both know that's not an option.
-Then…

176
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,075
…just let us send in medics.

177
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:19,994
We have to save his life.

178
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,670
I'll call you in ten minutes.

I'm sorry. I made an error in judgment.

189
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,926
But it was my decision.

190
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:21,389
The suspects can't possibly
be stupid enough to refuse medics.

[exhales]

[inhales deeply] I hope that's true.

This is not the time to blame yourself.

-[exhales]
-And this, well…

I'm also going to go in
with the medics myself.

[tense music playing]

[Berlin] We can't be played by them!

201
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,880
Who knows what kind of shit they'll pull
if we decide to let in an outsider?

202
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,757
We can't just let a hostage die.

203
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,262
If you die from a single gunshot wound,
I'd be a dead man.

204
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:04,098
That asshole has been begging us
to let him talk to his wife.

205
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,433
He's completely fine.

206
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,477
And even if he dies,
the police are the ones who shot him.

207
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,104
We have nothing to lose.

208
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,440
How about we let him die in peace,

209
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,567
and use what happened
to our advantage with the media?

210
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,902
"The police killed one of the hostages

211
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:19,405
on purpose
to make an excuse for a raid." Yeah?

212
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,448
Listen to me, Berlin.

213
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,616
Your punishment is only postponed.

214
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,662
And all of this only happened
because you executed a hostage.

215
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,207
I will not allow anyone else to die here.

216
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,335
And that's the bottom line, Berlin.

217
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,424
Very well, Professor,
let me be clear that I did warn you.

The Director wants
to talk to his wife before the surgery.

225
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,617
We will call her.

226
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,577
Does this mean yes?

227
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,039
[Professor] In an hour, send only
the minimum amount of medical staff.

228
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,499
-[Woojin] Okay.
-[line disconnects]

229
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:13,667
Is this really okay?

230
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,795
They were always one step ahead of us
this whole time

231
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,463
like they planned for every situation,

232
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,216
but they didn't anticipate
the Director of the Mint getting shot.

233
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,343
We have to take advantage of this.

234
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,930
Let's say we manage to enter
with the medics without getting caught.

What can Captain Cha do by himself

236

when they'll be watching our every move

-The equipment is ready.

Our army is prepared for any situation
that might occur during an operation.

240
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,370
i mean, what are going to--

241
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:52,832
As the Chief said, all of the suspects
are gonna be focused on the medics.

242
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:55,751
In the meantime, we'll turn their plan
against them,

243
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,253
and the SOU will invade.

244
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,589
In other words, it's a feint operation.

He tried to make a run for it
all by himself and got shot.

257
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,549
Did the thieves shoot him?

That she's still alive?

It's because of Berlin, okay?

I don't think whatever the Professor says
to do would matter at all to Berlin.

If she doesn't get surgery soon,
she might end up losing her leg, you guys.

that are coming in soon too.

How do you suggest we deal with that?

if anything goes wrong, okay?

00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,197
[breathing deeply]

322
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,160
[Denver sighs]

323
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,627
[Moohyuk] There's an underground vent that
leads to the kitchen of the cafeteria.

324
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,214
The structure will likely
take some time to infiltrate,

325
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,050
but this is the only route
that avoids security cameras.

326
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,718
Risky but worth a try.

327
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:17,638
If we can enter and blend in
with the hostages then maybe--

328
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,515
-[Chief] The medics are here now.
-[Woojin] Ah.

329
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,353
You've been informed that Captain Cha
will go in with you disguised as a medic.

330
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,312
Uh, yes.

331
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,356
[Moohyuk] I'm familiar with
the basic terms and knowledge.

332
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,858
Just treat me
like you'd normally treat an assistant.

333
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,735
How long do you anticipate
the surgery will be?

334
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,488
It'll take a minimum of 30 minutes,
but depending on--

335
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,825
Take as much time as you can,
without affecting the patient.

336
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,703
-What's the status of the Director's wife?
-She's waiting outside, ma'am.

337
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,332
-[door closes]
-[Denver sighs]

338
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,961
What is this, huh?

339
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,381
-What is what?
-I mean…

340
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,884
If you think about it, that woman almost
died because of what the Director did.

341
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,220
But look at this.

342
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:02,057
She actually talks about how sorry she is.

343
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,686
Are you starting
to feel something for her?

344
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,146
Huh?

345
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,648
That's crazy.

346
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:12,818
It's just that my brain can't make sense
of all the shit that's been happening.

347
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,361
-Okay?
-Does it need to make sense?

348
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,072
-Huh?
-[Tokyo sighs]

349
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,786
You're right.

350
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,082
[trembling breaths]

351
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,168
[pensive music playing]

352
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,807
You should forget about it. Okay?

353
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,226
[scoffs]

354
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,729
Well, it is what it is.

355
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,606
[chuckles] Right?

356
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,526
Fuck off, you fucking murderer.

357
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,654
[whispering] Shit, are you fucking crazy?

358
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,031
[sighs]

359
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,366
[Youngmin breathing shakily]

360
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,288
[Berlin] We're finally ready
to connect the wife of Director Cho,

361
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,290
the abiding hero of the Mint.

362
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:12,169
-Sweetheart. [groans]
-This is him, right?

363
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:18,091
So now that you're faced with death,
you finally remember that you have a wife.

364
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,385
-Hmm?
-[breathing heavily]

365
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,930
What's the password for this?

366
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:28,518
One, two, three, four.

367
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,812
[all laugh]

368
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:35,943
It's amazing that
you never got caught cheating. [laughs]

369
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,986
Am I right?

370
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,697
Uh, yeah.

371
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,661
So. One, two, three, four.

372
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,082
All right. What's her number saved under?

373
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,252
It's saved as "my love."

374
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,923
[Berlin chuckles] My love.

375
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,508
[chuckles]

376
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,678
-Mr. Romantic.
-Yeah.

377
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,513
You try to screw us one more time

378
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,683
and I promise you'll die
before the surgery. Got it?

379
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,434
-[ringing tone]
-[desperate whimpering]

380
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,938
-[Berlin clears throat]
-[breathing heavily]

381
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,982
[wife on phone] Hello?

382
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,275
MY LOVE

383
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,276
Honey!

384
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,737
-[sobs] It's me.
-[wife] Honey…

385
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,825
The police told me just now
that you've been injured.

386
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,160
Are you doing okay?

387
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,330
[sobs] I feel like I can live…

388
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,710
just hearing your voice.

389
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,211
Honey…

390
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,922
-Are the kids with you?
-[sobs]

391
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:43,593
If I die, please tell them
that their Dad loves them very, very much.

392
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,221
You too, Honey.

393
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:48,890
I love you so much! [sobs]

394
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,149
[cameras clicking]

395
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,695
[Woojin] Captain Cha will enter with
the medics and relay the situation inside.

396
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:05,741
While they're occupied with the surgery,
our few selected agents will enter.

397
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,535
Then they'll
quickly neutralize the leader.

398
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:11,621
As soon as the hostages
have been confirmed safe and secured,

399
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,707
we'll mop up everything
both inside and outside.

400
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:17,544
Sure, the plan's great, but how are you
gonna communicate with us from the inside?

401
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,755
They'll do a thorough full-body search.

402
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,799
[woojin] These glasses have a camera
with a wireless transmission function.

403
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,315
[camera whirring]

404
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:49,451
[Tokyo] Everyone, listen up.
I don't want to see anyone else shot.

405
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,413
You all right?

406
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,461
[sighs] Put your masks on.

407
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,630
And hold your guns like they're real.

408
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,846
[breathes deeply]

409
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,723
Are you pissed at me?

410
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:15,352
You understand why I had to do
what I did in there, don't you?

411
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,355
Forget about it.

412
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,982
It's my fault for trusting a con artist.

413
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,485
[inhales deeply]

414

[sighs]

419
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,127
You good? Is something bothering you?

420
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,294
[reporter 1] They're coming!

421
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,755
[reporter 2] Tell us how you feel
about going inside the Mint.

422
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,843
I guess I'm just worried that the police
would try to fuck with us again, you know?

423
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:51,596
Well, that's why you're on the team
in case anything like that happens.

424
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,348
So monitor them closely.

425
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,767
Mmm. Mmm.

426
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,520
-Of course, yeah.
-That's right.

427
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,065

[suspenseful music playing]

429
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,800
[Tokyo] Place all items on the scanner

430
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,678
and come forward three steps
with your arms out to the side.

431
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:34,264
HOUR 53 INTO THE HEIST

432
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:38,393
We reported earlier that the sound
of a gunshot was heard at the Mint today.

433
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:42,314
And just now, our camera's have captured
a team of medics entering the Mint,

434
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:45,025
though we don't know details
of the injury.

435
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:48,320
The police are only repeating
that it's an urgent situation

436
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:51,156
and have not released
any official statements so far.

437
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:55,744
There are concerns rising over whether
the person injured was a hostage,

438
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,078
and if that's the case,

439
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:01,833
whether or not the suspects are inflicting
intentional harm on the hostages.

440
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,044
[thrilling music playing]

441
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,308
One of them is a cop.

442
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:20,936
Of course. What did I tell you?
Which one is it?

443
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,562
The tall man with the glasses.

444
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,982
I definitely saw his face
at the Task Force.

445
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,903
Those fucking assholes.

446
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,990
We do them a favor by letting them
treat a hostage they shot by mistake,

447
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,825
and they just sneak in?

448
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,911
Shouldn't we find a way to stop this soon?

449
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:41,331
[Berlin] Why? This is a good opportunity
to capture a police officer.

450
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:45,293
Listen. They wouldn't risk doing all this
just to see the situation inside.

451
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:48,338
We have to find out
the motive behind this move.

452
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:58,515
[Nairobi] We'll take your personal effects
until you leave. Agreed?

[music continues]

454
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,952
[Berlin] Wait a minute.
We're going to do this properly.

[whirring]

456

[Nairobi] Back to your positions!

Raise your arms to the side
and turn around.

Passed the entrance.

A group wearing masks
is lined up in the lobby.

469
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,625
Based on the number,
it appears hostages are mixed in.

You think it's a good idea
to let a police officer in?

473
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,365
What did the Professor say?

474
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,161
-We should start a bloodbath.
-What?

475
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,456
-Don't like my joke?
-[scoffs]

476
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,335
Your acting skills are wasted on jokes.
Looking to change careers?

Even if they're all SOU Task Force,
they can't go head-to-head with us.

479
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,885
I'm going to need to find a way
to shake them up

480
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,595
and find out why they snuck in.

481
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,058
[Youngmin groaning]

482
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:59,112
[moans]

483
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,782
Hand me the forceps, please. For…

484
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,410
Oh. I mean, tweezers.

485
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:18,631
[Berlin] So? Do you think
you can save our Director friend?

486
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,426
The bullet is lodged
in the pectoralis major,

487
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,845
but thankfully, didn't damage
any vital organs.

488
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,930
[Berlin] How long will it take?

489
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,642
-[doctor] Probably about two hours--
-[Berlin] Finish within an hour.

490
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,852
[doctor] Uh, okay.

491
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,688
[Chief] Isn't that guy the Professor?

492
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,775
No, he has a different accent
and different speech patterns.

493
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:41,362
The real Professor is probably
watching it all from somewhere in there.

494
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:45,825
Scalpel.

495
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,081
[whispers] Any one of them.

496
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,422
[Berlin] Hold it.

497
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:05,011
You think you can operate when your hands
are trembling like that? Hmm?

498
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:06,930
Move.

499
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:11,935
I guess you'll have to do it.
You're the only one who isn't trembling.

500
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,485
Nerves of steel. Are you not scared?

501
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:23,613
People generally tend to flinch
when there's a gun pointed at them.

502
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,283
[Moohyuk] I'm prepared for any situation
that might occur.

503
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,957
[Berlin] You have a Munhwaŏ accent.

504
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:38,169
This is my first time hearing
of a male nurse from Pyongan.

505
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,588
So who are you?

506
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:47,178
-[Woojin] I think they caught us.
-What? What do we do?

507
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,681
[tense music playing]

508
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:53,810
[Moohyuk] Actually…

509
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,606
-I'm a police officer.
-[Berlin] What?

510
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:08,032
I'm only here to ensure the safety
of the medics.

511
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,284
No ulterior motives.

512
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:12,537
I'm sorry we lied,
but we had orders from higher-up

513
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,914
to not let civilians enter by themselves.

514
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,208
Is this operation
just going to end right here?

515
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,546
[sighs] it looks like Captain Cha's
decided to go off script.

516
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,550
He's creating a diversion so that they
don't catch on to our feint operation.

517
00:31:25,633 --> 00:31:28,094
That idiot, he revealed himself.

518
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,889
Guess Berlin can be intimidating.

519
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,765
It's too soon to relax.

520
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,977
From what I saw in the Task Force tent,
he wasn't just any cop.

521
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,689
Now the suspects
will just be focused on Captain Cha.

522
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,860
Infiltration team, can you get to
the cafeteria at the time we planned?

523
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,487
[tense music playing]

524
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,367
[Berlin] Civilian protection?
You expect me to believe that?

525
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:54,579
If we send in the medics by themselves,
and they also become hostages,

526
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,456
that'll mean trouble
for the higher ups too.

527
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,127
So what can you do when you're here
all by yourself, completely unarmed?

528
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,838
I was ordered to blend in
with the other people

529
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,757
in case we're held hostage.

530
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,845
[Berlin] Sounds convincing enough.

531
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,430
All right, then.

532
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,893
Let's get to saving our Director friend.

533
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,521
Denver, you keep a close eye
on this bastard.

534
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,857
[Denver] Okay, got it.

535
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,361
You, police. Stand back! Stand back!

536
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,155
[tense music continues]

537
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,368
[moans]

538
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,625
[trilling]

539
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,128
[keys clacking]

540
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,972
We've almost arrived at the target.

541
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,266
Keep moving forward.

542
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,149
[Youngmin moaning]

543
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,158
[Denver exhales]

544
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:17,829
Hey, why is this taking so long?

545
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,584
So Denver is…

546
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:25,545
He's your son?

547
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,883
He's not… He's not a bad guy.

548
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,804
He just happened to get stuck
with a bad father.

549
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:39,058
So if there's anyone that you were looking
to blame for this,

550
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,270
you should probably blame me.

551
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,151
It's okay.

552
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,695
I asked him to shoot me.

553
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,620
[sighs]

554
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,056
[suspenseful music playing]

555
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,563
[inhales deeply]

556
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,149
I've looked everywhere,
but there's nothing suspicious.

557
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,359
Maybe he's actually telling the truth?

558
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,989
No, I think there's
definitely something they're hiding.

559
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,658
[Rio] You know, Professor,

560
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,452
if Berlin…

561
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:42,330
if he hadn't decided
to kill one of the hostages…

562
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:47,376
I mean, if that hostage had stayed alive,
we wouldn't be in this situation, right?

563
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,213
Yeah, probably. Why do you ask?

564
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,381
Uh, uh, nothing.

565
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,386
[tense music playing]

566
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:19,033
-[radio beeps]
-We have arrived. Preparing to enter.

567
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,250
[whirring]

568
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:32,755
[Youngmin groans]

569
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,591
[tense music continues]

570
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,103
-[doctor] All that's left is to finish up.
-Is that right?

571
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:48,980
[clicking]

572
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:53,693
[Berlin] You can always stay here
if you want. There's plenty of space.

573
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,529
I'll leave when they're done.
I'm here for the medics.

574
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,823
[Denver] So what,
it's all finished, right?

575
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,785
Okay, I'll help pack up.

576
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:07,540
-[clattering]
-[Denver] Oh no, man, I'm so sorry.

577
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,917
[music intensifies]

578
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,509
-They're different.
-[Rio] What are?

579
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,179
[Professor] Is it possible
to insert something in those glasses?

580
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,848
[Rio] Yeah, it's possible to have
a microphone, even a camera.

581
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,642
If they have a reason
to be monitoring all of our moves

582
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,604
as they happen in real-time,
then it must be a feint operation.

583
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,397
[suspenseful music playing]

584
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,458
[Chief] One of the suspects
left the room before all the others.

585
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:54,462
-Do you think he's catching onto us?
-Even if he did, it's already too late.

586
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,631
-[radio beeps]
-It's time. Go.

587
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,382
[officer] Entering now.

588
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,182
[Professor] While a cop is there
to divert our attention,

589
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:09,894
there have to be others waiting
trying to infiltrate from somewhere else.

590
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,982
[Rio] That's not possible.
I didn't see anything on the cameras.

591
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:18,319
There could be a route we're not aware of.

592
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:20,196
Then what do we do?

593
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:23,282
Just stay calm, and listen carefully
to what I'm about to say.

594
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,159
[suspenseful music playing]

595
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,561
[Tokyo] This way.

596
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,605
Follow me.

597
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,917
[Berlin] You look so surprised?

598
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,836
Oh, these?

599
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,963
Thought we'd freshen things up a bit.

600
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,465
How do you like them?

601
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,180
Now, give a warm round of applause to…

602
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,349
the medics.

603
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,350
[all applauding]

604
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,020
[applause continues on monitor]

605
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,105
[upbeat music playing]

606
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,127
[Woojin] No. No.

607
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,086
[radio beeps]

608
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,630
Do not go inside. Retreat.

609
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,383
What? But we've already made it inside.

610
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,927
The suspects changed the masks.
if you go in, you'll be caught.

611
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,304
[panting]

612
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,181
Stop the operation!

613
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,600
Stop it now!

614
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,853
-[Woojin] Come back outside, right now!
-Okay. Roger that.

615
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:24,111
[panting]

616
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,411
[Woojin] They know it's a feint operation.

617
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,705
They're gonna comb through
the entire Mint.

618
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:35,956
Hurry, get out!

619
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,005
[grunts]

620
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,560
[panting]

621
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,612
[Professor] What happened?

622
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:09,156
We've checked everywhere
they could've possibly entered.

623
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,534
Mmm, yeah, it's all clear.

624
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,495
That's good. And how about the horse?

625
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,456
It's nicely gift-wrapped and sent back.

626
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,041
Fantastic!

627
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,460
[Tokyo] The Professor
immediately made a counter move

628
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,962
to oppose their feint operation.

629
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:26,215
[Professor] Now, if the standoff continues
for a significant length of time,

630
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:29,593
it's likely they'll try to secretly
come in and hide at some point.

631
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,845
Like the Trojan horse.

632
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,680
Oh, good, yeah.

633
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,306
I know exactly what that is.

634
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:36,851
-The Brad Pitt movie.
-Hey, I saw that too.

635
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,019
Agh, those dumbasses.

636
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,688
-What?
-What?

637
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,857
Why don't we just track them down
and kick them out?

638
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,817
Well, yes.

639
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,653
But that won't be enough.
We need to use that advantage.

640
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:48,654
How do we do that?

641
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:51,657
What about taking the cops
who infiltrated as hostages?

642
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,202
No. We're going to use
a different opportunity.

643
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,330
The success of this plan depends on…

644
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,792
You. Rio, here.

645
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:03,961
[Rio] Huh?

646
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:06,630
[downtempo rock music plays]

647
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,299

649
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,266
[all applauding]

00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,018
[song continues]

651
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,864
[Tokyo] The Professor planned
not only our masterful defense,

652
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:36,410
but also found a way to pierce through
the enemy armor without them even knowing.

653
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,500
[song ends]

654
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,336
[grunts, pants]

655
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,132
When do you think
they find out about our plan?

656
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:53,302
When I told them that I'm a cop?
Or did they know before?

657
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:57,306
That Professor guy. Sure,
he's exceptional, but to that level?

658
00:41:57,890 --> 00:41:59,141
I don't know either.

659
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:01,810
But what we do know,

660
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:06,190
is that he has us completely wrapped
around his finger.

661
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,360
[Tokyo] But by the time
the inspector realized this,

662
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,779
the Professor was already
in full control of the game.

663
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,657
[Helsinki] Okay, everyone, inside!

664
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:18,118
Hurry, come on.

665
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,580
Get going!

666
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,251
Move!

667
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,380
[Tokyo] And we also had something
very important to take care of

668
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:31,131
before it was too late.

669
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:35,427
[Oslo] But isn't it useless
if they just turn off the phone?

670
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,055
-Oh, you can't turn that phone off.
-Huh?

671
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:41,183
Even if you turn it off,
it only looks like you did.

672
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,143
But really it's still on, like a zombie.

673
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,521
We'll know everything that the cop does.

674
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:49,108
What he says, calls he makes,
even what the camera sees. [laughs]

675
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:51,110
Oh yeah? That's awesome, man.

676
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,195
[both laugh]

677
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,030
-Great, right?
-Yeah.

678
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,157
[laughing]

679
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:01,954
Uh…

680
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,332
[Berlin] What's that look on your face?

681
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,626
Were you up to something
other than your homework, Rio?

682
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,629
[breathing shakily]

683
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:19,722
[Tokyo] The anesthetic
seems to be working.

684
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:22,933
[Denver exhales nervously]

685
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,560
[breathes deeply]

686
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:30,608
Oh shit. Why the fuck are my hands
shaking so much?

687
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,610
Dad, the blood. Will you wipe it off?

688
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,820
Come on, just wipe it off! Wipe it off1

689
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:36,530
I'm wiping it off,
but it's still bleeding.

690
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,782
-[Denver] Shit.
-[Moscow] It won't stop. What do we do?

691
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:40,618
You do something about it.

692
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,578
[Denver] Just hold still. Okay?

693
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:45,456
-Agh! This isn't going to work.
-[Denver] Huh?

694
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,666
-I'm gonna go get Rio.
-[Denver] Rio?

695
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,543
That asshole won't do it.
He said he wouldn't.

696
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:52,671
Well, I'll drag him in here
if that's what we have to do.

697
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:55,257
-Now do something about all that blood.
-[Moscow] Okay.

698
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,884
But it won't stop bleeding!

699
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,552
[mumbling]

700
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,013
[Denver] Why won't it stop? [grunts]

701
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:03,057
[Moscow] Damn it. What should we do?

702
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,225
[startled mumble]

703
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,478
How did…

704
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:09,772
Youngmin's surgery go?

705
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,815
I didn't realize you were awake.

706
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,817
How is Youngmin?

707
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,612
[Moscow sighs]

708
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,405
The surgery went well.

709
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,700
The doctor said
he's gonna recover completely.

710
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,245
You don't need to worry about him.

711
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:27,498
That's good.

712
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:29,958
-[Denver sighs]
-[Misun] I…

713
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,254
I'm gonna die.

714
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,507
No. What are you talking about?

715
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,883
[Moscow] Tokyo just left.

716
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:41,428
She's going to find and bring someone back
who knows how to do surgery.

717
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:42,846
So just hang in there, okay?

718
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,015

Let me go! WHat are you doing?

722
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,820
-Let go. What the fuck are you doing?
-Hey, hey.

723
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,863
I was just having
a very serious talk with Rio,

724
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,616
but I think this will make
our conversation a lot easier.

725
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,701
What do you mean?

726
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,412
I don't know. Maybe something
that you and Rio know, and I don't?

727
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:09,123
What is our Tokyo up to right now?
What do you think?

728
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,792
[scoffs] Don't be ridiculous!

729
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,586
Threatening hostages isn't enough
for you anymore?

730
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,880
Well, I didn't exactly expect you
to fess up that easily.

731
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:19,049
But Rio will tell me, right? Hmm?

732
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,844
Maybe if I threaten
to hand you over to the police.

733
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:26,890
I can't just let you two continue
to muddy the waters here, can I? Huh?

734
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,768
All I have to do is tie you up
and throw you out in front of the Mint,

735
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,437
and the police
will take care of the rest.

736
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,940
[scoffs] Oh, it sounds like fun.
But you really think you can do that?

737
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:37,901
What will you do if I go ahead
and tell the police everything?

738
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,070
Oh, really? You won't say anything.

739
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,866
You didn't come here
for the money at all, did you?

740
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:46,869
You came here because you really want
the Professor's plan to be successful.

741
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,037
Even if that means you get caught.

742
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:51,790
-[grunts angrily]
-What are you talking about?

743
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:55,002
You can hear it for yourself when this
is over. But that's not important now.

744
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:59,298
What's important is that I'll hand Tokyo
to the police if you don't comply.

00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,101
D-Did you give him my note?

748
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,228
[exhales] Well…

749
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,814
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

750
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,817
What did Youngmin say?

751
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:22,613
Uh… He…

752
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:27,993
Uh, he was in tears,
saying he was relieved.

753
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,704
He also said he loves you.

754
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,210
What else?

755
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,420
He said that after this is all over,

756
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:41,548
he'll treat you well
until the day he dies, or something.

we made a good team, Denver.

You're not in this for the money?

[grunting]

775
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:35,769
I mean, why's this plan such a priority
to you when you might get caught?

[grunting]

777
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,899
So are you like…

778
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,444
into the Professor, or something?

779

[scoffs]

780
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,740
So is that all you can think about?

781
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:52,035
What would a kid like you
know about anything?

Come on.

The fear doesn't work
if this woman is still alive.

We threatened to kill her.

00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,354
If that turns out to be a bluff,

794
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,356
do you think the hostages
are gonna listen to us?

795
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,111
-[Moscow] Berlin!
-Oh shit. Fuck.

796
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,279
[grunts]

797
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:29,948
Do you think you'll get away
with all of this if you shoot me?

798
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,826
No, because I'm going to shoot her.
You just need to step aside.

799
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:33,785
Well, then, uh,

800
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,164
I don't think
I'm gonna do that, huh? [chuckles]

801
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:38,916
I'll count to three.

802
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,001
And one.

803
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,922
Shit. If the Professor finds out,
he's not just gonna let this stand.

804
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,506
[Berlin] I'm dying to know, Denver.

805
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,091
Why are you doing this?

806
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:51,345
Is it that you developed feelings
for this woman, huh?

807
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,971
[laughs]

808
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:57,601
Why? Because I'm shy around this girl
I have to have feelings, huh?

809
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:59,519
-Yeah. Two.
-[Moscow] Hey, hey.

810
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,896
-Wait.
-Shit.

811
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,189
-Three.
-Berlin, stop!

812
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,732
[Nairobi] Stop right there.

813
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:09,154
-Put your gun down, Oslo.
-[sighs]

814
00:49:09,738 --> 00:49:12,616
-Oh shit.
-How could all of you do this without me?

815
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:13,784
[breathing heavily]

816
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,454
Huh? Th-That's…

817
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:18,956
How? Wait.

818
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,374
[suspenseful music playing]

819
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:44,940
-I'm quick to catch on.
-I seem to remember you being on my side.

820
00:49:45,023 --> 00:49:46,441
Enough is enough, Berlin.

821
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:49,486
Your side is killing a woman
who's miraculously still alive.

822
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,487
[scoffs]

823
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,533
Even if i don't kill her,
looks like she's dying anyway.

824
00:49:54,616 --> 00:49:57,035
-[Moscow] What's wrong?
-[Denver] Huh? What's happening to her?

825
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,453
-[Moscow] What's going on?
-Wake up.

826
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,247
[Moscow] What is happening? Huh? Huh?

827
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,082
-Rio.
-[panicked chatter]

828
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,376
She's going to die
if you don't do something.

829
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,627
[breathing heavily]

830
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,337
I just… I… I…

831
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,463
Uh…

832
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,924
Ugh! I'll do it myself.

833
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:14,219
[Denver] Dad, Dad, do something.

834
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:16,763
[Rio] Stop treating me like a little kid.

835
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,682
Why didn't you quit
before we started all this?

836
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,726
You're the one who brought me back.

837
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:24,938
Everyone, even fucking Berlin, is here,
risking their lives. Understand?

838
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,732
We're all here for our own reasons,

839
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,567
even if it's for the money
or something else.

840
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:31,778
But it seems like you're here,
but you don't wanna be.

841
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,781
That right there is what makes you a kid.

842
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,451
I'll do it.

843
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,829
[breathing nervously]

844
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:49,254
[contemplative music playing]

845
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,864
[breathes deeply]

846
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:30,087
[retching]

847
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:32,297
[groaning]

848
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,507
[breathing heavily]

849
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,592
[flushing]

850
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,677
Blood makes you queasy, doesn't it?

851
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:46,353
Ever since I was a kid, I'd throw up
or faint any time I saw blood.

852
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,815
How'd you end up in med school?

853
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,651
It was decided before I was even born.

854
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,195
My family's full of doctors.

855
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:58,281
Your dad doesn't know
that you're like this?

856
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:01,493
[scoffs] My old man?
He knows and still made me do it.

857
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,663
He says I'm just weak-willed.

858
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,250
And that I don't try hard enough.

859
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:13,463
[breathes deeply]

860
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:17,259
I've always tried my fucking best
to be a huge disappointment,

861
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:19,761
but I guess he never gives up.

862
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:23,515
You'll totally disappoint him
this time for sure. [chuckles]

863
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:25,559
[both laugh]

864
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:28,186
You're right.

865
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:33,358
Ah, now that my identity has been leaked
to the whole world, he's going to.

866
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:35,152
[laughs]

867
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,237
[sentimental song playing]

868
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:43,702
But I think I…

869
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,831
I'm gonna stop acting like a kid now.

870
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,667
I spent so much time

871
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,962
only thinking
about ruining my dad's reputation

872
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,631
that I didn't even think
about what I wanted.

873
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,300
So what's different now?

874
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,553
Once we pull off this job though,

875
00:53:02,762 --> 00:53:05,682
I'm going to buy a beautiful
and far off island for myself.

876
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:07,601
That sounds good.

877
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:09,436
-Right?
-[chuckles]

878
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,353
[chuckles]

879
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,272
And that's where I'll live…

880
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,358
with you.

881
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,614
I should go.

882
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:22,574
Hey.

883
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,576
No, I'm serious.

884
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,830
I want to live on an island
with someone I love. Just the two of us.

885
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,999
I can't have something like that?

886
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:33,335
[sighs] I don't know.

887
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:36,087
You're free to dream
about whatever you want. [grunts]

888
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:40,008
[sighs]

889
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:46,264
[chuckles softly]

890
00:53:46,348 --> 00:53:47,974
[sentimental song continues]

891
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,653
[groaning]

892
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:06,451
[sighs]

893
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:08,828
Oh, you're up.

894
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:12,332
So apparently,
even if you're a different blood type,

895
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:16,169
and I'm Type O… I am type O,
I guess they can give blood to anyone.

896
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,171
[inhales deeply] Whew.

897
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,756
That's amazing, right?

898
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:22,550
What you told me earlier.

899
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:27,639
-You were lying, right?
-Huh? About what?

900
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,477
Oh…

901
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,273
I wasn't.

902
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:41,569
He never used that word,
when he and I were together.

903
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:43,822
What?

904
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:45,490
Love?

905
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:49,369
[scoffs]

906
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,581
[chuckles] Oh shit.

907
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,208
I'm sorry.

908
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:59,379
I was… I was about to pass
the note to him,

909
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:02,590
but then things just got really fucked up
in between, and…

910
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,844
That's okay. After all, I'm still alive.

911
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:13,059
[sighs] That asshole
just wouldn't stop begging to talk

912
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,603
to his wife and his kid
before the surgery.

913
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:18,773
It was so fucking annoying
to listen to all that.

914
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:22,444
But in a way, well,
I can also kinda understand.

915
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:24,487
I guess when you're
looking death in the eyes,

916
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:27,907
faces you really wanna see just…
just pop up like that.

917
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:32,537
And then, it got me thinking.

918
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,459
If I was ever in a situation like that,

919
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:40,170
who would I wanna see?

920
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,341
Well, maybe my dad?

921
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,469
[sentimental music playing]

922
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:51,348
[laughing] Oh shit.

923
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,225
If I ever die before that man,

924
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:58,355
I'd be too scared he'd beat me up,
so I'd probably just not see him.

925
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,440
[laughing]

926
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:01,524
[chuckles]

927
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:04,861
My old man is actually
super strong, you know?

928
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,448
[grunts gently]

929
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,327
Thank you.

930
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,665
You saved my life.

931
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:23,463
I mean, uh… That's okay.

932
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,547
I, uh…

933
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:28,093
[sighs]

934
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:32,389
-[Professor on phone] Yun Misun is alive?
-You can check the lounge camera.

935
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,603
[sighs]

936
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:41,272
This is good. This is really good.

937
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:45,318
Tokyo, you're in charge
of the scene from now on.

938
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:49,406
-And Berlin, what should we do about him?
-Put him on the line.

939
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,370
I know you understand, Professor,
why I did all that.

940
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:58,623
Yes, I understand.
But you know I don't approve.

941
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,210
You, of all people,
knew you'd be paying the consequences

942
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:04,087
as soon as you broke the rules.

943
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:05,505
Well, strict punishment

944
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,925
is always necessary when you take control.

945
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:11,970
[Professor] I trust
that you'll understand.

946
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,555
[breathes deeply]

947
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:15,306
So tell me what's it gonna be?

948
00:57:17,475 --> 00:57:18,560
[chair bangs

949
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:20,353
[sighs]

950
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,817
[Professor] Until I decide
you're needed again,

951
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:28,278
we're taking away your gun
and locking you up.

00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,655
[Nairobi chuckles]

953
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,453
Sorry I called you a con artist.

954
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:39,914
Why? I am a con artist.

955
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:46,129
[chuckles]

956
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:50,467
Enjoy it, friends.
Enjoy it while it lasts.

957
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,679
The hostage situation at the Korea Mint

958
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:57,557
is quickly turning into a scene
of extreme bloodshed.

959
00:57:58,224 --> 00:58:01,561
According to our reporters,
the man who was shot by the police today

960
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:05,106
was not one of the suspects
but a hostage, Cho Youngmin,

961
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,941
the Director of the Mint.

962
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:10,278
The bizarre incident occurred because
the police could not tell the difference

963
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:12,030
between the suspects and the citizens.

964
00:58:12,822 --> 00:58:15,742
Foreign news channels
have also reported on this matter,

965
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,786
and now that this story is becoming
an international embarrassment,

966
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:22,624
Inspector Seon Woojin,
the leader of the Joint Task Force,

967
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:25,210
is likely going
to have to take responsibility.

968
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:29,464
Some say Inspector Seon was not
the right person to lead a task force

969
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:31,508
handling such a serious crime.

970
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:34,594
But more so than that,
there is a growing consensus

971
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,638
that the prolonged standoff at the Mint

972
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:40,975
is largely due to Inspector Seon's lack
of proper, immediate response.

973
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:44,604
While some are suggesting a complete
restructuring of the Joint Task Force,

974
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,314
the police are also considering

975
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,983
lessening Inspector Seon's authority
in the Task Force and will--

976
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:49,901
[Mom] Hmm?

977
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:51,486
-[Woojin] Mom.

978

-Oh, welcome home, honey.

979
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:59,452
Ugh. I'm starving. We have anything?

980
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,829
Of course. Let me set the table for you.

981

[exhales]

983

You're doing your best to save lives,

984
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:17,387
and all the media does
is speak badly about you.

985
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:21,391
Oh, please don't worry about them. Okay?

986
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:23,810
[chuckles softly]

987
00:59:23,893 --> 00:59:25,853
-Mina's where?
-Oh, she's in bed.

988
00:59:25,937 --> 00:59:27,939
-She turned in a while ago.
-Mmm.

989
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,325
Oh goodness. There they are.

990
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:43,246
[chuckles] I was about to
put these back in the fridge.

991
00:59:44,122 --> 00:59:46,124
-Oh, damn--
-[sobs]

992
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:51,629
Huh? What's the matter? Are you all right?

993
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,301
Just a second. I have an important call.

994
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:00,972
Hello?

995
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,102

998
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:39,969
[Chief] I told you to stop the reporters!

999
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:42,180
[agent] No matter how much we try,
it's not enough,

1000
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:43,931
especially with the foreign news outlets.

1001
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,433
[Moohyuk] I'm worried about
Inspector Seon.

1002
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:46,559
I haven't seen her in a while.

1003
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,896
[Chief] Things are a mess here anyway,
so I told her to go home.

1004
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:53,650
This has been a thorough shitshow,
so Inspector Seon needs a rest too.

1005
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:54,651
Dammit!

[footsteps approaching]

1011
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,352
I'm sorry.

1012
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:33,022
I mean…

1013
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:37,985
I felt like I owe you an apology.

1014
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:40,530
[sighs]

1015
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:44,992
Earlier today, I saw on the news…

1016
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,496
Well…

1017
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:51,082
that's really nothing.

1018
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:53,626
Things can get messy
at work sometimes you know.

1019

[inhales deeply]

1020
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,466
So, I should go.

1021
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:05,221
Isn't it exhausting? [sighs]

1022
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:07,598
Living like that?

1023
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,937
[breathes deeply]

1024
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,773
Around all the macho police officers

1025
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:20,027
or your family who depend on only you,

1026
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,740
you can't tell them you're having
a hard time

1027
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:25,450
and you don't want to seem weak.

1028
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,369
So you're acting like you're strong.

1029
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:36,002
Acting strong got me where I am now.

1030
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:38,588
I don't care about
the gossip behind my back,

1031
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:42,508
or if my horrible ex-husband
is elected President or whatever.

1032
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:45,887
To protect my family,

1033
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:51,434
I have no choice but to be
the smartest, strongest person.

you don't have a shoulder to cry on?

-Sunho.
-[Professor] You look exhausted.

1038
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:15,458
Seems like you need someone to talk to.

Do you want to come in for a coffee?

1042

Maybe a stronger drink?

that things he would never have predicted
