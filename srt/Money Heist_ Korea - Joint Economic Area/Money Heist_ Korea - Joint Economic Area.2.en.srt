00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:23,023
[Tokyo] Some parts
are only 30 meters wide,

4
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,026
so many of the North Korean defectors
would use it to escape.

00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,319
If you were lucky,
you could get to South Korea

or find your way to another free country.

[Tokyo] The number of people

grew every time Berlin
was thrown into isolation.

[Professor] What's the situation?

56
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,366
[Berlin] The ones in the factory
are working nonstop.

57
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:47,370
Now we have the other hostages
taking shifts, either cooking or working.

58
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,330
Keeps them
so they don't have time to think.

59
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,001
Getting control of the hostages
is what's most important.

60
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,962
We need to make them believe
that they'll be safe

61

as long as they cooperate.

Would that really be enough?

I mean, I'm just saying.

64
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,932

Stop dragging your feet

The ones who worked through the night
need those sleeping bags.

[Tokyo] Following the Professor's plan
we split the hostages into groups

75
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,810
and made them work
to keep them from getting too anxious.

I had to dig some tunnel
in the underground storage area.

What, so they were
never really going to leave?

They really are crafty.

Hey, make up an excuse
so they put you in a different group.

Hey, you.

So where were you?

Were you out with that man again?

That's where you were

Huh.

103

What's going on with him?

Are things not going well?

to see you meet a nice man before I die?

111

I want the best for you.

00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:32,535
[sighs] You shouldn't ask me for that.

113

You just need to live a long life

Are you going back to the Mint.

It looks like it's very dangerous.

117
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,134
Just be safe, okay?

118

00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:41,562
[reporter 1] Were you already aware
that the student in yesterday's video

134
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,524
is Anne Kim, the daughter
of the US Ambassador Marshall Kim?

135
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,734
We will be holding
an official briefing, so--

136
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,403
[reporter 2] Is it true that there was
an attempted raid last night?

137
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,989
The word is that members from the North
will assume responsibility

138
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,824
for the failed attempt
and will be replaced.

-[reporter 3] Huh?
-[cameras clicking]

141
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,040
[reporter 1] So it's true
that you've attempted raid?

142
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,583
No, that's fake news.

[reporters clamoring]

144
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:07,129
The safety of the hostages
is our utmost priority.

145
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,840
We'll have to find out more
about the suspects' intended plans,

146
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:13,511
but please understand that Miss Anne Kim
is just one of the many hostages

147
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:14,720
that we need to rescue.

148
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,764
Fake news? Can we say something like that?

149
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,850
[Woojin] There wasn't any exchange
of fire, and we aborted immediately.

150
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,894
We just need to state
that we considered a raid,

151
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,355
but decided against it
for the sake of the hostages.

[sucks teeth]

153

Do you think that's okay? The reporters
will have us all under a microscope.

154
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,571
[Woojin] We have no choice.

155
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,156
The minute we admit
there was an attempted raid,

156
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,200
it's gonna stir up a powderkeg
of public opinion.

157
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:39,537
Then one of us is gonna have
to take responsibility for its failure.

working flawlessly as one,

160
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:50,590
and all under the guidance
of the so-called Professor.

161
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:55,177
We also need to work as a team
to go up against them.

162
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,345
Do you agree, Captain?

163
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,850
From now on, I will be in charge

00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:04,186
of making all decisions
in the negotiation process,

165
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,480
from the Special Operation Unit

166
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,692
to every piece of information
we share with the press.

167
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,237
If you all agree,
let's begin the briefing in ten.

168
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,534
[twinkly electronic music plays]

169
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,675
Here's a summary of the information
received from the operation.

170
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:36,802
Thank you.

171
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,810
[Woojin] Let's summarize the situation.

172
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,021
Yes, the raid that we attempted
has failed,

173
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,274
but we were able to get an understanding
of their combat capacity.

174
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,859
[Moohyuk] They're excessively armed.

175
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,695
And they knew we were going to raid
and were already prepared for that.

176
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,698
And they've definitely had
some kind of military training.

177
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:01,243
Maybe they really do have
some kind of political agenda.

178
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:05,373
If they had an agenda, they would've sent
a clear political message by now.

179
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,250
They might show their true intentions
when things get tense later.

180
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,418
[inhales deeply]

181
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,837
But for now we can't be so sure.

182
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,632
And the ambassador's daughter?
Did they know about the field trip?

183
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:15,800
We can't rule that out.

184
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,719
In any case,
we definitely know one thing for sure.

185
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:24,100
They are not just any bank robbers.

186
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:29,105
[reporter] The sun has come up
on another day

187
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,774
and the Korean Mint
is still deadly silent.

188
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:35,027
In response to some media reports
on last night's attempted raid,

189
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,279
the joint task force stated
that is untrue,

190
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,157
and they will do their best
to ensure the safety of the hostages.

191
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,284
-[phone rings]
-[TV mutes]

192
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,041
Are the hostages all right?

193
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:50,876
[Professor] Of course.

194
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,003
Anyway, I have question.

195
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,880
[Woojin] Yes?

196
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,883
[Professor] When was the last time
you had sex?

197
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:03,097
Why aren't you answering?
You're not seeing anyone?

198
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,602
That is a very personal question to ask.

199
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,229
[Professor] Too bad.

200
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:13,524
I thought having a conversation
about personal topics

201
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,693
was a good way
of building a rapport in a crisis.

202
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,862
Then how about this?

203
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,365
Have you ever faked an orgasm?

204
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:23,534
-What?
-[Professor] Don't be shy.

205
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,662
Half of all women have faked an orgasm.

206
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,705
Well, I…

207
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,417
Not every time,
but maybe I have occasionally.

208
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,503
Faking it can help smooth things over
in a relationship.

209
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,964
But that's just lying to your partner,

210
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:39,258
like the special forces
you sent last night.

211
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,844
You know you're the one who lied to us.

212
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:46,307
You said there were four of you.
That slip intentionally?

213
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,225
Must have been difficult

214
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,895
to bring costumes for all those hostages.

215
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:51,937
[tuts]

216
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,566
-I like to be ready for everything.
-[Woojin] Ready for everything?

217
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,612
Do bank robbers normally
come prepared to take hostages?

218
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,363
[Professor] That's not the issue here.

219
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,450
The issue is that we haven't been honest
with each other.

220
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,036
Don't play with me, Inspector.

221
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,788
You'll put us all in danger.

222
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,956
[sighs] I'm in charge of this operation,

223
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,708
so there will be no more lying
from now on.

224
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:15,085
Well, I can't just trust you.

225
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,629
[inhales deeply]

226
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,800
The priority is for us
to get to know each other.

227
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,426
Build a relationship.

228
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,637
Just give me a call when you're ready

229
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,680
to tell me about your last orgasm.

230
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,977
Oh, that son of a bitch.

231
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,229
He's a lunatic.

232
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,146
He's not.

233
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,942
He's actually quite skilled
in negotiating.

234
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,199
Someone who doesn't say what they want
is always the most difficult opponent.

235
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:49,703
But he's gonna make a request soon enough.
Is there food inside the Mint?

236
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:52,206
There is a cafeteria,
and given the number of people,

237
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,667
it should last, um… maybe four days?

238
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,126
So they're fine for now.

239
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,381
But it's not an easy job
to keep about 50 hostages under control.

240
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,216
They'll be thinking of ways to flee,

241
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,677
but they don't have a way
to cross the border.

242
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,055
[sighs] They'll gradually get anxious.

243
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,057
But what if it drags on
longer than expected?

244
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,935
-We have the upcoming summit.
-The side that rushes loses this game.

245
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,938
That confident attitude of theirs
is bound to change soon.

246
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,190
So let's buy us some time.

247
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,988
[Tokyo] But in reality,
we were the ones buying time.

248
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,699
The phrase "Time is money"

249
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,368
is the perfect description
for our situation.

250
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,037
Hey, are you not checking the ink
on the plate?

251
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,833
There's a misting because
the tack is too high. Go change the ink.

252
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,752
[sighs] But Mr. Cheongmyung,

253
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:41,922
the robbers are forcing us
to help them print all of this money.

254
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,091
There's no reason for us to do it right.

255
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,844
Since when do we really care
about whose money this'll be

256
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,679
after it makes it out of this place?

257
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:51,974
[grunts]

258
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,814
There's misting over there.

259
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,276
I also see mottling
at the edge. [pops gum]

260
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,486
I think there's a problem
with the ink quality!

261
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,491
[chuckles] You're Ri Cheongmyung,
aren't you?

262
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,953
You got famous
for creating the superdollar.

263
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,414
[whispers] I'm a huge fan.

264
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,249
You wanna make history?

265
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,754
Yeah.

266
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,177
[drilling]

267
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,894
Stop. Stop!

268
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,023
How many times have I told you
to aim for the center of the cross?

269
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,943
You've made a complete mess everywhere.

270
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,779
[sighs] Hand it over.

271
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,408
So look, you stand in this position,

272
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,535
then you aim for the center, and…

273
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,371
[imitates sound of drill]

274
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,748
-Why can't you do this, huh?
-Oh man.

275
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,667
He totally sucks at this.

276
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:04,004
[clears throat] Okay, here,
why don't you try this again? Here. Here!

277
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,130
[sighs]

278
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,217
I, uh…

279
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:13,889
I'm… not the kind of person
who does work like this.

280
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,557
[Denver] What?

281
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,227
Hey, listen. Are you saying

282
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,437
that some of us
are meant for this job then?

283
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,439
[chuckles] I mean,

284
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,608
I'm the Director
of the Korea Mint. [chuckles]

285
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,026
What does that mean?

286
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,152
-Huh?
-Oh!

287
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,279
Are you saying that you're too precious

288
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,532
-to do manual work? You little…
-[whimpers]

289
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,242
Hey. Hey! Stop it.

290
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,660
[Denver] Hey, come on.

291
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,078
Let me go, Dad!

292
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,957
I just wanna see if this smart guy doesn't
feel pain even when he gets beat up!

293
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,000
Stop! Stop!

294
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,127
You were just dancing
around a huge pile of cash

295
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,503
only a short while ago.

296
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:45,963
Why are you acting insane again?

297
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,632
He's just been fucking around
doing nothing,

298
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,885
trying to weasel
outta doing anything helpful at all, okay?

299
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:52,970
-Damn it!
-[whimpers]

300
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,389
He needs to learn his lesson right now
at the beginning.

301
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:59,393
-Then you need to use your words, okay?
-[Berlin] Anything fun going on in here?

302
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,396
Oh, no, um…

303
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,273
So what brings you here?

304
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,984
I just wanted to take a look around.

305
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,362
My director friend,
how's the work treating you?

306
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,823
[breathing shakily]

307
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,950
Uh… Well…

308
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,410
[exhales nervously]

309
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,996
Hey, I already told you
that I like you, right?

310
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,749
-Seems like my eyes are always on you.
-[Director chuckles nervously]

311
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,125
[Berlin chuckles]

312
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,712
We're all friends on the same boat, hmm?

313
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:28,672
So be good to each other.

314
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,175
[chuckles]

315
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:34,762
-Yeah, yeah, of course, of course.
-Hmm.

316
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,638
[Berlin] Hey, Denver.

317
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:38,682
A word?

318
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,518
I mean, that son of a bitch,

319
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:45,189
he spends all his time
looking down on me and my dad,

320
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:48,692
always acting out like an asshole,
pissing me off and shit.

321
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,945
-It's just fucking annoying.
-Yeah, fuck that asshole. Here.

322
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,948
[lighter clicks]

323
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,203
[coughs]

324
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,206
Where's this from? North Korea?

325
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,916
This is the real deal. [scoffs]

326
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,334
[coughs]

327
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,544
He's pissing you off?

328
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,962
[smacks lips] You're so naive.

329
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,715
You know, getting too swayed
by your emotions

330
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,509
can turn into your greatest weakness.

331
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,053
You're the expert on fights,
you should know better.

332
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,554
Why are you acting like this?

333
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,391
I… I mean,

334
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,478
my dad hasn't been in great condition.

335
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:26,897
I don't know,

336
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,650
I guess I'm just starting
to get a little worried, you know?

337
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,777
About both of us
making it out of here safely.

338
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,028
I understand.

339
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:40,202
Denver, do you think I would get involved
with something doomed to fail?

340
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,039
[inhales deeply]

341
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,291
-I don't.
-[Berlin] No. All right?

342
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,168
So stop thinking about all of that.

343
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,296
You just do your job
and this whole plan is gonna work.

344
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,048
Believe me. I'll make sure of it.

345
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,134
[solemn music playing]

[coughs]

347
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,186
Ugh, this is totally gross!

348
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,689
[inhales deeply, mutters]

349
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,151
What did he say to you?

350
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,069
I mean, nothing much.

351
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,406
-Hey, Dad?
-[Moscow] Yeah.

352
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,200
-That Berlin guy.
-Hmm.

353
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,536
He actually seems like a pretty good guy.

354
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,787
You silly…

355
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,584
You're going to need to get your temper
under control, boy, okay?

356
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,545
You get worked up so easily over nothing--

357
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,590
-Hey, hey, stop nagging me.
-[sighs]

358
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,260
You are exactly like your mom sometimes.

359
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,096
Shit.

360
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,347
They going to kill us?

361
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,850
I mean, it doesn't really seem like it.

362
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,268
Just think about it.

363
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,895
We know all of their faces,

364
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,606
watched every single thing
they've been up to from the beginning.

365
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,399
You really think they'll keep us alive

366
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,526
after we print all of the money
and dig this tunnel?

367
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:55,819
When we're of no use to them?

368
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,072
Well, there may be one use,
as bullet shields.

369
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,158
[sighing]

370
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,578
-We can't just stay like this.
-What do you want to do then, huh?

371
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,413
We need to call the police.

372
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:09,041
If we can somehow
get in touch with the police,

373
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,667
all their tricks will be useless.

374
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,794
But they took
all of our cell phones though.

375
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,755
How do you suggest
we get in touch with them?

376
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,341
Well, have any good ideas?

377
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:22,554
Mr. Park, you remember what I emphasize
in every single staff training?

378
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,807
-Uh, what, sir?
-[Director] Making a sacrifice.

379
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,310
Yeah,I remember, but why--

380
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,229
Vice Director, you hold onto his arms.

381
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,606
Wh… What are you… What are you doing?

382
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,358
Sir, please stop him!

383
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,109
Uh, wait, I…

384
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,237
I don't know what this is about,

385
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,614
but if you need a sacrifice,
I can volunteer.

386
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:44,201
Don't you ever talk about that woman!
How many times have I told you that?

387
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,703
Fine. But how dare
you call her "that woman"

388
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,038
when she's given birth to you!

389
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,414
Well, I don't think of her,

390
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:52,459
the person who left her baby behind
and ran away, as my mom.

391
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,044
What are you talking about?

392
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:58,590
-Hey, listen, boy, you know your mom was--

-[Moscow] What's all the noise?

394
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,971
What… What happened?

395
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,056
Oh no.

[Denver] What? What happened, huh?

397
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,268
The shovel, by accident…

398
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,144
-[Moscow] The shovel?
-[Denver] Fucking idiot!

00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,107
-Who the fuck did this?
-[Moscow] You should've been careful.

400
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,275
It… It was me, sir.

401
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,693
How did you do that?

402
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,570
That is not important right now.
Hurry, get the first-aid kit!

[Moscow] Oh,
you should've been more careful!

and there are tons of screens, okay?

422
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:56,500
So please, tell me,
what was my director friend doing

423
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,002
wandering around
outside of his work zone, huh?

424
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,088
I… I was just…

425
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,427
Isn't he on the worker team?
Under Moscow and Denver, yeah?

426
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,263
-[Denver] This way. Come on in.
-[door opens]

Huh? What's going on?

-What happened here?
-You tell me what happened.

Uh, well, the…

Oh! Ah…

00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:23,819
Ah, this man, he was injured
while we were working.

00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,404
Yeah, so?

433
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,031
He's not just an employee.
He's like family to me.

00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,283

to look for a first-aid kit and then--

Uh… Um…

439
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,753
I didn't want to be punished
for going outside of my area.

I'm telling the truth!

441
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,006
[Tokyo] You did leave your area.

442
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:48,009
and you were able to escape
because the surveillance was lax.

-Huh?
-[sighs]

I mean…

You have to understand, there was blood,
and it was total chaos everywhere.

446
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,354
And no one even knew
that he had disappeared.

447
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,981
How was I supposed to know? Damn it!

448
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,483
Am I right?

449
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,655
-Yes, you're right.
-See, I told you!

450
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:12,159
Okay. Well, I guess
what's done is done, so…

[Berlin] Attention, everyone.

Starting from this moment,
North Koreans, stand to my left,

458
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:36,349
and South Koreans will stand to my right.

459

Now move.

Come on, move it! Let's go!

I'm not really either of those.

You're exempt.

to treat you all humanely,

if anyone disobeys
or puts everyone's safety at risk.

If a South Korean is at fault,
North Koreans will be punished,

if you don't wanna be punished

for something that someone
on the other side did?

00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,811
Do you wanna know what it'll be?

480
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,230
[chuckles nervously] Uh… I just…

481
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,525
-Uh…
-[You'll find out soon.

482
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,987
Although you're really
better off not knowing.

483
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,749
[Professor] Situations can get complicated
when there a lot of hostages,

484
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,335
so what's the most effective way
to take control?

485
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:30,088
I mean,
we should just lock all of them up, right?

486
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:33,758
Hey, stupid,
who's gonna print the money? Cows?

487
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:34,968
-Huh?
-[all laugh]

488
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,012
[Denver] There's gonna be cows there?

489
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,850
The most ideal way is to make them believe

490
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,394
that cooperating with us
is beneficial to them too.

491
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:47,272
The second best method
is rewarding good behavior.

492
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:50,191
Lastly, the favored tactic
of Imperialists,

493
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,152
like the UK, Mongolia, and Japan.

494
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,946
The primary way
that each of them managed to control

495
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,032
and divide the people in their colonies.

496
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,784
So what you're saying
is we split them up, correct?

497
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,536
That's right.

498
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,454
DIVIDE AND RULE

499
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:05,749
We need to turn them against each other
so they forget who the real enemy is.

500
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,794
But I don't recommend this method.
Consider this last resort.

501
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,838
We need to do our best…

502
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,633
"…to treat them humanely
and coax them into cooperation."

503
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,176
That's what the Professor said.

504
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,845
-Isn't it?
-When did I ever treat them inhumanely?

505
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,222
All I did was split them
into North and South.

506
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,475
It's been that way for over 70 years.

507
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,810
-[gun clatters]
-Making them monitor each other?

508
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,521
You might as well have just forced them
to fight to the death.

509
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,608
Or this might bring them closer.

510
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:34,986
I mean, a North Korean hostage might cover
for a South Korean hostage's mistake

511
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,279
to avoid punishment.

512
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,949
[chuckles] Though I guess
that is pretty unlikely.

513
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,957
Is this fun for you, to play the games
that you used to play back at home?

514
00:27:48,041 --> 00:27:51,544
I just decided that it was necessary to
have a little bit of tension among them.

515
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,798
Just like what we have.

516
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,137
If you wanted to set an example,
you could've just punished the Director.

517
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,555
What, should I starve him?

518
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:06,059
You think that will really change someone?
You know better than that.

519
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:10,647
Get yourself together.
This isn't a prison camp.

520
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,358
I just awakened
their underlying human nature.

521
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,735
The way we treat the hostages
hasn't changed.

522
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:18,238
Make them trust you
and treat them humanely.

523
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:20,573
Stick to the plan
and everything will be fine, right?

524
00:28:21,991 --> 00:28:23,535
I really hope that's true.

525
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,956

[pensive music playing]

530
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,270
[hostage] This is a rookie mistake!

531
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,439
If you make a mistake,
we're the ones who suffer!

532
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,274
Hey, what's the matter now?

533
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,776
This idiot messed up the print again.

534
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,571
Why are you fucking blaming me?
Because I'm from the South, asshole?

535
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:00,572
Hey!

536
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,032
You guys, come on. That's enough.

537
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:07,287
I never thought I'd live
to see this happen all over again.

538
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,876
Even if it's a little boring up here,
this would be a better place to stay.

539
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,130
[sniffles]

540
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,467
-What's up?
-You're pretty cute.

541
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,885
I mean, for a criminal.

542
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,386
[chuckles] Sassy.

543
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,807
I'll be watching you.
Don't do anything stupid, understood?

544
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,894
Kids these days.

545
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,900
[combat music playing]

546
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:40,403
[Moohyuk] There are only a few
sniper teams on site for surveillance.

547
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,780
Others are on standby.

548
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,114
So now what?

549
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,993
Do we just wait for them to surrender
with their hands on top of their heads?

550
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,912
We're just getting started.

551
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,831
We can't try
to rush a positive outcome, can we?

552
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:53,958
[sighs]

553
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,467
-So do we have anything?
-[sighs]

554
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,304
There's no radio frequency.
We can't detect any communication devices.

555
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,889
What about the cameras inside?

556
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:08,848
[sucks teeth]

557
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:12,060
All the networks seem to be shut down.
I think they cut them all.

558
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:12,977
[sighs]

559
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,105
Maybe they also have an IT specialist
on their side?

560
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,025
And how many cell towers
are near the Mint?

561
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:22,445
There's only one network service provider
that's allowed in the JEA.

562
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,322
So that means if we can work with them,

563
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,825
we can get all the signals
within the perimeter, is that right?

564
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:27,909
Yeah.

565
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:30,912
Attention.

566
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,706
Effective immediately, I want everyone

567
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,251
to turn off their phones
and any other devices.

568
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,546
We will use radios to communicate on-site.

569
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,010
[animated, percussive music plays]

570
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,366
Evacuate any civilians nearby

571
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,369
and all the reporters
to outside the perimeter.

572
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,833
[in singsong] Hello.

573
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,085
So, uh, remember that girl, Anne?

574
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:22,672
She said I'm… I'm cute. [chuckles]

575
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,966
She, uh…
She has really great taste, right?

576
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,718
[laughs]

577
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,513
Uh--

578
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,224
So damn arrogant.

579
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,685
ROAD CLOSURE
NO VEHICLES ALLOWED

580
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:46,195
[Woojin] No matter how long the Professor
has prepared for this,

581
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,782
or how perfect or detailed his plan is,

582
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:53,786
a weakness is bound to emerge
as more time goes by.

583
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,330
[inhales deeply]

584
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,459
The hostages
could do something unexpected.

585
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:04,589
Or the suspects
could have internal conflicts.

586
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:10,386
If there's even one drop of water
from the tiniest crack in a dam,

587
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,723
the dam can break, flooding everything,

588
00:32:13,806 --> 00:32:16,017
regardless of how sturdy it is.

589
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,937
And that is the crack we need.

590
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:23,942
[Director] Do you have a minute?

591
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,198
They're watching us. Leave me alone.

592
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,076
[Director] There's a way
to contact the police.

593
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:36,245
Remember the smartwatch
that I only used to contact you?

594
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,122
It's inside a drawer in my office.

595
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,291
And if one of us gets our hands
on that watch,

596
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,919
we can tell the police these criminals
are stalling to print money.

597
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,421
Then the police will have to take action
and do something.

598
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,340
What do you think they're going to do?

599
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,634
Even if they get in,
they can't tell us apart.

600
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,302
Come on, just trust me.

601
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,554
We can turn the tables on them

602
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,557
if we can let someone on the outside
know what's going on.

603
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:59,852
So I was wondering, do you think
you could bring me that watch?

604
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:01,521
Really?

605
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,941
So you're telling me you want me to do
the most dangerous part?

606
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,151
-No, it's not like that.
-[sighs exasperatedly]

[grunts]

608
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,323
Do you think
I'm doing all this for my own sake?

609
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,575
We need to put an end to this
any way we can.

610
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,619
As both Director of the Mint and your man,

611
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,204
I've had a lot of time to think.

612
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,165
And faced with
this life-or-death situation,

613
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,583
I actually know now.

614
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:23,960
-[Misun gasps]
-I do love you.

615
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,878
You're the only one for me.

616
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,964
I'm getting a divorce
the minute I'm out of here.

617
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,633
Uh…

618
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,261
I don't believe you.

619
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,264
You don't have to,
but we'll die if we stay put, okay?

620
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,932
I'm doing this so we can live.

621
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,892
You're the only person
who can get the watch.

622
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,770
-The only one who can make the phone call.
-But how can I--

623
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,397
Hey, over there!

624
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,524
-What are you doing?
-[exhales]

625
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:49,777
I, um, actually…

626
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,406
she's pregnant, and I just…

627
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,993
got really worried because she…
because she suddenly started retching.

628
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,706
Is this true?

629
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:03,958
Uh…

630
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,546
Mmm, yeah.

631
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,757
[Director] So can she take a break?

632
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,092
It's still so early.
She could miscarry if she overdoes it.

633
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,763
Oh, really? Okay.

634
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,181
Come on. Just follow me.

635
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:21,225
Uh…

[door closes]

637
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,493
Good, I was so bored
all alone without my phone.

638
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:39,786
What's your name?

639
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,665
What? I don't belong on either side?

640
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,876
Why is that so important?

641
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,212
It's ridiculous they're spying
on each other

642
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,339
when we're all
in the same situation. [tsks]

643
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,633
I don't understand.

644
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,053
Because you've never been
in a situation like that.

645
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,888
There are just some things that…

646
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,226
people have no choice but to do.

647
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,146
Is anyone monitoring
the Director's office over there?

648
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:08,856
Mm-hmm.

649
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,817
And probably this room, too.

650
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:12,819
Why?

00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,281
[exhales]

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,618
Something's up, right?

653
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,123
What is it?
I might be able to help you with it.

654
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,334
Oh, no, it's nothing.

655
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,588
What? You think I'll tell someone?

[tense music playing]

[Misun inhales deeply]

663
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,068
So, uh, I…

664
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,780
I need to use the bathroom,
I'm on my period.

665
00:35:57,864 --> 00:35:59,574
Oh, um… Will it take long?

666
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:01,576
I'll only be a minute.

667
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,036
Mmm.

668
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,789
You stay put right where you are.

Uh, no, um…

677
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,229
It's because you're taking so long.

678

Come on, put them up right now!

00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,123
Shoot me.

Shoot me!

Put your hands up right now!

707
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,254

Tokyo used to yell at me
because I always forgot this too.

Um… [exhales nervously]

718
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:29,992
I was…

719
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,328
starting to get really hungry,

720
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,289
so I was looking for something to eat.

721
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,583
[chuckling] Ah, I get it.

722
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,126
Actually,

723
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,838
I wasn't sure what would be good
for a pregnant woman,

724
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,800
so I just brought everything
I could get my hands on. [chuckles]

725
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,760
Have anything you want. It's all yours.

You're the only thing in the world
that the baby has right now,

729
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,519
so even if it's hard for you,
you have to eat some of this

730
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,520
and keep going on.

731
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,398
So, what would you like?

732
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,112
-A little bit of the milk…
-Okay.

733

Oh, well, wait a second.

734
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,409
This is a little cold.

735
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,868
I'll warm it up for you.

[trembling breath]

747
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,323
Did he hit you?

748
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,909
[trembling breath]

749
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:57,037
I knew it. That goddamn son of a bitch!

750
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,374
From the moment I saw him I knew that
fucking scumbag was totally full of shit!

No, he…

00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,421
It's not that.

754
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,965
The problem is… he's married.

755

[inhales deeply]

756
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,685
So…

757
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:22,438
So, you and him, you're…
you're having an affair?

758
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:24,940
Okay. [exhales]

759
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:25,983
Sure, okay.

760
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,651
Okay. But what about the baby?

761
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,071
Did he tell you to get an abortion?

762
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,365
[nervous breathing]

763
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,494
I do…

764
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,454
really want to have a child with him,

765
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,582
but I don't think he wants the same thing.

766
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,835
Why, that fucking son of a bitch!
That asshole.

767
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,504
That fucking asshole!

768
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,298
-What are you doing in here?
-[Denver] It's nothing.

769
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,009
Hey, you, come with me.

770
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,512
[exasperated sigh] You can drink this.

771
00:41:57,431 --> 00:41:59,141
[Rio] That fucking bastard.

[sighs]

773
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,776
Do we know whose number
the call was from inside?

774
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,946
It's a smartwatch model under the name
of Cho Youngmin, the Director of the Mint.

775
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,365
[sighs] A hostage. Good.
That's what I thought.

776
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:18,035
-Why'd they turn it off so fast?
-They're probably under close watch,

777
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,370
or maybe they were found out.

[phone ringing]

782
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,227
Inspector Sun,
you know how to play hard to get.

783
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,312
[Woojin] Were you waiting for my call?

784
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:46,939
I was.

785
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,609
You ready to talk about your orgasms now?

786
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,613
[sighs]

787
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,743
You asked me
when was the last time I had one.

788
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:01,495
[Professor] I did.

789
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:03,455
[Woojin] About…

790
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:05,332
two months ago.

791
00:43:05,874 --> 00:43:06,709
With whom?

792
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,711
What kind of person was he?

793
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:11,255
I'd just met the guy that day.

794
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,425
[Professor] One-night stand?

795
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,552
Yeah, that's right.

796
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,180
[Professor] Was he good?

797
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,435
I'd say we were very compatible.

798
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,070
[exhales]

799
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,324
Are we done now?

00:43:38,907 --> 00:43:40,534
Because it's my turn
to ask you a question.

801
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,703
Sure.

802
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,455
What did you do with the hostages' phones?

803
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,082
Did you collect them and turn them off?

804
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,628
How do you know?
Are you watching us in here or something?

805
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:54,423
[scoffs] Detecting radio signals
is part of protocol.

806
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,883
Why?

807
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,928
If a hostage tries to call you?

808
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,056
[Woojin] Anyone. You never know.

809
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,391
A situation could arise
where they need help.

810
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,435
And it's our job to help them.

811
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:08,812
[Professor] Don't you worry.

812
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:12,107
It's not like
this is some five-star hotel,

813
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,902
but everyone in here
is being well taken care of.

814
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:15,861
[scoffs]

815
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:17,863
I'm glad to hear that.

816
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,492
You do have a lot of them to care for.

817
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:25,120
-Please let me know if you need anything.
-You know it won't be for free.

818
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:26,872
I'll get back to you.

819
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,499
[call disconnects]

820
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,671
They don't know about the watch yet.

821
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,589
This might be the first time
since the beginning

822
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,424
that things are working out in our favor.

823
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,218
The problem is…

824
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,512
how do we get in touch with them

825
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:44,598
without the hostages getting caught when
they finally turn the watch on again?

826
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,141
You have any ideas on how to do that?

827
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,227
Since it'll be difficult for them to talk,

828
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,479
we can text them, let them know
we're the police and send a link.

829
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:53,190
If they click it, it'll create a backdoor,
and we can hack in.

830
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,776
We'll be able to hear everything
without having to talk to them?

831
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,070
[agent] Depending on the model,
we could get a video feed.

832
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,405
[sighs] Let's do it.

833
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,447
Yes.

834
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,835
Next group up. Time for your shift.

835
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:16,755
[grunts]

836
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,264
[Denver] Hey! You!

837
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,728
-Are you insane?
-Huh?

838
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,771
How could you ask her
to do something like that?

839
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,566
And you think you can
still call yourself a man?

840
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:37,901
Uh, uh…

841
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,194
I was…

842
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,071
[grunts]

843
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,031
You need to step up
and take responsibility

844
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,450
if she has your child!

845
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,076
[chuckles I know.

846
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,203
I know that, uh…

847
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:51,832
I know, but…
Actually, I just, I was gonna…

848
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,792
Why are you still talking?

849
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,919
-I'll cut your tongue off.
-[whimpers]

850
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,463
Come on, please stop.

851
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:01,258
I know what kind of man he is,
and I was getting sick of him, anyway.

852
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,302
[coughs]

853
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:04,553
[Denver] That's true.

854
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:06,930
A bastard like you
doesn't even deserve to be a parent.

855
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:07,973
[coughs]

856
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,808
[Oslo] Denver.

857
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,268
[Denver] Okay.

858
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:13,520
[Oslo] Move.

859
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,647
[coughs]

860
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,983
And what the fuck are you staring at?

861
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,860
Up! Right now!

862
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,199
Hurry up!

863
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,533
You son of a bitch.

864
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,161
[tense music playing]

865
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,888
[Tokyo] On the surface,
nothing seemed off.

866
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,891
But the Professor sensed
something wasn't right

867
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,852
after hearing how relaxed she sounded
on the phone.

868
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:56,814
It suggested they had an advantage,
whatever it might be.

869
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:03,779
[ringing tone]

870
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,489
[phone ringing]

871
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:07,950
[clears throat]

872
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,536
-[Rio on phone] Yeah?
-Where's Berlin?

873
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:12,454
He's on inspection. Why?

874
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:15,290
-Is there something going on over there?
-Something?

875
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:17,751
Okay.

876
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,045
There is something really big going on.

877
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:21,547
[breathes nervously]

878
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,926
-Tell me.
-Fine. I'll tell you. I'm getting bored.

879
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,221
[laughs]

880
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,516
[grunts loudly, stretching]

881
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,901
ARE YOU BUSY?

882
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:49,157
HOUR 28 INTO THE HEIST

883
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,418
Looks like prepping to hack takes a while.

884
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,379
Maybe an hour or two?

885
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,216
[chuckles]

886
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,887
That's normal, considering
we've been on alert this whole time.

887
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,848
You should go out
and get something to eat, Captain.

888
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,433
Yes. You should do the same.

889
00:48:14,516 --> 00:48:16,643
You haven't eaten anything
since early morning.

890
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:18,604
Hmm.

891
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,647
Move your ass! Come on!

892
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:24,151
You weaseling out of work again?

893
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,279
No, really,
my stomach doesn't feel so good.

894
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:31,199
Ugh, you dirty piece of shit.

895
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:32,868
[sighs]

896
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:34,745
Go, and make it quick.

897
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:36,955
Yeah.

898
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,625
[suspenseful music playing]

[computer beeping]

901
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,396
-We have a signal again!
-What?

902
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,398
-Let's hear it.
-[agent] Yes.

903
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,025
[radio signal crackling]

904
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,946
[man] So two tangsuyuk, ten jjajangmyeon,

905
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,448
ten jjamppong
and one samseon jjamppong, right?

906
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,450
[officer] Yes.
Make samseon jjamppong less spicy.

907
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,910
The Chief hates spicy food, okay?

908
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:17,996
[sighs]

909
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:20,832
-Chief, I ordered in.
-Okay.

910
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,960
You said we'd be waiting around
for a while.

911
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:25,253
I mean, we have to eat, don't we?

912
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:28,340
I heard jjajangmyeon is very popular
in North Korea.

913
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,717
I ordered half and half, of course.

914
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,557
[door creaking]

915
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,101
Wha-- What is it?

916
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,936
-Keep the door open.
-Huh?

917
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,646
You're acting suspicious.

918
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:43,605
Very suspicious.

919
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:47,442
[nervous breathing] I understand
that you don't like me,

920
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,070
but if you keep treating me
this inhumanely,

921
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,948
I can't just keep letting this go anymore
since I represent the hostages.

922
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,866
Wow, you have a lot to say.

923
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,161
Do you not need to go?

924
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,289
[Youngmin sighs]

925
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,254

[phone vibrates]

928
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,408
COME BY IF YOU HAVE TIME.
I'LL MAKE YOU A SANDWICH.

929
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,286
[Woojin] What is this?

930
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,621
I thought you already had it made.

931
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,082
[Professor] I thought you would come late
like you always do,

932
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:45,834
playing hard to get.

933
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,169
[chuckles] You know?

934
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,170
[Woojin chuckles]

935
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,296
[Professor laughs]

936
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:53,300
So if you're so busy all of a sudden,
does that mean something bad happened?

937
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,635
Ah, no, the opposite.

938
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:00,724
I think we might be able
to make something happen.

939
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,270
What is that something?

940
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:09,149
[Woojin inhales] Well, I can't say,
for security reasons.

941
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,484
I'm sorry.

942
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,487
[sighs] Here, food's ready.

943
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,030
-[chuckles]
-Looks delicious.

[phone vibrating]

00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:18,617
Oh.

946
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:20,452
Oh. Please, take the call.

947
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,787
Thanks.

948
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,246
[vibrating continues]

949
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,757
Hey. Are we all set?

950
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:36,718
[agent] Yes. Took us some time
because the model was unusual.

951
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,054
So all we need is for them
to turn on the smartwatch again.

952
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:41,014
Once they turn it on
and click on the link sent,

953
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,058
the hacking tool will install itself,

954
00:51:43,141 --> 00:51:45,060
which will then
automatically restart the device.

955
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:47,562
-How long does it take to hack in?
-[agent] 30 seconds.

956
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,981
The watch has a camera
so we can get video, too.

957
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,442
That's good.

958
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:56,988
[clears throat]

959
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:02,035
-Did you finish your call?
-I actually have to go.

960
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,203
Hmm.

961
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,456
I know you're busy.

962
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,292
I'm glad I had a chance to see you.

963
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,796
I'll wrap this up.

964
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:16,258
Why were you eavesdropping on my call?

965
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,262
[exhales]

966
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,555
Woojin, let me--

967
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:24,266
You owe me a good explanation.

968
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:28,353
[gulps]

969
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:31,898
[plate clatters]

970
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,571
[Professor] Woojin.

971
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,701
I know that you're
not that serious about us,

972
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,204
but I feel

973
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,498
that I might be.

974
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:55,630
[exhales]

975
00:52:57,591 --> 00:52:59,259
I'd like to get to know you more,

976
00:53:00,135 --> 00:53:01,595
but we haven't gotten that far,

977
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:04,639
so I thought that
maybe there was another guy

978
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,142
I sound like a complete loser.

979
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,145
Right? I know I do.

980
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,899
But it's been so long
since I've felt this.

981
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:17,277
It's difficult for me

982
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,655
to keep things casual.

983
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:31,124
I really must be on edge
because of the case.

984
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:36,922
[inhales deeply] I'm sorry.

985
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,008
And, uh…

986
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,554
I'm not seeing anyone else.

987
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,765
And this really isn't
because I don't like you.

988
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:51,603
But right now, I just don't think
I'm in a place to be in a relationship.

989
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,605
[breathes nervously] Wait, Woojin…

990
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,066
-Uh…
-I should go.

991
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:03,365
[sighs]

992

-[clears throat]
-Everything good in here?

994
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:30,725
The Professor asked the same question.

995
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,018
But as you can see…

996
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,603
[sighs]

997
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:38,233
Well, that's a bit disappointing.

998
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,409
[phone ringing]

999
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:52,580
Hey.

1000
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:54,874
-Professor, what's up?
-[Professor on phone] Listen.

1001
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,377
One of the hostages
got their hands on a smartwatch

1002
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,796
and they've been trying
to contact the police with it.

1003
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,425
[smacks lips] Okay. I'll handle it.

1004
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,053
[grunts softly]

1005
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:09,889
Hey, what the hell?

1006
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,020
Time for the shift change already? [yawns]

1007
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:17,856
Berlin says to gather up all the hostages.

1008
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:18,940
[Denver] Why?

1009
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,985
[Moscow] We're working
our asses off over here.

1010
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,572
And he just gets to go off
and mess around, playing captain.

1011
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,614
Hey, take a break, Dad.

1012
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,825
-I'll take them, okay?
-Okay.

1013
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:32,412
Okay, let's go! Come on. This way!

1014
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:35,332
-[Moscow] All of you, follow him.
-[Denver] Come this way.

1015
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,834
[pensive music playing]

[door opens]

1017
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:03,318
-Where's Tokyo?
-She's helping Nairobi.

1018
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,653
We have to keep the printer running.

1019
00:56:10,325 --> 00:56:11,409
Is everyone here?

1020
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,126
When I was…

1021
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,337
about this little,

1022
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,839
I was in a prison camp
working in groups of five.

1023
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:27,842
Each group had to
consistently meet a certain quota.

1024
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,512
or else we'd starve for days
and get beaten.

1025
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:34,891
They gave us a homi to work with,
but it was all old and worn.

1026
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,770
And so, one of the members broke theirs.

1027
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,314
What do you think happened next?

1028
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:45,151
[yawns] The other four probably had to
work their asses off to meet the quota.

1029
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,028
[chuckles]

1030
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,154
We didn't.

1031
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,657
We made the one who broke it go

1032
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:53,451
and steal a homi from another group.

1033
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:55,995
If we got lucky and succeeded,

1034
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:58,706
a random group of workers
would get punished.

1035
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:00,750
But if we got caught…

1036
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:04,379
Well, I'll leave it
up to your imagination.

1037
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,514
-[Director whispers] Hide me, okay?
-Are you insane?

1038
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,100
-If they catch us right now--
-I have a bad feeling.

1039
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:18,685
It's either now or never. Get it?

1040
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,019
[beeps]

1041

[beeping]

1043
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:28,278
Looks like we're in.

Are we getting sound?

1048
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,668
[Berlin] Cho Youngmin, step forward.

1049
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:46,629
Huh?

1050
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:47,672
Step forward.

1051
00:57:47,755 --> 00:57:49,299
You, as the Director of this place,

1052
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:51,759
have something to do
on behalf of the hostages.

1053
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,595
Come up.

1054
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:57,390

Uh, why are you giving me this?

1057
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:20,079
It appears that one of our hostages

1058
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:23,249
broke our promise to each other
and tried to contact the outside.

1059
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,377
[breathes nervously]

1060
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,712
[Berlin] You are the Director,

1061
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:31,674
so why don't you take the responsibility
and find the person with the device.

1062
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,760
[tense music continues]

1063

[suspenseful music playing]

1064
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,111
-What's happening?
-I don't know yet.

1065
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,071
Where is the visual?

1066
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,657
We have video, but I think
they're hiding the watch somewhere.

1067
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:57,116

[scanner whining]

1069
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,996
…I tried my very best
to treat you all nicely.

1070
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,831
But one of you

1071
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:06,501
did something to put all of us in danger.

1072
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:08,545
Leaving everyone else
who followed the rules

1073
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,797
to suffer all the consequences.

1074
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,007
Do you think that person is on your side?

1075
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:25,103
My director friend,
that's not how you scan.

they'll leave the hostages alone?

He knows the negotiation is over
the minute they hurt a hostage.

We can't just sit here like this.

and take action--

Do the hostages need anything?

I think that you already know
why I called.

I don't.

1110
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:03,451
Why? Did something happen?

1111
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:05,703
[Professor] The smartwatch.

1112
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:08,206
You said we should trust each other
and negotiate.

1113
01:01:08,289 --> 01:01:10,249
That's going to be more difficult now.

1114
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:13,002
[Woojin] As I said, detecting
radio signals is part of the protocol.

1115
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:16,255
And the hostages can act irrationally
because they're all scared.

1116
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:18,383
[Professor] Yes, I understand.

1117
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,968
Humans will do anything
when they're backed into a corner.

1118
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:23,137
But the same thing applies to us, too.

1119
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:26,474
You know that if you do anything
to the hostages,

01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:29,936
this will make
the negotiations very difficult.

[Professor] That's why I'm calling you.

I'll let this go just once.

1123

But remember,

1124
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:38,778
No second chances.

1125
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,739
I understand.

1126
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:48,162

We need to set an example.

1144
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,851
Hey, what about what the Professor said?

1145
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:54,353
This is what you do in the real world!

1146
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:59,192
Fear is the only real thing
that works to control human beings.

Hey, hey, come on, man.

Come on. This is way too harsh.

If you two had actually done your jobs
and monitored her,

1150

it wouldn't have gotten to this point.
Am I wrong?

to make the hostages scared.

Besides, how could you shoot
a pregnant woman?

1162

What did I say to you earlier
about making sure

you don't get too swayed by your emotions?

Let me ask you.

1165
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:00,670
Do you really think that she's pregnant?

1166

If the watch isn't hers

1182

wouldn't that be really unfair?
