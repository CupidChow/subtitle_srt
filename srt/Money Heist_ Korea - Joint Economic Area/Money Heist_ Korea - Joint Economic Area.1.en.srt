He's always had the heart of a child.
I wonder if he's ever gonna grow up.

-[laughs]
-[scoffs]

700
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,698
[Tokyo] The Professor emphasized
from the beginning

701
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:13,202
that it was important
no one gets hurt or dies.

When the police arrive,

703

act as if you've been caught
while trying to flee, and shoot at them,

704
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,292
and retreat back
into the building to hide,

like a rat caught in a trap.

to fire into the air?

I told you.

708
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,760
Our plan is to not kill or hurt anyone.

709
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,470
But it's not like anyone plans to die.

She's right.
Who knows what's gonna happen?

711
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,100
Couldn't we just kill a few
if the situation calls for it?

712
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,101
Absolutely not.

are getting in the way.

What's with all the comments?

716
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,196
Our job here
is to execute the Professor's plan.

If you can't, then leave.

we asked how high.

What?

00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,220
I mean, if he told you to,

you'd jump into hell

You wouldn't understand even if the answer
smacked you right in the face.

as the head of a Joint Task Force,

[Tokyo] The Korean Peninsula,

Oh no, we're being robbed!
We're being robbed!

809
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,538
Seriously? [sighs]

810
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,582
Look at your room.

811
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:53,917
It looks like
someone actually broke in here.

812
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,794
[woman groans] Today's my day off.

813
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:58,380
Do you have to do this so early?

814
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,299
It's actually lunchtime now.

815
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,760
[woman sighs]

816
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,094
[groans]

817
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,807
PARK SUNHO
ARE WE MEETING TODAY?

818
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,017
[exhales]

819
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,226
[groans]

00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,354
[groans]

00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,025
[sighs]

822
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,529
-And school?
-I got back already.

823
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,072
We're in the middle of exams.

824
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,408
If you must know,
I did well on all my tests.

825
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:30,996
Please don't tell me you wear this
whenever you go on a date.

826
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:33,081
-[chuckles]
-Hey!

827
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,792
Hey, give that back now.

828
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,586
You little… Hey! [chuckles]

829
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,671
Since you did well on your exams,

830
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,466
how 'bout we go out to eat tonight?

831
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,301
Yeah! Okay.

832
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:48,138
Mom, is there anything
you'd like for dinner?

833
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,598
Oh, I don't know.

834
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:52,476
I'm happy as long as someone else
does the cooking for me.

835
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,896
But does your husband
have time to join us tonight?

836
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:01,944
[phone vibrates]

837
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,948
[sighs]

838
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,492
I'm off duty today.

839
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,039
What happened at the Mint?

840
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:22,756
[Berlin] My dear hostages,
please take off your blindfolds.

841
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,967
Come on, everyone. You can take 'em off.

842
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:27,636
[Berlin] It's okay. Please take them off.

843
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,850
[chuckles]

844
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,603
It's so good to finally speak
with you all face-to-face.

845
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,355
There's no need to be afraid.

846
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:41,316
We are all trapped
inside the same building together,

847
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,944
which means we have to work together, hmm?

848
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,416
[ominous music playing]

849
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:03,797
We have no intention
of hurting any of you, trust me.

850
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,884
Each and every one of you will return home
without a single scratch,

851
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,052
as long as you fully cooperate with us.

852
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:10,721
I give you my word.

853
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,432
Let's just have some fun.

854
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,608
[computer keys clack]

855
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:30,407
-[Berlin] How's the communication setup?
-[Rio] Oslo's getting the cable.

856
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,076
[exhales]

857
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,082
[lighter clicks]

858
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,590
[Oslo grunts]

859
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:48,884
[water sloshes]

860
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,346
[groans]

[strains]

863
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,309
[breathes heavily]

864
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,897
-[beeps]
-[Rio] Okay.

865
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:06,652
Mmm.

866
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:10,989
[phone rings]

867
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,325
[Berlin on phone]
Professor, can you hear me?

868
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,451
Are you all okay?

869
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:17,537
Anyone hurt? Are there any injuries?

870
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,624
Then you know what the next step is.

871
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,417
Remember, no casualties.

872
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:29,132
[newsreader] As an unprecedented heist
is currently taking place at the JEA,

873
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,009
it has been reported
that the North and South

874
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,095
have dispatched the Gyeonggi Police Agency

875
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:36,640
and a military unit under
the North's Ministry of State Security.

876
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,725
The two countries
have come to an agreement

877
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,478
and appointed Yun Changsu,
the Chief of the JEA Police,

878
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:43,188
as head of Joint Task Force.

879
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:46,108
South Korean Inspector Seon Woojin
of the Gyeonggi Police Agency

880
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,526
will take charge of negotiations.

881
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,153
[reporter 1] This is the first time
that the North and South police

882
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,280
have conducted a joint operation.
Any concerns?

883
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:53,907
[reporter 2] Given the imminent summit,

884
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,994
how do you think this situation will
shape discussions between the countries?

885
00:49:57,077 --> 00:50:00,706
As the individual in charge
of public safety within the JEA,

886
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,833
I can say
that we are doing our best to resolve this

887
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,710
as safely and peacefully as possible

888
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:07,170
with the feedback
from the two governments in mind.

889
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,088
Oh.

890
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,674
-[reporter 3] Here she is!
-[reporters clamoring]

891
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:13,427
[reporter 4] Do you have a comment?
Any idea how many hostages…

892
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,512
I'm so relieved
to have you working on this with me.

893
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,390
-You had your overview, right?
-Yes. How did the suspects enter?

894
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,559
We think they were onboard
the currency truck.

895
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:22,519
We tracked them down
using surveillance cameras,

896
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:24,646
and we found a section
without a working camera feed.

897
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,273
We figure that's where they got in.

898
00:50:26,773 --> 00:50:29,776
Why didn't the automated alarm go off
when the suspects opened the vault?

899
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,862
No clue. The manual alarm went off though.

900
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,280
I think an employee set it off.

901
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,032
[Woojin] How many hostages are inside?

902
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:38,285
We're not sure,
but the total number of employees is 35.

903
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,829
But the museum was open for visitors,
so there's probably more.

904
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,748
-Let's go inside.
-[sighs exasperatedly]

905
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:43,832
HOUR 3 INTO THE HEIST

906
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,667
-[agent 1] Good to go?
-[agent 2] I'll report.

907
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,503
-[agent 3] Please confirm.
-[agent 4] I did confirm both earlier.

908
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:52,132
Based on empty shells,
they used a replica from the North.

909
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,176
I have a hunch
that the robbers are from there.

910
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,720
Oh, and, uh,
let me formally introduce you two.

911
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,388
I'm Captain Cha Moohyuk,

912
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:00,390
from North Korea's
Ministry of State Security.

913
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:03,685
Seon Woojin,
head of crisis negotiation at Gyeonggi,

914
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:04,936
in South Korea.

915
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:08,440
Thank you for coming all this way,
but this case won't need negotiations.

916
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,195
From what I've just heard, we have no idea

917
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:14,905
how many suspects are armed yet.

918
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,537
The number doesn't matter.
It'll all be over in five minutes

919
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,122
once our special forces go in.

920
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:27,292
We've selected some of our best agents,
and each one has plenty of combat--

921
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,044
Any experience rescuing hostages?

922
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:31,713
There are at least 50 civilians
being held in that building.

923
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,548
If we engage,

924
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,885
how many casualties do you think
we'll have in those five minutes?

925
00:51:55,987 --> 00:51:57,072
[Moohyuk sighs]

926
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:03,995
The culprits won't even have time
to pull the trigger.

927
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,665
Even until just a while ago,
our top agents were training

928
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:09,668
to infiltrate the Blue House
and slit your president's throat.

929
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:15,549
I'm sure you're familiar
with the… Beslan massacre?

930
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:20,095
We're dealing with a national crisis
inside the JEA.

931
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:23,431
How are you going to control the situation
when you're so cowardly--

932
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:26,852
That is why we have
this thing called negotiating.

933
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,397
So why don't you watch and learn?

934
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,650
I'll show you how a normal country
that upholds human rights handles

935
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,862
a situation as precarious as this.

936
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,323
Excuse me?

937
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,617
Uh, what do you think
you're doing right now?

938
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,412
I'm trying my hardest

939
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:50,959
to "resolve the situation peacefully,"
as you've requested, Chief.

940
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:54,880
Imagine what would happen
when news spread that we used force

941
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,174
on the first day and a hostage died.

942
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,720
Your efforts to end your term here
without a problem

943
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,889
and move on to Seoul Headquarters…

944
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,391
[tuts] …will probably
not work out for you.

945
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,061
[sighs, clears throat]

946
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:12,272
You're right. We stick to protocol
and follow the steps.

947
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:15,150
-[Woojin] Hmm.
-Let's go with the negotiations first.

948
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,819
We'll start with negotiations via telecom.

949
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,447
-Get ready.
-[agents] Yes, ma'am.

950
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,033
-[agent 1] Let's get started.
-[agent 2] Already on it.

951
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:33,418
I heard your nickname is "Sun,"

952
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:37,047
so I will observe how peacefully
you handle the situation.

953
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:39,925
So you know a lot about me?

954
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:43,261
I know your ex-husband
is a powerful politician in the South.

955
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,138
That means you also heard the rumor

956
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,641
about how I got to be team leader
because of him?

957
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,353
Are you admitting that's true?

958
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,395
[scoffs]

959
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,314
You need to get better intel.

960
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,235
I'm in a custody battle
against that bastard and I'm winning.

961
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,571
Let me tell you who I am.

962
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:06,243
They call me "Sun"
because my enemies shrivel before me

963
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:08,286
while I smile over their corpses.

964
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:12,082
They're incompetent losers
who gossip behind my back and imply

965
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,127
my husband has anything
to do with my success.

966
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,214
[agent] Phone lines are ready, ma'am.

967
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,517
[phone rings]

968
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,479
[phone continues ringing]

969
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,690
[suspenseful music playing]

970
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:47,075
[phone rings]

971
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,537
[line ringing]

972
00:54:53,707 --> 00:54:54,916
[click]

973
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,168
Hello there.

974
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,713
I'm an inspector
with the Gyeonggi Police Agency.

975
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,673
I'm Seon Woojin. How are you?

976
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:04,759
[distorted voice] Can't say I'm fine.
You know how everything got out of hand.

977
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,219
Voice is distorted.

978
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:10,515
Your voice sounds a little strange.
Can I hear your real voice?

979
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:11,683
[inhales deeply]

980
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:14,019
So it's working! I downloaded an app.

981
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:16,146
it wouldn't even matter
if I fled on a helicopter

982
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:18,064
if my identity is revealed.

983
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:20,900
Before we start the negotiations,
don't you think

984
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,153
we should get to know each other first?
What's your name?

985
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:27,157
[breathes deeply]

986
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,451
Professor.

987
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,078
Call me Professor.

988
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:33,705
[Woojin] Professor?

989
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:34,789
All right, then.

990
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:37,208
Mr. Professor,

991
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,211
do you want a helicopter? For how many?

992
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:43,089
[Professor] I'll only negotiate
with a person who won't

993
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,758
drag on, someone who has power,

994
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:48,261
and who can call the shots,
not some powerless public servant.

995
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,429
Okay, well…

996
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:51,056
[exhales]

997
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:54,184
That won't be easy due to protocol.

998
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,354
Let's start over.

999
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,022
Use your imagination.

1000
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:01,483
All we wanted to do
was get some money and run.

1001
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:04,110
But thanks to you,
we're stuck inside this building

1002
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,905
with all
of these annoying, irritating hostages.

1003
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:11,242
Now, if you were me, wouldn't you be
running out of patience too?

1004
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,953
[Woojin] But that's partially your fault,
isn't it?

1005
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,414
Since the Mint is located
between the North and South,

1006
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:17,916
things are complicated.

1007
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,293
[inhales] Why couldn't you have just
robbed a regular bank?

1008
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:23,296
-[tuts] I know, right?
-[Woojin] You can talk to me.

1009
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:27,175
I'll take care of all the complicated
matters in the middle and everything else.

1010
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:31,304
I hate to admit it, but you're right,
I am a powerless public servant,

1011
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,473
so you have to give me
something I can use,

1012
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,266
so that I can persuade my supervisors.

1013
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,518
[Professor] Such as?

1014
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,312
How about letting the students go?

1015
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,480
[Professor scoffs]

1016
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,650
Then, will you send me a helicopter?

1017
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,529
That'll give me some rationale
to make a case for it.

1018
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:50,073
-[Professor] Are you kidding me?
-The hostages.

1019
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,118
Don't you think there are too many
for your group to handle?

1020
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:56,162
It's not like the situation changes
if you let some of them go.

1021
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,289
[Professor] That's true,

1022
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,458
since there are only four of us.

1023
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,294
I'll think about it.

1024
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,509
[chuckles lightly]

1025
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:18,601
Were you able to analyze his voice?

1026
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:21,146
We couldn't restore the voice fully
due to his voice modifier,

1027
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:24,399
but he is in his early to mid-forties,
and based on his natural accent,

1028
00:57:24,482 --> 00:57:26,067
we are certain he's South Korean.

1029
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:29,654
So, four thieves from the North and South
teamed up to rob the Mint?

1030
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:32,449
HOUR 11 INTO THE HEIST

1031
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:36,786
What's on your mind?

1032
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:40,081
Dongchul, hey.

1033
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:43,251
The Professor

1034
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,129
said there were four of them.

1035
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,091
Do you think it was by mistake?

1036
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,304
Maybe.

1037
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,769
[lighter clicks]

1038
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:03,730
What the hell?

1039
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:10,487
What do you think you're doing?

1040
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,696
Didn't you hear what he said?

1041
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,656
There's only four of them.
Let's get it over with.

1042
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:17,660
This isn't a situation we can rush.
He could've let it slip on purpose.

1043
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:19,871
It would be one thing
to exaggerate the number,

1044
00:58:19,954 --> 00:58:21,539
but why would he try to understate that?

1045
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:24,709
What if this is something he wanted?
This could be a setup.

1046
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,212
[exhales sharply]

1047
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:31,841
This is difficult for me too,
but consider the politics around this.

1048
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:35,261
Both countries want this resolved quickly
before the upcoming summit takes place.

1049
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,972
And you can go back home now.

1050
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,183
What do you mean--

1051
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:43,353
He means that negotiation
was only for justification,

1052
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:44,521
so thank you for your work.

1053
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:47,941
Can someone please show
the… team leader the way out?

1054
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:50,818
[scoffs]

1055
00:58:52,946 --> 00:58:54,072
[phone vibrates]

1056
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:02,372
STOP BY THE CAFÉ. I'LL COOK FOR YOU.
MUST BE WORKING. SORRY.

1057
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,541
BUT AREN'T YOU OFF?
AM I NOT GETTING THE HINT?

1058
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,167
[chuckles]

1059
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:11,130
I WAS JUST FORCED TO LEAVE WORK.

1060
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:12,840
THE CAFÉ?

1061
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,259
[inhales deeply]

1062
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:15,468
[phone vibrates]

1063
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:19,138
FORCED TO LEAVE WORK?

1064
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:21,391
[exhales, tuts]

1065
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,685
It's a long story.

1066
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:26,479
[sighs]

1067
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,369
[tense music playing]

1068
00:59:47,709 --> 00:59:50,628
[Moohyuk] The infiltration team
should move together simultaneously.

1069
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,261
PREPPING

1070
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:20,533
[turns off engine]

1071
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:33,588
[bell dings]

1072
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:35,882
Sunho?

1073
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:36,883
Hey.

1074
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,718
[man grunts] Is that you?

1075
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,720
It's chaos out there. Did you see it?

1076
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:43,473
Ugh, I just came from there.

1077
01:00:44,432 --> 01:00:46,142
Uh…

1078
01:00:46,225 --> 01:00:49,937
-Wait a second. Were you next door?
-What happened next door?

1079
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:52,523
Yeah, you should've seen it.
They had a pipe burst.

1080
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,360
It was a total disaster. [chuckles]

1081
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,445
-Oh.
-Why? Is there… Did something happen?

1082
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:00,239
Never mind.

1083
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,075
Wait a second. Have you had dinner?

1084
01:01:02,992 --> 01:01:04,035
-[Woojin] Mm-mm.
-Hmm.

1085
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:07,163
All right, let's see,
what are you in the mood for?

1086
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:10,083
-Uh…
-Do you want to eat anything specific?

1087
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:13,419
[Tokyo] The one with the true upper hand
was not the North or the South.

1088
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,587
It was the Professor.

1089
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,340
He developed plans
and factored in everything.

1090
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:21,010
The Professor came up with solutions
for every possible situation

1091
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,846
and then a backup plan
for each of those possibilities.

1092
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:27,934
As for our negotiator,
she was an important part of his plan.

1093
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:31,020
[Professor] The South is in charge
of keeping public order in the JEA,

1094
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:34,565
but in case of a hostage situation
in a facility such as the Mint,

1095
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:38,069
the two countries will form
a joint task force, just like us.

1096
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:40,988
Then, each country
will send its experts onto the field

1097
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,490
to try and catch you all in the act.

1098
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:46,327
The North will probably bring in men
from the Special Operations Unit.

1099
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:49,205
-It'll be quite the power struggle.
-Correct.

1100
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:53,209
It's very important who gets chosen
to be in charge of everything.

1101
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:56,504
And I intend to use that aspect.

1102
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:58,423
I like your plan,

1103
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:02,885
but, you see, not everything
happens according to plan in this life.

1104
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,554
For example, look at us.

1105
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:06,514
Who would've ever thought
we'd all get together

1106
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:08,224
and pull off a bank robbery, huh?

1107
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:09,142
[Denver] I agree.

1108
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:12,353
Like Berlin said, as soon as
the Special Operations Unit barges in,

1109
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,354
the game is over.

1110
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,231
You know, it was Mike Tyson who once said,

1111
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:19,444
"Everyone has a plan until they get
punched right in their fuckin' mouth."

1112
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:22,530
Point taken.
The first step to winning a battle

1113
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:25,575
is to wisely choose
the opponent you're facing.

1114
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:27,535
You mean you'll be picking the negotiator?

1115
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:29,495
[Rio] How?
Everything from the North is classified.

1116
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,373
How do we know who they're gonna send
to be on the task force?

1117
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,667
We at least know
who'll join from the South.

1118
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:41,048
Seon Woojin, crisis negotiation
team leader from the South.

1119
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:43,009
She will be our opponent.

1120
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:44,969
She's pretty, I'll say that.

1121
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:47,054
[all chuckle]

1122
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:50,141
However, how can we guarantee
that she'll be our negotiator

1123
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:52,143
when there are plenty of them
in South Korea?

1124
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:55,104
Well, there are a few strong contenders
they can choose,

1125
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:58,191
but all they have issues,
like sex scandals, bribery cases.

1126
01:02:58,274 --> 01:02:59,108
Right, Rio?

1127
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,862
[gasps] That's why you had me
do background checks.

1128
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:06,991
[Professor] Now, I plan on getting her
to assist us with our operation

1129
01:03:07,575 --> 01:03:08,785
without her knowing.

1130
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:11,621
[inhales deeply]

1131
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:15,249
-It's been exactly two months.
-Two months already?

1132
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,918
Why are you even keeping track?

1133
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:19,504
It's not like we're dating.
Don't make me blush.

1134
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:22,381
I meant it's been two months
since I opened the café.

1135
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:26,219
-[Woojin] Oh!
-[both chuckle]

1136
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:35,812
But hold on a second.
I thought we were dating. Hmm?

1137
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:38,731
Hmm?

1138
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:40,817
[cutlery scrapes and clinks]

1139
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:46,447
[inhales deeply, exhales]

1140
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:48,783
[Tokyo] The Professor
could guess a number of things

1141
01:03:48,866 --> 01:03:51,702
based on only one simple line of text.

1142
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:54,372
Her leaving the task force
meant one thing.

1143
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:57,291
They'll be there very soon.

1144
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:58,543
Proceed as planned.

1145
01:03:59,544 --> 01:04:01,712
A military raid was coming to get us.

1146
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:03,714
[sighs]

1147
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,510
-[man 1] Distraction team on the move.
-[man 2] Rescue team on the move.

1148
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:09,971
-Infiltration team?
-[man 3] We're going in.

1149
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:11,973
[suspenseful music plays]

1150
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,229
[Professor]
There's almost zero possibility

1151
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:20,439
that they'll willingly agree to negotiate.

1152
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:24,110
They'll try to suppress us no matter what,
and they'll do it in secret.

1153
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:27,363
There are a total of five entry points.

1154
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:28,406
The main gate,

1155
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,157
the rooftop,

1156
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:32,577
the underground garage,

1157
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,787
the emergency exit on the side,

1158
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:37,248
and last but not least, the loading dock.

1159
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:41,544
If you remove the main gate and rooftop
where they're likely to be seen,

1160
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:43,087
they'll use the other three to enter.

1161
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:47,258
Son of a bitch.
Those fucking bastards are everywhere.

1162
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,677
Okay, so let's say we know
when they'll enter,

1163
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,429
thanks to the information from that woman.

1164
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:54,974
How do we stop the Special Operations Unit
when they have so many points of entry?

1165
01:04:55,057 --> 01:04:56,017
Well,

1166
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:58,811
that's a good question.

1167
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,230
[Moscow] Faster! Move! Hurry up!

1168
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:03,316
Move! Move!

1169
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,525
Move!

1170
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:06,652
[Tokyo] Move your asses!

1171
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:08,112
-Quickly!
-[Berlin] Run!

1172
01:05:10,156 --> 01:05:12,074
[suspenseful music fades out]

1173
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:18,915
Is something bothering you?

1174
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:20,833
Huh?

1175
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:24,045
Oh, no, I… I just…

1176
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:28,633
You said you're a hostage negotiator,
but you're an open book.

1177
01:05:28,716 --> 01:05:29,675
Well,

1178
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,386
negotiating's about being honest.

1179
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:36,641
Isn't it better to be honest
when trying to gain someone's trust?

1180
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,392
[inhales, chuckles softly]

1181
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,312
That makes sense. [chuckles]

1182
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:43,105
[man 1] Distraction team on standby.

1183
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:46,484
-[man 2] Rescue team on standby.
-[man 3] Infiltration team on standby.

1184
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:48,569
[suspenseful music playing]

1185
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:53,240
[Moohyuk] You have the green light.

1186
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,371
[whirring]

1187
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:01,958
[breathes deeply]

1188
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:06,671
[Professor] What do you think
is the best strategy

1189
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:08,464
when we're surrounded by enemies?

1190
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:10,132
Best strategy, huh? [tuts]

1191
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:13,052
-We're so fucked.
-Why do you think we can't stop them?

1192
01:06:13,135 --> 01:06:15,721
No one can fight their way out
when they're surrounded.

1193
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,723
We don't have enough people on our side.

1194
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:23,229
[suspenseful music playing]

1195
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:28,651
[Professor] But we have plenty of people.

1196
01:06:28,734 --> 01:06:31,529
In fact, we outnumber them.

1197
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:38,119
[tense music playing]

1198
01:06:51,465 --> 01:06:52,633
[gun loading]

1199
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:02,977
[man 1] Heavily armed suspects
are blocking the entry.

1200
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:03,978
Take a look at this!

1201
01:07:06,397 --> 01:07:08,899
[man 2] It'll be impossible
for the distraction team to enter.

1202
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:11,819
[man 3] Rescue team's entry also blocked.

1203
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:14,655
-How many are even in the building?
-[man 1] What should we do, Captain?

1204
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:17,241
-[agent] Captain, you have to see this.
-What?

1205
01:07:17,324 --> 01:07:20,453
-A YouTube live stream from the Mint.
-[man on video] Please, don't hurt us!

1206
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:21,871
Please do not use force.

1207
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:25,583
[director sobbing] The robbers,
we're all dressed the same.

1208
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:28,836
[girl] The robbers and the hostages
are wearing the same clothes.

1209
01:07:28,919 --> 01:07:30,713
We are forced to hold fake guns

1210
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:33,132
so you won't be able
to tell us apart from them.

1211
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:34,967
-[phone vibrates]
-[girl] They're making us…

1212
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:36,802
-Yes?
-[girl] …hold fake guns.

1213
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:39,722
-[director] They wanna be peaceful.
-What?

1214
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:42,058
Slow down a second.
Who did you say that girl's father is?

1215
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:44,935
-[director] Please, we ask the police…
-The US ambassador?

1216
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:46,562
[director] …to just talk to them.

1217
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:49,315
So please continue negotiating.

1218
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:51,817
Retreat.

1219
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,236
Everyone, retreat.

1220
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,446
[breathes heavily]

1221
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:57,198
[tense music continues]

1222
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,128
Now, my dear comrades,

1223
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:13,380
take off your masks.

1224
01:08:24,058 --> 01:08:25,768
Thanks to your cooperation,

1225
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,231
the police completely aborted
their mission to raid the building.

1226
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:33,692
-[Moscow and Denver chuckle]
-[Moscow] Yes!

1227
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:36,153
[Berlin] I want to applaud you all
for being courageous

1228
01:08:36,237 --> 01:08:37,738
and for your exceptional teamwork.

1229
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:40,324
We could not have done this without you.

1230
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:43,077
[Berlin slow claps]

1231
01:09:01,637 --> 01:09:02,972
[applause builds]

1232
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,232
[cheering]

1233
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,652
[Professor] You said the scene is nearby?

1234
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:20,322
Come over whenever you're hungry.
Being busy isn't an excuse to not eat.

1235
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:22,533
I already told you I was asked to leave.

1236
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:24,451
They said they don't need me.

1237
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:26,328
[Professor] Come on. [inhales deeply]

1238
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,497
I think you're just waiting
for them to call,

1239
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,583
and my café just happens to be nearby.

1240
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,918
Oh, that's not true!

1241
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:35,754
I came to see you, really.

1242
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:38,966
Plus, it's not like they need me anymore.

1243
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:41,302
Trust me, they're gonna ask you
to come back.

1244
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:43,470
-[Woojin slurping]
-[dramatic music plays]

1245
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:46,557
Huh?

1246
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:49,977
You're the best negotiator I know.

1247
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:54,315
[chuckles] I'm the only negotiator
you know.

1248
01:09:54,398 --> 01:09:56,859
-Come on!
-You caught me on that one.

1249
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:58,152
[laughing]

1250
01:09:58,235 --> 01:10:01,238
[phone vibrates]

1251
01:10:04,909 --> 01:10:06,035
Yes?

1252
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:08,913
What?

1253
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:13,250
[sighs]

1254
01:10:14,084 --> 01:10:17,004
[Tokyo] The Professor
didn't have to listen to the conversation.

1255
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:18,714
He knew the raid had failed,

1256
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:22,384
and, on top of that,
the daughter of the US ambassador

1257
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:23,886
was one of the hostages.

1258
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:28,140
So now that using force was off the table,
they'd need to go back to negotiating.

1259
01:10:28,224 --> 01:10:29,183
[sighs]

1260
01:10:29,266 --> 01:10:30,392
You have to go?

1261
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,394
Yeah, sorry. [sighs]

1262
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:35,022
Sunho, they called me back.

1263
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:36,190
See, I told you.

1264
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:39,068
I guess I'll be making food
for you from now on.

1265
01:10:39,151 --> 01:10:40,486
[both chuckle softly]

1266
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:45,658
[chuckles]

1267
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:02,549
[downtempo rock music plays]

1268
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:11,558
[Professor] Is everyone okay?
Did anyone get hurt?

1269
01:11:11,642 --> 01:11:14,687
Why? Did something happen, huh? [chuckles]

1270
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:17,022
-And the woman?
-[Professor] She went back.

1271
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,524
Just as we planned.

1272
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:20,567
Now then,

1273
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:23,988
shall we go ahead and begin our next step?

1274
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,782
[Nairobi] Do they have that much in cash?

1275
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:29,493
If it's the Mint, that could be possible.

1276
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:31,954
Where else would they put
all that money, right?

1277
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:34,331
Oh, for fuck's sake.

1278
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:36,333
Huh? What did you say?

1279
01:11:36,417 --> 01:11:37,501
Come on.

1280
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:40,504
You really think they'd be storing
four trillion in cash in some building?

1281
01:11:40,587 --> 01:11:42,131
Rio's right.

1282
01:11:43,007 --> 01:11:44,842
-They wouldn't.
-What are you talking about?

1283
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:48,137
Stealing cash that doesn't even exist?
That doesn't make any--

1284
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,764
Stop interrupting,
and let him finish his sentence.

1285
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:52,850
-Huh?
-[Professor] Thank you.

1286
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,062
I'm not planning to steal the money
from somewhere

1287
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,939
or from some specific person.

1288
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:01,650
So, what's your fucking plan then?

1289
01:12:02,526 --> 01:12:03,360
[gasps]

1290
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:04,528
[screams excitedly]

1291
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:06,405
Oh! [laughs]

1292
01:12:06,488 --> 01:12:07,656
No way!

1293
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:09,992
[Moscow] So what the Professor is saying…

1294
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:11,702
[Rio] …is we're not stealing the money.

1295
01:12:11,785 --> 01:12:12,828
We'll print the money

1296
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,873
using the actual equipment.

1297
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:17,833
-That means it's no one's money.
-[Moscow laughs]

1298
01:12:17,916 --> 01:12:21,128
We'll print our own untraceable bills
worth four trillion won.

1299
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,715
-[all gasp]
-[laughs]

1300
01:12:24,798 --> 01:12:26,675
And then we'll magically disappear.

1301
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,260
[Nairobi] Oh, ah!

1302
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,720
Oh!

1303
01:12:30,262 --> 01:12:32,264
[squeals, laughs]

1304
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:35,726
[laughing]

1305
01:12:37,478 --> 01:12:39,146
[laughs maniacally]

1306
01:12:41,607 --> 01:12:43,192
[all whoop and laugh]

1307
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:50,366
This heist is going to change the world.

1308
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:53,786
[printer whirs]

1309
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:01,752
