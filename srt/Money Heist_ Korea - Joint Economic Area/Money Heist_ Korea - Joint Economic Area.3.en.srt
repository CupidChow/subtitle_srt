I won't repeat myself.

[gasps]

168
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:32,280
Wow, is it tense in here,
or is it just me?

169
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,782
-We should go.
-[exhales]

170
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,910
[breathing heavily]

171
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,041
[ringing continues]

172
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,466
Hello?

173
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,551
What happened?

174
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,885
Nothing at all.

175
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,722
We had a minor disagreement,
but everything's settled down now.

176
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,599
[Professor] It doesn't seem
that minor to me.

177
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,059
Tell me,
is the disagreement at all related to…

178
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:03,978
Denver and a hostage?

179
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,146
Oh, that thing.

180
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,191
[beeps]

181
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,362
Apparently, that woman is pregnant.

182
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,824
We put her somewhere else
because she needed to calm down.

183
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,411
And yes, I may have threatened them a bit.

184
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,580
But the hostages know their place now.

185
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,166
Don't forget.

186
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,754
We're at a critical point that will
either make or break our plan. Understood?

187
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,048
Understood.

188
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,676
We took care of the smartwatch.
So are we all set?

189
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,929
[smacks lips, inhales deeply]

190
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:39,972
Give Rio the phone.

191
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,106
Uh, hello there, Professor.

192
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,734
[Professor] Can you analyze the access log
on the broken watch?

193
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,195
It'll be a little tough, but I think so.
Can I ask why?

194
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,740
We need to know if they've found out
anything that can compromise us.

195
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,741
Just in case.

196
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,415
Don't get any ideas and just focus
on the task the Professor's given you.

197
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,501
[tense music playing]

198

-[gasps]

201
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,900
Ah, shit. For fuck's sake, Tokyo.
You scared me.

202
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,443
And the woman?

203
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,070
[breathes deeply]

204
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,196
Where is she?

205
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,156
She's over there.

206
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,413

00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,757
-Fuck, this is driving me insane!
-[gasping]

210
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,759
How does Berlin expect me
to shoot a person?

211
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,302
[screams angrily]

212
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,471
What the fuck?

213
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,015
[trembling breaths]

214
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,226
[breathing heavily]

215
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,811
Please don't shoot me.

216
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,272
If I don't kill you,
that bastard Berlin will do it himself.

217
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,858
What if you pretend you did?
Can't you shoot my thigh?

218
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,402
I can play dead.
Just say you killed me, please!

219
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,113
-But still I can't, what if--
-[whimpers]

220
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,531
-Damn it!
-Shoot me here.

221
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,159
It's going to hurt like fucking hell
when I actually shoot you.

222
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,786
-Are you sure you can bear with the pain?
-Okay. Please hurry.

223
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,873
All right. Let's do this, okay?
I'll shoot here.

224
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,375
It'll be extremely painful.
Bite down on this.

225
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,002
-Hey, are you ready?
-[moans nervously]

226
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:34,462
Clench your teeth!

227
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,717
[gasps, breathes heavily]

228
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,386
[Denver] Thank God it was you
who barged into the bathroom.

229
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:46,056
If Berlin finds out that she's alive,
we're both dead.

230
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:49,435
-You know that. Right, Denver?
-Yeah, I know.

231
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,229
I'll be careful.

232
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,816
[breathing heavily in pain]

233
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,027
Take off your clothes.

234
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,278
[breathing heavily in pain]

235
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:00,446
Let me see the wound.

236
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,783

-Mmm.
-Oh, oh.

241
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,090
My bad. Sorry.

242
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,342
Go ahead.

243
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:23,052
I'll… be outside.

244

Make sure to keep an eye on her.

00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,892
[sighs]

254
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,686
And remember to give her the antibiotics.

255
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,480
Yeah, I got it.

256
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,316
[Tokyo] I know it hurts,
but hang in there.

257
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,235
I'll do whatever I can to help you.

Hey, wait…

261
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,040
Did you tell the Professor?

262
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,711
No.

263
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,798
Right now even if I tell him,
Berlin will kill her himself.

264
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,258
[Denver] Fuck, what should we do?

265
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,802
We can't hide her like this for long.
She's seriously injured.

266
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:48,929
First, I think we need to…

267
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,974
do something about Berlin.

268
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:53,934
Like what?

269
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,186
We need to remove him as head of the team.

270
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,481
But to do that,
we need to get rid of Helsinki and Oslo.

271
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,110
And then we can take out Berlin.

272
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,782
[breathes deeply]

273
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,202
[agent] Han Joseph, 22 years old.
A medical school dropout.

274
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,580
[exhales]

275
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,791
So is he one of the hostages?

276
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:20,419
He isn't on our presumed list of hostages.

277
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:21,879
Any criminal record?

278
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:24,381
He was let off with a warning
because he was a minor,

279
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,383
but he's been a skilled hacker
since he was young.

280
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,887
[scoffs] That explains why our
cyber forensics team struggled so much.

281
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,222
He has to be one of the suspects.

282
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:39,104
If they've put this much effort
into making this elaborate plan,

283
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,565
they must have come to the Mint
ahead of time

284
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,359
to prepare for every contingency.

285
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,778
Check all the surveillance footage,

286
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,821
secure what you can
from the cameras near the Mint.

287
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,540
Once the heist begins, I'll have to rely
on the security cameras and the phone

288
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,125
to know what's happening inside.

289
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,586
Since we don't know
what will happen then and there,

290
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:06,507
I need one of you to take charge
on my behalf inside the Mint.

291
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,466
Any volunteers?

292
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:12,721
I can be the leader
since I have experience working in teams?

293
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,807
Really? What did you do?

294
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,726
Maybe you've heard
of one of my big accomplishments.

295
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,938
-The Jeju-do Casino?
-What?

296
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,272
[Nairobi] Seventy big ones.

297
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,024
Are you really the one who did that?

298
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,943
-[Helsinki] Huh?
-[Oslo laughs] Wow!

299
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,152
What is that?

300
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,487
You don't know?

301
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,531
She was so good
no one knew there was a robbery

302
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,242
and by the time people realized
it was too late.

303
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:34,952
-[laughs]
-Oh.

304
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,037
[Rio] Damn, that's crazy. [chuckles]

305
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,248
'Cause I heard the ones who carried it out

306
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,375
were foreign and all got caught.

307
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,960
But I was smarter than them.

308
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,129
I set up all the plans for them
in the beginning…

309
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,590
[exhales] …but maybe it was because
they couldn't understand me?

310
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,342
It really was frustrating.

311
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,052
What is she even talking about?

312
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,346
You really do lie
every time you open your mouth,

313
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,348
[all laugh]

314
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,225
[Berlin] I'll do it.

315
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,439
Objections?

316
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,566
Out of curiosity,

317
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,360
why are you volunteering to be our leader?

318
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,655
Do you enjoy being in command?

319
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,451
I won't lie and say no. But that's…

320
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:18,662
[exhales] …not the only reason
for being the leader.

321
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:24,001
[clears throat] The Professor's plan
is damn near perfect.

322
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,713
Perfect on the surface,
just like this paper house.

323
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,383
But what do you think will happen
once we are inside?

324
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,552
We'll have to face many obstacles.

325
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,472
Some of us will be struggling to survive,

326
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,891
and some of us will be blinded by money.

327
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:41,268
The place will be like a burning furnace,

328
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:44,104
with everyone's deep, dark desires
all tangled up inside.

329
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:48,901
And in the end,
this sophisticated, beautiful plan

330
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,361
will be reduced to ashes, to nothing.

331
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,781
And what can the Professor do
on the outside?

332
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,074
Not a damn thing.

333
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,952
What I'm saying is,

334
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,498
in the end, one of us
will have to establish order amidst all…

335
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,457
the chaos.

336
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,418
And you're the right man for that job?

337
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,759
If you think you can do
a better job than me then come forward.

338
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:17,179
We could even take the democratic approach
like the Southerners do,

339
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,264
and we can all vote on it.

340
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,564
Hey, I think we should just go by age.

341
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,525
So how about my dad?

342
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,361
-[exhales] Huh?
-Will you shut your mouth. son?

343
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,321
-Sorry. Sorry.
-[Denver] What?

344
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:39,159
Sorry, but Moscow already has
another important task.

345
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:44,456
He will build us an escape route
and connect us back to the world.

346
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,750
[drilling]

347
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,878
The tunnel the hostages
will be digging is fake.

348
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,463
Once the time comes,

349
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:55,342
we'll free the hostages
and escape using the real escape route.

350
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,095
Of course, I'm sure
the police will be right on our tail

351
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,140
following the fake route
the hostages will tell them about.

352
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,183
[sighs loudly]

353
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,518
[laughs]

354
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,228
Is that the time already?

355
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,480
Stomach, you never let me down.

356
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,525
Let's eat first
and then we'll get back to it. [chuckles]

357
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,153
Oh, man….

358
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,195
Let's go.

359
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,905
[sighs]

360
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:21,160
Where is… that little idiot?
I haven't seen him at all.

361
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,245
[music playing indistinctly]

362
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,084
[shoveling]

363
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,213
[breathes deeply]

364
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,592
[exhales]

365
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,220
[whispering] Oh shit.

366
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,639
[grunts]

367
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,976
I'm going to the bathroom,
but you all are gonna keep working.

368
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,645
And remember,
we're watching you with the cameras.

369
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,818
You. Especially you!

370
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,112
If you get caught doing anything,

371
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,199
you know what'll happen.

372
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:05,829
All right, keep an eye on him.

373
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:15,714
[door closes]

374
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,674
That fucking psychopath.

375
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,052
How could he have no problem

376
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:23,263
taking a dump
after killing someone in cold blood? Huh?

377
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,350
-I know, right?
-I hope you shit your brains out!

378
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:27,935
[exhales]

379
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,728
[sighs]

380
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,813
Anyway,

381
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:36,610
how much longer do I have to keep digging
this fucking hole right here? [sighs]

382
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,530
[gasps] Wha-- What is it?

383
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:44,326
We want to speak with the Director.
Step aside and don't get involved.

384
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,372
[Denver] You must be starving.

385
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:50,916
You need to eat,

386
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,043
if you want to survive.

387
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,295
So he

388
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,632
really thinks I'm dead, right?

389
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,633
Your…

390
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,135
boyfriend?

391
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,387
Mm-hmm.

392
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,180
Well, yes…

393
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,058
-At least for now.
-How… How did he…

394
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,144
Nevermind, I guess it doesn't matter.

395
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,605
He doesn't even care
if I'm alive or not, right?

396
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,566
[sighs] Uh, no.

397
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,361
You don't have to worry
about that douchebag anymore.

398
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:22,322
I mean, what do you see
in that piece of shit, anyway?

399
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,409
Now here, you should eat.

400
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,995
Come on, open wide. [exhales]

401
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,871
[cries softly]

402
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,417
[whimpers]

403
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,670
[inhales deeply]

404
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,130
Hang in there, all right?

405
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,131
Trust me…

406
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,883
we have a plan.

407
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,637
I'll get straight to the point, Youngmin.

408
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:49,683
We're not going to allow you
to act on your own from now on.

409
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,768
What… do you mean "allow?"

410
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,855
They made a promise
to treat each of us humanely and fairly

411
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,440
as long as we do what we're told.

412
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,442
Don't do anything stupid. Or else.

413
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,069
O-Or else, what? Hmm?

414
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,323
-Yun Misun had to die because of you.
-Hey.

415
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:05,949
Did I kill her, huh?

416
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,784
No, that bastard killed her.

417
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:12,706
And did you think I did
all of those things for me? Huh?

418
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,624
For myself? Just think about it.

419
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,210
We're digging a tunnel
so that these fucking thieves can escape.

420
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,546
I mean, they know
we'd go straight to the police,

421
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,381
so do you really think
they'll keep us alive?

422
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,175
They'll kill us on the spot if we run!

423
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,593
Will you stop saying "us"?

424
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,429
Do you think I don't know that
all you're thinking about is yourself?

425
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,850
Hey, you're the one putting me on trial
at a kangaroo court, all right?

426
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:32,893
Look at you.

427
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,103
All of you commies!

428
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,564
-I see you for what you really are!
-What was that?

429
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,276
Help! Someone help!
The North Koreans are revolting!

430
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,944
-[grunts]
-Ow! [grunts]

431
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,488
[breathes shakily]

432
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,823
There's really no getting through
to this guy, is there?

433
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,034
Let's teach him a lesson this time.

434
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,744
[stuttering] Stop it.

435
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,954
You guys are all m-making a mistake.

436
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,247
[screams]

437
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,833
[breathing heavily]

438
00:22:56,917 --> 00:23:01,129
The next time you put another hostage
in danger so you can save your own life,

439
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,964
you'll pay for it.

440
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,258
-[exhales]
-[Moscow] What's going on?

441
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,010
[gasps, shouts]

442
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,430
-Oh thank God. Help me! Help me!
-What? Huh?

443
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:13,433
Those commies ganged up on me
and were about to kill me! It's true!

444
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,851
-What's going on?
-That's a lie.

445
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,771
We were giving him a warning because
he was sneaking out during our shift.

446
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,231
Hey! Hey, Park! Hey!

447
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,691
You saw everything! Right?
Tell him everything!

448
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,822
Uh, uh, I…

449
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:30,075
You should all really be
ashamed of yourselves.

450
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,869
Now, look. You need to remember
that you're all in the same boat!

451
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,331
Rather than helping each other
you all turn on…

452
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,959
And you, Director,
need to stop being so sneaky

453
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:42,337
and everyone here needs to be smart
and use their fucking heads!

454
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:43,380
[clicks tongue]

455
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,632
Where is that little idiot and why is he…

456
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,300
Ridiculous.

457
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:50,220
Come on. Put down your gear
and let's go eat something first, huh?

458
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,640
What are you guys doing?
Let's hurry up and get going!

459
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,396
God.

460
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,856
[tuts]

461
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,989
[hostage] Come on, hurry up!

462
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,866
[dishes clattering]

463
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,912
I'm sorry,
but can I get some more, please?

464
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,289
-Get a new one.
-What did you say?

465
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:20,083
He's just a kid. He didn't mean
to drop his food on the floor.

466
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,460
It's somebody else's fault--

467
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,171
I'll say it again. I was ordered
to never give out extra food

468
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,505
no matter the circumstance.

469
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,506
Stop being so cheap!

470
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,049
[hostage 2] Just serve the kid again.

471
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:31,052
We will be held responsible, if anything
goes wrong with giving out food.

472
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,762
What do you think you're doing?

473
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:34,973
Here, you can have this.

474
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,892
-You should stay out of it, old man.
-[bangs]

475
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,352
[Nairobi] Hey, what the fuck!
He's just a kid!

476
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,937
Give him some more.

477
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:51,531
[Moscow] So, what's with…
all the hostages? They seem tense.

478
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,367
And?

479
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,370
What really matters is our system
is working properly for once.

480
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:01,041
Tell me, did anything happen while
I was busy working on the escape route?

481
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:02,792
I don't know.

-Denver, come here.
-Yeah?

Where have you been lately?
I didn't see you at your post earlier.

Oh…

I think I ate something bad.

My stomach doesn't feel good.
I don't know why.

And you're not
getting into trouble, are you?

[Denver chuckles]

490
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:27,651
I'm not a little kid anymore, Dad.
Is there something going on here?

491
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:31,029
Your father is asking if
anything has happened to the hostages.

492
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:32,364
Do you know anything?

Uh…

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,285
No, I… I don't know.

Really?

496
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:43,250
Do you think the hostages will get along
just because they're stuck in here?

When they've been at war with each other
for decades?

498

It's not bad for us, though.

499
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:50,340
They're too busy fighting among themselves
that they don't see the real enemy.

What did you find?

There isn't any data left on the device,
but there are traces of a transfer.

Based on the size,

571
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,959
it's most likely that an image
or a short video was sent.

So that means what we were worried about
might actually happen.

Isn't it a big problem
if our faces were captured on video

Then find out who she is

around this time frame.

00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,984
My editor will be hearing about this.

646
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,195
[officer 2] No cameras allowed
from this point.

647
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,154
You're not allowed in.

648
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,199
-[reporter 5] Excuse me. Let me through.
-Put your phones away. No recording.

649
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,619
-[officer 3] You can't take any pictures.

-[alarm continues sounding]

652
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,874
Hey, check it out.

653
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,502
-[officer 4] No cameras.
-[reporter 6] Come on. What are you doing?

654
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:32,338
-[officer 4] You're not allowed.
-[reporter 7] Excuse me, officer.

655
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,298
[officer 4] You can't enter
beyond this point.

656
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:38,719
[officer 5] Are you a reporter? Excuse me!
Hey, you there! Are you a reporter?

657
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,304
[reporter 6] Give me something.

658
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,515
You over there! Hey, you!

659
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,225
Somebody stop him!

660
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,769
[agent] Sim Youngmun, 38 years old.

661
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,397
-She has been convicted of fraud, but…
-Of fraud?

662
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,649
All right,
so we have identified two suspects.

663
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:53,192
Should we do a press briefing?

664
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,111
That will certainly put pressure
on those thugs.

665
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,946
Plus the higher-ups will like it.

666
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,825
Not yet. First we need to know
how we're gonna play our cards.

667
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,910
I say we keep this to ourselves for now.

668
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,290
What's really bothering me is
I can understand why they have a hacker…

669
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,125
But why have a con artist?

670
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:10,835
Exactly.

671
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,379
[agent] We're getting a phone signal
from nearby.

672
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:14,964
Connect so we can all listen in.

673
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,053
[officer] Hey, you can't go in there!
It's off limits!

674
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,597
[Professor] You don't understand.

675
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,057
I have to talk to Inspector Seon Woojin
right this second.

676
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:28,686
Like I said, it's a personal matter.
I'll only need a minute. [grunts]

677
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,521
Hey, Sunho.

678
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,064
[panting]

679
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,025
-What is this--
-[Professor] Oh, Woojin.

680
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,735
Here. It's your mother.

681
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,738
I think it's something urgent.
Because she couldn't reach you,

682
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,532
I think she called me after seeing
my number on my business card.

683
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:42,700
[breathes deeply]

684
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,412
Hello? Hello, Mom? You there?

685
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,538
Woojin, is that you?

686
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,540
Mina was coming home from school when

687
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,667
her father suddenly showed up and she…

688
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,502
Wait, Mom, hold on.

689
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,588
I'll call you right back, okay?

690
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,340
[disconnects call]

691
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,259
Please, excuse me.

692
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,928
Uh, please, excuse me.

693
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,138
[breathes deeply]

694
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,188
[man] How's your grandma?

695
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,898
How has she been feeling lately?

696
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,818
So where…

697
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,988
are you taking me right now?

698
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,241
We're going to eat
some very delicious food.

699
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,409
[chuckles] Hey, what do you want to eat?

700
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,912
Do you want to go
to your favorite pizza place?

701
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,956
-Mom's gonna be mad if she finds--
-Shh.

702
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,583

[scoffs]

704
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,297
Where are you taking my daughter?

705
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,591
You broke the restraining order.

706
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,927
I don't know what you said to Mina,
but you better--

707
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,471
You better watch what you're saying.
I just wanted to see her.

708
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,681
It's been a long time.

709
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,642
That's enough. Take her home
before I call the police on you.

710
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:50,810
Right now!

711
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,271
I said I'll take her back home
after we go eat!

712
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,026
So you need to stop overreacting.

713
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,738
Take her back home right now
or you'll see what overreacting is.

714
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,156
This is your last warning.

715
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,199
[man] Hey.

716
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,285
-Hey, Seon Woojin--

[exhales]

718
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,665
[Professor] So,

719
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,043
your husband is with your daughter?

720
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,296
[sighs]

721
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:22,466
I'm sorry you had to see that.

722
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,052
[Professor chuckles]
Hey, don't be sorry. I just…

723
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:26,846
[inhales deeply]

724
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:29,473
…haven't heard you talk much
about your ex-husband.

725
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,436
Does he not get along with your daughter?

726
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,314
Your mother told me…

727
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,942
Sunho, this has nothing to do with you.

728
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,446
So please just ignore
everything you just heard.

729
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,031
Right, I'm sorry.

730
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:47,533
I know I must have embarrassed you
by barging in like that.

731
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,952
But your mother was very worried
about the situation,

732
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,663
which is why I felt a bit rushed too.

733
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,623
I'm sorry.

734
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:57,668
Thank you for worrying,
but this is a secure facility.

735
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,797
[chuckles awkwardly]

736
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,299
I understand.

737
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,469
I'll get going now,
but if you ever have time--

738
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:07,678
Goodbye.

Who were you talking to?

744
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,042
None of your business.

745
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,964
[suspicious music playing]

746
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,094
[Tokyo] That could have been the end
of the relationship

747
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,346
between the Professor and the inspector.

748
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,390
Hello, Mom? You there?

749
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,725
[Tokyo] But the situation
was desperate enough

750
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:58,354
that he risked gambling everything he had
with Seon Woojin,

751
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,731
a card he'd worked very hard to get.

752
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,775
[solemn music playing]

753
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,861
But it was worth the risk.

754
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,489
The Professor got his hands
on the card he wanted.

755
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:11,200
[Woojin] I'll call you right back.

756
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,119
Please, excuse me.

757
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,954
Uh, please, excuse me.

758
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:18,499
[Tokyo] However,

759
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,668
-the result of this gamble…
-[ringing tone]

760
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,421
…was headed
in a completely unexpected direction.

761
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,881
What the hell?
Why the hell isn't he answering?

762
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,968
We need him right now. He has to hear
everything about what Berlin's done.

763
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:30,886
Oh God, what if something happened to him?

764
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,139
This is why the Professor put me
in charge of the heist,

765
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,974
in case we found ourselves
in a situation like this.

766
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,267
You don't deserve it.

767
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,852
I know that's what you think,

768
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,979
-but what about what everyone else thinks?
-What?

769
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,147
How about we gather everyone

770
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,983
and vote on whether I'm fit
to lead the operation or not?

Democracy.

772
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,403
Did you get shot in the head?
Are you crazy?

773
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,616
And if you refuse, it'll just be that
you're staging a coup

in the Professor's absence,

775
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:57,496
so really if you think about it
you are the one actually ruining the plan.

-[ringing continues]

It's really nothing at all.

I'm sorry,

but do you think you can
separate me from those hostages?

they keep provoking me--

It's not like that.

then what is, you bastard. What?

is going on in here? [exhales]

804
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:33,968
Moscow?

805
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,096
He's busy with the tunnel,
but I've asked him to come.

806
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,138
[sighs]

807
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,767
Do you know how much money
we could be printing instead of fighting?

808
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,686
I'd like to know what you all think

809
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:47,064
since Tokyo says I have no right to be
in charge of what happens from now on.

810
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:48,816
Berlin ignored
the Professor's instructions.

811
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,193
He divided the hostages
and pitted them against each other.

812
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,988
And then he broke the rule about
not killing any of the hostages.

813
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,157
If we continue to let him lead,
the Professor's plan will fail.

814
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,702
-And that's exactly what he wants.
-No need to drag this out.

815
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:02,204
We'll take a vote
since that's what you all want.

816
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,290
[suspenseful music playing]

817
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,218
You know I'm always going
to be on your side.

818
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,470
[scoffs softly]

819
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,598
Thanks, but I don't want us
to choose sides.

820
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,517
Remember when you volunteered
to take part in this.

821
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:27,521
It's because we trusted the Professor
and not this goddamn fucking psychopath.

822
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,772
Understand?

823
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:29,732
[sighs]

824
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,696
Berlin, you know that
I'm normally on your side.

825
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:36,697
[grunts]

826
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,325
You know, this time
you've really crossed the line.

827
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:44,330
Well, my dad and I are obviously
on the same side so that means,

828
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,498
one, two, three, four. We win.

829
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,542
It's game over for you, bud.

830
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:51,378
Don't you know voting by proxy is illegal?

831
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,130
Accept the result, Berlin.

832
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,966
[laughs]

833
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,094
[panting]

834
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,269
-[Berlin chuckles]
-[phone ringing]

835
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,860
Now tell the Professor
you killed a hostage.

836
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,448
Do it.

837
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,491
Hey, Professor.

838
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:23,702
What, are you busy dating? Huh?
Why weren't you answering this whole time?

839
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,371
What's going on right now?

840
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:28,707
Tokyo wants to impeach me because
she doesn't think I'm a good leader.

841
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,918
There must be a reason. Now explain.

842
00:44:32,294 --> 00:44:35,172
Actually, I ordered Denver
to kill a hostage.

843
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,510
Was it her?

844
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,513
That pregnant woman?

845
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,599
[exhales]

846
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:52,272
[Berlin] She made up that thing
about being pregnant, okay?

847
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,190
It was all a lie.

848
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,608
How could you do that?

849
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:58,237
I've emphasized this countless times
and yet, you killed her?

850
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:00,614
On the bright side…

851
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,784
[sucks teeth] …everything is
operating perfectly over here

852
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,452
after we made an example out of her.

853
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,495
[Professor] What?

854
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,580
Perfect?

855
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:10,290
Did you really say perfect?

856
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:11,625
Oh right.

857
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,336
I forgot about that one thing.

858
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,629
I guess not technically perfect

859
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,132
since one of our identities
may have been leaked to the police,

860
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,342
which sounds like
a very big problem to me.

861
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,343
What?

862
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,055
No, there was…

863
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:28,183
a possibility,
so the Professor was looking into it.

864
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,476
And how did that go?

865
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,691
The police have identified Rio.
Nairobi as well.

866
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,573
[nervous breathing]

867
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:43,615
[screams in frustration]

868
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,117
A-Are you serious?

869
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:48,537
I think Rio was the only one
captured on the watch,

870
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,873
but they seemed to have found
surveillance footage…

871
00:45:50,956 --> 00:45:52,082
from one of the pre-visits.

872
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,919
They got Nairobi's face and identity
since she was with Rio that day.

873
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,089
Do any of you think
this would have happened

874
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,049
if things were done my way
from the beginning?

875
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,969
The hostages have been pulling this crap
on us because they don't fear us.

876
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,721
This is the sorta thing
I wanted to prevent.

877
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:06,764
Berlin!

878
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,391
[Berlin] Sorry for going against the rules
without reporting it.

879
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,976
But now look what happened!

880
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,771
Someone should've gotten
their hands dirty early on.

881
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,481
So this operation would be successful.

882
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,775
Your hands have always been dirty!

883
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,943
-It's time to stop joking around.
-Fucking bastard.

884
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:22,112
Hey! Nairobi! Rio!

885
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:24,615
Do you still believe
I'm in the wrong here?

886
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,950
I think you might have
had a change of heart by now.

887
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,243
Is that right?

888
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,162
When all is said and done,

889
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:31,914
the hostages
wouldn't dare try anything else

890
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:34,708
because they're terrified of Berlin.
Isn't that right?

891
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,920
-Nairobi.
-This is how things are.

892
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:42,049
-We all have to adjust somehow.
-[Denver] What the fuck are you doing?

893
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,968
Hey, Rio! You need to it together, okay?

894
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:46,929
You can't let
something like that get to you.

895
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:48,722
They ID'd you. So what?

896
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,432
[breathes angrily]

897
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,018
So what?

898
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:56,396
Fuck off. What do you know?
It's not like they have your photo.

899
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,232
You fucking moron.

900
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,360
Whining about it doesn't change anything.
There's nothing you can do, okay?

901
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,570
So cut this shit out
and take what happened like a man!

902
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,365
What, you think you're any different?
I'm sure your mom who left you…

903
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:10,744
will be thrilled to see on the news that
her little boy currently robbing the Mint.

904
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,079
You…

905
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,540
You shut the fuck up.

906
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:15,707
Fair enough.

907
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,377
Seeing as how you come
from a family of convicts

908
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,546
and killed a person already,
nothing scares you, right?

909
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:21,755
Am I wrong?

910
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:24,341
You fucking son of a bitch,
how dare you!

911
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,051
I've had enough of your shit,
motherfucker.

912
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:28,262
-[Tokyo] Stop! Stop! Stop!
-[both grunting]

913
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:29,513
-Stop!
-[Denver] Let go of me!

914
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,598
Denver, stop! Denver, stop it!

915
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,516
[Moscow] Who…

916
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,059
[both panting]

917
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:35,435
[Tokyo] Oh shit.

918
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,895
Who did you say killed a hostage?

919
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:40,315
No, uh, that's…
that's not what he said, Dad.

920
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:44,236
I ordered him to. The hostages were
getting more and more bold.

921
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:47,155
If Denver hadn't killed her,
things would've gotten much worse.

922
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,032
We should be grateful for what he did.

923
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,452
[breathing heavily]

924
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,497
Is it true?

925
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,207
Huh?

926
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,042
[Denver breathing heavily]

927
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,754
Ah, shit. Damn it.

928
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,339
[cries in fury]

929
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,509
Fuck! You little idiot!

930
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,177
Why did you have to kill her?

931
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:11,847
Who do you think you are,
taking someone's life?

932
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:14,933
Are you going to kill me
if Berlin tells you to?

933
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,101
-Huh?
-Calm down, Dad.

934
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,728
-Moscow, don't.
-Let me go. Let me go.

935
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,563
Dad, you need to calm down!

936
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:22,316
[Moscow] Professor!
Tell me what's going on here.

937
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:25,861
You said there would absolutely be
no deaths. These are your words!

938
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:29,781
[sobs] You said everything would
go according to your plan! Everything!

939
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,700
So what is the meaning of this?

940
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:35,203
Why did… Why did my son have to kill
an innocent person?

941
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,371
[Denver] Dad! Dad!

942
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,832

-I'm okay.
-[Denver] Ah, fuck. Seriously.

947
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:47,674

00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:46,358
Clearly, you forgot
that it was the key principle

962
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:47,484
for our plan to work.

963
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,569
You nearly ruined everything.
Do you understand me?

964
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:51,405
Well, that's a relief.

965
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:53,865
Thank God.

966
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:56,201
What?

967
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,328
So all we have to do is hide the murder.

968
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,955
If it's not for your petty conscience,

969
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,165
then we'll make it
so no one knows about it.

970
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,459
And then it won't
affect the plan whatsoever.

971
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:08,839
Berlin… [sucks teeth]

972
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:11,633
[Denver] Dad.
I swear it's not what you think.

973
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,969
-[Moscow breathes in despair]
-Dad, come on.

974
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:16,930
Please, listen to me for one second.
Damn it.

975
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:20,058
[Moscow] Listen.
Don't follow in my footsteps.

976
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,728
What do you mean don't follow?

977
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:27,441
This may all sound like an excuse.

978
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:31,278
I don't have any real money
or any profound knowledge to give you

979
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:35,323
and you're all I have…
my only child, my little idiot.

980
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,827
[inhales] And it wasn't easy for me
to raise you on my own.

981
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,579
At least, not properly

982
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:45,417
[sighs] So are you saying
I didn't grow up properly?

983
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,878
[Moscow] That's not what I mean.

984
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:53,925
My life was messed up
a very long time ago.

985
00:50:55,469 --> 00:51:00,015
But I'd hoped at least my son
would live a normal, decent life.

986
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,851
A life any ordinary person can live.

987
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,103
[smacks lips]

988

[exhales]

990
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,567
Your mom, there was this one--

991
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,819
You're doing it again! Stop, okay?

992
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,614
Will you just listen to me?

993
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:16,907
[sighs]

994
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,951
Do you know
what your so-called mom said to me

995
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:23,705
when she came to visit me in jail
for the last time before she left us?

996
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,041
She said that…

997
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:30,003
that you'd eventually do
the same things I've done.

998
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:33,965
Do you know how hard I tried,
so you wouldn't end up a criminal like me?

999
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:35,717
Look, Dad…

1000
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,012
Like father, like son.

1001
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:41,348
What's so wrong
with me being like my dad? Huh?

1002
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,724
[smacks lips]

1003
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:45,560
[sighing] You get into trouble
all the time,

1004
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,230
and you go in and out of prison.

1005
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:51,817
Your life has hit rock bottom
and it can't possibly get any worse.

1006
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,820
I feel like I'm responsible for that.

1007
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:58,698
[grunts] It eats away at my heart
all the time.

1008
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,325
[breathes deeply]

1009
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:02,994
Don't do that.

1010
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:05,497
I've never thought of it that way,
I promise.

1011
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,332
Taiksoo.

1012

[sighs]

1015
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,465
This heist…

1016
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,301
Let's do it right.

1017
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,053
Once we finish the job,

1018
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,015
let's live the plain, ordinary life
we've dreamed about together.

1019
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:27,644
Just like ordinary people, for once. Huh?

1020
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:29,771
Uh-huh.

1021
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,523
All right, all right.

1022
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:36,236
Dad, you're making me cringe.
Stop it, please! Okay?

1023
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:38,780
I'm sorry.

1024
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,868
-Dad.
-[sobs]

1025
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:46,204
-You're crying?
-No, of course I'm not crying. [laughs]

1026
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:49,624
[Denver] Stop. I mean it!
Don't start crying, all right?

1027
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,543
All right. [chuckles]

1028
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,378

1032
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,720
Hey, Dad? Dad, wait!

1033
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:04,389
So what? There's no use crying over it.

1034
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,307
What are you gonna do

1035
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:08,185
if the police want to check if
the hostages are alive or not? What then?

1036
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,228
We'll think of a solution if that happens.

1037
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:13,023
Don't you dare give me that nonsense.

1038
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,442
I asked you if you've come up
with a well thought out plan.

1039
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,778
If you didn't,
you'll have to take the responsibility

1040
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,405
for causing a setback to our plan.

1041
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:22,949
[exhales sharply]
Then what do you want to do?

1042
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,242
What's your genius plan?

1043
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,077
Will it involve putting Tokyo in charge?

1044
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,371
When the majority vote was in my favor.
Is that it?

1045
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,497
[Rio] We're fucked.

1046
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,500

What?

[Moohyuk] Seems unarmed. A hostage?

00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:01,947
I'm on my way.

1054
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,951
All units, to the main gate.

1055
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,577
[music continues]

1056
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:33,186
[officer 1] We have visual
of one unidentified middle-aged male.

-Looks to be surrendering.
-[officer 2] All officers remain alert.

Stand by in case of emergency.

[officer 3] Unit one, main priority is
to identify the target from a distance.

1061
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,743

1062
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,620
Remain alert. You may approach.

1063
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:56,001
Ah shit.

1064
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:57,544
Ah, sh--

1065
00:55:00,005 --> 00:55:00,839
Dad!

1066
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,135
-There's one more.
-[Moscow grunts]

1067
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,762
[Denver] Dad. Dad, get down.

1068
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:10,307
Hurry, you have to cover your face!

1069
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,685
He is wearing a mask and is armed.

-[Denver] You can't show your face!
-[Moscow grunting]

1072
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,197
Come on, stay down!

1073
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:27,157
Right…

1074
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,909
It's better that you're here.

1075
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,954
Son, let's turn ourselves in.

1076
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:37,959
But we'll say that I killed that woman.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1077
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:39,878
[sighs]

1078
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,840
Dad, are you crazy?

1079
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,051
Things didn't go as planned,

1080
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:49,929
but they can reduce our sentence
if we surrender peacefully.

1081
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:54,142
[sobbing] A good father wouldn't have
brought you here in the first place.

1082
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:56,853
You said you want to live a new life!

1083
00:55:56,936 --> 00:56:00,023
You're right, I wanted to give you
a new life but instead,

1084
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,859
I've made my only son a murderer!

1085
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,819
[sobbing] I'm sorry!

1086
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,989
Dad, I'm telling you
that I didn't kill her!

[panting]

1088
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:13,286
That one's definitely one of the suspects.

1089
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,205
We have to save the hostage.

1090

[nervous breathing]

1091
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,500
They're both suspects.

1092
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:20,627
What?

1093
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,630
If he wanted to stop a hostage
from running he wouldn't tackle him,

1094
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,173
he'd use his weapon.

1095
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:28,718
Snipers, on standby.

1096

-[Tokyo] Professor, what should we do?
-[Nairobi] What do you mean?

1097
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:37,435
Will anything change if we sit here?
I'll go get them.

[breathes deeply]

1099
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:42,065
What are you gonna do outside
all by yourself?

1100
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,691
Save the day like a Hollywood movie?

1101
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,319
Are we supposed to leave them out there
by themselves?

1102
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,905
We need to come up with a good plan.

1103
00:56:48,988 --> 00:56:51,866
-Isn't that right, Professor?
-Do you have an idea?

1104
00:56:52,617 --> 00:56:53,743
[scoffs]

1105
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:56,663
I do, but I don't know
if the Professor will trust me.

1106
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:01,793
Do you really think I will believe you
if you tell me now?

1107
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:03,962
But I really didn't kill her, okay?

1108
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:06,047
-That woman's alive right now.
-[breathing heavily]

1109
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:09,175
You can go and ask Tokyo
right fucking now! Jeez!

1110
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:12,512
Really?

1111
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:13,596
Ah, sh--

1112
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:15,765
[sighs]

1113
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,560
What are these? Why do you have red spots?

1114
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,145
[Woojin] Attention, you on the ground!

1115
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:23,440
Three sniper units have their sights
on the two of you as we speak.

1116
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,568
You can't go back in, or escape them.

1117
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:29,404
So drop your weapons
and surrender immediately.

1118
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:30,405
[breathing shakily]

1119
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:32,323
[hostages screaming]

1120
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,284
-Get out! Move it!
-Move! Come on!

1121
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:36,953
Those selected will carry out
a very special mission, all right?

1122
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,705
What is this?
Are you going to kill us all?

1123
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:41,791
What's going on? Are the negotiations
with the police not going well? Huh?

1124
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:42,792
Stop making a big fuss.

1125
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:45,128
Anything stupid you do
will only decrease your lifespan.

1126
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:46,379
Keep that in mind.

1127
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,256
[Youngmin] Please! No!

1128
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:50,133
[hostages whimpering]

1129
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,135
[Youngmin whimpers in fear]

1130
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:53,595
Get over here.

1131
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,140
Do you think they've been
fighting amongst themselves, or what?

1132
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,976
[sighs] We'll find out
once we arrest them.

1133
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:04,355
If we can grab them we'll be able
to end the hostage situation.

1134
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,484
Keep your eyes on the armed suspect.

1135
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:09,861
Our priority right now
is to capture them alive.

1136
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:13,823
There's more coming out of the gate.

1137
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,450
[suspenseful music playing]

1138
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,539
[thrilling electro music playing]

1139
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,035
[officer] We can't tell anyone apart.

1140
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,496
They're all armed.

1141
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:07,085
[Berlin] Professor,
how do you like my plan?

1142
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:11,047
I'll admit it's a good plan.
But it's a huge gamble.

1143
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:13,341
If any of the hostages try to run…

1144
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:16,678
At this point
the hostages won't do anything foolish.

1145
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:18,930
Now they know
what will happen to them if they do.

1146
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:20,390
That's how humans are.

1147
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:22,600
If you scare them,
they lie flat on the floor.

1148
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:25,186
If you show weakness,
they'll come running to bite.

1149
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:30,024
That is why the only way to bring humans
under control is to instill fear in them.

1150
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:34,279
Of course,
I respect that you have noble ideas,

1151
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,906
and I know Tokyo follows that.

1152
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:42,120
But where there's light,
there will always be a shadow

1153
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:44,998
and I've simply taken on
the role of the shadow.

1154
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,334
So that you can shine.

1155
00:59:58,386 --> 01:00:00,680
[Woojin] You're not just putting
the hostages in danger

1156
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,807
but you're also putting
yourselves in danger.

1157
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:04,809
I'm asking you
to put down your weapons, now!

1158
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:08,688
[Tokyo] We are not here to fight.
We will retreat in peace…

1159
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:11,024
so put your guns down now!

1160
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:13,860
Are we just going to stand and watch?
We need to do something!

1161
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:16,571
Things could escalate of we move too fast.

1162
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,239
Ugh, dammit!

1163
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,619
[Denver] Dad, Dad, Dad.
Put the mask on first.

1164
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:25,622
Hurry, you need to cover your face.
Put this on.

1165
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,707
[Youngmin breathing heavily

1166
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:33,046
It's less than 100 meters to there, right?

1167
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,256
[Park] But, sir, you could get shot!

1168
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,175
[Youngmin breathing heavily]

1169
01:00:37,258 --> 01:00:40,136
[Moscow] Tokyo, is it true that
that woman is still alive?

1170
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:41,346
[Tokyo] Yeah, it's true.

1171
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,640
Denver isn't someone
who would murder anybody.

1172
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,600
You're his father,
you should know that better.

1173
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:47,852
[Denver] I pretended to kill her
then hid her in the basement.

1174
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:50,021
I couldn't tell you
because of that bastard Berlin!

1175
01:00:50,104 --> 01:00:51,939
[Rio] Hey. What are you talking about?

1176
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,901
Berlin, that thing you said
about ruling with fear.

1177
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,779
Does that only apply to the hostages
or to everyone?

1178
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:58,696
What?

1179
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,698
[Professor] After the video
leaked to the police,

1180
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,825
our members seem to be
under your control as well.

1181
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:04,869
Was that intended?

1182
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:06,079
[tense music playing]

1183
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:08,956
No way.

1184
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,169
[music continues]

1185
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:22,136
[Rio] Is what you said true?

1186
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,223
[Denver] Why? So you can rat me out
to Berlin again like a fucking pussy?

1187
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:27,308
-[Rio] What did you say?
-[Tokyo] Now's not the time.

1188
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:29,060
-We can talk back inside.
-[Youngmin gasps]

1189
01:01:29,143 --> 01:01:31,646
[man] You want to see another person
die because of your behavior?

1190
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,731
-[Youngmin] Let go of me!
-[Tokyo] Helsinki.

1191
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,317
[Rio] Okay, but can you just tell me
if that's true or not?

1192
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:39,696
[Denver] Come on, let's get inside first!
We don't have time for this whining.

1193
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:42,073
-[Rio] What? Whining?
-[Denver] Motherfucker!

1194
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:43,574
[Rio] Damn it! Are you serious?

1195
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:45,243
[Moscow] Come on, stop it.

1196
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:48,204
[Youngmin grunts] Freeze, you bastards!
I'll shoot if you move.

1197
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:49,872
-[man] Is that--
-[Youngmin] Stand back!

1198
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,375
Be ready to open fire. Be ready.

1199
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:55,628
[Youngmin] Don't come any closer!

1200
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,547
-Drop your guns!
-[Tokyo] What are you doing?

1201
01:01:57,630 --> 01:01:58,631
Put down the gun.

1202
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,133
[Youngmin] Shut up!

1203
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:02,510
Don't come near me. Stand back!

1204
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:03,886
[Tokyo] Put the gun down!

1205
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:06,097
-[Moscow] Be careful.
-[Youngmin] No, you drop yours!

1206
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:07,682
Put it down!

1207
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:12,937
-Don't move!
-[Moohyuk] We have to shoot.

1208
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,605
[Woojin breathing shakily]

1209
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:18,443
[Youngmin] I said, don't move!

1210
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,447
[Tokyo] Everyone put your guns down.

1211
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,533
-[Youngmin grunts]
-[Moscow] Put down your gun.

1212
01:02:25,616 --> 01:02:27,952
-[Youngmin] Now! That's right!
-[Rio] Hey!

1213
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:30,329
[Youngmin] Just like that! On your knees!

1214
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:31,831
Sit down!

1215
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:37,837
-We have to shoot!
-[breathing heavily]

[music continues]

1219
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:57,815
Fire.
