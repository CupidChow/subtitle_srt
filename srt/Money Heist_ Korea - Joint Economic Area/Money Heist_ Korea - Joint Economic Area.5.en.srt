00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:36,135
[Rio moaning]

161
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,763
So cold.

162
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,351
[Tokyo] Hmm.

163
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:48,356
He's got pretty hands for a guy.

164
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,450
[door opens]

165
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,578
[door closes]

166
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,539
[moaning]

167
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,426
[suspenseful music playing]

168
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:37,822
[agent] Moohyuk, take a break.
I'll update you when you come back.

169
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,283
Okay, I will.

170
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,911
[breathes deeply]

171
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,840
We've received word.

172
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,301
What took so long? Let's go.

173
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,721
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

174
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,520
-[radio beeps]
-Park Chulwoo, can you hear me?

175
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,940
[Chulwoo] Yes, but I'm in a tight spot,
so I can't talk for long.

176
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:13,858
[Moohyuk] Understood.

177
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,485
The higher-ups have ordered
to end the situation soon.

178
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,030
Your mission is to find their leader
and kill him. It's up to you to end this.

179
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,949
-Kill the Professor?
-[Moohyuk] Yes.

180
00:12:22,032 --> 00:12:24,660
without him leading them,
the suspects are only mindless sheep.

181
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,829
Once you've taken care of the Professor,

182
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,622
we'll raid the Mint
and deal with the rest.

183
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,875
What about the hostages?

184
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:36,922
Remember that your priority is
to deal with the Professor.

185
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:41,010
We'll have to accept the consequences.

186
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,938
We believe the suspects have an informant
inside the Task Force.

187
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,815
So this operation will proceed in secret.

188
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,276
[Tokyo] At this moment, seeds of failure

189
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,404
that could greatly jeopardize
the Professor's plan were growing,

190
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,156
both inside and outside the Mint.

191
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:06,660
In the next 12 hours, each suspect
will either be shot or taken away.

192
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,831
One of these seeds planted itself
inside the Professor's heart

193
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,291
It was called guilt.

194
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,756
[shivering]

195
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,342
[exhales]

196
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,927
[shivering]

197
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,558
[door opens]

198
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,568
Why are you sweating so much?

199
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,488
Because I'm terminally ill.

200
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,325
[laughs] I'm sure you are.

201
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,535
[Berlin] Rio.

202
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,414
There's a bottle of medicine hidden
in a bookshelf in the Director's office.

203
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,667
Could you try to get it for me?

204
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:01,131
Stop trying to trick me
and just eat your fucking food.

205
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,425
Doesn't everyone miss me, Rio? Huh?

206
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,468
[scoffs]

207
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,136
[inhales deeply]

208
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,306
Right about now,
they're probably very excited

209
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,933
after seeing their new leader.

210
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,936
Everything's finally running smoothly,
thanks to Tokyo.

211
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,356
You think everything
will go according to plan?

212
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,571
Berlin, look at me.

213
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,909
You need to try

214
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,911
to embrace the change.

215
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,747
[chuckles]

216
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,087

00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:58,147
[indistinct chatter]

221
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,277
[hostage whispering] Are they
gonna do something to us?

222
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,122
We asked you all to be here
'cause we have…

223
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,419
[exhales]

224
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,464
Can you tell them instead?

225
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,591
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-[sighs]

226
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:34,308
We have good news and we have bad news.
Which do you want to hear first?

227
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,061
What's with this vibe?

228
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,234
Mr. Troublemaker, your pick.
What do you wanna hear first?

229
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,321
The good news or the bad news?

230
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,365
W-W-When you say bad news,

231
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,951
do you mean
somebody else was killed again?

232
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,037
What? Is that what you think of us?

233
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:56,830
-[gasps]
-[hostages gasp]

234
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,666
-You really have a death wish, don't you?
-No.

235
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:02,503
That's not what I… I meant!
That's my wound. That's my wound. Ahh!

236
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:03,754
[panting]

237
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,175
Fine, then I'll pick.
You'll get the bad news first.

238
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,221
Berlin's gonna be out for a while.

239
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,306
[all murmuring]

240
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,102
So then, you said there was good news?

241
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,062
See for yourselves.

242
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,525
[grunting] Be careful walking.

243
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,985
Be careful there.

244
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,445
-[all murmuring]
-They didn't kill her?

245
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,531
[excited chatter]

246
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,119
[all applauding]

247
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,125
[hostages cheering]

248
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,585
[door opens]

249
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,671
[hostages applauding in distance]

250
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,590
[applause continues]

251
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,733
You will all stay in here from now on.

252
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,276
We'll only be guarding the exits,

253
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,319
so you can use the restrooms
whenever you want.

254
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,030
Men and women will now sleep separately

255
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,866
except for those of you
who have sustained injuries.

256
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,410
This should be far more comfortable
than sleeping in the lobby.

257
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,622
Do the injured go this way?

258
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,834
Okay. Slowly, slowly.

259
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,046
-[Nairobi] I really mean it when…
-Slowly.

260
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,923
…I say we have absolutely no intention
of hurting any of you.

261
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,216
There. Be careful.

262
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,428
[Nairobi] I hope you'll forget all
the bad things Berlin ordered us to do.

263
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,848
So that we can build
a cooperative relationship.

264
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,683
Do I make myself clear?

265
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,020
Do you get me?

266
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,774
All right. [claps]
Workers, go on and get to work.

267
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,192
The injured are exempt.

268
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,695
And the rest of you can rest here until
your next shift starts in a few hours.

269
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,613
Okay?

270
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,573
[gasps, exhales]

271
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,116
[chuckles]

272
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,620
Wow, Nairobi, you're good at this, huh?

273
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,038
[Denver and Nairobi laugh]

274
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,623
And I must say,

275
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:06,585
I think Tokyo is a way better leader
than Berlin. Am I right?

276
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:08,754
I'm going to be totally devoted
to Tokyo now.

277
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,089
Dear leader Tokyo!

278
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,799
Salute!

279
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,884
[laughing]

280
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,142
According to this map, we'll have units
A and B follow this route right here.

281
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,936
[siren wailing]

282
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,858
[inhales deeply]

283
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,902
I know everyone has had a rough night.

284
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,196
Each and every one
of our plans have failed.

285
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,907
Every one. And I mean every one.

286
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,328
But we need to get back on our feet
for the hostages trapped inside the Mint.

287
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,666
Let's pull through
until the headlines say,

288
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,252
"The police from South and North Korea
have safely

289
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:52,506
rescued dozens of hostages
by working together."

290
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,716
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yeah, all right!

291
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,303
Anything unusual happen?

292
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,975
Since you've completely
recovered overnight, Inspector.

293
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,103
I guess I got good sleep.

294
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,981
Were you home by yourself last night,
or did you…

295
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,067
or did you meet that male friend of yours?

296
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,325
[Woojin] Am I being interrogated?

297
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,244
Do I have to answer your question?

298
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,414
[Moohyuk] I'm sorry if you felt that way.

299
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,709
You're right.

300
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,963
Oh, I haven't had
a night like that in ages.

301
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,548
Want to hear about that too?

302
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,262
I think that's enough chit-chat.

303
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,473
-Get ready to connect.
-[agent] Yes, ma'am.

304
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,642
[tense music playing]

[phone ringing]

307
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,582
[Woojin] Good morning.

308
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,918
Did you have breakfast?

309
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,881
I did. Actually,
the Mint has a very talented cook.

310
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:17,966
What was on the menu this morning?

311
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,722
[Professor] Sandwiches.

312
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,226
[inhales deeply] First of all,

313
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:30,354
I want to thank you
for cooperating with us

314
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,022
in treating the Director yesterday.

315
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:35,984
By the way, kudos for changing the masks.
It was refreshing.

316
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,027
[chuckles]

317
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,030
That was a nice diversion. Was it okay?

318
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:43,492
Well, you did say that you were thorough.

319
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,744
You're not planning
on staying in there forever, are you?

320
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:48,747
[Professor] Even if I wanted to leave,
it's not like you're helping.

321
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,165
How much food do you have left?

322
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,292
You should be running low by now,
am I right?

323
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:56,255
Correct. We could hold up longer
by giving less food to the hostages,

324
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,090
but I don't want to.

325
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,093
I think I can arrange something
to help you out with that.

326
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,469
I take it's not for free.

327
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,349
[whispering] Ask for Anne.

328
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,771
-It's an act of goodwill.
-Ah--

329
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:17,776
But on the one condition that
you do not hurt the hostages in any way.

330
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,487
[Professor] You've got a deal.

331
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,781
I'll give you a call when we're ready.

332
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:23,991
[call disconnects]

333
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,703
How could you just hand it over like that?

334
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,038
Give-and-take is a must in negotiating!

335
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,790
Don't you think he knows

336
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:34,835
that it would be easier for us
to raid them if he releases Anne?

337
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,754
They've caught us red-handed
twice already.

338
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,382
We need to rebuild trust.

339
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,925
[Chief sighs]

340
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,760
Get the food suppliers
on the phone right now.

341
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,845
[agent] Yes, ma'am.

342
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,055
[sighs]

343
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:55,480
[breathes deeply]

344
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,817
[hostage 1] Berlin was the problem.

345
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,320
The others seem pretty okay, to be honest.

346
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,738
[hostage 2] I think so too.

347
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,615
Didn't the one they call Denver
hide Ms. Yun to save her life?

348
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,742
Mm-hmm.

349
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:09,411
We're hurt and need to rest!
So stop that racket!

350
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:11,079
[groaning]

351
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,540
Ah shit.

352
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,877
We're both injured.
Please don't forget about that.

353
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,837
Stop bothering us and go away.

354
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,297
Go!

355
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,674
[grunts] Let's go.

356
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:24,426
[Youngmin] They are all
out of their minds.

357
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,472
[sighs]

358
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,808
Was it hard?

359
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,561
I thought you were dead,

360
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:38,315
and drove myself crazy
thinking it was all my fault.

361
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,068
That's why I completely lost my mind

362
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,613
and got hurt trying to shoot down
all of those fucking bastards.

363
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,699
I'm so relieved, Misun.
You know that, right?

364
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:49,409
[groans]

365
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,120
Wait. Where's your necklace?

366
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,538
There it is.

367
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,959
For a second, I thought they took it
from you. It's expensive.

368
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,464
I need to rest.

369
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:03,382
Huh?

370
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,385
Oh. Okay.

371
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,723
Wh-What is it now?

372
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:12,682
Yun Misun.

373
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:17,771
You need your, uh… your bandage changed.
Follow me.

374
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:19,564
[sighs]

375
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,652
Come on. What's taking you so long, huh?

376
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:28,156
Here, like this.

377
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,035
Let's put this on.

378
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,914
At this speed, we're not gonna be able
to change the bandage today.

379
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,666
Here, grab my shoulder.

380
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,752
Be careful. There we go.

381
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,172
[Youngmin] What about me?

382
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,425
-[Denver] What?
-I'm a patient too, okay?

383
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,052
Yeah. But you were treated by a doctor.

384
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,849
Okay, careful. Watch your step.

385
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,894
[grunts softly]

386
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:03,525
[sighs]

387
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:08,321
-[gasps, whimpers]
-Oh-- Did I do something wrong?

388
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,074
It was too tight, right?
I'll be more careful.

389
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,827
Does it hurt a little less if I do this?

390
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,665
[Denver exhales, clicks tongue]

391
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:23,211
Do you want me to move you
so you can rest?

392
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,340
Huh?

393
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:34,681
I… I mean, because with that jerk
right next to you,

394
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:38,351
he's gonna keep bothering you
and make you uncomfortable. [sighs]

395
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,856
I wouldn't be uncomfortable
if it wasn't for what you did.

396
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:46,276
-Huh?
-Thank you again for saving my life.

397
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,945
But you're a thief, and I'm a hostage.

398
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,531
It is what it is.

399
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,659
[sighs]

400
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,250
From now on, I…
I can take care of myself.

401
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,880
-[groans]
-Oh no! Shit. Are you okay?

402
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,173
Let me help you.

403
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:11,593
I got you. I got you. There we go.

404
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,515
Ah shit.

405
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,267
[suspicious music playing]

406
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:24,981
[clears throat]

407
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:26,858
Hey.

408
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,736
Did you see Denver walk through here
with Yun Misun?

409
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,071
Uh-huh.

410
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,614
Hold on.

411
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:38,370
I don't recognize you.
You're not an employee.

412
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:40,705
Oh. [chuckles]

413
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,583
-Um, I'm with the school hostages.
-The school?

414
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,168
But there's only one teacher.

415
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,712
And you're not a student…

416
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,881
-Uh, I'm…
-[Anne] Excuse me, sir!

417
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,342
-Yeah?
-[footsteps approaching]

418
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:56,346
I think one of the toilets is broken
in the ladies' room. Can you take a look?

419
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,933
-Do you know this man?
-Yeah. He's our school bus driver.

420
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,017
Why?

421
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,311
Hurry up! What are you waiting for?

422
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:05,855
[door opens]

423
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,778
-[groaning]
-Oh God! I got you. I got you.

424
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:30,130
[panting]

425
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,424
I'm impressed, officer.

426
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,426
You've been snuck in with the same outfit.

427
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,386
You don't have to thank me.

428
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:39,264
You're Anne, right? Are you Anne Kim?

429
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,016
[Anne] So what's your guys' plan?

430
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,144
Maybe I can help you, like I did just now.

431
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,399
Actually, have you ever seen one of
the thieves whose name is "the Professor?"

432
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,359
Professor?

433
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:53,570
No, I haven't heard of him.

434
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,114
[sighs]

435
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:57,866
[gasps]

436
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,619
There's someone who might know.

437
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,663
Make sure to exclude any instant food

438
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,833
and instead include any ingredients, um,

439
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,169
that take more time to cook and prepare.

440
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,128
Sure.

441
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,799
FOOD INVENTORY

442
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,218
Oh. And don't send food like sandwiches.

443
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,889
Uh, the menu is made up of Korean food,
so sandwiches won't be included.

444
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:21,806
Okay.

445
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,354
[dramatic whoosh]

446
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:29,522
[exhales]

447
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:32,317
[gasps]

448
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,530
They've been playing us this whole time.

449
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,948
The Professor isn't in the Mint.

450
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,241
What?

451
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,119
[Woojin] Earlier, I asked him
what he had for breakfast

452
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:44,871
[panting] He made a mistake.

453
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,289
[panting]

454
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,834
They've been one step ahead of us
from the very beginning.

455
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:54,047
And it's because the Professor has been
watching everything from the outside

456
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,633
and sending instructions
to everyone inside.

457
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,845
[Moohyuk] You think the Professor
is outside, all because of a subtle clue?

458
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,349
How can he communicate with the suspects
when we've restricted all the networks?

459
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,684
They have a hacker, remember?

460
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,688
I don't know, but what if
they know how to avoid getting detected?

461
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,855
[Moohyuk] Even so,

462
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,858
the fact that they can see through
all of our plans…

463
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,696
That's impossible.
Unless they have an informant.

464
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,239
I don't know.

465
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,242
He maybe somewhere very close.

466
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,953
Didn't we see a car
in the surveillance footage?

467
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,454
-Did you track it down?

468
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,833
That car? The same thing happened when
they entered the Mint. It vanished.

469
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,168
[Woojin] Is there
a more precise way to track it?

470
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,837
[Chief] What's so special about the car?

471
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,341
[Woojin] Where do you think the car went
after they finished casing the Mint?

472
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,759
Back to the rest of the suspects.

473
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,178
And those same suspects
held up the Mint a week after

474
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,389
and are still in there
holding the hostages.

475
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:46,141
What if one of them is outside?

476
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,268
What if it's the Professor
heading the operation?

477
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:51,354
We can't disperse our resources
based on hunches or mere assumptions.

478
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,356
It will only cause unnecessary chaos.

479
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,067
But what if the Professor
is really outside the Mint?

480
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:58,903
Their game is over
the minute we catch him.

481
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,240
Then how about assigning only a few
South Korean agents

482
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,700
to focus on tracking down the car.

483
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:06,327
We need to be here on standby,
in case any incidents arise.

484
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,788
[Chief] That sounds like a good idea.
Inspector Seon?

485
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,084
All right.

486
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:17,046
Dongchul, I want you to check
the route the car took one more time

487
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,339
and search the junkyards too.

488
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,717
They could've disposed of it
before they started the heist.

489
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,010
Already on it, ma'am.

490
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,303
[keys clacking]

491
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,604
-Careful. Watch out. Coming through.
-Yep.

492
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,439
[grunts]

493
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:37,484
You know how in like lot of the movies,

494
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,653
they, like, trace calls
and find our location and stuff?

495
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:41,863
How's that gonna work?

496
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:45,700
Look. What do you think
we need all this equipment for?

497
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:49,788
Do you really wonder why we're connecting
cables that smell like a fucking sewer?

498
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,664
Like, seriously?

499
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,042
-Yeah, yeah, you're so smart.
-[Rio] Okay?

500
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,087
-[Denver] Get over yourself.
-Dammit!

501
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,218
Anyway, I was thinking,

502
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,179
Shouldn't your base of operations
be hidden?

503
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,348
Are you sure you want it set up
in a store like this?

504
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,225
The more you have to hide something,

505
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,685
the better it is to hide it
in plain sight.

506
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,395
[Rio] What does that even mean?

507
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,941
Anyway, if you ever get caught
doing all of this from here,

508
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,443
I'm totally going to book it
and leave you all behind.

509
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:22,445
Shut up, you dimwit.

510
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,447
That's what the Professor told us to do.

511
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,534
I mean, aside from the Professor
getting caught by the police,

512
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,954
we'll already be screwed
if they find out he isn't inside the Mint.

513
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,664
-What?
-You little…

514
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:33,706
[Professor] He's right.

515
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,750
If they find out I'm elsewhere,

516
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,628
they'll realize that our operation
isn't the typical hostage situation

517
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,840
and it won't be long until
our entire plan goes wrong.

518
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,596
[Tokyo] How's the escape route
coming along?

519
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,932
-Hmm?
-[Moscow inhales deeply] It's fine so far.

520
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:53,476
As long as we don't run into bedrock,
we'll be…

521
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:55,854
[tuts]

522
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,523
Well, would you look at that.

523
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,817
-That little boy's got a crush on you.
-[clears throat]

524
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,319
[laughs]

525
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:09,826
I'm sorry, but the Professor
banned relationships for a reason.

526
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:10,994
Don't forget.

527
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,037
Nothing's going on.

528
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:14,706
[inhales deeply]

529
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,543
At your age sparks fly
just by looking into someone's eyes.

530
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,379
You might not be able to help yourself
from falling for someone,

531
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:24,549
especially when you are together
in a life-or-death situation like this.

532
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,342
You don't even know what hit ya. Hmm?

533
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,469
Speaking from experience?

534
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,807
[clears throat] What experience?

535
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,268
Look, just keep that in mind.

536
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,896
[phone ringing]

537
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,612
Professor.

538
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,407
What?

539
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,367
Oh shit.

540
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,579
[door closes]

541
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,005
[Denver grunting]

542
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,638
[gasps, exhales]

543
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:13,723
[sighs]

544
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,476
[breathes deeply]

545
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,737
-What are you-- [gasps]
-Uh-- Uh--

546
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,948
He's a police officer.
He's got a question for you.

547
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,826
-[sighs] He's a cop?
-[Chulwoo] Ms. Yun Misun?

548
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,536
You spent much time with your captives.

549
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,622
Did you happen to see
someone called the Professor?

550
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:40,166
Professor?

551
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,918
-I'll count to three. One.
-[Denver] Shit.

552
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,630
If the Professor finds out,
he's not gonna just let this stand.

553
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,298
[gasps] I've heard of him.

554
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,801
What can you tell me about him?

555
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:54,305
Listen up. Shift change
for the currency printing group.

556
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,598
Good work, Mr. Cheongmyung,

557
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,684
and everyone,
you've really been doing a great job.

558
00:32:57,767 --> 00:33:01,729
Since conditions have got so much better,
let's have a great time this shift.

559
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,148
Let's go. Come on.

560
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,737
How about you? Don't you need a break?

561
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,741
The supervisor has to be on top of it
for things to run smoothly.

562
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,369
-You understand.
-[chuckles]

563
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,328
[chuckles]

564
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:21,749
[tense music playing]

565
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:25,670
-Things good here?
-Of course. [laughs]

566
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,048
-Take it easy.
-Move. Let's go!

567
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:32,885
We're gonna print ten billion this shift.
Yeah! Ten billion.

568
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,562
-Mr. Park.
-[grunts]

569
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,023
Where did Yun Misun go now?

570
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,318
I don't know.
I haven't seen her in a while.

571
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,529
She probably went to
go change her bandage.

572
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,031
-What?
-Hmm.

573
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:56,868
[huffs]

574
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,293
Damn it. [panting]

575
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,301
Son of a bitch!

576
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,511
So then Denver said to Berlin,

577
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,139
that the Professor wouldn't
let it stand if he found out.

578
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,390
That's exactly what I heard.

579
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,976
-Have you seen him though?
-Mm-mm.

580
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,563
I don't understand.

581
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,608
But at least that means Berlin and Denver
are not the Professor.

582
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:31,027
So that means the Professor has to be
one of the others.

583
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,070
[banging on door]

584
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,280
[Youngmin] Misun!
You're in there, aren't you?

585
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,948
Isn't that the Director?

586
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,825
[banging continues]

587
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,995
Open the door! I know you're in there!

588
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,665
Did you think I wouldn't find out?
Did he save you so you can be with him?

-[Misun] Lower your voice.
-Lower my voice?

00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,136
-Why? Everyone should know!
-[door access beeps]

595
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,060
There. I see him.
I see a man in there. Hah!

596
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,603

00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,284
The police? But how did you…

601

-[Oslo] What's all the racket?
-[gasps]

What is this?

00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,130
Um, the…

605
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,924
The stall door wasn't opening for me.

606
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:37,510
Even if you had to go really bad,
this is the ladies' room!

607
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,221
Yeah… you're right.

608
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,181
[chuckles] You're right about that.

You don't, uh, want to open that.

616
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,387
[Oslo] Why?

617
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,307

are you doing in here?

Something's a little weird in here.

622
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,830
The Professor's asking for you.

623
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,415
[Oslo] The Professor wants me?

624
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,626
[Helsinki] I swear.
Did you screw something up?

625
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:56,214
Yeah. Then why else would he be looking
for your dumb ass personally?

Hurry up.

Oh, don't do that again.

636
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,889
Did you just see that? [laughs]

637
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,732
[dramatic whoosh]

638
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:04,657
[Oslo] The car?

639
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,450
[Professor] Did you make sure
it was crushed?

640
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:10,037
Of course. I even gave them some extra
cash so they would handle it immediately.

641
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,789
[Professor] And did you see it
get crushed?

642
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:14,667
Uh…

643
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,961
No, I… I didn't check.

644
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,006
That car not only has
everyone's fingerprints and DNA

645
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,173
but it also has mine.

646
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,093
I'm sure it's well taken care of.
It has to be.

647
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,262
Where is the junkyard?

648
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,308
A place called Imjingang.
It's called Hyeongje Carworld.

649
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,350
Hold on.

650
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,102
Where is it?

651
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,395
[Dongchul] Take a look at this.

652
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,480
[suspenseful music playing]

653
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,234
This is one of the illegal used-car sites.

654
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,986
I think they changed the plate,

655
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,739
but the color, type, and model year,
all match what we're looking for.

656
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,157
You found it.

657
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,701
[Tokyo] As the economic cooperation policy

658
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:51,037
led North Koreans to financial freedom,

659
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,332
the first item on their wish list,
a car from South Korea,

660
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,417
a symbol of success.

661
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,920
As the demand for cars
in the North surged,

662
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,715
parasites from all over
crawled out of the woodworks.

663
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,633
They took scrap cars from the South

664
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,386
and fixed them up
just enough to resell them.

665
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:13,225
These fixed-up lemons were literally
ticking time bombs on wheels.

666
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:17,688
But that didn't matter,
not to the seller nor the buyer.

667
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,649
it's Hyeongje Carworld at Imjingang.

668
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:24,904
Take care of things.

669
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:27,948
-Let's go.
-[Dongchul] Yes, ma'am.

670
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,451
[suspenseful music playing]

671
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,638
[Youngmin sighs] The Professor…

672
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,848
What are you going to do
when you find him?

673
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,183
I'll take him out myself.

674
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,810
And as soon as that happens,

675
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,020
the suppression operation
will begin out there.

676
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,190
Ah. Take down the leader
and clean up the rest of them.

677
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,818
So then what about the rest of us?

678
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,945
Won't that be dangerous?

679
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,739
Think about it. After you kill the leader,

680
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,908
it's no guarantee
that the rest of them will surrender.

681
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,704
It'll be total chaos in here
once the operations starts.

682
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,416
Hey, it's better to end this quick
even though it's dangerous.

683
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,043
[sighs]

684
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,673
Then how about we do this?

685
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,510
-We give everyone a heads-up to evacuate--
-[Youngmin] Seriously?

686
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,762
If we do that, then we'll get caught.

687
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,889
We can't let things get too complicated.

688
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,312
Ah! There's a way to find out
who the Professor is.

689
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:47,820
We lure out the dumbest one of them,
and beat the crap out of him

690
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,864
until he tells us who he is.

691
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,869
[exhales]

692
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,079
-You're not…
-Why?

693
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,879
But he protected me, he saved my life.

694
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:08,048
Yeah, but wasn't he the one who shot you
in the leg in the first place?

695
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,592
[breathing heavily]

696
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,886
Hey, Yun Misun.

697
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,388
I think you're seriously confused,
but you need to wake up now.

698
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,307
We're in this fucked-up situation

699
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,642
because of those fucking
greedy bastards. All right?

700
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,895
I don't know how much
that bastard cared for you,

701
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,606
but you need to come
to your senses! Come on!

702
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,276
[nervous breathing]

703
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:32,865
[sighs] Shit…

704
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,910
[breathes deeply]

705
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,171
[Misun] Hey. Thank you.

706
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,256
You saved my life.

707
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,344
[chuckles softly]

708
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,803
E-Excuse me.

709
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,307
[clears throat] What? What is it?

710
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,184
Somebody asked me to give this to you.

711
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,148
What is this?

712
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,274
[grunts]

713
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,153
[exhales]

714
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,032
What?

715
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:19,745
I HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.
LUNCHTIME, EXHIBITION HALL STORAGE - MISUN

716
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:20,788
[grunts]

717
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:26,961
Huh? What…

718
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,631
[upbeat music playing]

719
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,386
[whistling]

720
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,232
[continues whistling]

721
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,159
[knocking on door]

722
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:00,953
Misun?

723
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,667
-Misun, hey, are you in here?
-[door closes]

724
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,378
[tense music playing]

725
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,009
[grunts]

726
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,353
[sighs]

727
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:30,858
[sighs]

728
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,153
Are you all right?

729
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,741
Uh… yeah.

730
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:42,620
You should get some rest. You're probably
still hurting from the surgery yesterday.

731
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:45,414
It's not so bad if I don't move too much.

732
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,292
You don't want to overwork yourself, okay?

733
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,130
It's better for me to be busy
so that I can take my mind off things.

734
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,174
[scoffs]

735
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,759
Um, wait.

736
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:00,638
[sighs]

737
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,935
Never mind.

738
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,146
Mm-hmm.

739
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,981
[breathes deeply]

740
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:13,442

00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,778
[breathes deeply]

742
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:20,240
[indistinct chatter]

743
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:32,336
It's a good thing
that now we can all stay together, right?

744
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,253
Huh?

745
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:36,965
-Yeah, sure.
-I was really worried about you.

746
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:41,303
Uh, it wasn't just me. Everyone else too.

747
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,554
And the teacher.

748
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,015
[exhales]

[gasps]

752
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,461
What is the Director's
crazy plan for us this time?

753
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,589
How should I know?

754
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:18,757
[sighs]

755
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:22,886
I only care
about the safety of the hostages.

756
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,764
Is it something I should worry about?

757
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,316
[upbeat music playing]

758
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,943
[grunting]

759
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,572
Save your breath.
That's a sure-fire way to die.

760
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:42,948
Motherfucker!

761
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,033
[laughing evilly]

762
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,994
Look at you. It serves you right!

763
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,245
-[gasping]
-[Youngmin laughs]

764
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,038
Where's the Professor? Tell us or you die.

765
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:54,251
Professor? Why are you looking
for the Professor?

766
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,503
So you can slit his throat?

767
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:58,255
Tell me!

768
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,841
Guess what, you'll have to slit my throat

769
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,385
because I'm the Professor.

770
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,179
-[laughs]
-You little shit.

771
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,639
Stop fucking lying,
you worthless pile of shit.

772
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,933
[panting]

773
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,811
Tell us or I will really kill you.

774
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:17,107
Ah shit. Seriously.
Who is this Professor anyway?

775
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,275
[groans]

776
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,944
Your fucking boss, the one in charge.

777
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,696
He calls himself the Professor,

778
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,407
and for some reason
none of the hostages have seen him.

779
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,117
-So where is he?
-[gasps]

780
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,579
Wait. wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

781
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:32,790
Huh? The question should be,
"Who is the Professor?"

782
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,542
I already know it's not you
or that fucking psychopath Berlin.

783
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,213
It's definitely not Helsinki
and it couldn't possibly be Oslo.

784
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,923
So that leaves just four of you. Huh?

785
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:42,841
It has to be one of them.

786
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,843
It can't be Moscow!

787
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,011
Rio?

788
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:49,097
No, no, no, no.
Rio is too… Rio's too young.

789
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,307
Nairobi?

790
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:51,433
[Denver] Dear leader Tokyo!

791
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,310
Salute!

792
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:54,937
[Denver laughs]

793
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:59,191
Right. Tokyo! It has to be her.

794
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:00,818
Nairobi looked like the leader,

795
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,403
but Tokyo, she's the one
who ordered her! Am I right?

796
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:07,282

What do you mean by that?

815
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,931
Moving forward,
we will take down the Professor

816
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:14,516
and launch an offensive.
