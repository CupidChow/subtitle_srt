<i>[Episode 37]</i>

22
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,219
I came to Mobei to find gromwell.

23
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,939
Because the plague has hit the Eagle Division.

24
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:43,819
But meanwhile, Khan's tent has blocked all the access to the gromwell.

25
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,459
What does it mean?

26
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:47,918
It means they have abandoned the Eagle Division.

27
00:01:47,918 --> 00:01:50,520
Now, we have to form an alliance!

28
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:55,160
Whether Eagle Division will live or die is none of our business.

29
00:01:57,339 --> 00:01:59,698
The man saw me, it was obvious.

30
00:01:59,699 --> 00:02:00,718
He also recognized me.

31
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:02,639
But why did he seem so calm?

32
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:04,378
That was because he saw the leaders of Monan and Mobei

33
00:02:04,379 --> 00:02:06,418
with the military counselor of the Eagle Division.

34
00:02:06,419 --> 00:02:10,139
He must've seen that as a sign of political collusion between you and the Eagle Division.

35
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:14,160
If we let him go back, I'm afraid you'll be facing your doom.

36
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,500
No.

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,059
As long as we tie you up

38
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,138
and let the envoy hand you over to Khan's tent,

39
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:22,419
we'll be able to prove our innocence.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,218
Fine. You can tie me up

41
00:02:26,218 --> 00:02:28,760
along with your mother and your daughter.

42
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,658
Father.

43
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:33,879
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to kill him.

44
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:35,380
Stop there!

45
00:02:36,299 --> 00:02:39,559
What? You want to stop me?

46
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,839
This is Mobei.

47
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:46,540
You, King of Monan, are in no place to give orders here.

48
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,640
<i>Yes.</i>

49
00:02:57,859 --> 00:02:59,559
Get out of the way!

50
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,218
King, we've brought back his body.

51
00:03:16,219 --> 00:03:18,638
Get rid of it. I don't want to see him ever again.

52
00:03:18,638 --> 00:03:20,120
Yes.

53
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,039
You've killed the messenger. You can't hush a thing like this up.

54
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,758
That's all because of you.

55
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,459
Me?

56
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:30,398
You think they wouldn't recruit your people if I were not here?

57
00:03:30,399 --> 00:03:35,259
That they wouldn't take Zhenzhu and your mother as hostages?

58
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,119
That Khan's tent, will it show you mercy?

59
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,520
It's not just you.

60
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,759
Eagle Division has always been loyal to Khan's tent, risking their lives.

61
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,598
And look where we ended up.

62
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,878
Enough.

63
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:49,138
We're dying anyway.

64
00:03:49,138 --> 00:03:51,019
Tujia, let's go home.

65
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:53,538
- Father! Father!
- But it's not necessarily a dead end.

66
00:03:53,538 --> 00:03:56,639
Didn't I just say that we could form an alliance?

67
00:03:57,739 --> 00:03:59,118
That's easy for you to say.

68
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:01,639
You haven't even tried. Why are you so certain that we'll fail?

69
00:04:03,119 --> 00:04:05,318
Please let my people go.

70
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:07,978
As long as Eagle Division has the gromwell and are safe,

71
00:04:07,978 --> 00:04:12,319
I'll persuade Ashile Sun to form an alliance between you and the Eagle Division.

72
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,239
What if you're just lying to us?

73
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,278
Then I'll stay here and tell you how to defend against Khan's tent.

74
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:23,759
King, please let my people leave with the gromwell.

75
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,359
Changge offered to be held hostage.

76
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,399
She can't come out. So I'm here to see you off instead.

77
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,478
The gromwell you want has been loaded.

78
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,478
She wants you to lead the convoy and carry gromwell back to Eagle Division.

79
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:40,019
Me?

80
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,239
I can't.

81
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,598
Why can't you?

82
00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:45,758
She thinks you can.

83
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,600
Don't you believe in yourself?

84
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,800
Elder Qin will help you.

85
00:04:50,339 --> 00:04:53,799
But Changge offered to be held hostage here.

86
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,478
It worries me.

87
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:57,739
She only did so to assure the King of Mobei.

88
00:04:57,739 --> 00:05:00,278
Khan's tent has issued the order of forced conscription in Monan and Mobei.

89
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,038
They also want to take us as hostages.

90
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,979
They've pushed us too far.

91
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:06,318
Father and the King of Mobei intend to lead a rebellion.

92
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,999
The top priority now is to persuade Eagle Division into forming an alliance against Khan's tent.

93
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:12,199
That's the only way to keep Changge safe.

94
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,520
So you must take the message back immediately.

95
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,639
Miss Mi, since Young Master has a plan,

96
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,999
we need to go back as soon as possible.

97
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:24,399
Let's set off now.

98
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,220
Child, goodbye then.

99
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,480
Let's go.

100
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:45,259
Don't worry. I'm always as good as my word.

101
00:05:45,259 --> 00:05:47,380
They'll leave here unchallenged.

102
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,740
Now you can tell us how to defend against the Ashile Tribe.

103
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,519
No more tolerance nor infighting.

104
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,739
Monan and Mobei are the biggest tribes in the whole area.

105
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:01,399
As long as you unite, you won't have to fear the Ashile Tribe anymore.

106
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,380
You want me to work with him?

107
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,200
Not a chance.

108
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,119
This is not a time for rash actions.

109
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,438
If you have zero intention of forming an alliance,

110
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,379
you wouldn't have dashed out to get that messenger.

111
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,399
What if Mobei is willing to give back your ancestral homeland?

112
00:06:23,459 --> 00:06:24,740
I didn't say that.

113
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,579
It's not too late for you to say so.

114
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:30,259
Only if you dismiss the old grievance will you fight side by side in the future.

115
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:37,650
Have you ever thought about the consequences of failure?

116
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,429
The game is never really set.

117
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,489
I regret it now.

118
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:47,370
At least Monan would survive if we just gave in.

119
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:52,610
Zhenzhu once told me that her father is the bravest man in the world.

120
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:57,658
My father is the invincible, undefeatable God of War.

121
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:59,259
He would never fear the Ashile Tribe.

122
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,980
He'll lead the bravest warriors in Monan and conquer Khan's tent.

123
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,980
Am I right, Father?

124
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,599
If you say so.

125
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,679
With all that going on, when you can't even protect your own families,

126
00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:19,879
are you really going to keep giving in?

127
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:22,359
Tolerance is no way to avoid conflicts.

128
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,019
The war is threatening.

129
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:26,700
Are you really going to turn a blind eye to it?

130
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,459
I'll return your ancestral homeland to you.

131
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:52,979
Monan has an army of 20,000.

132
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,178
How about you?

133
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:55,299
Less than 30,000.

134
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,800
More than that.

135
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,680
We need to gain more allies.

136
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,299
If the whole desert area unite,

137
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,620
we'll have an army of more than 50,000.

138
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:19,778
Princess.

139
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:20,819
What happened?

140
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,099
Mobei and Monan rose up against us.

141
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,680
Adong was killed.

142
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,198
The ones we sent to keep an eye on Li Changge sent the message back

143
00:08:27,198 --> 00:08:28,919
that the Eagle Division has gotten some gromwell.

144
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,898
Mobei sent a special convoy for it.

145
00:08:30,899 --> 00:08:33,018
They're heading back to Eagle Division now.

146
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:35,760
Li Changge persuaded Mobei to unite with Monan.

147
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,778
How surprising.

148
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:40,179
I guess Eagle Division will also rebel against us.

149
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,040
I should've killed her at that time.

150
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,460
Oh, when will She'er and Tu Kashe be back?

151
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,100
I followed your order.

152
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,438
I sent a secret order in Great Khan's name

153
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:54,179
to Bear Division and Wolf Division, and deployed them along the border.

154
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,080
They should've been back by now.

155
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,100
Summon Bear Division to Khan's tent now.

156
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,979
As for She'er, he doesn't have to know about it now.

157
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,580
Yes.

158
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:08,379
Well, that Mimi Guli might come in handy now.

159
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,259
Where are you going at this hour, Princess?

160
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:14,700
I'm still a little worried.

161
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,519
Before She'er and Tu Kashe come back,

162
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,179
I want to make sure that Yanli can't talk.

163
00:09:32,239 --> 00:09:33,939
Water.

164
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:35,980
Help.

165
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,940
Water.

166
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,660
Why are you here?

167
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,740
Where's Jinse?

168
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,939
I haven't seen her for ages.

169
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:03,240
I'm afraid you can't see her ever again.

170
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,040
What happened to her?

171
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,000
She's dead.

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,800
You killed her.

173
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:14,380
I'll be the only one who's there for you.

174
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,960
What are you trying to do?

175
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:23,300
You once said that

176
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,520
you'd get justice for me and the Sui family.

177
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,120
Does that still count?

178
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,898
Because of your promise, I took the risk

179
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:41,639
and removed the hidden peril for you.

180
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:46,380
Or... how did you think

181
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,080
you came into power?

182
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,619
That... That's all because you took the liberty.

183
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,719
It was you who killed my brother.

184
00:10:56,719 --> 00:11:01,319
It had nothing to do with me.

185
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:05,980
No one really cares about the truth.

186
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,550
What matters is that is you, Ashile Chuobi,

187
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:14,508
who is on the throne now.

188
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:16,270
You're trying to...

189
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,089
Now that you're seriously ill,

190
00:11:20,089 --> 00:11:23,150
I'll do what you ought to do

191
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,728
on your behalf.

192
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:28,910
You want to kill me.

193
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,929
Like what you did to my brother.

194
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,810
Ashile Tribe won't...

195
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:40,060
won't let you get away.

196
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,850
That's none of your concern.

197
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:48,349
Don't worry. I know what to do with Eagle Division and Bear Division.

198
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:50,750
What... What about Wolf Division?

199
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:56,270
You want to support She'er?

200
00:11:56,270 --> 00:12:00,729
He... He's young and inexperienced.

201
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:05,429
Ashile Tribe won't obey him.

202
00:12:05,429 --> 00:12:07,869
And that's why...

203
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:10,129
I won't kill you now.

204
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:14,090
I'm going to keep you alive so that you'll call the shots for me.

205
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:18,930
I... I will tell She'er.

206
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:22,710
I'll let him know that his mother

207
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:26,910
is such a monster.

208
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,230
I suggest that you stop struggling.

209
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,169
The more you intake,

210
00:12:34,169 --> 00:12:37,969
the more severe your poisoning will get.

211
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:58,810
It must be so hard for you

212
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,090
to be controlled by others

213
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:04,170
and be deprived of your freedom.

214
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:11,930
Help...

215
00:13:12,869 --> 00:13:16,909
Don't say things that you shouldn't have.

216
00:13:18,109 --> 00:13:19,910
From now on,

217
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,630
I'll be your mouth.

218
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:41,949
What do we do now?

219
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,808
I can't force the medicine down his throat.

220
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:46,269
If we can't bring down his fever,

221
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:49,469
I'm afraid he won't be able to survive tonight.

222
00:13:49,469 --> 00:13:53,790
And even if we save him from death, he might lose his mind.

223
00:13:59,509 --> 00:14:01,489
So he still has a chance of surviving

224
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:03,868
as long as we can bring down his fever tonight, right?

225
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:05,669
What are you going to do?

226
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,950
Mu Jin! Mu Jin!

227
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:23,709
Mu Jin.

228
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,889
Finally, you're awake.

229
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:29,429
Where am I?

230
00:14:29,429 --> 00:14:31,610
I feel so cold. So cold.

231
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:35,148
Mu Jin, we can't bring down your fever. So I must cool you down now.

232
00:14:35,148 --> 00:14:37,529
Just hang on. Changge will be here soon.

233
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:38,909
Along with Mimi.

234
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,950
Mimi will lead the convoy back here with the gromwell.

235
00:14:42,869 --> 00:14:47,190
Mimi... I like her so much.

236
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:52,689
Sun, promise me that you'll take care of her.

237
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:56,088
What are you talking about?

238
00:14:56,088 --> 00:14:57,888
Stay alive. Take care of her yourself.

239
00:14:57,888 --> 00:15:00,968
You hear me? You hear me?

240
00:15:02,849 --> 00:15:07,088
Do you remember that once, when we were kids, we went hunting

241
00:15:07,088 --> 00:15:09,150
and got caught in a snowstorm?

242
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,369
We were so cold and thirsty.

243
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,509
We almost died in that snowy cave.

244
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:16,830
It was you who told me to hang in there.

245
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:19,750
You said someone would come to rescue us.

246
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,748
In the end, someone did come.

247
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:23,549
Yes.

248
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:25,168
I didn't lie to you at that time.

249
00:15:25,168 --> 00:15:28,429
And I won't this time, okay?

250
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,068
I'm sure you can survive this.

251
00:15:30,068 --> 00:15:32,610
Listen to me, just hang in there.

252
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,429
Don't fall asleep.

253
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,850
I lost my mother and father when I was little.

254
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,809
I was brought up in the slave camp.

255
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:44,390
If you hadn't saved me,

256
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,328
I'm afraid I might've been dead a long time ago.

257
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:48,909
Why are you saying these things?

258
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:51,349
If it wasn't for you, I would've died 1,000 times.

259
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:56,489
Mu Jin, come on... Wake up, don't fall asleep.

260
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:58,129
Mu Jin! Wake up!

261
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:00,169
Mu Jin! Mu Jin!

262
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:02,050
Don't you fall asleep, Mu Jin!

263
00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:07,309
I know perfectly well

264
00:16:07,309 --> 00:16:12,109
that I can't survive this time.

265
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,589
Mu Jin! Mu Jin!

266
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,229
Mu Jin! Come on!

267
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,929
Mu Jin! Mu Jin!

268
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:22,869
Don't sleep, Mu Jin!

269
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:41,289
If we continue on our journey,

270
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:43,269
our horses will die of tiredness.

271
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:46,769
Let's take a rest here for two hours

272
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,988
and grab a bite.

273
00:16:51,989 --> 00:16:55,188
Well, I'll go gather some wood and make a fire.

274
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:56,589
Okay.

275
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:26,190
<i>Destroy the gromwell and Buzhen can live.</i>

276
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,148
<i>Hand me the water.</i>

277
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,910
<i>Here, take it.</i>

278
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:10,810
On guard.

279
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:14,949
Wolves.

280
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:24,469
Xu Feng. Shiba. You two protect Miss Mi and the gromwell.

281
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,368
You guys leave first.

282
00:18:25,368 --> 00:18:26,308
- Yes.
- Yes.

283
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:27,989
The rest of us, cover from them with me.

284
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:30,049
- Elder Qin, watch out!
- Yes!

285
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,010
Come on.

286
00:18:58,389 --> 00:18:59,989
Shiba!

287
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:11,669
- Here you go.
- I... I...

288
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:13,249
Young Master believes in you. So do I.

289
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:14,509
- But I can't...
- You can!

290
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,629
I'll hold the pursuers with Shiba.

291
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,189
Mu Jin is waiting for you. Go now!

292
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,210
Are you okay?

293
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:52,550
Let's go.

294
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,590
<i>Destroy the gromwell and Buzhen can live.</i>

295
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:35,860
<i>I promise I'll take the gromwell back.</i>

296
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,580
<i>Mimi, I like you.</i>

297
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,340
No.

298
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,139
I can't lose Mu Jin.

299
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,540
No!

300
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,760
You're awake.

301
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,498
Don't move. You lost a lot of blood.

302
00:21:34,498 --> 00:21:35,698
Help me up.

303
00:21:35,699 --> 00:21:37,999
Slowly. Watch out.

304
00:21:41,299 --> 00:21:43,879
I had a hard job getting you all wrapped up.

305
00:21:43,879 --> 00:21:46,259
Don't rip it open.

306
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,218
I didn't mean to touch you.

307
00:21:50,219 --> 00:21:53,060
But I couldn't leave you by the road and watch it.

308
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,519
I know you wouldn't want to, but just think of me as a cushion and lean on me for a while.

309
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,598
Elder Qin is on his way to chase after Mimi.

310
00:22:01,598 --> 00:22:03,539
They should be arriving at Eagle Division now.

311
00:22:04,299 --> 00:22:06,439
I made a straw mattress for you.

312
00:22:08,219 --> 00:22:10,759
It'll be more comfortable when you're riding your horse later.

313
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:14,360
Then we should set out now.

314
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,540
Let me put it on first.

315
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,379
Did you hurt your legs?

316
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,680
No.

317
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,619
They're just numb.

318
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,479
Sun,

319
00:23:22,219 --> 00:23:25,339
Taoist Sun has done all he can.

320
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:27,060
Don't make things difficult for him.

321
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,660
Shut up.

322
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,680
Don't start with that negative talk.

323
00:23:35,299 --> 00:23:37,160
Sun,

324
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:39,959
help me up.

325
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:42,780
I want to see the sunrise one more time.

326
00:23:54,340 --> 00:24:01,139
Sun, there's something I want to tell you.

327
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,979
I'm afraid I won't have the chance to say it later.

328
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:09,799
You're my only friend in my whole life.

329
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,999
Don't sacrifice yourself for nothing.

330
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:17,779
For all these years,

331
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:21,519
you've been repaying Great Khan's kindness.

332
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:24,139
But it's all over now.

333
00:24:24,699 --> 00:24:28,140
I'm sorry that I've failed you, Brother.

334
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:32,220
But from now on,

335
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,620
you're all they got for Eagle Division.

336
00:24:43,959 --> 00:24:46,339
There is just one more thing.

337
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,120
I want you to...

338
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,080
take care of Mimi Guli.

339
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:57,280
She really suffered a lot.

340
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,399
If you die, I won't take care of her.

341
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,620
You will.

342
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:09,520
You're just being stubborn.

343
00:25:10,219 --> 00:25:12,719
You're firm in your speech and soft in your heart.

344
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,300

Look at him.

349
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:16,819
Do you think he still has consciousness?

350
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,159
But you said the gromwell would save him.

351

By the way, Khan,

00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,680
I've got good news for you.

394
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:32,059
We'll move our capital.

395
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,139
I've given the order on your behalf.

<i>Lei Meng begs an audience with Great Khan.</i>

397
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,519
Come on in.

398
00:29:56,119 --> 00:29:57,619
Khatun.

399
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,300
Don't mind him.

400
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,000
Just say it.

401
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,600
I'm sorry.

402
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,880
They brought back the gromwell.

403
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,760
Then I guess we can't count on Mimi Guli.

404
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,560
Then shall we kill Buzhen?

405
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,500
The best timing to kill someone

406
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,120
is something you need to think about.

407
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,380
Khan, don't worry.

408
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:36,500
I won't kill you now.

409
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:41,819
To deal with Eagle Division, we can't just wager on Mimi Guli alone.

410
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:44,359
I will think of something else.

411
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:47,179
Have you decided on the troop to send to Mobei?

412
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,700
Bear Division has just arrived here.

413
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,400
Tu Kashe is waiting outside Khan's tent right now.

414
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,719
Khan, would you like to meet Tu Kashe?

415
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,420
Khan and Khatun, this is Tu Kashe.

416
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:22,119
General Tu Kashe, you can stand up.

417
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,720
Thank you, Khatun.

418
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,560
This is the edict written by Great Khan himself.

419
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,219
I'm just a woman. I'm in no place to read that.

420
00:31:34,219 --> 00:31:36,280
Take a look yourself.

421
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,520
Yes, Khatun.

422
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:52,159
Khan,

423
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,560
I've always been waiting for a historic victory.

424
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,458
This time, I'll put down the rebellion in Mobei.

425
00:31:56,459 --> 00:31:58,979
I won't let you down, Khan.

426
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:04,040
Khan, you can count on me.

427
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:08,690
General Tu Kashe will go all out to fulfill this task.

428
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,899
General Tu Kashe,

429
00:32:13,899 --> 00:32:16,720
it's time for Khan to take his medicine.

430
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,039
Then if you'll excuse me...

431
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,960
Khan, take care.

432
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,560
You want to seek help?

433
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,019
General Tu Kashe can't wait to fight the war

434
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:49,799
so that he can take credit for Bear Division.

435
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:52,099
He's in no mood

436
00:32:52,099 --> 00:32:54,840
to read your facial expressions.

437
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:59,919
He's not Ashile Sun.

438
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,000
You miss your son?

439
00:33:06,219 --> 00:33:08,220
What a pity.

440
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,700
You might not be able to see him again.

441
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:27,800
Elder Qin, where's Changge?

442
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,339
And why are Xu Feng and Shiba not here, either?

443
00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:31,259
We were under attack on our way here.

444
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,619
Shiba was wounded.

445
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:35,380
She and Xu Feng will be arriving here soon.

446
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,139
As for Young Master...

447
00:33:37,139 --> 00:33:38,760
What happened to her?

448
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,080
Young Master offered to be held as a hostage

449
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,700
so that we could bring the gromwell back successfully.

450
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,339
She stayed in Mobei.

451
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:48,000
Why?

452
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,418
Khan's tent delivered conscription notices in Mobei and Monan.

453
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:56,300
They also wanted to hold the two kings' mother and daughter in custody.

454
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,400
Instead of giving in to oppression, it's better to form an alliance.

455
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,920
Young Master promised King of Mobei

456
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,400
that she would persuade you into forming this joint force.

457
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,920
She offered to be held hostage.

458
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,000
That was why the King of Mobei let us go.

459
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,960
I see.

460
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,520
Well...

461
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:18,139
Well... I understand your concerns about fighting against Khan.

462
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:23,460
You can discuss it with Young Master when you see her.

463
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,780
Come on.

464
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,919
Does it still hurt? Your hand?

465
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:40,080
Does it taste good?

466
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,980
Of course.

467
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:48,339
I remember every word you said that day before you left.

468
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,460
Forget about it.

469
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:54,098
No way.

470
00:34:54,098 --> 00:34:57,919
A promise is a promise.

471
00:34:57,919 --> 00:35:00,260
You can't take it back.

472
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,560
Sun.

473
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,080
I'll go to decoct the herb soup for you.

474
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,560
All right.

475
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,399
<i>You can come in now.</i>

476
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,879
I suppose you were in haste when you put the bandage on.

477
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:44,280
It did stop the bleeding.

478
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,978
But still, it was roughly done.

479
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:48,219
I must've hurt you a bit when I changed your dressing, right?

480
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:50,120
No. Thank you.

481
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,459
You're welcome.

482
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,498
If you need any help, feel free to tell me.

483
00:35:54,499 --> 00:35:57,919
No need to be courteous. We, Eagle Division, owe a lot to you.

484
00:35:57,919 --> 00:35:58,800
Thank you, Auntie.

485
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,499
Have some rest. I have some errands to run.

486
00:36:01,499 --> 00:36:03,260
All right.

487
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,820
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

488
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,920
Does it still hurt?

489
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:22,399
It's much better now.

490
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,080
Then... that's good.

491
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:30,919
Come here.

492
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:32,779
Come on.

493
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:35,319
Sit.

494
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,320
Why don't you wrap it up?

495
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,940
I haven't had time to do so.

496
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,859
Let me help you.

497
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,639
Does it hurt?

498
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:52,120
No.

499
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,600
I'll be gentle.

500
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:42,039
All done.

501
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,800
I've applied medicine for you.

502
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,800
But... you haven't even had my wound dressed.

503
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,500
Well... Just-Just do it yourself.

504
00:38:06,459 --> 00:38:08,599
We've just caught our breath for a while.

505
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:10,778
And now they want us to march against the desert tribes.

506
00:38:10,778 --> 00:38:12,400
What do you think?

507
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,600
Changge is in Mobei now.

508
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:18,479
If I don't go there, someone else will.

509
00:38:18,479 --> 00:38:21,759
"Bear Division will fight with us," they say.

510
00:38:21,759 --> 00:38:25,919
The way I see it, they were only sending Bear Division to spy on you.

511
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:30,479
I guess we have to play it by ear now.

512
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:34,559
Mu Jin, you've just recovered from the plague.

513
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:36,220
You'd better not go to Mobei.

514
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,859
Come on, brotherhood means a lot to me.

515
00:38:38,859 --> 00:38:42,960
I'll always be by your side, my friend.

516
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,960
Come to think of it,

517
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,559
Changge's proposal is not entirely infeasible.

518
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:52,160
What advice?

519
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:56,920
Khan's tent is no longer what it used to be.

520
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,520
Yes, you should've thought of some way out.

521
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,419
Great Khan was indeed kind to you.

522
00:39:02,419 --> 00:39:04,860
But now you owe him nothing.

523
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:12,780
<i>Khatun.</i>

524
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:15,459
General Tu Kashe, you can stand up now.

525
00:39:15,459 --> 00:39:17,580
Thank you, Khatun.

526
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,578
Khatun, may I ask why you'd summon me here at this hour?

527
00:39:23,578 --> 00:39:27,520
Great Khan has a secret order for you.

528
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,618
Now, Great Khan is seriously ill.

529
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:31,860
You've seen that.

530
00:39:32,499 --> 00:39:36,599
Everything seems to be calm and smooth in Khan's tent today.

531
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:39,019
But actually, there is more at stake here.

532
00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:42,460
It's facing both inside turmoil and foreign invasion.

533
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,120
I know about the "foreign invasion."

534
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,719
But what do you mean by "inside turmoil"?

535
00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:51,860
I'm just a woman.

536
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:55,239
I know nothing about military affairs inside Khan's tent.

537
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:58,679
But I once heard Great Khan say that

538
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:02,339
among Bear, Eagle, and Wolf Division,

539
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:05,320
Eagle Division is the strongest one.

540
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:09,960
Too bad they swear loyalty to Ashile Sun,

541
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,139
not Khan Yanli.

542
00:40:12,139 --> 00:40:13,540
Indeed.

543
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:17,740
If it wasn't for me, Ashile Sun would have rebelled a long time ago.

544
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,760
Now Great Khan is seriously ill.

545
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,079
No one is in charge of Khan's tent.

546
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,179
I'm worried that if Eagle Division rises in rebellion...

547
00:40:27,179 --> 00:40:28,680
Khatun, don't worry.

548
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,538
If so, I will definitely confront him till the end.

549
00:40:31,538 --> 00:40:32,519
No, no, that won't work.

550
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:37,819
General, if you confront him, you'll suffer heavy casualties.

551
00:40:37,819 --> 00:40:40,060
So you're saying...

552
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,700
Khan sent me to give his order that,

553
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,840
this time, when you quell the disturbances in Mobei,

554
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,700
you can simply rely on Eagle Division and just reap the benefits.

555
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:56,819
Got it.

556
00:40:57,779 --> 00:41:01,799
Then... I'm leaving now.

557
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,399
I understand now.

558
00:41:24,479 --> 00:41:26,839
Princess, you're trying to have Tu Kashe kill Ashile Sun.

559
00:41:26,839 --> 00:41:28,619
That is a great trick, indeed.

560
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:32,058
Ashile Sun has always been the mortal enemy to Tu Kashe.

561
00:41:32,058 --> 00:41:35,119
All I'm doing is to make use of that.

562
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,599
It's just...

563
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:38,260
What's your most concern?

564
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,459
Tu Kashe is crude and rash.

565
00:41:40,459 --> 00:41:42,678
I'm afraid he'll ruin our plan eventually.

566
00:41:42,678 --> 00:41:44,519
Send some assassins to keep an eye on him.

567
00:41:44,519 --> 00:41:49,138
If he fails, I want you to order those assassins to get rid of Ashile Sun.

568
00:41:49,138 --> 00:41:51,479
Make sure he's dead.

569
00:41:51,479 --> 00:41:53,719
I'll get on with it now.

570
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,820
<i>[Shesheti Tribe Chumuwei Tribe Huluwu Tribe]</i>

571
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:09,579
What are these?

572
00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:12,578
These places circled in red ink are the ones that are willing to

573
00:42:12,579 --> 00:42:14,878
make friends with your father and the King of Mobei.

574
00:42:14,878 --> 00:42:17,138
Now those tribes have sent out their troops on the way here.

575
00:42:17,138 --> 00:42:18,639
They'll arrive in Mobei in two days.

576
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:21,398
There may be about 30,000 soldiers.

577
00:42:21,398 --> 00:42:23,320
Plus the soldiers we have.

578
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,879
That'll amount to over 80,000.

579
00:42:25,879 --> 00:42:29,299
That's a lot. So we'll win for sure.

580
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:31,139
Not necessarily.

581
00:42:31,139 --> 00:42:32,560
Why?

582
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:36,119
We've got so many people. Why can't we defeat them?

583
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:38,778
If there're only two tribes involved, it'll be easier to deploy.

584
00:42:38,778 --> 00:42:41,139
But this time, so many tribes are involved.

585
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:43,979
This is a newly raised regiment without much adjustment.

586
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:46,259
We can't be sure about its fighting capacity.

587
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:48,718
When you're on the battlefield, the outcome of the war

588
00:42:48,718 --> 00:42:51,378
is based more on the tactic used and its morale.

589
00:42:51,378 --> 00:42:55,220
If it's founded on quicksand, the size won't make any difference.

590
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,338
If you can't do the job, just let me be the leader.

591
00:42:58,338 --> 00:43:00,979
I don't mind leading the whole regiment alone.

592
00:43:00,979 --> 00:43:02,419
No way.

593
00:43:02,419 --> 00:43:04,158
You want to command the whole army?

594
00:43:04,158 --> 00:43:06,499
Do you want to take this opportunity and plot against Monan?

595
00:43:06,499 --> 00:43:08,319
We're in the midst of a war.

596
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,678
Stop fighting.

597
00:43:09,678 --> 00:43:12,439
He started it.

598
00:43:14,299 --> 00:43:16,320
Report!

599
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:20,839
King, Ashile Tribe... Ashile Tribe is mounting an attack.

600
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:25,319
Which one?

601
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:28,080
The troops leading the charge hung out the flags of the Eagle and Bear Division.

602
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,080
Eagle Division?

603
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,920
Eagle Division is here.

604
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,140
That would make things much easier now.
