00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,949
♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,909
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,780
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,819
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,600
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,769
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

7
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,639
♫   Tears and regrets go hand in hand   ♫

8
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:34,639
♫   But my heart is still fiery-hot   ♫

9
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:37,689
♫  To the distance  ♫

10
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:40,659
♫  The miserable past is like a dagger  ♫

11
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:43,569
♫  Though my wings are broken  ♫

12
00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:50,390
♫  I will keep flying  ♫

13

♫  Following the direction of the light  ♫

14
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:58,409
♫  I'll forget you  ♫

15
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:04,209
♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

16
00:01:04,209 --> 00:01:07,309
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,259
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,319
♫  The river of life is under my feet  ♫

19
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:17,610
♫  I don't regret my craziness  ♫

20
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:25,120


21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:32,429
   

22
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,230
   

23
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,050
From now on,

24
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:41,830
you're just a slave of Eagle Division.

25
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:46,949
What do you want to do to me?

26
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,259
I want you to disappear from Great Tang.

27
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:55,859
Only I can decide my life or death.

28
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,839
What you say is useless.

29
00:01:58,739 --> 00:02:00,698
It depends on your ability.

30
00:02:00,699 --> 00:02:02,658
You're keeping me beside you...

31
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:05,738
is no different from keeping a snake at your bosom.

32
00:02:05,739 --> 00:02:08,859
Think about it after you can survive.

33
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:12,138
The only law of survival here is that

34
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:14,679
the big fish eat up the small ones.

35
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:54,610
 Behind me is Shuo State, 

36
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,610
 which has been plundered but undamaged. 

37
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:05,199
 Behind it are the mountains. 

38
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:11,240
 Thousands of miles away is my hometown, 

39
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:16,759
 Chang'an. I can't return anymore. 

40
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,059
 You used to win honor for our country, 

41
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,479
 but now you're reduced to being a slave. 

42
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:31,198
 Li Changge, 

43
00:03:31,198 --> 00:03:34,119
 even I feel sorry for you. 

44
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,619
   

45
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,938
Upon receiving your order, I rushed over here.

46
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:43,539
What can I do for you?

47
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:45,699
Follow Ashile Tribe right now.

48
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,459
I want to know the end of Li Changge.

49
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,678
Kill her?

50
00:03:49,678 --> 00:03:52,120
If she colludes with the Ashile Tribe,

51
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,259
kill her.

52
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,038
What if not?

53
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:58,619
Then the Ashile Tribe won't allow her to survive.

54
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,920
Yes.

55
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:03,739
Send me information by carrier pigeon.

56
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,820
You can leave now.

57
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,020
Yes.

58
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,378
 My closest relatives were killed like dogs. 

59
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:21,739
 I'm exiled from the place where I grew up. 

60
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,240
 I consider life worse than death. 

61
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,500
 But I must finish what I should do. 

62
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,890
 It's not late for you to kill me after I finish it. 

63
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,760
   

64
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,399
 Li Changge, I hope you can sacrifice yourself for our country. 

65
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,378
In recent days, the county governments all over the country

66
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:50,479
are secretly looking for the whereabouts of the princess.

67
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,358
But the portraits sent to the capital have no semblance of Princess.

68
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:57,639
The four northern cities where she once appeared

69
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:02,880
haven't sent any information.

70
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,518
Your Highness.

71
00:05:04,518 --> 00:05:08,199
Princess Yong'an is always fortunate.

72
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,898
Li Chunfeng has predicted that she would return safe and sound.

73
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:15,159
I hope so.

74
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:23,179
Recently, I've always dreamed of Yueyan and Changge in their childhood.

75
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,299
 They're playing in the garden. 

76
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,299
I wave to them, but they can't see me.

77
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,139
 I call them, but they can't hear me. 

78
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,859
 And they run farther and farther. 

79
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,550
You've been thinking too much,

80
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,459
so you have these strange dreams.

81
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:57,118
Your Highness, I'll ask the imperial kitchen to stew some soothing and healthy soup.

82
00:05:57,118 --> 00:06:02,239
Will they be farther away from me?

83
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,439
No.

84
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:09,180
They are your most intimate daughter and minister, respectively.

85
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,399
Perhaps it's the best news that we have no news.

86
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:20,259
Yes.

87
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,999
Your Highness! Emergency!

88
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:27,358
The Ashile Tribe suddenly attacked our northern border.

89
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:29,178
Sima Tu, the military governor,

90
00:06:29,179 --> 00:06:32,839
and Gongsun Heng, the governor of Shuo State, have both died.

91
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,618
When did that happen?

92
00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:36,319
Why hasn't anyone reported this before?

93
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,378
The Ashile Tribe encircled the city.

94
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:40,838
So the frontier was never able to send out war reports.

95
00:06:40,838 --> 00:06:43,658
Hao Du sent a man to hurry up all the way.

96
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:48,260
It cost us five horses to send a letter to Chang'an.

97
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,419
Send troops right now to recover the northern border.

98
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,398
Do expel Ashile Tribe from our border!

99
00:06:53,398 --> 00:06:58,458
Then, the troops should be stationed there to comfort the local people.

100
00:06:58,458 --> 00:06:59,959
Yes.

101
00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:06,000
Brother Du.

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Brother Du, I have something to discuss with you.

103
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,999
Brother Fang, you're always full of thoughts.

104
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:17,658
What do you want to discuss?

105
00:07:17,659 --> 00:07:20,279
Brother Du, don't make me embarrassed.

106
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,898
We're both officials of the court.

107
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,419
We should discuss matters.

108
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,520
And I really need your help this time.

109
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,259
Just make it clear.

110
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:36,938
It's the biggest worry of His Highness that Princess Yong'an is gone.

111
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:41,178
We've sent the portraits of Princess to the governments all over the country to let them investigate in secret,

112
00:07:41,179 --> 00:07:42,458
but in vain.

113
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:46,460
Only the northern border hasn't sent any information yet.

114
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,359
I'm worried.

115
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:51,778
What can I do for you?

116
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:56,299
People on the northern border have never seen Princess.

117
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,259
It happens that your adopted son is also there.

118
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:04,719
Although Young Master Wei shoulders the whole responsibility of the missing princess,

119
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:09,419
Hao Du was also with Princess then.

120
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,739
So one more man means more help.

121
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,019
And under your wise instruction,

122
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,378
- your adopted son... 
 - Fine.

123
00:08:17,379 --> 00:08:21,040
Just tell me your business. Don't flatter me.

124
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,979
Since His Highness entrusts this matter to you,

125
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,200
it's fine that you arrange everything.

126
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:34,439
 Yes. 

127
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,698
 Eat more. 

128
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:38,099
 Come on. 

129
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,018
Why do you keep that guy?

130
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:44,440
You'd better kill him.

131
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,499
Here you are.

132
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,000
Put it there.

133
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,759
One more pie, please.

134
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:52,460
 Here you are. 

135
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:00,239
Where are you going?

136
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,540
I didn't expect to meet you here.

137
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,340
Here.

138
00:09:11,659 --> 00:09:14,658
In fact, Eagle Division is not far from Shuo State.

139
00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,159
It is near the river with trees.

140
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,300
You'll get used to living here.

141
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,159
Have some food.

142
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:24,879
Listen. If General Sun didn't care about you,

143
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:26,778
I won't care about your life.

144
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:28,579
Stubborn!

145
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:34,818
Your friend seems to be quite stubborn.

146
00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:37,818
I think you'll have no benefits from him.

147
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:41,698
He's too weak to survive in the grasslands.

148
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:43,018
No.

149
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,639
Why?

150
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,440
He has the strongest desire for survival.

151
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:53,419
Such a situation can't beat him down.

152
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,739
It seems that you know him very well.

153
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,740
But I think he just treats you as an enemy.

154
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,100
I don't care.

155
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,100
You've never treated me that kindly these years.

156
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,379
That guy has followed us all the way.

157
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,358
I know.

158
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:31,420
He comes to see Shisi.

159
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:34,619
Do me a favor.

160
00:10:38,699 --> 00:10:39,859
What do you want to do?

161
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,279
Let me go!

162
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,898
Listen. You're our slave.

163
00:10:43,898 --> 00:10:46,059
You must listen to us.

164
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,079
You refuse to work?

165
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,240
I think you ask for death!

166
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:53,018
Take him away!

167
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,059
Cut him off and feed him to the dogs!

168
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,560
Yes!

169
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,418
What do you want to do?

170
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,658
Let me go!

171
00:11:02,658 --> 00:11:03,859
Go!

172
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,460
Let me go!

173
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,600
Hurry up!

174
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:39,319
Elder Qin.

175
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,860
I feel sorry for Little Miss Yuan.

176
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,698
She's braved the wind and dew with us for a long time.

177
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:53,118
I don't think so.

178
00:11:53,118 --> 00:11:57,559
She has the best dad and mom in the world.

179
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:01,100
What's the situation of Shuo State?

180
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,258
I've got news.

181
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:05,258
The Ashile Tribe has left.

182
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:08,140
The court will send someone to take over the rest.

183
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:10,519
And...

184
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,818
And?

185
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:16,299
Do you want to tell me the news of Young Master?

186
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:19,099
Her assassination failed.

187
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,700
She was killed.

188
00:12:21,219 --> 00:12:22,419
Got it.

189
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,999
She was so stubborn.

190
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:28,379
It's easy for her to suffer losses.

191
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,120
If...

192
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,778
Don't be sad.

193
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,138
I think she's still alive.

194
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:39,018
Still alive?

195
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:43,179
Since the Ashile Sun has an agreement with the governor,

196
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,698
he won't kill her.

197
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:48,979
Perhaps he's taken her to the grasslands.

198
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,458
So we don't need to wait for her. We should find her!

199
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:54,338
The grasslands are full of their spies.

200
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:57,760
We can't do anything there.

201
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,358
Let's make an arrangement for Little Miss Yuan first.

202
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:05,778
Try to use the previous intelligence network to get information.

203
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:07,660
Then make decisions.

204
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,100
   

205
00:13:28,219 --> 00:13:32,718
 Li Changge, perhaps it's your best end. 

206
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:51,939
Why are you here?

207
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,999
It's a question that I should ask you.

208
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:58,379
It's strange that His Highness doesn't blame you for losing Princess.

209
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,519
I'll find Yueyan for sure.

210
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,660
I'll wait.

211
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:06,899
You haven't been back to Chang'an for a long time.

212
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:09,019
Are you looking for Changge?

213
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:12,338
What's wrong with her?

214
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:14,039
She died.

215
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:17,880
How did she die?

216
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,660
You killed her?

217
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:25,239
Tell me!

218
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:39,039
Wei Shuyu, are you going to take revenge for your loved girl,

219
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:41,158
regardless of the safety of your family?

220
00:14:41,158 --> 00:14:43,439
After I kill you,

221
00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:45,279
I'll commit suicide.

222
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,159
Do you think His Highness the Crown Prince will kill my family for you?

223
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,280
Why haven't you taken any action?

224
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,099
When Li Changge was alive, you could do nothing.

225
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,239
But you have the courage to revenge after her death.

226
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:03,759
I think you know that once Li Changge dies,

227
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:06,880
your family's glory won't be affected.

228
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,400
If you want to get revenge, you got the wrong person.

229
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,459
I didn't kill Li Changge.

230
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:22,458
She was killed by the Ashile Tribe.

231
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:23,979
The Ashile Tribe?

232
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,598
After the Ashile Tribe occupied Shuo State, Li Changge was captured. 
    

233
00:15:27,598 --> 00:15:30,139
Considering her stubbornness,

234
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:32,300
do you think she can survive?

235
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:39,379
 I never expected that you were the man that ran after me with him. 

236
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:43,979
 From now on, you and I have nothing to do with each other. 

237
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,580
 From now on, I'll lead my own life. 

238
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,479
The amulet given by Yueyan is of no use.

239
00:16:09,459 --> 00:16:11,359
In the end,

240
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,499
I failed to protect neither of them.

241
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,778
Come on.

242
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,658
Li Changge has died.

243
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:19,458
Don't let Princess be in trouble.

244
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:22,179
And I received a letter from Chang'an.

245
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,179
They asked me to stay in the north to look for Princess.

246
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,300
Obviously, they don't trust you.

247
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,698
I'll find Yueyan earlier than you.

248
00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:38,099
I don't care.

249
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,000
I disdain to compete with you.

250
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:43,559
But I can give you a hint.

251
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:47,099
Li Changge is a well-known commandant in Shuo State.

252
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,658
If Princess Yong'an is in Shuo State, there must be some traces.

253
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:53,990
So you shouldn't come to Shuo State.

254
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:58,030
   

255
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:19,438
What happened last night?

256
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,799
Why did you knock me out after putting the headgear on my head?

257
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:23,699
Why didn't you kill me?

258
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:26,659
Last night, a slave died for you.

259
00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:28,618
 Take him away! Cut off him and feed him to the dogs! 

260
00:17:28,618 --> 00:17:30,319
 Yes! 

261
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,238
-  Let me go! 
 - Go! 

262
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:35,959
 Let me go! 

263
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:38,719
 Go! 

264
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,219
 Hurry up! 

265
00:17:44,219 --> 00:17:45,919
 Don't resist! 

266
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,800
 Hurry up! 

267
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,618
What does Ashile Sun want to do?

268
00:18:05,618 --> 00:18:07,218
I don't understand it, either.

269
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:10,339
If I were him, I would have been impatient!

270
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,799
You've been challenging the bottom line of Eagle Division.

271
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:17,379
You'll never realize our power without any suffering.

272
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:20,059
How delicate you are!

273
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:22,340
I don't know why he brought you back.

274
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,900
   

275
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,720
Sir, this way.

276
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,298
Sir.

277
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:57,340
Are you the magistrate?

278
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,338
Where are you from?

279
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,238
You don't even know our magistrate!

280
00:19:01,238 --> 00:19:03,318
Magistrate, please do me a favor.

281
00:19:03,318 --> 00:19:04,298
How dare you!

282
00:19:04,299 --> 00:19:05,619
Don't you know the rules?

283
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,698
The magistrate is busy with official business.

284
00:19:07,699 --> 00:19:09,199
Go away!

285
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,440
Magistrate!

286
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,559
You're the local magistrate of Yun State.

287
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,698
If I didn't ask for something urgent,

288
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,158
I wouldn't have been so presumptuous.

289
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:19,979
Go away!

290
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,860
If you want to redress the injustice, beat the drum.

291
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:26,298
What do you want to say?

292
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,379
Listen.

293
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:32,418
It's inconvenient to tell you my identity.

294
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:36,398
But could you send a letter to Chang'an or Luoyang

295
00:19:36,398 --> 00:19:38,400
if it is convenient for you?

296
00:19:44,059 --> 00:19:46,458
What's your identity?

297
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:48,619
I'm Princess Yong'an.

298
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,379
I lost touch with my valet by accident.

299
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,139
After the city was occupied, I ran all the way and arrived here.

300
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,139
Magistrate.

301
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,698
If you can help me return to the capital,

302
00:19:55,699 --> 00:19:58,279
His Majesty will give you a big reward.

303
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,999
Do you have any keepsake?

304
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:01,600
Keepsake?

305
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,500
I kept no keepsake when lost.

306
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,659
But I'm really a princess.

307
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,099
My grandfather gave me the title in person.

308
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,538
Do you have any things made by the palace?

309
00:20:13,539 --> 00:20:16,419
I can recognize it immediately.

310
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,718
All the keepsakes were robbed.

311
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,859
Where did you get the news?

312
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,178
You're well-informed.

313
00:20:23,179 --> 00:20:27,099
The court gave us a secret order to find a princess in secret.

314
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,800
But I can't identify you based on what you say.

315
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,120
I know Father must have sent people to look for me.

316
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,679
Magistrate, I'm really a princess. Believe me.

317
00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:38,198
Really. Magistrate.

318
00:20:38,198 --> 00:20:40,518
I beg you. Send a letter to Luoyang!

319
00:20:40,518 --> 00:20:42,579
- You impersonate the princess. Flog her to death. 
 - I'm not cheating you!

320
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:44,338
- Come on! Catch her! 
 - Yes!

321
00:20:44,338 --> 00:20:46,938
Magistrate! Magistrate...

322
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:51,019
Why not trust me?

323
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,180
Don't be stunned! Catch her!

324
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,218
Come on.

325
00:20:55,219 --> 00:20:56,538
Let her go.

326
00:20:56,539 --> 00:20:59,279
What a poor girl!

327
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:01,139
Now the situation is very chaotic.

328
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,739
The new governor will arrive in days.

329
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:05,400
I have no time to deal with the refugee.

330
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,799
Be careful.

331
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,340
Father.

332
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,900
Why haven't you come for me?

333
00:21:44,959 --> 00:21:47,859
Have you abandoned me?

334
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:17,179
If you think you have endless strength, run a few laps outside.

335
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,899
I'm really confused.

336
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:23,279
How will you treat Shisi?

337
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:25,499
You made great efforts to rescue Shisi.

338
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,840
But now you don't care about him, leaving him bullied.

339
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,859
You're becoming more and more strange.

340
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,259
The more I care about him, the more in pain he will be.

341
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,020
Instead of letting him hate himself,

342
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,298
I'd better let him hate me.

343
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:44,099
You're really strange!

344
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,979
Are you bewitched by him?

345
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:48,019
Shall I ask a witch doctor to diagnose you?

346
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,899
I think you want to clean up horse dung.

347
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,920
Clean horse dung?

348
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,099
I'm the military counselor of Eagle Division.

349
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,619
Don't make me embarrassed.

350
00:22:58,219 --> 00:23:02,739
He has to get a foothold here on his own.

351
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,279
I can't see all of his actions.

352
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,019
He's just a clever man from Central Plains.

353
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,559
Is he worth your deeds?

354
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,560
I don't think he's grateful at all.

355
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,178
I don't need his gratitude.

356
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:18,520
I just hope he can survive.

357
00:23:21,219 --> 00:23:22,899
General. Counselor.

358
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:26,439
The slave you asked me to keep an eye on fainted.

359
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,539
You have been burned out of Shuo State

360
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:55,080
and have refused to eat and drink all the way.

361
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,159
Are you seeking death?

362
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:03,040
Do you think I'll do anything to you?

363
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:06,559
I'm not interested in women like you.

364
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:09,659
When did you...

365
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,460
I knew you were a girl when I saved you beside the river.

366
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,118
I found that you wanted to conceal it.

367
00:24:15,118 --> 00:24:16,999
I'm not interested in exposing you.

368
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,799
You've always been messing with me?

369
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,920
I don't care what you think.

370
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,299
General! Here's the medicine you wanted and...

371
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:41,078
The doctor said you became ill due to worries and are deficient in qi and blood.

372
00:24:41,078 --> 00:24:45,119
If you don't want to die, take the medicine.

373
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:53,079
Take it!

374
00:24:56,439 --> 00:24:58,279
Li Shisi!

375
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:01,518
I didn't expect that you were so sheepish! The people in Shuo State are safe and sound.

376
00:25:01,518 --> 00:25:05,158
I've met my commitment. Now it's your turn.

377
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,259
Don't forget that you're at my mercy.

378
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:11,559
Ridiculous.

379
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:14,159
You want a person from Central Plains to work for you?

380
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,900
You'd better kill me so that you won't regret it later.

381
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,559
I'll tell you the last time. Take the medicine.

382
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,058
Can you only solve problems in this way?

383
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:45,838
That's better than living in disgrace.

384
00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:49,639
Now that I'm at the mercy of you, why do you humiliate me?

385
00:25:49,639 --> 00:25:51,279
Humiliate you?

386
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:54,259
I just don't want you to die so easily.

387
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:58,038
Li Shisi, you'd better try to survive.

388
00:25:58,038 --> 00:26:03,519
Even if you want to kill me or get revenge for Gongsun Heng one day.

389
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:05,579
Revenge?

390
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:10,199
Yes. Revenge!

391
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:15,339
Have you forgotten the hatred of Gongsun Heng and the people and the army of Shuo State?

392
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:25,260
It's ridiculous that Gongsun Heng entrusted everything to you.

393
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:30,159
If I were you, I would try every means to get a firm foothold here

394
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,438
and win others' trust at any cost so as to find the chance to kill them.

395
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,039
If you want to live up to his expectation, struggle to survive.

396
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:50,639
 If I can entrust Shuo State people's lives to the princess of Great Tang, 

397
00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:53,290
 I will die without regret. 

398
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,020
   

399
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:03,078
 I can't let the families in the city down 

400
00:27:03,078 --> 00:27:07,960
 but I am doomed to fail my wife and daughter. 

401
00:27:10,059 --> 00:27:13,179
 A' Dou! 

402
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:27,499
Not only the hatred of Gongsun and Shuo State.

403
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,598
 Yes. 

404
00:27:29,598 --> 00:27:32,238
 I can't just die. 

405
00:27:32,238 --> 00:27:34,859
 I can't die here. 

406
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:37,259
It's easy to die.

407
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:39,860
It has always been the hardest to live on.

408
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:47,899
- Go. 
 - Don't go there.

409
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,818
We just came from there. Yan'er is not there.

410
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,760
Turn left. To Yun State.

411
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,799
It's the magistrate's office! You are not allowed to break in!

412
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:11,560
Magistrate.

413
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:23,438
I came to look for Princess under His Highness' order. We need your people for help.

414
00:29:23,438 --> 00:29:27,800
I am at your service.

415
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:32,259
Immediately arrange for people to go to all refugee settlements to find the woman in the picture.

416
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:33,839
Yes.

417
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,859
Well... Well...

418
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:46,558
Did you see her? Where's she?

419
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:51,700
She had no keepsake to prove her identity.

420
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,538
I mistook her as a refugee, so I drove her away.

421
00:29:55,538 --> 00:29:58,979
Find her at all costs!

422
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,480
Yes.

423
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,829
- Miss Chai, where are you going? 
 - Just hanging around.

424
00:30:03,829 --> 00:30:05,159
Bye.

425
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:08,219
Your embroidery is terrible. You should work harder to earn money.

426
00:30:08,219 --> 00:30:10,318
All right. Got it.

427
00:30:10,318 --> 00:30:14,218
Madam Xiang, how is your incense business?

428
00:30:14,218 --> 00:30:16,318
Good.

429
00:30:16,318 --> 00:30:17,979
You need to burn more incense.

430
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,859
 Fragrant and crisp sesame cake! 

431
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,919
- Open for business today? 
 - Yes.

432
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,418
Give me three.

433
00:30:23,419 --> 00:30:25,519
You have many workers. Three is not enough.

434
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:26,739
Nonsense.

435
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,818
It's already hard for them to have meals, let alone sesame cakes.

436
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:32,770
Hurry up. I'm hungry.

437
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,530
All right. Wait a minute.

438
00:30:34,538 --> 00:30:37,419
So many things here! Look at it!

439
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:44,518
It's not a charity. Beg for food elsewhere.

440
00:30:44,518 --> 00:30:46,660
I have money.

441
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,578
I want to buy cakes.

442
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:50,418
You frightened her.

443
00:30:50,419 --> 00:30:52,699
Three coppers each. Don't consider it expensive.

444
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:56,479
It's a time of chaos. Food is expensive everywhere.

445
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,240
Here you are.

446
00:30:59,719 --> 00:31:04,778
Miss, in broad daylight, will you do anything to...

447
00:31:04,778 --> 00:31:08,918
Miss, I'm married.

448
00:31:08,918 --> 00:31:12,098
Three coppers each. No other alternative.

449
00:31:12,098 --> 00:31:14,838
No. I was afraid of being robbed,

450
00:31:14,838 --> 00:31:18,000
so I put my purse in the innermost layer of my clothes.

451
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,700
Okay.

452
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,598
Obviously, you don't know how to embroider. What's this?

453
00:31:32,598 --> 00:31:35,380
An ugly purse!

454
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:40,620
I think it's the most beautiful purse in the world.

455
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,398
Okay. Wait a minute.

456
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:53,400
Here's your cake.

457
00:31:54,459 --> 00:31:56,778
- Thanks. 
 - Okay.

458
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:13,259
Sorry.

459
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,078
That's all right. I had dirtier food before.

460
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:23,160
If you don't mind, I can share a half.

461
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
I can share with you.

462
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,759
I mean no harm.

463
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:33,058
In recent years, kind people are bullied by bad ones.

464
00:32:33,058 --> 00:32:35,599
Miss, check your purse right now.

465
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:41,000
It's stupid that you want to share your cake with him!

466
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,519
Have a look!

467
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:48,099
My purse! My purse!

468
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,540
Stop!

469
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:53,159
Stop!

470
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,660
My purse!

471
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,440
Stop!

472
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,440
Stop!

473
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:16,319
Stop!

474
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:20,778
Return my purse. You can take away the money.

475
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:39,479
 Well. Here you are. 

476
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:40,879
 Here you are. 

477
00:33:44,219 --> 00:33:45,779
 So ugly! What's this? 

478
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:48,298
 To make it, I got my hands punctured. But you think it's ugly. 

479
00:33:48,298 --> 00:33:49,578
 Well, I won't give it to you. 

480
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:53,299
 Though it's ugly, I like it. 

481
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,739
Changge.

482
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:04,119
Where are you?

483
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:18,279
Have you seen the woman in the portrait?

484
00:34:18,279 --> 00:34:19,880
No.

485
00:34:20,819 --> 00:34:23,359
- Have you seen this woman? 
 - No.

486
00:34:24,259 --> 00:34:26,359
Have you seen the woman in the portrait?

487
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:27,960
No.

488
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,218
- Have you seen her? 
 - No.

489
00:34:31,218 --> 00:34:33,359
- Have you? 
 - No.

490
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,420
They want to catch me.

491
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:42,819
You! Stop!

492
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:43,819
Go!

493
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,178
Stop! Stop!

494
00:34:48,178 --> 00:34:49,778
Stop!

495
00:34:49,778 --> 00:34:51,579
Go!

496
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,478
You lost money. But why do you follow me?

497
00:35:29,478 --> 00:35:32,359
- They want to catch me. 
 - What crime have you committed?

498
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:35,778
Nothing. They said I'm impersonating the princess.

499
00:35:35,778 --> 00:35:38,158
You'd be better to impersonate someone else.

500
00:35:38,158 --> 00:35:41,319
Miss, are you a fool?

501
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:44,439
I'm not impersonating the princess. I'm really—

502
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,960
 Open the door! 

503
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,319
 Open the door! 

504
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,539
I'm coming! Will you compensate if the door is broken?

505
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:02,199
It's daytime. Why are you in a hurry?

506
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:05,079
Do you want to buy cloth?

507
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,238
We're arresting a girl. We saw her walking down the street.

508
00:36:08,238 --> 00:36:10,080
Have you seen her?

509
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,360
The girl in the portrait.

510
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,840
Yes.

511
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,058
The girl's purse was stolen in the street before.

512
00:36:24,058 --> 00:36:26,719
She ran south after the thief.

513
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:29,350
Sir, what crime has she committed?

514
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,320
I hope she's not an infamous robber.

515
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,350
It's been very restless here.

516
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,619
Search!

517
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,399
Sir! Sir!

518
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:04,678
- What's the matter? 
  - No idea. 

519
00:37:04,678 --> 00:37:06,619
 What is happening? 

520
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:27,098
- Not here. 
 - Not here.

521
00:37:27,098 --> 00:37:29,040
Not there.

522
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,439
Sir, I've told you that she's not here.

523
00:37:31,439 --> 00:37:33,799
My workshop should do business.

524
00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:37,699
You search everywhere, and the impact is bad.

525
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:41,639
Come on. Inform us if you see her next time.

526
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:43,700
Of course.

527
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,339
Go.

528
00:38:01,399 --> 00:38:04,478
You're so clever that you hid in the tank.

529
00:38:04,478 --> 00:38:07,759
Thank you, Miss.  I thought you didn't want to save me.

530
00:38:07,759 --> 00:38:11,578
Come on. I think you're innocent.

531
00:38:11,578 --> 00:38:13,519
The government really makes a fuss of it.

532
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:16,759
It's nothing serious to impersonate a princess.

533
00:38:16,759 --> 00:38:20,818
Miss, I don't impersonate the princess. I'm really the princess.

534
00:38:20,818 --> 00:38:24,018
Come on. I don't care whether you're a princess or a master.

535
00:38:24,018 --> 00:38:26,378
I'm busy now. You should leave now.

536
00:38:26,378 --> 00:38:31,038
Miss, if I go out now, I'll be killed.

537
00:38:31,038 --> 00:38:36,439
Please do me a favor. Allow me to stay here one more day. I beg you.

538
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:40,159
All right, all right. Go in and change your clothes.

539
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:42,759
Don't get ill and stay here for a long time.

540
00:38:43,439 --> 00:38:45,879
Thank you, Miss.

541
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,259
 It's the grasslands. 

542
00:39:00,399 --> 00:39:02,979
 So vast. 

543
00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:07,139
Miss Su Yili, do you have any cheese?

544
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:09,158
- Leave a bit more for me. 
 - Yes!

545
00:39:09,158 --> 00:39:12,759
Come to my tent later. You'll eat as much as you can.

546
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:15,158
General! Have you prepared gifts for us?

547
00:39:15,158 --> 00:39:18,038
Yes. Everyone can get a gift.

548
00:39:18,038 --> 00:39:19,819
Ya Luo.

549
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:24,759
General, the herbs are all dried. Here you are.

550
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,659
Take a look. What do you think?

551
00:39:27,659 --> 00:39:29,260
Good.

552
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,359
- General. 
 - Look.

553
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:33,679
Help yourselves.

554
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:36,459
- Gifts! 
 - I want this!

555
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:39,639
This one is good.

556
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:41,958
- Look! 
 - Let me see.

557
00:39:41,958 --> 00:39:43,438
 Second Uncle! Where's my award? 

558
00:39:43,438 --> 00:39:44,729
 - Where's my award? 
 - Where's my award? 

559
00:39:44,729 --> 00:39:47,838
 Stand still! Stand still! Stand still and close your eyes! 

560
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:50,019
 Close your eyes! 

561
00:39:54,259 --> 00:39:55,719
 Where's mine, Uncle? Where's mine? 

562
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:58,580
 I have only one little horse. 

563
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,099
 Try to reach it! 

564
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:03,678
 - Give me, Father! 
 - Give me! 

565
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,360
 Father! 

566
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:13,659
 Second Uncle! 

567
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,578
 Father, don't cheat me! 

568
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,298
 Father! 

569
00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:19,380
 Second Uncle! 

570
00:40:20,439 --> 00:40:24,458
 Give me, Second Uncle! You promised me! 

571
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,660
Let me help you.

572
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,999
Good.

573
00:40:33,999 --> 00:40:35,900
Interesting!

574
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,159
Since you're good at playing football, here you are.

575
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,359
Brother! Could you lend us your ball?

576
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,080
Here you are.

577
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,679
- Stop! 
 - Let's go.

578
00:40:56,679 --> 00:40:58,460
Wait!

579
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:00,818
Slow down!

580
00:41:00,819 --> 00:41:03,038
- Give me! 
 - No!

581
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,399
 I'll bring the gifts to them. Be careful. 

582
00:41:06,399 --> 00:41:08,639
 Help him carry the gifts. 

583
00:41:22,339 --> 00:41:24,839
The monthly salary this year is too low.

584
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:26,478
Miss Zhang, don't be too greedy.

585
00:41:26,478 --> 00:41:28,958
At least we have a job to keep from starving.

586
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:30,899
That's good.

587
00:41:30,899 --> 00:41:33,658
Yes, you're right. Are the looms more and more difficult to use?

588
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,500
Yes.

589
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,518
Miss Chai, you've finally hired a new weaver.

590
00:41:46,518 --> 00:41:49,719
I picked her in the street. She'll just stay here for a night.

591
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,539
Nice to meet you.

592
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:01,638
Stop looking around! Go on with your work!

593
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,539
What a pretty girl!

594
00:42:08,539 --> 00:42:10,319
What etiquette did she show?

595
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,738
I don't know. It looks good.

596
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,039
Yes.

597
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:15,538
Nice to meet you.

598
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:17,738
No. Like this.

599
00:42:17,738 --> 00:42:20,679
No. Just like her!

600
00:42:21,399 --> 00:42:23,498
Just share this room with the others.

601
00:42:23,498 --> 00:42:27,118
You have to leave tomorrow. I don't raise idlers.

602
00:42:27,118 --> 00:42:30,298
Thanks, Miss. I'll repay you one day.

603
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:32,700
Thank you in advance.

604
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:43,900
What should I do tomorrow?

605
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,240
   

606
00:42:51,919 --> 00:42:56,359
Magistrate, what did you say just now?

607
00:42:56,359 --> 00:42:58,778
I'm sorry.

608
00:42:58,779 --> 00:43:02,979
We found her but failed to bring her back.

609
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:07,159
You'd better say you failed to find her. What do you mean by that?

610
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:10,478
We saw a similar woman in the street.

611
00:43:10,478 --> 00:43:13,598
But... she ran away.

612
00:43:13,598 --> 00:43:16,299
What similar woman? Why did she just run away?

613
00:43:16,299 --> 00:43:18,919
Sir, I'll make further research.

614
00:43:18,919 --> 00:43:22,279
But Princess has feet.

615
00:43:22,279 --> 00:43:26,079
I'm not sure whether she's still in Yun State.

616
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,818
How dare you shirk responsibility!

617
00:43:27,819 --> 00:43:32,139
Well. We'll keep searching for her.

618
00:43:32,139 --> 00:43:34,438
- I'll search for her tomorrow! Get lost! 
 - I'll search for her tomorrow! Get lost!

619
00:43:34,438 --> 00:43:36,119
Okay.

620
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,478
 Yan'er, where are you? 

621
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:55,400


622
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:00,129
