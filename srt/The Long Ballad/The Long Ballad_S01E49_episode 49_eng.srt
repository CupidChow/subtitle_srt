00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,899
♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,859
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:14,930
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,769
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:25,150
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,819
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

7
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:31,689
♫   Tears and regrets go hand in hand   ♫

00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:34,789

♫  To the distance  ♫

10

♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,359
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,309
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,269
♫  The river of life is under my feet  ♫

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,010
♫  I don't regret my craziness  ♫

20
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:25,540


21
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:32,419
   

22
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:36,260
   

23
00:01:37,839 --> 00:01:42,918
Shuyu, along the way, sometimes I was reckless,

24
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:45,079
and, at other times, I've misunderstood you.

25
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,379
Thank you for your tolerance and help all this time.

26
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:51,440
I know you don't want me to be courteous,

27
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,199
but I really want to thank you.

28
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:00,660
If we part today, I don't know when we'll meet again.

29
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,179
Changge, take care.

30
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:04,860
Take care.

31
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,999
Take good care of Changge.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,578
I wish you happiness.

33
00:02:11,578 --> 00:02:15,800
Brother Wei, thank you.

34
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:34,638
Sun, do you think Mimi will like this place?

35
00:02:34,638 --> 00:02:36,980
What if she dislikes it?

36
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:41,119
When you dream of her, you may ask her.

37
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,540
It's wooded and wide here.

38
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,919
She'll like it for sure.

39
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,539
Changge, when breaking into the execution ground,

40
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:59,939
did you think you might not have returned?

41
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:07,320
Have you thought of your life when saving me in Chang'an?

42
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:19,119
In fact, I saw the letter you wrote to my mother about marrying me.

43
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,999
So...

44
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:34,079
what do you think?

45
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,829
I think...

46
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:44,089
I think...

47
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:47,029
we don't need too much red tape.

48
00:03:47,029 --> 00:03:49,989
It's enough to have you in my life.

49
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,850
I think the same.

50
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:03,549
It's enough to have you in my life.

51
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,459
By the way, how did you contact General Li?

52
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,659
After you were taken to Dingxiang, were you still in contact with him?

53
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,399
In fact, before leaving Chang'an,

54
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,449
I made an agreement with him.

55
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:29,369
 Brother Li, 

56
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:32,319
 no, General Li. 

57
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,060
 Brother Qin, we meet again. 

58
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,085
 I'm afraid we can't take each other as mere friends. 

59
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:43,185
 It doesn't matter. 

60
00:04:44,807 --> 00:04:50,610
 Brother Qin, do you remember what I said 

61
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,910
  when we parted in Luoyang? 

62
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,759
 The benevolent has no enemy. 

63
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,318
 That's it. 

64
00:04:58,318 --> 00:05:04,240
 But now Princess Yicheng takes Khan hostage to control all tribes, 

65
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,278
 manipulating the grasslands and desert, 

66
00:05:07,278 --> 00:05:09,258
 and caring nothing about the public,  

67
00:05:09,258 --> 00:05:13,400
 so the war expands and lasts, plunging the people into misery. 

68
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:17,729
 We're on different sides. 

69
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:20,609
 Customs of the grasslands and central plains differ as well, 

70
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:25,370
 but our people all fear war and long for peace. 

71
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,709
 I want to know whether 

72
00:05:27,709 --> 00:05:35,089
 you can forget about the differences and save people from suffering. 

73
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,370
 I have one condition. 

74
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,470
 Please speak. 

75
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,929
 I want your side to help me get Khan Yanli out. 

76
00:05:50,989 --> 00:05:53,909
 Okay, I promise you. 

77
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:58,436
 Though warlike Ashile Duobi broke up our alliance many times, 

78
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:01,090
 he still kept his promise after the battle on Wei River. 

79
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:03,049
 His death can be spared. 

80
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:04,989
 Thanks for your righteousness. 

81
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:08,049
 But now I'm in jail, 

82
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:12,128
 and am unable to live in either Dingxiang or the central plains. 

83
00:06:12,128 --> 00:06:16,228
 How can I help you? 

84
00:06:16,228 --> 00:06:19,149
 You have to return to Dingxiang and reclaim Eagle Division. 

85
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,828
 But it'll be too dangerous. 

86
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:26,509
 If you want to succeed unharmed, it's harder than flying to the moon. 

87
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,469
Ashile Sun, you hid things from me again.

88
00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:32,448
You're so unteachable.

89
00:06:32,448 --> 00:06:33,720
I dare not.

90
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,520
I dare not in the future.

91
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,600
Sun, do you like Chang'an?

92
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,360
Want to go back?

93
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,389
I'd better not.

94
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:52,449
It may be troublesome to have many acquaintances.

95
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:54,709
So where do you want to go?

96
00:06:55,689 --> 00:06:57,630
I haven't decided yet.

97
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:05,389
Sun, I'm sorry.

98
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:08,908
I promised you to live freely far from secular strife

99
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:13,509
and to enjoy sightseeing over the world.

100
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:17,199
But if I turn a blind eye to the current situation,

101
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,519
I can't be at ease.

102
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:25,200
My promise may be fulfilled a bit later.

103
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,298
Changge, I know the second thing I want you to do.

104
00:07:29,298 --> 00:07:31,139
Come on!  Why haven't you given it up?

105
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,019
You may as well forget it.

106
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:37,018
Last time as soon as you told me the first thing, you got shot with an arrow.

107
00:07:37,018 --> 00:07:39,999
I'm afraid it brings bad luck. Just forget it.

108
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:42,978
It's the first time I've seen a guy easily breaking a promise like you.

109
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:45,280
It's not the case.

110
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,919
Well, speak.

111
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:56,640
The second thing I want you to do is to never say sorry or thanks to me.

112
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,520
These words are not needed between the two of us.

113
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,139
That's it?

114
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:04,919
Isn't the second thing too easy?

115
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,579
Just do as I said.

116
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:10,999
Tell me the third thing all at once, so I'll fulfill my promise earlier.

117
00:08:10,999 --> 00:08:13,320
The third thing...

118
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:19,124
Leave it for later.

119
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,033
We still have a long way to go.

120
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,279
Hao Du, why are you here?

121
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,959
I'm under Princess's order.

122
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,840
Aren't you getting married soon?

123
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,358
We've been married.

124
00:08:41,359 --> 00:08:42,740
That's great.

125
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,558
Wait!  You shouldn't have come here.

126
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,899
I have to protect the people Yueyan cherishes.

127
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:49,238
All right, all right.

128
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:52,379
Consort Prince is a great help to us.

129
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:56,190
Report!

130
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,430
Go ahead.

131
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:01,319
According to scouts in the east, Dingxiang troops were found in Baidao.

132
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,979
It seems Yicheng wants to break through Baidao by way of Qikou.

133
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:08,079
Go ask Li Ji to intercept the enemy from the front,

134
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:09,578
and I from the back.

135
00:09:09,578 --> 00:09:11,079
Yes.

136
00:09:11,878 --> 00:09:15,219
General Li, you dispatched two troops of scouts,

137
00:09:15,219 --> 00:09:19,319
but one of them hasn't returned yet.

138
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,618
There's a possibility.

139
00:09:21,618 --> 00:09:23,478
What possibility?

140
00:09:23,478 --> 00:09:27,219
It doesn't mean there's no enemy in this direction.

141
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:30,518
Maybe scouts have been ambushed and can't return.

142
00:09:30,518 --> 00:09:33,178
I'll go have a look with Eagle Division,

143
00:09:33,178 --> 00:09:35,908
so the main forces can stay here.

144
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,668
I'll go with you.

145
00:09:37,668 --> 00:09:39,150
No, you can't.

146
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,829
It's just my guess.

147
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:46,369
I may return empty-handed or face danger.

148
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:49,788
You'd better stay with General Li as his adviser.

149
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:51,040
But...

150
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,920
Princess, I'm afraid I can't let you go with him.

151
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,150
We'll take the main force with us out, leaving no one in our camp.

152
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,910
There must be one dealing with important messages,

153
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,750
or our military plan may be delayed.

154
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:08,739
Consort Prince is skillful in battles.

155
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,099
Can you stay with Princess here just in case?

156
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:18,259
If any emergency, you two can join hands and play it by ear.

157
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,498
I won't let you down.

158
00:10:21,499 --> 00:10:23,800
I won't let you down.

159
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,130
Unexpectedly, the previously unruly and arrogant little princess

160
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,139
making trouble with horses,

161
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:33,680
now rises to the occasion to guard your country.

162
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,515
I have really appreciated your hard work all this time.

163
00:10:37,515 --> 00:10:39,139
I'm flattered.

164
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:43,840
I just want to do my bit for the world's peace.

165
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,518
Yicheng's so cunning. Please be very careful.

166
00:10:46,518 --> 00:10:50,099
Don't worry. She's at her wits' end.

167
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:55,918
This time, we must root her out for our country, the grasslands, and the desert.

168
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:06,620
Sun, I'll go with you.

169
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,271
Mu Jin, but you just...

170
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:11,140
I'm not only your brother but the military counselor of Eagle Division.

171
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,499
How can I be a coward and let you a commander-in-chief resist the enemy?

172
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,940
Okay.

173
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,339
We're followed by many soldiers.

174
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:09,668
Tuluk, take Young Khan away.

175
00:12:09,668 --> 00:12:11,789
- The rest is on me. 
 - Yes.

176
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,390
Wait!

177
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,799
On you?

178
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,290
You mean killing more people?

179
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:22,068
You can live without killing people because such things are all on us.

180
00:12:22,068 --> 00:12:25,229
I'll do evil so that you can be innocent.

181
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,170
If it's really for the sake of my mother, please stop here

182
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,969
and avoid committing crimes.

183
00:12:29,969 --> 00:12:33,589
Your mother's education to you was all in vain.

184
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,190
Piss off!

185
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,129
Tuluk.

186
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:38,830
Let's go, Young Khan.

187
00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:22,629
We're so lucky.

188
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:26,329
God seems to be on our side.

189
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:31,570
It's not up to you to decide what luck you have today.

190
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:39,508
God knows you'd be here.

191
00:13:39,508 --> 00:13:43,309
If you want to take revenge, just do your best.

192
00:13:43,309 --> 00:13:46,170
Sun, you go first.

193
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:50,069
Leave him to me.

194
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:52,609
Okay.

195
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,130
Stop them.

196
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:51,470
She'er.

197
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,040
Sun.

198
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:57,868
I said I'd neither go with you nor surrender to you.

199
00:14:57,869 --> 00:15:00,850
Just like you'll never surrender to me.

200
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:06,689
All stand back.

201
00:15:08,687 --> 00:15:10,554
Don't you understand?

202
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:13,809
Yes, I do.

203
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:31,188
You don't understand what Mimi died for.

204
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:35,108
She died for freedom rather than your arrow.

205
00:16:35,108 --> 00:16:37,168
A person like you, who only obeys orders

206
00:16:37,168 --> 00:16:41,289
and tramples on lives instead of valuing your own life,

207
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:44,010
will never understand.

208
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:50,849
I'm not ordered but entrusted to do so.

209
00:16:50,849 --> 00:16:53,810
I have to keep my promise.

210
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:30,568
She'er, must you be like this?

211
00:17:30,568 --> 00:17:35,650
Were you moved because I set you free in Dingxiang?

212
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,249
Don't show mercy later.

213
00:17:39,249 --> 00:17:43,110
Come on, you're more merciful.

214
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:06,989
You...

215
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,210
Why?

216
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,130
I'm tired.

217
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:23,869
If there's one in the world that can kill me, it must be you.

218
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:29,170
She'er, don't punish yourself because of someone else's fault.

219
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,049
You're innocent.

220
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:35,289
I'll atone for my mother's crimes.

221
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:40,790
Sun, promise me to set my men in Wolf Division free.

222
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,349
They're warriors of Ashile Tribe and shouldn't fight for Dingxiang.

223
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,750
You're Young Khan.

224
00:19:03,269 --> 00:19:11,549
You ought to lead them to a free life yourself.

225
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:28,350
Sun, I want to have another fight and drink with you.

226
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,349
I wonder if there's a chance.

227
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,550
There is, of course.

228
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:37,130
When the war ceases and the grass sprouts again,

229
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,369
we'll meet again for sure.

230
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:43,889
Go west.

231
00:19:45,009 --> 00:19:46,909
As far as possible.

232
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,750
Wolf Division!

233
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:33,590
Let Wolf Division go!

234
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,710
General Du, General Li broke through the enemy's ambush in Qikou.

235
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,250
Now both sides are at war.

236
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,750
- Get more news. 
 - Yes.

237
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,890
General Li is so fast.

238
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,809
My second uncle fought here and there after overturning Sui Dynasty

239
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,890
to "govern" the country.

240
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:34,009
Governor Gongsun had guarded Shuo State for years to "protect" the city.

241
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:36,249
But General Li's different.

242
00:21:36,249 --> 00:21:38,649
Speed is valued in war.

243
00:21:38,649 --> 00:21:41,409
He just wants to "expedite" the war.

244
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:48,990
 Charge! 

245
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,819
General Du, leaders of all tribes fled from the western mountain pass following Yicheng's carriage.

246
00:22:07,819 --> 00:22:12,349
General Li's delayed and needs cavalry to block them.

247
00:22:12,349 --> 00:22:15,209
I'll be on it. I can't let Yicheng run away.

248
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:17,830
Take enough men and take care.

249
00:22:19,512 --> 00:22:20,610
What about Eagle Division?

250
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,248
It encountered an enemy troop at the mouth of Wuduo Valley.

251
00:22:23,248 --> 00:22:24,869
The leader Lei Meng was killed.

252
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:28,590
The General of Eagle Division detoured to block Ashile's Young Khan.

253
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,140
I see, go on.

254
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,630
Yes.

255
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:54,830
No! Let's go.

256
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:23,349
Everybody. The alliance between Tang and your tribes

257
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:27,149
is for common prosperity and long-term well-being.

258
00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:32,010
Yicheng got you all involved for her own benefit.

259
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,029
Do you still want to work for her?

260
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:39,620
Our country doesn't want to be your enemy.

261
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:43,150
If you stop fighting against us now, you can give up the sword for the plow,

262
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:46,508
look after your family, and lead your tribe to water

263
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:50,968
and grass-oriented life with many flocks.

264
00:23:50,968 --> 00:23:55,448
But if you're too stubborn to agree, and go on fighting against us,

265
00:23:55,448 --> 00:23:59,969
our country will never give in!

266
00:23:59,969 --> 00:24:06,350
Never give in!

267
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:30,369
I'll go home to look after my family.

268
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:33,288
I won't fight anymore.

269
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,969
We won't fight as well.

270
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:14,390
Good news! We've won!

271
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,108
General Li's back.

272
00:25:21,099 --> 00:25:23,110
Congratulations on your defeating the enemy!

273
00:25:23,111 --> 00:25:24,349
Please be assured.

274
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,548
Hao Du went to arrest Yicheng.

275
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:27,229
He won't let Yicheng go.

276
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:28,788
Well done.

277
00:25:28,789 --> 00:25:32,268
Hao Du, have you arrested her?

278
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:34,349
Leaders of all tribes surrendered,

279
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,749
but Yicheng wasn't in the carriage at all.

280
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:40,950
She's neither in the camp nor running away by carriage.

281
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,070
Where's she then?

282
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:46,730
Maybe she didn't want to escape at all.

283
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:29,089
Are you here to ridicule me?

284
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:34,090
I just feel afraid that I almost went the same way as you.

285
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,869
Trash!

286
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:42,530
To achieve your goal, a lot of people died from your schemes.

287
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:46,829
I'd rather be trash than being like you.

288
00:27:46,829 --> 00:27:49,208
You don't understand.

289
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:51,309
You'll never understand.

290
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:53,448
I'm the Princess of Sui Dynasty.

291
00:27:53,448 --> 00:27:55,788
I was born and grown up in Sui Dynasty.

292
00:27:55,789 --> 00:27:57,209
That's my homeland.

293
00:27:57,209 --> 00:27:59,129
I must save it!

294
00:27:59,129 --> 00:28:01,230
Your homeland is still here.

295
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,308
It didn't disappear.

296
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:04,908
Its land is still here.

297
00:28:04,909 --> 00:28:06,308
Its people are here, too.

298
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:08,629
It was the people who suffered the most.

299
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,750
What's gone is just the glory of your royal family.

300
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,349
Does the glory really matter?

301
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,630
Royal family?

302
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:21,761
I'm not exactly one of the royal family at all.

303
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:27,870
I just bear the royal surname.

304
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:33,550
The most glorious day of my life

305
00:28:34,449 --> 00:28:38,449
was the day when I was promoted to Princess.

306
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,129
 I had neither been to the royal palace 

307
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:53,068
 nor been so well-dressed, praised by the entire public 

308
00:28:53,068 --> 00:28:55,810
 and welcomed by all officials. 

309
00:28:55,810 --> 00:29:01,710
 They said from then on, I'd be the Princess of Sui. 

310
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:06,929
 I would have to marry a khan of the grasslands. 

311
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:12,248
 From now on, you'll be my company. 

312
00:29:12,248 --> 00:29:17,869
 I, Lei Meng, will do my best to protect Your Highness till death. 

313
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:21,089
 I agreed to marry Khan. 

314
00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:26,109
 That was not only my glory but also my fate. 

315
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:28,528
 I'm the Princess of Sui. 

316
00:29:28,528 --> 00:29:31,950
 I'm willing to sacrifice for it. 

317
00:29:42,909 --> 00:29:48,928
I don't need your or anyone else's sympathy.

318
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:54,568
Those so-called princesses or princes of the royal family all far lagged behind me.

319
00:29:55,209 --> 00:30:00,490
They knelt down and begged for mercy.

320
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:05,550
They cast their country aside just to survive.

321
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,069
Only me.

322
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:17,249
For thirty years, only I, confined to the grasslands,

323
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:20,550
haven't discarded our country.

324
00:30:23,389 --> 00:30:25,089
Come back.

325
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:29,768
Sui Dynasty had been overturned.

326
00:30:29,768 --> 00:30:32,407
Where shall I go back?

327
00:30:32,407 --> 00:30:34,389
Your homeland is still here.

328
00:30:34,389 --> 00:30:36,208
Chang'an is still here.

329
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:38,510
Daxing Palace is still here.

330
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:43,770
Trees in the palace were planted during Sui Dynasty.

331
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:48,949
In my childhood, I used to climb up the tree with friends to play truant.

332
00:30:50,669 --> 00:30:54,850
As long as you can go back and be subject to Tang Dynasty,

333
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:05,189
according to my knowledge of Second Uncle, he won't kill you.

334
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:30,050
If I had been willing to beg for my life,

335
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:35,269
how could I have chosen this path?

336
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:44,730
Will you even go back to Chang'an?

337
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,230
Yes.

338
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,130
I was wrong.

339
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:11,010
My life is nothing but a humiliating joke.

340
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:14,750
I won't beg for mercy,

341
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:22,980
but thank you

342
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:28,550
for accompanying me at the end of my life.

343
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,909
♫   The past can't blow away the moonlight,   ♫

344
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:49,869
♫   I can't forget   ♫

345
00:32:49,869 --> 00:32:55,510
♫   where to look back   ♫

346
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:07,390
♫   The dark side of the world turns to frost   ♫

347
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:12,130
♫   What if persistence disappears like fleeting glory?   ♫

348
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:16,490
♫   It's okay to forget   ♫

349
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:36,549
Grandma, is this Chang'an?

350
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:41,029
Yes, we're back home.

351
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:56,170
   

352
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:03,330
   

353
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:29,609
Father.

354
00:34:44,009 --> 00:34:45,809
Father.

355
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:57,369
We won Dingxiang back. We won Yinshan back.

356
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:27,470
Father, don't worry.

357
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:31,550
I'll take good care of Li Yueyan.

358
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:41,510
Father... we'll take good care of each other.

359
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:41,009
You can rest in peace now.

360
00:37:03,869 --> 00:37:06,510
Your Majesty, my condolences.

361
00:37:08,009 --> 00:37:10,769
Did she die a painful death?

362
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:14,310
You mean Li Changge?

363
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:24,089
Princess achieved her goal, so she can rest in peace.

364
00:37:24,089 --> 00:37:29,789
What did she say at last?

365
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:35,249
She said she was grateful to you.

366
00:37:37,289 --> 00:37:39,188
Anything else?

367
00:37:39,189 --> 00:37:45,189
She said... she liked reading.

368
00:37:45,189 --> 00:37:49,739
On each year's Cold Food Day, please burn books as sacrificial offerings.

369
00:37:53,629 --> 00:38:00,309
I've watched her growing up, but I never knew she liked reading.

370
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,650
Didn't she like reading?

371
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:03,809
She seems to like it.

372
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:05,809
Li Yaoshi.

373
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:10,489
How dare you trick me?

374
00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:17,110
I'm sorry, but it's all because of Li Changge.

375
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:20,350
I was forced to do so.

376
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:27,089
You may rise.

377
00:38:27,089 --> 00:38:29,449
What happened, after all?

378
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,690
 Changge! 

379
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:39,750
 Changge! 

380
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,480
 Didn't you promise me to never to... 

381
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,950
 Never to risk my life alone. 

382
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,728
 So why did you rush in instead of waiting for me? 

383
00:38:55,728 --> 00:38:59,309
 I know I was wrong. Don't be mad at me. 

384
00:39:04,729 --> 00:39:11,829
 Princess, are you not going back to Chang'an with me? 

385
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:13,849
 General Li, what are you talking about? 

386
00:39:13,849 --> 00:39:16,489
 Everything has gone with the fire. 

387
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:19,009
 There's no princess. 

388
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:24,969
 You're so determined. 

389
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:29,390
 I'm the one who paid a double cost. 

390
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:33,348
 General Li, if His Majesty asks about me, 

391
00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:37,169
 let him remove my name from historical records. 

392
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:39,870
 There'll be no Li Change in the world from now on. 

393
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,869
 Thank you, General Li. 

394
00:39:47,869 --> 00:39:49,930
 I know nothing. 

395
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:00,050
 So where are you going? 

396
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,949
 Don't mention it. 

397
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:05,789
 Anyway, someplace in the world from which no one can escape. 

398
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:11,270
 If His Majesty asks, tell him just to let it be. 

399
00:40:34,009 --> 00:40:36,009
Fine.

400
00:40:36,009 --> 00:40:40,210
Maybe one day you'll meet again.

401
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:52,689
 Changge, is such a prosperous Tang Dynasty what you want? 

402
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:59,169
 Having traveled around for long, 

403
00:40:59,169 --> 00:41:02,789
 I'm increasingly aware that only when the country is in peace 

404
00:41:02,789 --> 00:41:05,669
 can the people live in contentment; 

405
00:41:05,669 --> 00:41:09,890
 only when the country is strong can the people be fearless. 

406
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:12,509
 The old scores are all personal trifles. 

407
00:41:12,509 --> 00:41:17,190
 Now I can finally leave them behind. 

408
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:19,394
 Today the country is well-governed; 

409
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:22,149
 people benefit a lot from His Majesty's grace; each performs its own functions; 

410
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:26,290
 the world is in peace, and is ushering in a flourishing age. 

411
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:30,109
 Second Uncle, thank you so much 

412
00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:34,689
 for not letting our country and people down. 

413
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:54,790
 Huge thanks to the The Ode to Love Team! 

414
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:59,980

 Thank you for your hard work as TE, trangxlnguyen_197! 

417

 I'm very grateful for cerejacult for being our GE! 

418
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:20,020
 I really appreciate the work of all our other language moderators! Thank you all! 

419
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:25,090
 Also, a million thanks to every other subtitler who has worked on this project with us!
