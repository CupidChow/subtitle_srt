23
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,998
Sun. Sun.

24
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,720
Sun'er.

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,299
Sun.

26
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:52,640
It seems the drug isn't strong enough.

27
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,998
From now on, increase the dosage.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,059
Yes.

29
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:59,238
Let our men in Mobei check carefully.

30
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:02,439
He must see Ashile Sun's dead body himself.

31
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,178
Mimi Guli didn't even ruin the gromwell.

32
00:02:05,178 --> 00:02:08,519
I don't believe she would kill Sun on her own.

33
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,319
Please be assured, Princess.

34
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,300
I'll do as you told me.

35
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,820
By the way,

36
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:17,339
I heard that Buzhen gets along quite well with the Prince of Sui.

37
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:19,479
They're at similar ages.

38
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,500
Prince of Sui indeed likes him.

39
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:25,360
As long as he's under our control,

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,940
she's still useful.

41
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,683
Young Khan, we're sure that, except for Mu Jin,

42
00:02:48,683 --> 00:02:51,750
among Bear Division and Eagle Division, no one else is alive.

43
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,020
Why?

44
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:00,179
Ashile Sun is so experienced in wars,

45
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,560
he has been through a lot.

46
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,300
How can it be?

47
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,480
Sun,

48
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,940
I haven't even drunk with you happily.

49
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,019
I thought I would be very happy when you were dead.

50
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,359
But somehow, I'm not happy at all.

51
00:03:56,119 --> 00:03:59,079
You're the opponent I appreciate the most.

52
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:02,720
I haven't proved to you that I won't be defeated by you.

53
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:06,459
Ashile Sun, you're such a jerk!

54
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,140
So you want me to lose to you forever.

55
00:04:26,119 --> 00:04:29,520
When you were alive, you'd been quite annoying.

56
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,500
Now you're dead, and you still make me suffer.

57
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:11,240
Do you believe that Ashile Sun has died?

58
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,639
He's the God of War here.

59
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,220
How could he die?

60
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:21,979
She'er, you're drunk.

61
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,099
Uncle Khan.

62
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,199
It must be Uncle Khan.

63
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,800
If he hadn't allowed it,

64
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,340
how could Tu Kashe have done it?

65
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,979
He wouldn't dare to do so.

66
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,979
No one dare to kill Sun.

67
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,699
I can even imagine that on the battlefield of the desert,

68
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:51,858
the soldiers from the desert were waiting for him,

69
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:54,359
and Tu Kashe was following him.

70
00:05:54,359 --> 00:05:57,159
They all wanted to kill Sun.

71
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,960
Everyone has his own fate.

72
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:07,519
Stop guessing on your own.

73
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,980
If someone sly heard everything you said about that,

74
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,479
your Uncle Khan would be angry.

75
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,499
It wouldn't be good for the Wolf Division.

76
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:21,379
Angry?

77
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,100
Sun is already dead.

78
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,620
Can't I talk about the truth?

79
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,020
Before, I'd been eager to defeat Sun.

80
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,420
Now Eagle Division is gone.

81
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:43,600
Even if Wolf Division becomes the king here,

82
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,840
is it meaningful?

83
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:49,379
Of course, it's meaningful.

84
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:51,798
You're the real king of the Ashile Tribe.

85
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:54,358
You should have been the leader here.

86
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:55,799
Ashile Sun died.

87
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,479
You should feel happy about that.

88
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,080
You can't let your mother down.

89
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,878
She'er. She'er!

90
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:19,959
 Ashile Sun, you even won my son's heart. 

91
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,559
 I belittled your ability. 

92
00:07:33,999 --> 00:07:36,059
Where's he? Did you catch him?

93
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:36,958
He's dead.

94
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,940
Who released the arrow?

95
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,829
Our men surrounded him.

96
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:43,159
When he realized that he couldn't escape, he killed himself.

97
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,560
Where's his body?

98
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,719
It's outside.

99
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,220
We've searched him thoroughly, there isn't anything useful.

100
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,838
It's the Ashile Tribe that wanted him to die.

101
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:56,140
It's his fellow that wanted to kill Ashile Sun.

102
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,039
It's Khan's tent.

103
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,219
If they dare hurt Sun again,

104
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:04,620
I'll definitely let them pay tenfold.

105
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,398
I want to request one more thing from you.

106
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:09,520
Go ahead.

107
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,539
Since they sent the spy here, they must want to see the dead body.

108
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,509
Can you burn the battlefield, so that there will be no trace?

109
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,319
Under such a sad situation, you can still be so thoughtful.

110
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,720
That's stunning.

111
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,039
Don't worry. I'll handle that.

112
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,720
How is he?

113
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,739
I've done everything I can.

114
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:30,319
But whether he can survive until tomorrow...

115
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,279
Anyway, you'd better get prepared.

116
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,759
Thanks a lot.

117
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,440
I want to take good care of him.

118
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,820
Let's go.

119
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:09,039
Sun, you can hear me. Right?

120
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:11,959
♫  Gradually swims towards you  ♫

121
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:15,479
I've let Pusa help the men of Eagle Division settle down.

122
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:17,340
When you wake up,

123
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,440
let's leave here together.

124
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:24,499
We can go to a place where there's no war.

125
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:26,440
There would be many plants

126
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,720
and many herds of cattle and sheep.

127
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:32,420
I heard that when we walk a little more toward the north,

128
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:35,200
there would be a very beautiful snow mountain.

129
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,659
Can you accompany me to visit there, okay?

130
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:43,019
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

131
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:47,798
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

132
00:09:47,798 --> 00:09:50,719
I remember when we first met.

133
00:09:50,719 --> 00:09:55,579
Back then, I had lost all my family,

134
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:01,500
but I suddenly became friends with Zhun.

135
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,959
 I'm Qin Zhun. 

136
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,079
 You can call me Zhun. 

137
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:12,680
 Whether it's storm or war, 

138
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,919
 I, Ashile Sun, will protect you. 

139
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:22,919
That was the saddest period in my life,

140
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:26,640
but you showed up.

141
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,499
Now it's also your worst moment.

142
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:35,379
I will definitely not leave you.

143
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:40,700
We've been through so much about life and death.

144
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:46,239
And we can also face those things together in the future, right?

145
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,319
Actually, I really hate you.

146
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:03,029
You're too arrogant.

147
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,150
And you don't know how to take care of yourself.

148
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,900
But I just can't leave you.

149
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,280
Wasn't it you who told me

150
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,579
I should spend my whole life to pay you back?

151
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:18,080
I promise.

152
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:21,599
I won't leave you in my life.

153
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,039
But you have to give me a chance.

154
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,080
Please wake up.

155
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,500
Sun, please wake up. Okay?

156
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,039
I'll accompany you.

157
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,759
Please wake up.

158
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,379
There are a lot of things we haven't done together.

159
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:53,100
There are many places we haven't visited together.

160
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,900
Don't leave me alone.

161
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:03,960
♫  It is sleepless  ♫

162
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,299
I didn't expect things would be like this.

163
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:21,839
That's all about what happened to Sun and Changge in Mobei.

164
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,399
You should join them first.

165
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,558
Eagle Division is gone.

166
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:26,839
It might not be safe for you to stay here.

167
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,740
What about you? Why do you stay?

168
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,119
Great Khan is ill, and Khan's tent is moving.

169
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,219
I've looked into it. Khan's tent is moving to Dingxiang.

170
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,299
I have to go there.

171
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,839
I still have something undone.

172
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,440
What's that?

173
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,739
Since we're all on the same side,

174
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:49,180
brothers of Yanxing Sect won't leave you alone.

175
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,839
It's not convenient for you to follow.

176
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,159
Please tell Sun all about it.

177
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,460
What's more, Ya Luo is dead.

178
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,179
I've secretly been to the prison of Khan's tent,

179
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:05,459
and I didn't find Ya Luo there.

180
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,799
The soldier guarding the prison there told me

181
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:12,539
that Ya Luo was killed the night when he arrived at Khan's tent.

182
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,478
Nowadays, Khan's tent isn't the same as before.

183
00:13:18,479 --> 00:13:20,918
You said that Khan's tent is moving to Dingxiang.

184
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:24,640
So there's someone from Sui in your Ashile Tribe?

185
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,259
That's Khatun.

186
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,600
Interesting.

187
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,539
That's your Ashile Tribe's business, I'd better not interfere.

188
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:36,579
I only follow Young Master's order.

189
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:38,440
Thank you, Elder Qin.

190
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:42,800
Take care.

191
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,690
And... if you meet Mimi, please tell her...

192
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:51,350
to live a good life.

193
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,800
Young man, I think...

194
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,020
she must wish you to tell her yourself.

195
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:07,158
Xu Feng, tell our men that we'll wait for Young Master's order here.

196
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:10,759
Besides, send a letter to Mobei.

197
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,060
Yes.

198
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,479
Young man, take care.

199
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,700
See you.

200
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:04,759
Sun, you are finally awake.

201
00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:07,619
You're really awake.

202
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:12,419
I knew that you wouldn't leave me alone.

203
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:14,780
You really have woken up.

204
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:19,880
Are you really not leaving me for your whole life?

205
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,059
You heard that.

206
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:25,839
If I can hear your sincere words,

207
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,580
it's worthwhile even if I get ten more arrows.

208
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,939
Stop talking nonsense.

209
00:15:31,939 --> 00:15:34,699
Do you know how worried I was about you last night?

210
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:38,140
I was afraid that you might...

211
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,759
just die like that.

212
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:43,180
I also thought I would die,

213
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,519
but I heard you calling my name.

214
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:48,999
Then I came back from the God of Sirius.

215
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:54,840
I also heard that...

216
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,059
you wanted to take revenge for me.

217
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,579
I'm really happy about that.

218
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,780
Changge,

219
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:08,379
the moment when I got shot with the arrow, I thought about nothing

220
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:10,900
except for taking you home.

221
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:16,440
Changge, I...

222
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:20,719
General Sun, you're awake!

223
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,419
There's no General Sun anymore.

224
00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:25,100
Just call me Sun.

225
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,619
Well, I'll tell them the good news.

226
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,139
They've been worrying for a whole night.

227
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,399
 Move. Fast. 

228
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,678
 Careful. Don't get it broken. 

229
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:49,049
 - Keep moving. 
 - There's another box. 

230
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,718
 - Keep following. 
 - Careful. 

231
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,159
 Give me a hand. Put it here. 

232
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:54,759
 - Don't break it. 
 - Keep moving. 

233
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:58,499
 It's ready here. Come. 

234
00:16:58,499 --> 00:17:00,619
 Here. Give me a hand. 

235
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,079
 Careful. Gently. 

236
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:05,971
 - Gently. Put it here.  
 - Too loud! Shut up!

237
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,859
Young Khan.

238
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,958
What's going on?

239
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,099
Great Khan orders that the capital is to move to Dingxiang.

240
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,760
And we start moving now.

241
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,199
 Your Uncle Khan is seriously ill. 

242
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,079
 He can't continue working. 

243
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:25,959
 The Great Seal, Khan's tent, 

244
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,120
 and the whole area here will be controlled by you. 

245
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,399
 You're the real king of Ashile Tribe. 

246
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:35,100
 You should have been the leader here. 

247
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,920
It's Mother.

248
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,380
Uncle Khan is ill.

249
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,900
Ashile Sun and Tu Kashe both died.

250
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:46,279
There's only me in the capital.

251
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,360
Is that a coincidence or Mother's plan?

252
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,979
Tuluk, what do you think?

253
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:01,558
You can finally meet your mother.

254
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:03,320
That's a good thing.

255
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:09,739
What's wrong?

256
00:18:09,739 --> 00:18:12,639
The spy we sent to Mobei... died.

257
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,119
He died?

258
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:16,440
He might have been discovered by the soldiers of Mobei.

259
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,559
Useless.

260
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,539
So no one saw Ashile Sun's body with their own eyes?

261
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:24,739
Yes.

262
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:28,340
What's more, we didn't find Tu Kashe's body, either.

263
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,399
Mobei defeated Ashile Tribe for the first time.

264
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,159
They burned up the battlefield to celebrate. So...

265
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,859
All right, I know.

266
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:38,880
You can leave here.

267
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,920
Yes.

268
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:52,639
I told you.

269
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,559
This wolf here has nine lives.

270
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,879
He wouldn't die so easily.

271
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,020
Let's get to the point.

272
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,200
Ashile Sun, I know that you're a true man.

273
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,340
I'll say it directly.

274
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,559
The man trying to kill you was from Ashile Tribe.

275
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,100
No need to have attachments.

276
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,959
As long as you work for me with Eagle Division, I can promise that

277
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:20,060
Mobei will treat you quite well.

278
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,459
Thank you, King of Mobei.

279
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:24,418
However, since I faked death with my men,

280
00:19:24,418 --> 00:19:26,939
I won't risk their lives in another place.

281
00:19:26,939 --> 00:19:30,360
Except for Mobei, where else can you go?

282
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,860
It doesn't matter.

283
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,458
Even if I have to be exiled,

284
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:36,938
it would be better than always to keep fighting and risking my life.

285
00:19:36,938 --> 00:19:39,579
You're quite good at leading troops. It's a pity that you don't use it.

286
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,900
- How about coming to Monan? 
 - Eagle Division won't fight for anyone.

287
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:51,300
Since everyone expressed what they're thinking about,

288
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:53,259
I would also like to say something.

289
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:54,759
Go ahead.

290
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,799
In my opinion, even if Khan Yanli was quite worried about Eagle Division's power,

291
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,779
he wouldn't kill Sun.

292
00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:01,338
And the truth...

293
00:20:01,338 --> 00:20:02,839
Dingxiang.

294
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:07,519
It must have something to do with Dingxiang.

295
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,159
You also found that out.

296
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,560
Right.

297
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,559
However much Father dislikes me,

298
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,659
he wouldn't remove such a powerful tool.

299
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:16,560
But if it were that person,

300
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,820
she couldn't know it better that Eagle Division wouldn't work for her.

301
00:20:21,479 --> 00:20:23,279
Now all the tribes here have betrayed her.

302
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,959
Princess Yicheng's wish won't come true.

303
00:20:25,959 --> 00:20:28,519
But I believe that she won't give up easily.

304
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,478
I'm afraid that more and more people in Ashile Tribe believe her lies

305
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:34,399
and blindly join the war.

306
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:38,479
At present, if we want peaceful days, there's only one way.

307
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:40,456
We should ally with Great Tang.

308
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,499
Ally with Great Tang?

309
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:46,999
Forming an alliance with Great Tang, allows the third party to interfere.

310
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,378
At that time, if Yicheng wants to launch a war again, she would hesitate.

311
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:54,420
But what if she doesn't stop?

312
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,938
I can't allow Great Tang to attack Ashile Tribe.

313
00:20:56,938 --> 00:20:59,880
I also don't want to see it happen,

314
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,779
but we have to do our best.

315
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:06,199
Only when three parties hinder each other will the war not begin.

316
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:09,700
Changge, you thought about it too simply.

317
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,419
It's not an easy thing, but if we don't try our best,

318
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:16,780
we'd lose our last chance.

319
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,155
This is the letter I received this morning from Elder Qin.

320
00:21:27,155 --> 00:21:30,540
It includes some messages from Mu Jin.

321
00:21:41,859 --> 00:21:43,740
Ya Luo died.

322
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,640
Father is also seriously ill.

323
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,360
Khan's tent...

324
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:52,700
Khan's tent is moving to Dingxiang.

325
00:21:53,459 --> 00:21:55,559
Right.

326
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,380
If I guess correctly,

327
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:01,079
Yicheng is getting more control over the capital.

328
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,779
After Khan's tent moves to Dingxiang,

329
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:07,038
once Yicheng completely controls the whole Ashile Tribe,

330
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,079
her next move is to attack Great Tang.

331
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:15,079
- In other words, you came to meet us for Tang? 
 - No.

332
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:19,058
No, I'm for all the innocent people who are suffering from wars.

333
00:22:19,058 --> 00:22:23,320
As for the people in the desert, in Ashile Tribe, or in Great Tang,

334
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,939
they're merely innocent people.

335
00:22:24,939 --> 00:22:29,120
They shouldn't sacrifice themselves by being controlled due to those people's desires.

336
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,179
We all should take responsibility.

337
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:34,759
I thought you had a brilliant idea.

338
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,538
Ally with Great Tang?

339
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:40,739
Remember. We were all enemies of Great Tang.

340
00:22:40,739 --> 00:22:42,040
Right.

341
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,059
If we ally with Great Tang,

342
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:47,478
no one can make sure it won't be the second Ashile Tribe.

343
00:22:47,479 --> 00:22:48,739
It won't.

344
00:22:48,739 --> 00:22:51,939
About what's happening now, only Tang can help with that.

345
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:53,748
From what I know about Li Shimin,

346
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:56,588
Tang will never be the second Ashile Tribe.

347
00:22:56,589 --> 00:22:58,949
Let Tang hinder Ashile Tribe.

348
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:02,508
Then the desert can withdraw without getting hurt.

349
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:05,129
There is no better strategy.

350
00:23:05,129 --> 00:23:09,408
Besides, you ally with many parts to be against Ashile Tribe.

351
00:23:09,408 --> 00:23:12,270
How can you give up such a strong ally?

352
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:13,949
Wait. Wait a second.

353
00:23:13,949 --> 00:23:17,549
We keep discussing it, but there's a question.

354
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:20,830
Why would Tang ally with us?

355
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,970
In a few days, we might get the news.

356
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,910
Sun, Ya Luo...

357
00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:00,228
Ya Luo died for the whole Eagle Division.

358
00:24:00,229 --> 00:24:02,049
Don't blame yourself too much.

359
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:04,069
Changge,

360
00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:07,769
Father wouldn't kill Ya Luo.

361
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,190
I know.

362
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:12,388
Father was so strong.

363
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:14,630
He wouldn't fall ill easily.

364
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:18,110
Sun, I know what you're thinking about.

365
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,649
If it were not for the whole scheme...

366
00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:23,389
If it were not for the whole scheme... you would definitely lead Eagle Division to Khan's tent,

367
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:26,449
avenging Ya Luo and saving your father.

368
00:24:26,449 --> 00:24:28,110
Right.

369
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,590
As the General of Eagle Division, I failed to protect Ya Luo.

370
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:38,450
As a son, I shouldn't have let Yicheng hurt my father.

371
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:40,949
I know we're all waiting for good timing.

372
00:24:40,949 --> 00:24:44,509
But don't worry, Yicheng won't kill Great Khan,

373
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:47,710
since the whole Ashile Tribe still needs him to lead.

374
00:24:48,569 --> 00:24:50,650
I feel really bad now.

375
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:53,569
Take it easy. I'm with you.

376
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:58,590
Sun, I'll save your father with you

377
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:02,509
and avenge Ya Luo and the whole Eagle Division.

378
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:09,650
Leader, the envoy of Tang has asked to meet you.

379
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:11,249
I know. You can leave.

380
00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:12,750
Yes.

381
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,229
Tang? So fast.

382
00:25:16,229 --> 00:25:18,288
Li Changge hid something from us.

383
00:25:18,288 --> 00:25:21,030
Let me meet this envoy.

384
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:24,010
Will you stay here or hide?

385
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,490
Cut the crap.

386
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,049
Send the envoy of Tang here.

387
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,428
Greetings to King of Mobei.

388
00:25:40,428 --> 00:25:42,749
I'm Wei Shuyu, the envoy of Tang.

389
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:46,049
The imperial court knew that the Ashile Tribe was recruiting in the desert.

390
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:49,248
His Majesty sent me here to invite leaders of each tribe

391
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:52,810
to having a meeting in Chang'an to discuss forming an alliance.

392
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,508
Thanks for coming here from so far, Envoy Wei.

393
00:25:56,508 --> 00:25:58,588
We'd better carefully discuss it.

394
00:25:58,589 --> 00:26:00,330
Take our time.

395
00:26:13,189 --> 00:26:15,490
Changge?

396
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,429
Wei Shuyu?

397
00:26:19,489 --> 00:26:21,610
Why are you here?

398
00:26:24,909 --> 00:26:27,789
Changge, why are you in Mobei?

399
00:26:27,789 --> 00:26:29,648
Since we met last time in Liuyun Taoist Temple,

400
00:26:29,648 --> 00:26:32,549
Li Yueyan and I were very worried about you.

401
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,688
What about  Li Yueyan? How is she?

402
00:26:34,688 --> 00:26:36,060
Princess is fine.

403
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,069
She observes farming on her own and cares for ordinary people.

404
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:41,310
She's quite different from before.

405
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:45,229
After all, she's suffered a lot.

406
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:47,210
But that's a good thing.

407
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:49,888
Since the Noble Princess of Tang needs to grow up.

408
00:26:49,888 --> 00:26:51,668
You're also a Princess of Tang.

409
00:26:51,668 --> 00:26:53,789
You've also grown up.

410
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:58,630
Shuyu, tell me about Li Shimin...

411
00:27:01,209 --> 00:27:03,349
Tell me why you're here.

412
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:05,729
His Majesty received a cryptogram.

413
00:27:05,729 --> 00:27:07,949
After reading that, His Majesty sent me here

414
00:27:07,949 --> 00:27:09,850
to discuss forming an alliance.

415
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,089
That cryptogram was written in the name of Shuozhou.

416
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,408
Changge, was that you?

417
00:27:15,408 --> 00:27:16,609
Yes, that was me.

418
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:19,829
I didn't expect that you would be still caring about Tang.

419
00:27:19,829 --> 00:27:23,490
After all, Tang is my hometown.

420
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:30,529
Is he... your friend?

421
00:27:30,529 --> 00:27:33,128
Right. He's my friend Sun.

422
00:27:33,128 --> 00:27:34,769
Sun, come here.

423
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:38,510
Let me introduce my friend from Tang, Wei Shuyu.

424
00:27:45,469 --> 00:27:48,908
Your friend doesn't seem to like me.

425
00:27:48,908 --> 00:27:50,529
He's just like that.

426
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:52,349
Don't mind.

427
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:56,570
It's okay. This man Sun...

428
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,710
Sun?

429
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,869
Is he Ashile Sun?

430
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:05,548
Yes. He's Ashile Sun of Eagle Division.

431
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:11,389
I got a cryptogram, saying that Eagle Division and Bear Division all died in the war of Mobei.

432
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,509
Why is he still alive?

433
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:15,348
That's a long story.

434
00:28:15,348 --> 00:28:19,409
About the news that Sun's still alive, please keep it a secret.

435
00:28:19,409 --> 00:28:22,509
We'll form an alliance soon. We don't want to cause additional trouble.

436
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:24,769
That won't be a problem.

437
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:28,208
But, Changge, if you take me as your friend, please listen to me

438
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:31,809
that he's not a kind person and you'd better stay away from him.

439
00:28:32,469 --> 00:28:35,849
Wei Shuyu, I know you said that for me.

440
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:38,250
But about this, I know what I'm doing.

441
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,989
Don't worry.

442
00:28:40,689 --> 00:28:45,550
Since it's so, it'd be useless even if I say more things.

443
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:49,130
Changge, I still have official business.

444
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,329
I have to go.

445
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:21,210
About why Envoy Wei and I know each other,

446
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,820
the two leaders must have many questions about that.

447
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,589
Then tell us yourself.

448
00:29:26,589 --> 00:29:28,869
I was from Eastern Palace.

449
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:31,189
The present emperor killed my whole family.

450
00:29:31,189 --> 00:29:34,028
I was on the run and met Ashile Sun.

451
00:29:34,028 --> 00:29:36,350
Then we became friends.

452
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:39,477
Therefore, I'm not only an old friend of Envoy Wei,

453
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:40,968
but also the military counselor of Eagle Division.

454
00:29:40,968 --> 00:29:42,470
Interesting.

455
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,989
And Tang won't kill you now?

456
00:29:44,989 --> 00:29:49,009
Otherwise, how can I meet the two leaders now?

457
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,210
I believe in what you have said, for now.

458
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,149
We can't lose a strong ally.

459
00:29:55,149 --> 00:29:59,769
But... who should I send to Chang'an?

460
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:01,850
I want to know your thoughts.

461
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,029
If the two leaders trust me,

462
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:05,649
I'd like to be the envoy of the desert

463
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:07,929
and have the meeting in Chang'an.

464
00:30:09,029 --> 00:30:10,230
You?

465
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:13,028
It was also me that negotiated with other tribes about an alliance.

466
00:30:13,028 --> 00:30:15,969
So they should trust me more or less.

467
00:30:15,969 --> 00:30:17,270
Please be assured, two leaders.

468
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:20,690
I'll try to get more interest for the desert.

469
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:29,769
You're not from here.

470
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:32,329
Why do you care so much about the alliance?

471
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:35,110
I hope the war can end as soon as possible,

472
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:38,289
whether in Central Plains, the grasslands, or the desert.

473
00:30:38,289 --> 00:30:41,110
And people won't suffer from starvation or separation.

474
00:30:42,149 --> 00:30:43,989
That's all?

475
00:30:43,989 --> 00:30:46,390
Isn't it sufficient?

476
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,289
What status do you want?

477
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:50,030
Can I choose at my will?

478
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:51,528
Tell me first.

479
00:30:51,528 --> 00:30:54,389
I want to go there as Princess of Mobei.

480
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:57,769
That means your little sister. What do you think?

481
00:30:57,769 --> 00:30:59,929
Okay.

482
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:02,249
Thanks, King of Mobei.

483
00:31:02,249 --> 00:31:05,750
From the day you traded gromwell with me until today,

484
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,289
it seems everything is under your control.

485
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:11,650
Thankfully you're a friend, not an enemy.

486
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,359
Dad!

487
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,917
Dad, I also want to go to Chang'an.

488
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,649
Changge is just a fake princess and she can go there.

489
00:31:19,649 --> 00:31:21,548
I'm the genuine one, why can't I go there?

490
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:23,589
You eavesdropped again.

491
00:31:23,589 --> 00:31:27,970
I just passed by and happened to hear Changge say

492
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,509
that she'll go to Chang'an as a princess.

493
00:31:30,509 --> 00:31:33,668
- Dad, you know it. 
 - No way. You can't.

494
00:31:33,668 --> 00:31:35,630
I long for visiting Chang'an.

495
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,730
No.

496
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:39,439
Dad, that's quite a rare chance.

497
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:44,519
If I had such a naughty daughter, I'd have sent her as far as I could.

498
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:46,060
You...

499
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:50,218
Since Princess is so energetic, if she's not allowed to go there,

500
00:31:50,218 --> 00:31:52,980
she'd definitely try to follow us.

501
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,499
I think she can just go with me.

502
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:57,059
That's easy for you to say.

503
00:31:57,059 --> 00:31:58,778
What if something happens to my baby daughter?

504
00:31:58,778 --> 00:32:01,258
Changge and Sun are with me.

505
00:32:01,258 --> 00:32:04,780
If something happens to me, just punish Changge for that.

506
00:32:08,739 --> 00:32:11,040
Dad.

507
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:16,319
Remember. Tujia is my only baby girl.

508
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:18,200
We know that.

509
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,159
Changge will protect me. Right?

510
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,638
About this journey to Chang'an,

511
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:32,399
please be careful and promote the alliance, Princess.

512
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,619
I won't let you down, Brother.

513
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:37,279
Well, I'll say goodbye now.

514
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,119
Take care.

515
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,689
Sun, have you been to Chang'an before?

516
00:32:46,689 --> 00:32:48,298
This is my first time going there.

517
00:32:48,298 --> 00:32:50,579
I heard that Chang'an is a big and beautiful city.

518
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:52,980
There is also a lot of tasty food.

519
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,459
It's hard to tell if we'll be safe in Chang'an.

520
00:32:56,459 --> 00:32:58,095
Are you prepared?

521
00:32:58,095 --> 00:33:00,879
When I was in Liuyun Taoist Temple,

522
00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:04,460
Master told me to follow my heart and accept the consequences.

523
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,999
If I just seek safety and avoid disasters and difficulties,

524
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,279
I wouldn't have been the same Li Changge as of today.

525
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,540
Whatever happens, I won't regret it.

526
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,640
Besides, you're accompanying me.

527
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:24,770
Right. Let's go.

528
00:33:50,199 --> 00:33:51,660
I'll ask some people to help me.

529
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,160
All right.

530
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,860
Let's go. Come.

531
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,940
 Carefully check everyone in and out. 

532
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,379
You can't leave out anyone. Understand?

533
00:35:01,379 --> 00:35:02,920
 Yes! 

534
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,678
Have you prepared Great Khan's meal?

535
00:35:11,678 --> 00:35:13,560
Yes, it's ready.

536
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,979
Did you put enough in it?

537
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,400
Yes, I did.

538
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,138
Khatun is worried that it can't fill Great Khan's stomach.

539
00:35:27,138 --> 00:35:28,578
Please be assured.

540
00:35:28,578 --> 00:35:31,439
Great Khan won't be disappointed.

541
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,320
   

542
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:05,600
You can leave here.

543
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,580
Yes.

544
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,299
Princess, Monan and Mobei have sent envoys to Chang'an about an alliance.

545
00:36:17,299 --> 00:36:20,179
And the team leader is exactly Li Changge.

546
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:25,138
Li Changge can indeed live well anywhere.

547
00:36:25,138 --> 00:36:26,899
We've left many people in Chang'an.

548
00:36:26,899 --> 00:36:29,039
With only an order, Princess...

549
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:31,380
Then kill her?

550
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:35,379
The alliance between Tang and the desert is basically decided.

551
00:36:35,379 --> 00:36:40,260
Just killing Li Changge doesn't change the scheme of things.

552
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,139
Princess means...

553
00:36:42,139 --> 00:36:45,179
Since the desert will ally with Tang,

554
00:36:45,179 --> 00:36:50,099
I should also show the what I have to offer.

555
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:52,220
Princess, please don't.

556
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,260
I know what you're worried about.

557
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:01,098
But I'm not the little girl that only knows how to cry in the carriage any longer.

558
00:37:01,098 --> 00:37:04,759
Chang'an. I really look forward to it.

559
00:37:04,759 --> 00:37:08,580
Since Princess wants to go there, I'll follow Princess.

560
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:13,920
No. I need you to guard Dingxiang for me.

561
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,479
When did you begin following me?

562
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,039
Was it when I was in Daxing Palace

563
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:23,499
or when I got married?

564
00:37:23,499 --> 00:37:25,500
In the 18th year of Kaihuang.

565
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,360
I was a guard of Daxing Palace.

566
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:32,560
The second year, you came here with me.

567
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,060
I had four husbands.

568
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:40,079
But in the end, you're the one always accompanying me.

569
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:46,000
In other words, I was also accompanying you.

570
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,279
On this huge prairie,

571
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:51,879
the only person I can trust is you.

572
00:37:53,399 --> 00:37:57,479
I'll definitely guard Dingxiang well for you.

573
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,839
You're here.

574
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,940
I cooked something for you.

575
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,280
Mother.

576
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,879
You can't sleep, right?

577
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,059
Do you miss the grassland?

578
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:41,920
It's too late. Get some rest, Mother.

579
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,579
Wait.

580
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:47,120
I want to talk with you.

581
00:38:52,919 --> 00:38:54,419
Have a taste.

582
00:38:59,719 --> 00:39:04,919
I know that you have many doubts.

583
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:09,479
And you may also think things happened too suddenly.

584
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,280
I only want to ask

585
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,238
if you tried to get rid of your Uncle Khan's control

586
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:21,599
in all these years to see me every day.

587
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,300
Yes.

588
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,659
When I was little, every time I got hurt or punished,

589
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,640
I wanted so much to go to your tent to seek your comfort.

590
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,740
But I dare not and could not.

591
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:40,700
I could only bear it by myself.

592
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:06,180
Mom, I'm just not used to that.

593
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:10,360
I understand.

594
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,300
Among all these years, you've been growing up alone.

595
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,999
You got used to days without me quite early.

596
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,800
Not like that.

597
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:26,439
Now, we two can finally stay together.

598
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:27,860
Do you feel happy?

599
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,000
Yes.

600
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,719
Dingxiang is my hometown.

601
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:38,340
I have so many memories here

602
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:41,280
and many regrets also.

603
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,779
I hope that I can make up some of them while I'm still alive.

604
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,360
Would you like to accompany me?

605
00:40:52,539 --> 00:40:57,460
Everything I do is for you.

606
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,220
I know.

607
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,540
Well. Get some good rest.

608
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,659
I have to go back.

609
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:07,639
I'll go to Chang'an later.

610
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:09,139
Chang'an?

611
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:11,240
Why are you going to Chang'an?

612
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,959
To do the things I haven't finished.

613
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,700
Mom!

614
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,539
I'll accompany you to Chang'an.

615
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:48,500
   

616
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:02,020
Wait.

617
00:42:06,099 --> 00:42:08,019
Chang'an is quite a big city.

618
00:42:08,019 --> 00:42:10,820
That's much more interesting than Mobei or Monan.

619
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:14,319
Sun. Changge. I'm going to buy something.

620
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,519
Miss, have a look. The sugar figures.

621
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:23,700
Two wen for each.

622
00:42:25,959 --> 00:42:28,140
 I'm back finally. 

623
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,839
 Everything remained, except for the people. 

624
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,760
 The past should only stay in my memory. 

625
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:36,120
 Mom, how are you? 

626
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,860
Returning to this sad place,

627
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,600
I'm sorry.

628
00:42:42,779 --> 00:42:44,479
It's all right.

629
00:42:45,339 --> 00:42:47,759
I just have some complicated feelings.

630
00:42:47,759 --> 00:42:52,120
When it's over, I'll take you away from here.

631
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,420
This time, I do feel like a century has passed.

632
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:02,279
Things are really hard to expect.

633
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,220
I did everything I could to run away.

634
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,659
Now I'm back without caring about the consequences.

635
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:16,160
Sun, people change easily, don't they?

636
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,920
You escaped in order to survive.

637
00:43:19,439 --> 00:43:23,880
Now you're back so that more people can survive.

638
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,359
Changge, you didn't do anything wrong.

639
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,960
If the world is in a mess and people die from wars,

640
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,539
how can I enjoy being alive alone?

641
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:41,460
Saving others is also saving myself.

642
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,339
Don't worry.

643
00:43:43,339 --> 00:43:45,640
I'll protect you.

644
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,139
I'm the Princess of Mobei now.

645
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:50,500
No one dare kill me.

646
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,660
Right.

647
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:55,020
With such a good guard like me,

648
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,579
no one dares to lay a finger on you.

♫  As your silhouette weaves  ♫

656
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,730
♫  and locks in my nostalgic dream  ♫

657
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:40,529
♫  Before the daybreak,  ♫

658
00:44:40,530 --> 00:44:42,819
♫  through the obsession of love,  ♫

659
00:44:42,819 --> 00:44:46,649
♫  the yearning flowing through thoughts  ♫

660
00:44:46,649 --> 00:44:50,219
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

661
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:56,019
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

662
00:44:56,019 --> 00:44:59,459
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

663
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:06,080
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

664
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,469
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

665
00:45:08,469 --> 00:45:10,649
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

666
00:45:10,649 --> 00:45:15,319
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

667
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:18,179
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

668
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,320
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

669
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:27,390
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

670
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,400
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

671
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:40,129
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

672
00:45:40,129 --> 00:45:43,639
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

673
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:50,049
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

674
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:52,509
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

675
00:45:52,509 --> 00:45:54,879
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

676
00:45:54,879 --> 00:45:59,459
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

677
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,229
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

678
00:46:02,229 --> 00:46:04,229
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

679
00:46:04,229 --> 00:46:11,640
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

680
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,310
♫  It is sleepless  ♫

681
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:33,340
