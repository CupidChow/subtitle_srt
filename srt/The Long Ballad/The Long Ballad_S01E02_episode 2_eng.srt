00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,999
♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,959
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,120
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,869
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,140
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,819
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

7
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:31,789
♫   Tears and regrets go hand in hand   ♫

8
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,789

00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,739
♫  To the distance  ♫

10

♫  The miserable past is like a dagger  ♫

♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,359
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,309
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,269
♫  The river of life is under my feet  ♫

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,950
♫  I don't regret my craziness  ♫

20
00:01:25,855 --> 00:01:32,654
   

21
00:01:32,654 --> 00:01:36,240
   

22
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:41,350
Greetings, Father.

23
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,950
That "lad" who reversed the game today. It was you, right?

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,309
I didn't mean to break into the arena.

25
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,821
But we were on a losing streak at that time.

26
00:01:50,822 --> 00:01:52,790
So...

27
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:56,660
that's why I had to...

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,640
Well done.

29
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:06,654
You've brought not only the treasured dagger,

30
00:02:06,654 --> 00:02:08,787
but also honor for me.

31
00:02:08,787 --> 00:02:11,754
Your Grandfather heard it and requested my presence at once.

32
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:13,176
He praised you very highly

33
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:15,250
and gave many rewards.

34
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,320
I've never thought that a girl

35
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,150
could do better than your brothers.

36
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,365
Thanks for the praise, Father.

37
00:02:25,365 --> 00:02:30,570
Changge, where's the Ashile Tribe's treasured sword?

38
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,943
Send it to my room.

39
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,200
I want to appreciate it.

40
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,770
I've already sent it to Second Uncle.

41
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:41,770
What?

42
00:02:42,877 --> 00:02:45,710
How "good and dutiful" you are!

43
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,810
It's me who's raised you

44
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,359
but how can you send the treasure to other people?

45
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:53,870
Second Uncle is also my family...

46
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,279
He's your family, so what about me?

47
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,176
How dare you take his side?

48
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:01,232
Changge, from now on,

49
00:03:01,232 --> 00:03:06,243
I want you to mention nothing about the Qin Family.

50
00:03:06,244 --> 00:03:08,440
Father, you've misunderstood me.

51
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,540
- I... 
 - Your Highness, please calm down.

52
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:14,921
Your Highness, please calm down.

53
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:16,465
Mr. Wei.

54
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:18,210
Advisor Wei. 
    

55
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,543
You finally come to see me.

56
00:03:20,543 --> 00:03:23,543
Your Highness, she's still young

57
00:03:23,543 --> 00:03:26,887
so you need not flare up for it.

58
00:03:26,888 --> 00:03:28,620
She's unfilial!

59
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,469
She only cares about Prince Qin!

60
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,879
I don't think she is concerned for me!

61
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:34,921
Your Highness.

62
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:36,376
Wei Zheng!

63
00:03:36,377 --> 00:03:37,665
Don't waste time!

64
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:39,660
Come with me!

65
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,200
Yes.

66
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,500
Leave here.

67
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:47,443
Go to Prince Qi's Manor and ask Yuanji to come here at once!

68
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:49,070
Yes.

69
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,560
   

70
00:04:05,566 --> 00:04:07,560
- Mother. 
 - Halt there!

71
00:04:11,977 --> 00:04:16,550
You don't take my advice anymore, right?

72
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,430
Then, what did I tell you yesterday?

73
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,499
I just...

74
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:24,199
You just went over the wall and dressed up as a player

75
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,010
to be in the limelight in front of the Ashile, right?

76
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,177
Mother... I won the game.

77
00:04:31,177 --> 00:04:34,760
Father said that Grandfather praised me a lot.

78
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,450
You've never slapped me before...

79
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,590
You've been wild since your childhood,

80
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,079
always making trouble.

81
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,159
I'm to blame for not lecturing you well.

82
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,719
You've been spoiled by me.

83
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,643
How dare you fight for the limelight against men?

84
00:05:07,644 --> 00:05:09,720
Why mention it?

85
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,700
Men and women should be equal.

86
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,319
Why do you always think

87
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,750
I'm not as good as a man?

88
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,179
I'm able-bodied. I have skills.

89
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:19,739
I can go wherever I want!

90
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:21,790
You can go nowhere!

91
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,520
Mother.

92
00:05:25,888 --> 00:05:27,610
Follow me.

93
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:33,940
Kneel down.

94
00:05:34,711 --> 00:05:36,310
Mother.

95
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,970
Kneel!

96
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:45,620
Take an oath here.

97
00:05:46,322 --> 00:05:48,300
From now on,

98
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,000
no matter what happens

99
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,200
and what you go through,

100
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,365
you must live with no hate forever.

101
00:05:56,365 --> 00:05:59,210
Mother... I've never hated anyone.

102
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,510
I need your pledge.

103
00:06:03,299 --> 00:06:06,260
Okay. I swear.

104
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,421
But if someone harms you,

105
00:06:08,421 --> 00:06:10,490
I shall certainly hate the guy.

106
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:22,290
No one will harm me.

107
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,630
I only hope...

108
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:29,550
that you can be happy and unfettered forever.

109
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:35,230
Stay away from disputes and mishaps.

110
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:38,010
As long as my mother stays with me,

111
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,370
I'm the happiest girl in the world.

112
00:06:42,559 --> 00:06:47,060
Do not forget what you've sworn here.

113
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,932
Okay. I'll keep it in mind.

114
00:06:49,932 --> 00:06:51,670
Fine.

115
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,321
Go back and pack.

116
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:55,860
You'll be sent to Biyong Hall tomorrow.

117
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,000
Read and repent there for ten days.

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,921
You must never escape again.

119
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:01,660
Mother.

120
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,410
It's my decision.

121
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,560
Nobody can change it.

122
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:10,110
Mother...

123
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:17,076
Report to General.

124
00:07:17,076 --> 00:07:19,754
Li Jiancheng and Li Shimin balance in power but are discordant.

125
00:07:19,755 --> 00:07:22,420
We don't know who will be the heir.

126
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,332
Li Yuanji will soon lead troops to Wu City.

127
00:07:24,332 --> 00:07:28,330
We know nothing about his power and plan.

128
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:30,399
What has he done recently?

129
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,380
Nothing special. He's been visiting Li Jiancheng every night.

130
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,799
It's said they're close.

131
00:07:35,799 --> 00:07:38,140
He did nothing unusual.

132
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,860
Nothing unusual?

133
00:07:42,022 --> 00:07:45,600
Conceal your whereabouts and spy on them.

134
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,010
Report to me about all the details,

135
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,590
including the things not unusual.

136
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,000
Yes.

137
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:09,830
   

138
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,160
 Abnormal astrology. 

139
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,630
 A new monarch. 

140
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,650
 The world will be changed. 

141
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,170
   

142
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,950
Get the cart.

143
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,487
I want to go to the palace.

144
00:08:26,488 --> 00:08:28,160
Yes.

145
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:33,950
   

146
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:49,100
Princess!

147
00:08:53,622 --> 00:08:57,149
Princess, Madam made you some pastries.

148
00:08:57,149 --> 00:08:59,321
All your favorites.

149
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:04,330
And also, she made you some clothes.

150
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,200
I'm out for a few days and I'll be back soon.

151
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,110
Why did she...

152
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,038
She stayed up all night.

153
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:14,276
She's worried about you.

154
00:09:14,276 --> 00:09:17,770
But why doesn't she come to see me off?

155
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:21,110
She's... tired.

156
00:09:22,388 --> 00:09:24,865
Nanny San, by the way, Yueyan doesn't know that I'm leaving.

157
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:27,740
Don't forget to tell her to wait for me to return.

158
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,132
You can be at ease.

159
00:09:29,132 --> 00:09:31,143
You've been friends since childhood,

160
00:09:31,143 --> 00:09:33,490
so she won't get angry with you.

161
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,432
Well... Nanny San, it's time for me to leave.

162
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:45,010
Take care of yourself and my mother.

163
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,770
Wait for me.

164
00:09:48,777 --> 00:09:50,310
Here you are.

165
00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:53,460
Take it.

166
00:09:55,255 --> 00:09:56,990
Mother!

167
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,670
   

168
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,911
Mother, you ask me to leave

169
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:07,040
but also hate to part with me.

170
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:14,040
Changge,

171
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,238
Biyong Hall is different from here.

172
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:18,920
The servants there are not that meticulous,

173
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,670
so can you take special care of yourself?

174
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,521
When meals don't agree well with you,

175
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:27,520
can you make yourself a few delicious dishes?

176
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:30,800
As your clothes are torn

177
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,210
and I'm not at your side,

178
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:37,330
sew it yourself according to how Nanny San taught you.

179
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:40,630
Put on more clothes,

180
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,160
if it's rainy or snowy.

181
00:10:44,155 --> 00:10:46,410
Mother.

182
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,054
How about I not go

183
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:50,630
and stay with you?

184
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,240
Can I?

185
00:10:55,711 --> 00:10:57,054
No.

186
00:10:57,054 --> 00:10:58,940
Set out at once.

187
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,587
Do not come back without my permission!

188
00:11:01,587 --> 00:11:03,430
Mother.

189
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:06,870
Mother.

190
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:13,440
Fine, I'm leaving.

191
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:24,580
Changge.

192
00:11:25,577 --> 00:11:27,440
Could you...

193
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,140
call me "mother" once again?

194
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,120
Madam.

195
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,250
You hate to part but why do you...

196
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,080
Only in this way can she live a good life.

197
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,450
 The mission will depart tomorrow. 

198
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:09,310
 Shixin Sili, lead a group and ride north 

199
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,459
 and report the situation to Khan. 

200
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:14,930
 I'll stay here to continue exploring. 

201
00:13:34,811 --> 00:13:36,350
Scatter.

202
00:14:22,788 --> 00:14:26,220
   

203
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,800
Close the gate and lock it at once!

204
00:15:02,855 --> 00:15:04,350
 Hurry! 

205
00:15:08,288 --> 00:15:09,410
 Wait. 

206
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,043
 We're not driving northward to leave. 

207
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:13,410
 It's not the way to Biyong. 

208
00:15:14,644 --> 00:15:16,199
Is it the wrong way?

209
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,400
It's not the way to Biyong.

210
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,909
We didn't go wrong.

211
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:21,310
Princess, don't worry.

212
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:25,950
Madam has told me to send you there safely.

213
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,380
 She's been weird since yesterday. 

214
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,843
 Where is she going to send me? 

215
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:32,690
 Hurry! 

216
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,110
Hold on.

217
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,250
She's never treated me in this way before.

218
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,560
She must be keeping something back from me.

219
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,820
   

220
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,670
 Blood? 

221
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:25,890
 What's happened? 

222
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,810
 Where are they? 

223
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,030
 Why is there so much blood here? 

224
00:17:02,211 --> 00:17:04,030
 Why? 

225
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,510
 Why? 

226
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:12,560
 Why is no one here? 

227
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,030
 Mother. 

228
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,210
 Please be safe! 

229
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,220
Follow up!

230
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,620
Hurry!

231
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,470
Keep the pace!

232
00:17:52,344 --> 00:17:53,940
Go!

233
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,332
Hurry up!

234
00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:57,030
Be quick!

235
00:17:59,111 --> 00:18:01,160
 How did it happen? 

236
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,176
 Mother! Mother. 

237
00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:20,070
 Second Uncle? 

238
00:18:50,711 --> 00:18:54,210
Report! Li Jiancheng and his sons are all dead.

239
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:58,360
General Yuchi has gone to guard the emperor.

240
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,390
Guards.

241
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,387
Master.

242
00:19:38,387 --> 00:19:40,254
Ask someone and send it to East Palace.

243
00:19:40,254 --> 00:19:42,521
Be sure to invite Crown Prince to read it.

244
00:19:42,521 --> 00:19:43,510
Yes.

245
00:19:43,511 --> 00:19:44,449
Hurry!

246
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,350
 It's too late. 

247
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,821
Too late.

248
00:19:47,822 --> 00:19:51,054
Xuancheng, it's late.

249
00:19:51,054 --> 00:19:53,170
   

250
00:19:54,844 --> 00:19:56,410
You...

251
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:00,000
   

252
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,660
Leave here.

253
00:20:03,522 --> 00:20:05,560
Xuancheng,

254
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,321
you've persuaded him a lot.

255
00:20:08,321 --> 00:20:10,632
Is it useful to write it?

256
00:20:10,632 --> 00:20:11,910
Why do you come here?

257
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,670
I'm here to save you.

258
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,054
I don't need it.

259
00:20:15,054 --> 00:20:20,421
But why are you going to suggest him again?

260
00:20:20,421 --> 00:20:23,587
The officials should be loyal to their masters.

261
00:20:23,587 --> 00:20:26,487
I should fulfill my duty.

262
00:20:26,488 --> 00:20:28,443
Let me tell you that

263
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:30,643
a loyal official cannot die with his master.

264
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:33,519
You've done your duty.

265
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,160
All your duty.

266
00:20:36,911 --> 00:20:38,340
You!

267
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,220
I'm here to prevent you.

268
00:20:42,222 --> 00:20:44,065
As I'm here,

269
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:47,454
others will think you're under house arrest,

270
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,078
so I can preserve both your reputation

271
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,879
and your life.

272
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,850
- I don't need it! 
 - Xuancheng.

273
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:57,099
Do not let me down.

274
00:20:57,099 --> 00:20:58,510
Get out!

275
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,619
Get out now!

276
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:03,990
You and I cannot leave here today.

277
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,409
Anything strange happened since last night?

278
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:11,776
Prince Qin went to East Palace.

279
00:21:11,777 --> 00:21:13,643
The emperor withdrew from court today.

280
00:21:13,643 --> 00:21:15,176
Xuanwu Gate has been closed.

281
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:18,076
Nearly 300 cavalrymen appeared at the gate.

282
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:21,888
They left after a while.

283
00:21:21,888 --> 00:21:23,843
Who gave the order to close the gate?

284
00:21:23,843 --> 00:21:24,999
Crown Prince's subordinate.

285
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,150
General of Xuanwu Gate Chang He.

286
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:33,270
He controlled the entrance.

287
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,240
General.

288
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,890
We found it outside Xuanwu Gate.

289
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:52,332
It's from Youzhou.

290
00:21:52,332 --> 00:21:55,860
Li Jiancheng commands the army in Youzhou.

291
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,676
As Chang He guarded the gate,

292
00:21:57,676 --> 00:22:01,670
why did he stop Crown Prince's army to enter?

293
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:07,580
Prince Qin is not that simple.

294
00:22:09,322 --> 00:22:14,090
Chang He might have turned the gun round.

295
00:22:18,155 --> 00:22:20,060
Mother.

296
00:22:38,333 --> 00:22:40,120
Mother.

297
00:23:14,911 --> 00:23:16,610
Mother.

298
00:23:17,711 --> 00:23:19,850
Mother.

299
00:23:20,644 --> 00:23:22,770
Mother.

300
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:27,554
What's going on?

301
00:23:27,554 --> 00:23:30,000
Please wake up.

302
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,410
Mother. Mother.

303
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,132
Can you hear me?

304
00:23:34,132 --> 00:23:35,570
Mother...

305
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:38,299
Please wake up. Don't scare me!

306
00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:42,100
Please wake up and see me.

307
00:23:43,788 --> 00:23:46,832
What's happened? What's the matter?

308
00:23:46,832 --> 00:23:50,187
Mother, please respond to me!

309
00:23:50,187 --> 00:23:52,470
Mother.

310
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:58,300
Mother!

311
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,240
Princess.

312
00:24:00,877 --> 00:24:03,888
Princess. Princess.

313
00:24:03,888 --> 00:24:06,940
- Nanny San! 
 - Princess...

314
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,387
What's wrong with you? What's going on?

315
00:24:10,387 --> 00:24:11,621
Mother.

316
00:24:11,622 --> 00:24:12,910
Leave here, Princess.

317
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:15,999
- They... 
 - They... Who are they?

318
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,199
- They... 
 - Tell me.

319
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,770
They're...

320
00:24:19,844 --> 00:24:22,950
- Who are they? 
 - They... 
 - Princess?

321
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,921
Chang He! Save her! Please save my mother!

322
00:24:25,921 --> 00:24:28,065
She's lying there!

323
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,040
Traitor...

324
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,810
Princess! Run!

325
00:24:35,088 --> 00:24:36,440
Princess!

326
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,749
♫   The long ballad is silent; 
 Wielding a double-edge sword without victory   ♫

327
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,954
♫  Longing to live without life; 
 Why should I continue to hope?  ♫

328
00:24:41,955 --> 00:24:44,732
 Uncle's taught me to ride and use swords since I was seven. 

329
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,832
 Thanks for teaching me skills and crafts. 

330
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:48,369
 Of course, I should gift it to you. 

331
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:53,820
♫   Remembering our past, hoping we can forget each other   ♫

332
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,376
♫   The long ballad is silent; 
 Wielding a double-edge sword without victory   ♫

333
00:24:57,377 --> 00:24:59,754
Prince Qin's soldiers are all over here.

334
00:24:59,754 --> 00:25:02,240
I'm afraid you cannot escape.

335
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,576
Leave now!

336
00:25:03,577 --> 00:25:05,139
Princess!

337
00:25:05,139 --> 00:25:06,621
- Princess! 
 - Princess...

338
00:25:06,621 --> 00:25:09,176
All soldiers in Chang'an accept Prince Qin's assignment.

339
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:12,650
- Hurry... 
 - I can't violate. Don't blame it on me!

340
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:15,399
Crown Prince is rendered powerless!

341
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,570
Princess!

342
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,879
Remember what Madam has told you!

343
00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:23,076
You must stay alive!

344
00:25:23,076 --> 00:25:25,850
Must stay alive!

345
00:25:26,599 --> 00:25:27,759
Run!

♫  Memories haunt me. I can't get rid of it  ♫

347
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:38,070
♫  Where is my future? I don't know   ♫

348
00:25:42,011 --> 00:25:43,900
 Don't move! 

349
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,910
 Stay there! 

350
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,600
 Halt! 

351
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,950
 Stop! 

352
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,233
 Stop running! 

353
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:51,687
 Freeze there! 

354
00:25:51,688 --> 00:25:53,720
 Halt! 

355
00:25:53,755 --> 00:25:55,710
 Stop! 

356
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:59,732
 Stay there! Where can you escape? 

357
00:26:04,955 --> 00:26:06,060
 Release! 

358
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:10,270
♫   Life's uncertainty is like a endless dream   ♫

Su Yishe.

361
00:26:15,688 --> 00:26:19,710
Call the scouts together and ask them to spread it in nearby armies,

362
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:23,170
especially those which will soon go north to attack Wu City.

363
00:26:25,733 --> 00:26:29,632
"Crown Prince and Prince Qin died. Execute all their soldiers."

364
00:26:29,632 --> 00:26:33,076
Soldiers in the army are mainly their former soldiers.

365
00:26:33,076 --> 00:26:37,400
As it's spread, trouble may arise.

366
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,900
Then, Khan can be at ease.

367
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,621
- I'll do it at once. 
 - Leave.

368
00:26:56,744 --> 00:26:58,640
Lady!

369
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,144
Lady! Mutinous soldiers have been suppressed.

370
00:27:01,144 --> 00:27:02,621
We're now safe.

371
00:27:02,622 --> 00:27:04,421
Why are there mutinous soldiers?

372
00:27:04,421 --> 00:27:07,310
East Palace. What about East Palace?

373
00:27:07,955 --> 00:27:09,890
What's happened?

374
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,970
Something happened with Changge?

375
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,887
Trouble arises. But Prince Qin has suppressed it.

376
00:27:14,887 --> 00:27:19,270
Crown Prince and Prince Qi have been executed.

377
00:27:21,855 --> 00:27:24,000
What are you saying?

378
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,430
What about Changge?

379
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,750
Princess Yongning escaped while being chased.

380
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,940
She's now missing.

381
00:27:31,699 --> 00:27:33,590
How come...

382
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,370
She told me to wait for her here when she returns.

383
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,940
I won't believe it. It's so weird. I want to see Father.

384
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,760
Lady.

385
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,220
I'm afraid he has no time.

386
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,270
   

387
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:50,932
- Young Master Wei. 
 - How's it going?

388
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:55,098
I asked the guards of Prince Qin about Princess as ordered.

389
00:27:55,098 --> 00:27:59,240
Princess escaped from being chased temporarily but she's missing.

390
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,810
She's clever. As she's escaped, she might be safe now.

391
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:06,458
Well... I'm afraid she won't give up revenge.

392
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:09,932
Keep an eye on it. Report to me when there is any news.

393
00:28:09,932 --> 00:28:11,290
Yes.

394
00:29:12,322 --> 00:29:13,655
 Set out at once. 

395
00:29:13,655 --> 00:29:16,765
 Do not come back without my permission! 

396
00:29:16,765 --> 00:29:18,590
 Fine, I'm leaving. 

397
00:29:21,866 --> 00:29:23,790
 Changge. 

398
00:29:24,611 --> 00:29:26,550
 Could you... 

399
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,980
 call me "mother" once again? 

400
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,500
   

401
00:29:32,422 --> 00:29:34,220
Mother...

402
00:29:37,755 --> 00:29:39,700
I'm sorry...

403
00:29:45,422 --> 00:29:48,740
I will stay alive.

404
00:30:56,466 --> 00:30:58,309
 Am I wrong again? 

405
00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:01,700
 Have there been mice in the building recently? 

406
00:31:16,655 --> 00:31:20,065
Thanks for saving my life. That's very kind of you.

407
00:31:20,065 --> 00:31:22,949
I wasn't saving you. I was afraid I would be implicated.

408
00:31:22,949 --> 00:31:27,010
Sir, do you hide here because you're homeless?

409
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,000
You can sleep on my treasured bed.

410
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,260
It's soft and aromatic, thick and spacious. No one will disturb you!

411
00:31:47,733 --> 00:31:51,060
Is it the soft, aromatic, and treasured bed?

412
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,639
You can have a try.

413
00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,210
It's soft and thick with the aroma of straws.

414
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,421
Smells good!

415
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:04,832
Remember not to snore. It'll bring people here.

416
00:32:06,677 --> 00:32:10,543
Come on! Have a try! Sit.

417
00:32:12,455 --> 00:32:14,799
Sir, what's your name?

418
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,354
Are you from Chang'an? Or are you from a foreign land?

419
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:19,100
Why did you come to Chang'an?

420
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,999
Sir, do you dislike chatting?

421
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,443
Where did you learn your skills?

422
00:32:22,444 --> 00:32:24,659
Why did you learn it? To help the weak

423
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:26,560
or dominate the world?

424
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:31,250
You'll lose your tongue with one more sentence.

425
00:32:32,955 --> 00:32:36,510
Sir, I have only one last question. Trust me!

426
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,318
As you're homeless, I think you may have no money.

427
00:32:41,318 --> 00:32:43,110
Shall we...

428
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,710
As you're good at skills,

429
00:32:44,711 --> 00:32:47,421
shall we go to steal the funeral objects of the Madam of East Palace?

430
00:32:47,422 --> 00:32:51,421
There must be countless treasures.

431
00:32:51,422 --> 00:32:53,860
Whose funeral objects?

432
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,900
It's hearsay.

433
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,410
The Madam of East Palace.

434
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,370
Where's that place?

435
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,655
Tell me!

436
00:33:02,655 --> 00:33:04,165
Rongen Temple.

437
00:33:04,165 --> 00:33:07,599
Sir, why are you so nervous?

438
00:33:10,077 --> 00:33:13,510
Sir, what's the matter with you?

439
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:23,410
   

440
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,632
I heard Prince Qin was rewarding his soldiers.

441
00:33:31,632 --> 00:33:34,100
Even the horse grooms.

442
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:38,599
We really have had the luck to be appointed here to guard the body.

443
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:42,176
We're really simpletons to seek refuge with Prince Qin.

444
00:33:42,176 --> 00:33:46,670
It's already good for us to save ourselves.

445
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:50,430
By the way, where's our meal?

446
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,300
That's right.

447
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:11,399
Officers, here's the food box from Pinxiang Store.

448
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:13,065
Who can sign for it?

449
00:34:13,065 --> 00:34:14,433
Pinxiang Store?

450
00:34:14,433 --> 00:34:16,600
- Who ordered? 
 - I don't know.

451
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,287
- Who asked you to come? 
 - I'm on duty to deliver. The customer didn't leave a note.

452
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:31,140
It's said that it's worth 20 liang.

453
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,810
Officers, it can't be shelved for long.

454
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,176
If it's not yours,

455
00:34:35,177 --> 00:34:36,733
- I'll send it back. 
 - Hold on!

456
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:39,554
It's worth 20 liang.

457
00:34:39,555 --> 00:34:42,210
Shall we...

458
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,632
Be careful, be safe.

459
00:34:46,632 --> 00:34:48,970
We can't go wrong again.

460
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:53,220
You! Try one!

461
00:35:02,977 --> 00:35:05,560
Really? Can I?

462
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,843
I'd like this one.

463
00:35:07,844 --> 00:35:09,110
No.

464
00:35:09,111 --> 00:35:10,910
Eat this one.

465
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,650
Hold on! The former one.

466
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,930
Have you decided?

467
00:35:21,755 --> 00:35:23,970
It melts in my mouth.

468
00:35:23,977 --> 00:35:25,399
Smooth and tasty!

469
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,232
It's the best pastry in Pinxiang Store!

470
00:35:27,232 --> 00:35:29,100
Pretty nice! Officer, can I...

471
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,590
No. It's enough.

472
00:35:35,455 --> 00:35:37,855
Delicious. High quality.

473
00:35:37,855 --> 00:35:40,340
I think I'm eating money.

You wanted me to get rid of hate...

490
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:58,600
Had you predicted your end before?

491
00:39:00,644 --> 00:39:04,900
But Mother... Father and you met a violent end

492
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,021
and servants of East Palace were imprisoned.

493
00:39:07,022 --> 00:39:10,010
Grandfather pretended to be ignorant of it,

494
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:14,670
and all the officials looked on and did nothing.

495
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:19,890
If you hadn't sent me out of the palace,

496
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:25,180
I might have been killed by them too.

497

♫   Joy and sorrow can fades within a flash   ♫

505
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,610
   

506
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,566
Now the rumor has spread.

507
00:40:24,566 --> 00:40:29,958
I'm afraid it's useless for Your Highness to swear

508
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:33,630
or ask His Majesty's help.

509
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:37,238
What a malicious rumor!

510
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:39,429
Someone must want to stir up trouble,

511
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:42,199
causing the friction between you

512
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,021
and the generals of Li Yuanji and Li Jiancheng.

513
00:40:45,022 --> 00:40:48,450
You should make a decision as soon as possible.

514
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:52,887
Your Highness, the suburban army is the main force to support Wu City.

515
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:54,443
We can't move it so easily.

516
00:40:54,443 --> 00:40:59,232
What about inviting the general to come in the name of giving out awards?

517
00:40:59,232 --> 00:41:02,876
Separate soldiers and their generals and then handle them.

518
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:06,399
If they're to be malicious, how could they come?

519
00:41:06,399 --> 00:41:10,232
If they refuse, it shows their wild ambitions.

520
00:41:10,232 --> 00:41:14,254
It will only alarm them and trigger a war.

521
00:41:14,254 --> 00:41:18,365
I think you'd better solve it at once, strictly and rapidly.

522
00:41:18,365 --> 00:41:19,821
I don't agree.

523
00:41:19,821 --> 00:41:24,788
I think you'd better part and rope them in, slowly and gently.

524
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,050
   

525
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,933
- Let's wait and see. 
 - Your Highness!

526
00:41:31,933 --> 00:41:35,450
That will do for the present.

527
00:41:40,788 --> 00:41:42,232
- Commander Hao! 
 - Commander Hao!

528
00:41:42,232 --> 00:41:43,910
Someone poisoned us.

529
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,040
Please forgive us.

530
00:41:46,644 --> 00:41:48,722
Who did it?

531
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:49,855
A common man.

532
00:41:49,855 --> 00:41:52,243
He was clean-cut and brought us pastries from Pinxiang Store.

533
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:54,770
We didn't eat it until he finished eating safely...

534
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,820
Please forgive us!

535
00:42:01,755 --> 00:42:03,370
Anything else?

536
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:07,350
No... nothing... We fainted after having it.

537
00:42:09,088 --> 00:42:10,177
Commander Hao.

538
00:42:10,177 --> 00:42:13,254
We've examined the sacrificial tablet and tributes of the Madam of East Palace.

539
00:42:13,254 --> 00:42:15,040
Nothing is missing.

540
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,600
Father.

541
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,329
Sorry for letting Father be startled by the poisoning case.

542
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:29,700
It's not a normal case.

543
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,140
It happened around the Madam of East Palace.

544
00:42:34,711 --> 00:42:36,340
Father, here you are.

545
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,920
They were poisoned to faint after eating these.

546
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,450
Besides, nothing was stolen.

547
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:49,998
The guy dares to poison the emperor's soldiers but steals nothing.

548
00:42:49,998 --> 00:42:52,480
It seems to be our old friend.
