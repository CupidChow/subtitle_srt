♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,860
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:14,830
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,830
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:24,950
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,780
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

20
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,479
   

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,200
   

22
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:44,119
Uncle, are you all right?

23
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:45,520
Water.

24
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,680
- Water? 
 - Water.

25
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,659
Done.

26
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,600
   

27
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:27,400
You killed the Prince of Lujiang?

28
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,619
I've killed the Prince of Lujiang, Li Yuan,

29
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:34,260
for betrayal and causing turbulence.

30
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,660
How could you kill your own master for survival?

31
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:40,820
Junkuo is Prince of Lujiang's subordinate,

32
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,319
so I followed his order of betrayal.

33
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,180
But this was against my will.

34
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,500
Now I've killed the traitor in person.

35
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,060
I hope... I can atone my crime by this.

36
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,560
Where is Shuyu?

37
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:00,659
Envoy Wei was hurt by the subordinates of the Prince of Lujiang.

38
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:02,499
- I asked someone to take good care of him. 
 - You...

39
00:03:02,499 --> 00:03:06,019
Now he is receiving treatment in the room.

40
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,980
Envoy Wei?

41
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,479
General Shen, I have a contribution to our court.

42
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:18,000
Do you know the identity of the person who has just left?

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,619
- She's the daughter of the traitor Li Jiancheng. 
 - Take hold of Wang Junkuo!

44
00:03:20,619 --> 00:03:22,919
- Yes. 
 - Shen Gu! You...

45
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,779
The Prince of Lujiang rose in rebellion, now take all the people in his house for trial.

46
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:28,240
Shen Gu!

47
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,080
I offered advice for your own sake. I didn't expect you to not be able to tell good from the bad. 
    

48
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,160
Shut his mouth!

49
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,639
 I won't let you go! 

50
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,319
Changge, why are you here?

51
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,979
Luckily you are okay.

52
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:50,340
Yueyan is waiting for you in the post house.

53
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,640
I didn't know why, but Wang Junkuo suddenly let me go

54
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,619
and found a doctor for me.

55
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:57,619
Hao Du lit the beacon.

56
00:03:57,619 --> 00:03:59,390
Meanwhile, I used your name

57
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,600
and asked the general at the defense station outside the city for help.

58
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,700
Wang Junkuo killed his master for survival when he felt danger.

59
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,220
What?

60
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:08,499
I've done all I should.

61
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:09,739
Take good care of Yueyan.

62
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:11,999
Promise me you'll send her back safely.

63
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,078
Changge, once you hold the seal of the crown prince, Hao Du will...

64
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,720
It doesn't belong to Li Shimin, nor has it ever.

65
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,840
I just took something that belongs to me.

66
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:39,759
Master, how was it?

67
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,339
Go.

68
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,770
- Remember to be careful! 
 - Yes!

69
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,780
   

70
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,710
   

71
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,618
According to the command as the Aide of the Crown Prince, I'm here to capture the betrayers.

72
00:04:59,618 --> 00:05:02,320
I'm the general of the city wall of You State, Shen Gu.

73
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,939
Envoy Wei has already reported.

74
00:05:03,939 --> 00:05:05,619
We are dealing with the aftermath.

75
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:06,599
Envoy Wei?

76
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,379
Thanks to his arrival in time, or else the consequences would have been unbearable.

77
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:13,579
But sadly, the Prince of Lujiang was killed by Wang Junkuo.

78
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,820
The best statement has vanished.

79
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,540
   

80
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,710
   

81
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,689
Master, the one who wants to capture you from the court comes again.

82
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:45,399
Come here, all of you!

83
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,260
Wait a minute!

84
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:55,140
What are you going to do with Wang Junkuo?

85
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,358
Please allow me to report to our court and follow the instruction.

86
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:01,600
In case of any accident, I've locked him up in my camp.

87
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,639
Wang Junkuo is quite shrewd with many subordinates.

88
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,899
We must stop him from escaping.

89
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:08,920
Thank you, General.

90
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,170
   

91
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,259
Who are you? Why do you catch me?

92
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:22,809
- Why is it a kid? 
 - Who are you?

93
00:06:22,809 --> 00:06:24,998
Why do you push me? I'm a great benefactor!

94
00:06:24,998 --> 00:06:26,859
I went miles to the camp for the relief troops at night.

95
00:06:26,859 --> 00:06:28,439
Report what I did to the government!

96
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:29,759
I'm waiting for the reward!

97
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,079
I led the army of counter-insurgency and swept away the traitor in You State!

98
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:34,399
- Search! 
 - Yes!

99
00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:20,580
Where is Changge?

100
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:24,180
You're asking me?

101
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,560
No. I need to chase her back.

102
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,920
- She still has the seal. 
 - Good, you know that!

103
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:33,000
If it can't be found, neither of us can go back to Chang'an.

104
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,400
Stand up now!

105
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,759
Catch her back with me!

106
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:46,940
Is it okay that your friend is still in the city?

107
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,749
I've confirmed with him that I'll make marks along my way.

108
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:52,380
He will find me once he gets rid of the danger.

109
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:55,420
Thank you, General Shen, for saving my life.

110
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,779
I can't accept your salut, Princess.

111
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:01,259
How did you know?

112
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:04,319
The temperament brought up among the palace from childhood

113
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,279
is hard to simulated by others.

114
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:10,239
It's said that Princess Yongning hasn't been found till now.

115
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,780
Besides, I was the subordinate of the crown prince.

116
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,779
How can I fail to recognize you?

117
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:16,759
Just now, Wang Junkuo wanted to expose your identity,

118
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,840
which further proved my speculation.

119
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,200
Therefore, why don't you go with me?

120
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,120
Now the entire You State has been under Li Shimin's control.

121
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:29,019
He will never let go of my father's old fellows like you.

122
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:33,440
You should leave with me for the next plan instead of waiting for the consequences.

123
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,358
I'm a soldier, so I can't take action before the command.

124
00:08:36,359 --> 00:08:38,380
General Shen,

125
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,499
You State is totally controlled by Du Ruhui.

126
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:44,859
We can't get even a corner of You State back.

127
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,759
Are you waiting for death here?

128
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,600
What's more, I've got the seal of the crown prince.

129
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,619
Do you really think that an item can call up the army?

130
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,299
I'm helping you as payback to the crown prince for his recognition of my capability.

131
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:00,859
This is my private thought.

132
00:09:00,859 --> 00:09:05,019
Before I was the crown prince's previous subordinate, I'm a general of Great Tang.

133
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:07,840
Now, the Ashile Tribe's army is ready to move to the north.

134
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,499
You State is a crucial town in the north with millions of people.

135
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:15,640
My duty is to keep the land of You State safe and sound.

136
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,000
If you can't understand this, Your Highness,

137
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,610
whatever you've got is useless.

138
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,478
Although I disagree with your words, everyone has their own ambitions.

139
00:09:27,478 --> 00:09:29,640
I've learned something anyway.

140
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,279
Your Highness, quickly go!

141
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,399
Or else, their army will catch up to us,

142
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,000
I can't protect you at that time!

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,559
I can't stay in You State anymore.

144
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:43,040
I can't believe that I have nowhere to stay in such a big world.

145
00:09:44,359 --> 00:09:46,980
Toward the northwest. Go to Shuo State.

146
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,620
It's a separate place between Great Tang and the grasslands.

147
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:53,840
It's beyond the court's control.

148
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,060
Thank you, General Shen.

149
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,280
Your Highness, take care of yourself.

150
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:01,520
See you.

151
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,160
Young Khan, enough!

152
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,459
The horses will die of exhaustion if you keep riding them.

153
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,380
Did you say the bastard was gone?

154
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,380
Why did he come back again?

155
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:09,699
I can't let it go so easily.

156
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:11,479
I've observed

157
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:13,740
that there is no track of any army.

158
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,659
He came and went back by himself!

159
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:17,419
Young Khan, what are you going to do?

160
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:20,400
He dared bite me. Why can't I bite him?

161
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,558
You should report to Khan in his tent immediately.

162
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:25,300
If you spend too much time on your way back,

163
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,580
Great Khan would possibly suspect you.

164
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,679
Stop telling me what I should do and what I shouldn't.

165
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:33,420
Do you think you are my father?

166
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,478
I don't care if the Great Khan will suspect me.

167
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:41,019
Can I suffer this injustice in silence?

168
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:44,179
Great Khan led his army toward Shuo State.

169
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:47,080
Eagle Division should be in the north of Shuo State.

170
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,980
This way.

171
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,139
We're able to speculate that he chose this route.

172
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:53,459
Ashile Sun may also know it himself.

173
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:56,359
Right. Is it possible for them to go toward the south?

174
00:11:57,599 --> 00:12:00,299
Since you've thought of it, how could he fail to realize?

175
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,199
That bastard is always quite tricky.

176
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,359
He keeps manipulating me,

177
00:12:04,359 --> 00:12:07,479
so he must know I can figure out he wanted to go this way.

178
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,478
But he has to complete the Great Khan's command.

179
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:14,479
If he went in this way, his task will be delayed.

180
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,020
He usually completes the Great Khan's command at all cost,

181
00:12:20,659 --> 00:12:23,080
so he must have gone towards the north.

182
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,659
Besides, I think he must have chosen the main road deliberately.

183
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:29,280
If so, we should go to the main road to stop him. Speed up!

184
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,739
Stop him in the pathway.

185
00:12:30,739 --> 00:12:31,699
Why?

186
00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:35,200
Because I think if I can figure out his choice of the main road,

187
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,740
he can definitely think of my speculation.

188
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,039
I bet this time he can think of it as well.

189
00:13:04,219 --> 00:13:07,779
General Shen, do you want to shield the criminal of the court?

190
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:10,840
Criminal? Who is it?

191
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,999
The traitor Wang Junkuo has been locked in our prison.

192
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:15,519
But you two...

193
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,719
In this turbulent place, I can't believe you only by a Fish Token.

194
00:13:19,719 --> 00:13:22,399
Currently, the rebellion in You State hasn't been pacified.

195
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,560
No spy is allowed to escape out of the city.

196
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,059
It seems that you won't let us go today.

197
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:30,880
Yes, so what?

198
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,800
It is impossible for both of us to break through by General Shen's solid guard.

199
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,860
One of us has to make a sacrifice.

200
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:38,880
My martial skills are better than yours. After you.

201
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,980
Be careful!

202
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,019
Move!

203
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,480
I knew that the Wolf Division couldn't find you.

204
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,618
But when you thought you were safe, you must show up.

205
00:15:02,618 --> 00:15:04,119
How's my strategy?

206
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:05,740
Not bad.

207
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,079
Combative loser.

208
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,100
Admirable courage.

209
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:24,980
Who allowed you to slash him?

210
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,979
My duty is to protect you instead of putting you in danger.

211
00:15:28,979 --> 00:15:30,520
I...

212
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,639
The key point of ambush is targeting in the first attack.

213
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,279
Now the prey has been alerted and not easy to be caught.

214
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,100
Let's go.

215
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,459
We have to go back for reporting.

216
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,420
Stop.

217
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,279
You should keep chasing him.

218
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,499
We can't let go of him so easily.

219
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:18,000
Changge. Give it up!

220
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,939
Didn't you learn your lesson from the You State's matter?

221
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,460
How long are you going to escape?

222
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:26,999
Changge. I, Wei Shuyu, swear to the heavens

223
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,019
that I'll definitely save your life at all costs.

224
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:33,958
Even though the consequences can't be reversed, I'll die together with you.

225
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:38,740
No matter on earth or the netherworld, I will be with you.

226
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,759
I will no longer trust anyone.

227
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:49,159
And I won't stay for anyone.

228
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:52,359
But you still have the seal of the crown prince.

229
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:56,160
They won't give up chasing you before they get it back.

230
00:16:58,479 --> 00:17:01,099
Envoy Wei's flattery

231
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,238
is just for getting the seal of the crown prince back,

232
00:17:03,239 --> 00:17:05,499
so that you can complete your task.

233
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,160
Changge.

234
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:18,060
Wei Shuyu,

235
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,339
listen carefully.

236
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:26,179
From today on, we have severed our ties and no more than strangers.

237
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,000
Considering our acquaintance,

238
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,619
I'll give you another merit to report.

239
00:17:38,619 --> 00:17:41,090
This is nothing but an item.

240
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,219
People won't follow its direction.

241
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:47,940
I will make my own plan from now on.

242
00:18:48,239 --> 00:18:52,100
Shen Gu, you hid the criminal of the court secretly.

243
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,539
When I'm back to Chang'an, I will report it to the crown prince.

244
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:57,260
I bet he'll punish you by the military law!

245
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,338
Sir, don't be annoyed.

246
00:19:03,338 --> 00:19:06,279
General Shen said that you have been proven not to be the spy after verification.

247
00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:08,800
He asked me to apologize to you.

248
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:14,559
By the way, someone called Envoy Wei has been outside.

249
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:20,419
Sir, this way, please.

250
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,240
Please.

251
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,050
Did you let Li Changge run away again?

252
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,279
The seal of the crown prince is here.

253
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,000
We can go back to Chang'an for reporting.

254
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:46,900
   

255
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:51,499
I want both: the seal of the crown prince and Li Changge.

256
00:19:51,499 --> 00:19:54,560
Wei Shuyu, where are you going?

257
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,480
Her Highness is still waiting at the post house.

258
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,159
Good girl, what's your name?

259
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,579
Who on earth are you?

260
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:34,039
If my friend can't see me when he is back,

261
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,899
he'll come and look for me.

262
00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:39,199
At that time, you will get into trouble.

263
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:41,859
Great, let them find me.

264
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:45,799
Girl, people should learn what is contentment;

265
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:48,440
or else, they may lose their lives.

266
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:53,500
I'm asking again. What's your name?

267
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,720
Tell him.

268
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,650
I'm Yueyan.

269
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,560
Good, you are clever.

270
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,479
Just call me Elder Hai.

271
00:21:25,479 --> 00:21:28,369
You should behave nicely from now on.

272
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:32,730
I will sell you to a nice family at a high price.

273
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,880
If you are indocile,

274
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,280
you will be sold to someone who might take your limbs.

275
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,919
I was kidnapped, too.

276
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,180
Those two are human traders.

277
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,478
Human... traders?

278
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:52,500
Someone who'd kidnap women and kids for sale.

279
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,260
Sale?

280
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,519
Where would they be sold?

281
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,999
Why would someone take our limbs?

282
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,419
They will cut down people's arms and legs and make them beg.

283
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:14,160
Yueyan, we can survive only by helping each other in this condition.

284
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,779
Got it?

285
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,739
Yueyan.

286
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,719
Yueyan?

287
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,600
Where is Her Highness?

288
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,759
Where is the guest who lived in this room?

289
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,758
I... I don't know. This room is alway quiet.

290
00:22:59,199 --> 00:23:01,060
Everything valuable has been lost.

291
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:04,238
But there is no mark of fighting in the room.

292
00:23:04,239 --> 00:23:05,979
Her Highness wouldn't have left by herself.

293
00:23:05,979 --> 00:23:09,539
The sole possibility is that she was beaten and kidnapped.

294
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,000
Wei Shuyu? Wei Shuyu!

295
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,598
You should pack up as soon as possible.

296
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,919
Go back to Chang'an and report the intelligence in You State

297
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,400
and the news that Her Highness has disappeared.

298
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,800
No.

299
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,599
- I have to find Yueyan back. 
 - Let me remind you for the last time!

300
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:29,220
Now your task is to send the intelligence back to Chang'an.

301
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,899
Yueyan has disappeared, so why are we still talking about the task now?

302
00:23:31,899 --> 00:23:33,399
She knows little about You State,

303
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,358
and it's near the border of the battlefield in the north.

304
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:38,229
Yueyan is a royal, innocent, and weak.

305
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,619
Now, she's left outside the palace.

306
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,200
Our most important task is finding her back.

307
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,740
Shut up, Wei Shuyu!

308
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,399
Tell me! Who should be blamed for the disappearance of the princess?

309
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:48,439
Who let her go with us?

310
00:23:48,439 --> 00:23:49,799
Who promised confidently

311
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,279
that he'd be fully responsible for the princess's safety.

312
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,740
Right, I said I would hold responsibility,

313
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,020
so I must completely fulfill my promise.

314
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,559
Just report it to His Highness,

315
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:01,200
I will give up my life to find Her Highness.

316
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,700
If she's got any injury,

317
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,139
I'll atone my guilt by suicide.

318
00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:08,839
Wei Shuyu,

319
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:11,619
remember what your purpose is for coming to You State.

320
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:14,439
What's more important, finding her by yourself

321
00:24:14,439 --> 00:24:17,360
or His Highness sending troops to search which way is faster?

322
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,120
The mark left by my master!

323
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:57,459
Your Highness.

324
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,000
The smoke of wolves' dung has been fully put out.

325
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,559
You State has been pacified.

326
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,759
Envoy Wei is on his way back to the capital.

327
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:04,999
That's perfect.

328
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:17,359
Your Highness, there are many of Li Jiancheng's old subordinates

329
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:19,659
in the ares like Hebei and Shandong.

330
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:21,999
If we indulge them guarding in their current position,

331
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,700
that equals to asking for trouble and destruction.

332
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,120
If so, the story of You State will be followed in those places sooner or later.

333
00:25:29,479 --> 00:25:30,718
What do you mean?

334
00:25:30,719 --> 00:25:33,639
The generals were commanded to be there for defending Hebei

335
00:25:33,639 --> 00:25:35,439
from the pirates of the grasslands.

336
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:39,630
Do you want to withdraw

337
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,390
all the military power from them?

338
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:44,419
Advisor Wei, if you have any better method,

339
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:47,840
I'm very glad to hear it.

340
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:49,260
Remember?

341
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,300
The envoy who went to You State is from the Wei family.

342
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,159
The Prince of Lujiang hasn't come back with him.

343
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,119
What's worse is that he rebelled.

344
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:02,320
What a talent Young Master Wei is?

345
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:14,240
Your Highness, I didn't teach my son well.

346
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,180
I beg for your forgiveness.

347
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,530
When he comes back, except for the punishment from the government,

348
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,820
I will punish him with my family's rule.

349
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,380
But the news of You State

350
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,480
influences the overall situation of our country.

351
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,240
I strongly suggest

352
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,439
not suppressing the general

353
00:26:29,439 --> 00:26:31,619
in case of causing anxiety amongst our people.

354
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:34,438
I've defended Hebei with Jiancheng,

355
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:37,679
and now I'm willing to go again for Li Jiancheng,

356
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,060
the previous subordinates of Li Yuanji.

357
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,220
Mr. Wei.

358
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,039
Your Highness, if you believe me,

359
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,619
I will set off tomorrow to the north.

360
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:48,920
Your Highness,

361
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,399
I hope you can convince the people by benevolence.

362
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:54,419
Okay.

363
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:56,170
I will authorize you

364
00:26:56,170 --> 00:27:00,030
the full right to complete the task in Hebei.

365
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,899
This trip is long and complicated,

366
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:05,900
you can take action as you like.

367
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,700
No need to ask for approval.

368
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,539
Thanks, Your Highness.

369
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:26,300
If he refuses to come back,

370
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,490
I will execute him

371
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:33,330
for our nation no matter where he is.

372
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,139
Duke Du, you are just reluctant to admit.

373
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:39,378
You deliberately mentioned the execution of the generals and his son,

374
00:27:39,378 --> 00:27:42,920
forcing him to propose going to the north for His Highness.

375
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,939
Yes, I did, so what?

376
00:27:44,939 --> 00:27:46,519
Poor Wei Zheng,

377
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,180
look how naive he is.

378
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,879
He thought if he had not paid any effort,

379
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,198
you would definitely apply for the punishment to the general.

380
00:27:54,199 --> 00:27:58,540
How could you not ride the horse you've got with great effort,

381
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,478
but keep it in the stable as a pet?

382
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,039
It sounds reasonable.

383
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:13,759
Why do I always see you in the firewood house or a shabby room?

384
00:29:14,379 --> 00:29:16,360
Why are you here?

385
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,560
I should ask you this question.

386
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,060
Not anyone is as wealthy as you, Boss.

387
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:29,339
How did you get hurt?

388
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:35,799
What are you doing?

389
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,560
Bandaging the wound.

390
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,180
Quickly!

391
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,280
Ask whatever you want.

392
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,960
It seems you're eager to know.

393
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:20,660
How did you get hurt?

394
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,660
Where are the horses from?

395
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,700
Cut the excuses about the horses.

396
00:30:26,499 --> 00:30:28,720
You want to know about me, right?

397
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:30,280
Right.

398
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,080
Yes, I live in the Ashile Tribe of the grasslands.

399
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,420
I won't deny this.

400
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,019
Since you know Young Khan of the Ashile Tribe,

401
00:30:39,019 --> 00:30:41,360
were you involved in his plan

402
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,619
to steal from the You State Treasury together with Wang Junkuo?

403
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:47,500
The only thing I can tell you is

404
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,939
that I was hurt by the people of Young Khan.

405
00:30:49,939 --> 00:30:52,639
You could stop the carriage of the warehouse

406
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:54,680
because I secretly broke it in advance.

407
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,320
It's really you that did it!

408
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:03,140
Who on earth are you?

409
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,660
A'Zhun.

410
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,639
Since you don't want to tell me, I won't keep asking anymore.

411
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:14,539
I just took you as an unscrupulous merchant.

412
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,220
But seeing you die without doing any favor is not my style.

413
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,900
Where are you going after leaving You State?

414
00:31:29,339 --> 00:31:30,999
That I can't tell you.

415
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:35,660
There are only two roads to go from here:

416
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,400
one is to Shuo State, the other is to the grasslands.

417
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,100
You wouldn't go to the grasslands, would you?

418
00:31:44,859 --> 00:31:46,519
Don't go to Shuo State.

419
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,840
Why?

420
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:53,019
That's the border area close to the grasslands while far from the Tang Kingdom.

421
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:56,080
Besides, these years,

422
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,100
the war never stops there.

423
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:01,540
You should take good care of yourself first.

424
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:03,520
I'm serious.

425
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,700
You should leave as soon as possible. It's not safe here.

426
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,600
If anyone asks, just say you've never seen me.

427
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,660
Is it okay for you to be alone?

428
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,180
Don't worry, it's not likely for me to die easily.

429
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,520
Wait.

430
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:36,400
Don't live in such a shabby place next time.

431
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,320
I don't need any handouts.

432
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,040
I'm lending it to you.

433
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,719
I'll wait for you to return it later.

434
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:49,079
Thank you, Boss.

435
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:58,819
See you, Shisi.

436
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,760
No,

437
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,800
Princess Yongning.

438
00:33:16,939 --> 00:33:19,079
It's fine to get it back.

439
00:33:19,719 --> 00:33:23,119
Grant Hao Du and Envoy Wei abundant rewards.

440
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:25,379
Thanks, Your Highness.

441
00:33:25,379 --> 00:33:27,980
According to Changge's character,

442
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,060
she wouldn't hand it over so easily.

443
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,479
Is Changge okay?

444
00:33:31,479 --> 00:33:36,720
Princess Yongning handed it over and ran away successfully.

445
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,840
Fine. Stop producing more conflict.

446
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,119
Just wind up the case about Yongning.

447
00:33:47,819 --> 00:33:50,480
I have another thing to report.

448
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,339
Another thing about Changge?

449
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:55,340
It's about Princess Yongan.

450
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,580
What's wrong with Yueyan?

451
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,979
Princess Yongan went to You State with the army

452
00:34:09,979 --> 00:34:12,279
but an accident occurred in You State.

453
00:34:12,279 --> 00:34:15,239
Young Master Wei was locked by Wang Junkuo.

454
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:19,718
Hao Du went to rescue him while Princess Yongan waited at the post house.

455
00:34:19,718 --> 00:34:24,539
However, after the battle ended and they went back,

456
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:27,120
Princess Yongan disappeared.

457
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:32,880
Your Highness, I've asked people nearby

458
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,660
to search her whereabouts.

459
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:42,680
Young Master Wei proposed to search Princess Yongan because of his guilt.

460
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,430
Do you think...

461
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:47,840
it is necessary to call him back for condemnation?

462
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,500
Forget it.

463
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:09,539
Just believe that he will try his best to find Yan'er back.

464
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,289
Announce that Princess Yongan has gottaen a strange disease,

465
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:17,840
so she's still taking the treatment in Luoyang.

466
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,018
No information is allowed to be leaked.

467
00:35:20,018 --> 00:35:24,760
Please be assured, Your Highness, I will arrange it well.

468
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,380
Keming,

469
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:30,240
you may leave now.

470
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,399
Leave me alone.

471
00:35:33,399 --> 00:35:35,439
Okay, Your Highness.

472
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,699
Yueyan, you dropped your food.

473
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:19,580
Pick it up.

474
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,240
I'll eat it if you don't.

475
00:36:38,439 --> 00:36:42,300
Slow down. I won't fight it from you.

476
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,939
You are so nice to me.

477
00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:50,930
We are good friends from now on. Let's share the happiness.

478
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:52,670
Sister Yueyan, I'm thirsty.

479
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,850
Let me drink your water.

480
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:09,200
Elder Hai, can you give me some more water?

481
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,680
I've provided you with food and drink for today but you didn't have it.

482
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,079
It's not my fault.

483
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,320
   

484
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,760
Fang Yi!

485
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,820
Your Highness.

486
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,620
Do you have any information about Yueyan?

487
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,089
I've arranged for more people to search for Her Highness in each county and prefecture.

488
00:37:56,089 --> 00:38:00,320
But there has been no news so far.

489
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,520
 Yan'er, you are mild and weak. 

490
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,870
 As your father, 

491
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:20,460
  I'm quite worried about you staying outside the palace alone. 

492
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:25,059
 Water. 

493
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:42,479
 Water. 

494
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,299
 Yueyan. 

495
00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:00,020
 Water. 

496
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,360
 Yueyan. 

497
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:07,639
 Brother Shuyu. 

498
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:11,940
 Brother Shuyu, you're here to rescue me! 

499
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,180
Don't smudge my carriage if you want to seek death.

500
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,020
Who's Brother Shuyu?

501
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:38,599
How about seizing your Brother Shuyu here to be your companion?

502
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:42,459
No. I beg you, don't do harm to Brother Shuyu.

503
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,039
You've been missing for several days.

504
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:51,240
Your Brother Shuyu didn't come to rescue you.

505
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,479
Did he find a new lover?

506
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,860
How much do you want?

507
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,480
I can give you as much as you want.

508
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,360
Just release me.

509
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,939
The lady from a wealthy family is less likely to be released.

510
00:40:06,939 --> 00:40:10,618
If I let you go, that means I'm asking them to capture me.

511
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:14,078
No. They won't, I promise. They won't.

512
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,259
Elder Hai, I'm begging you.

513
00:40:16,259 --> 00:40:19,899
- Please let me go. 
 - It's time for me to rest.

514
00:40:19,899 --> 00:40:23,499
If you keep making noises, I'll cut out your tongue.

515
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,360
Shu... Shu...

516
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,759
Nice. You've become wiser.

517
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,120
Stop.

518
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:30,100
 Yueyan, where are you? 

519
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,060
   

520
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,220
 Sachets! 

521
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,819
They are playing balls.

522
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:10,630
 Buy one for your kid. 

523
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:17,719
 Catch it! 

524
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:25,080
 Shuo State is located in an isolated border area and has suffered years of war. 

525
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,579
 How could it be prosperous like this? 

526
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:31,398
I'm Gongsun Heng from Shuo State. You bandits, surrender now!

527
00:42:31,398 --> 00:42:33,320
 Gongsun Heng? 

528
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:35,918
- No. 
 - Please, just some food.

529
00:42:35,918 --> 00:42:37,918
- Drink it. 
 - Thank you. Thanks.

530
00:42:37,918 --> 00:42:39,420
Take it.

531
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,999
 Even in the most bustling city, Chang'an... 

532
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,039
 Thank you so much. 

533
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,600
 Such a peaceful scene can't be seen.
