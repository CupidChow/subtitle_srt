22
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,744
My son told me that Princess Yongning

23
00:01:39,744 --> 00:01:43,440
went to Ashile Tribe before the negotiations.

24
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,310
So you think it's Changge?

25
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:54,470
I have no idea about it.

26
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:59,071
But I believe if she knew about the assassination,

27
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:02,180
she'd try her best to save you.

28
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,840
If she really did so,

29
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:14,030
I will owe her even more.

30
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,090
Have you ever seen this lady?

31
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,400
<i>No...</i>

32
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,805
<i>We've never seen her.</i>

33
00:02:42,805 --> 00:02:44,990
<i>No.</i>

34
00:02:46,522 --> 00:02:49,720
Sir, we haven't seen her.

35
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,530
Only your group set off from Yunzhou.

36
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,000
How can you haven't seen her?

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,676
Sir, please listen to me.

38
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:00,880
See how far have we walked?

39
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,539
Some of us refused to walk halfway.

40
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,454
Some chose to join another group.

41
00:03:05,455 --> 00:03:08,379
And some... We don't know where they have gone.

42
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:10,932
<i>- He's right.</i>
- So how can we know where she is?

43
00:03:10,932 --> 00:03:13,499
Am I right? Do you agree?

44
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:15,129
We haven't seen her.

45
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,229
<i>He's right...</i>

46
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,899
<i>- I don't know her.
- I haven't seen her.</i>

47
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,040
<i>Same with me.</i>

48
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,969
Enough. It's getting dark. Let's go on our way.

49
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,050
<i>Let's go.</i>

50
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,720
<i>Princess, where are you?</i>

51
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,140
<i>[World Peace]</i>

52
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,565
Your Majesty, scouts have found out the source of the arrow.

53
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:10,011
Who's its owner?

54
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:14,630
An elite from Young Khan's Wolf Division of Ashile Tribe.

55
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,658
Yanli has reprimanded him.

56
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:21,650
And now they've gone back to the grasslands.

57
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:37,129
Young Master Wei, what do you think of the news?

58
00:04:39,955 --> 00:04:43,476
Don't be nervous. It's a chat.

59
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,380
Your Majesty, to tell the truth,

60
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,320
my first thought is...

61
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,150
"Fortunately, it's not Changge."

62
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:55,440
Please forgive me.

63
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,470
That's also what I think.

64
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,630
Khatun, Great Khan is back.

65
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,943
Ali'er, let's go to welcome him.

66
00:06:20,943 --> 00:06:24,110
Khatun, I heard that they returned with nothing.

67
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,580
Please be cautious.

68
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,876
I see... Let's go.

69
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,980
Welcome back, Khan.

70
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:20,030
Please have a cup of wine first.

71
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:26,309
Hundreds of thousands of troops brought nothing back.

72
00:07:26,309 --> 00:07:28,420
Why would I drink wine?

73
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,980
Your dejected expression... makes me feel unlucky!

74
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,720
Don't show up in front of me again!

75
00:07:37,344 --> 00:07:38,880
Yes.

76
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:48,076
Khan, Young Khan comes to greet you.

77
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:49,990
Greet me?

78
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,121
I think he wishes me to die!

79
00:07:52,121 --> 00:07:55,054
Ask him to go back to reflect! I don't want to see him!

80
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:56,560
Yes.

81
00:08:00,555 --> 00:08:03,680
Why are you still freezing here? Get out!

82
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,239
Sun, you're back! Are you okay?

83
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,654
What's going on? Have you seen the counselor?

84
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:31,090
She'er captured her and brought her back.

85
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,109
What happened to Changge?

86
00:08:33,109 --> 00:08:34,679
Prepare some gifts. I'm going to see Khan.

87
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,449
You just got back without any rest.

88
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,179
And what's your reason to see Khan?

89
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:40,187
- Report on military affairs.
- What are they?

90
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:42,609
- I'll write at once.
- I'll go with you! I want to see...

91
00:08:42,609 --> 00:08:46,199
Mimi, please! It's no use of you to go with him.

92
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:48,679
Haven't you heard that Changge was arrested?

93
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:51,690
Should I wait here and do nothing?

94
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:11,199
Shouldn't you prepare gifts to see Khan?

95
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:12,539
Why are you scouring your sword here?

96
00:09:12,539 --> 00:09:15,230
Kurultai will be held in three days.
<i>(T/N: a political and military council to strategize war plans)</i>

97
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:19,540
I'll request to fight a duel with She'er.

98
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,809
I want to win her back.

99
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:24,009
Sun, are you mad?

100
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:26,743
He's stuck for how to kill you fair and upright.

101
00:09:26,743 --> 00:09:28,689
How can you provide him a chance?

102
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:32,050
You'll show mercy but he won't.

103
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:34,530
I won't either.

104
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,959
Mimi wants to follow you to the capital.

105
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,830
Don't bring her there.

106
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,899
It's too dangerous. I'm worried about you.

107
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:48,250
So I can't let Changge stay there for long.

108
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:58,432
- General, let me go with you.
- Why?

109
00:09:58,432 --> 00:10:01,554
Changge must be cold and hungry now. Maybe she's injured.

110
00:10:01,554 --> 00:10:04,680
So I'm bring her some food, drinks, and medicines.

111
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,699
- Give them to me.
- No.

112
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:08,510
I must see her with my own eyes.

113
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:12,054
General, please bring me there! I'll be useful!

114
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,050
Young Khan.

115
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:34,465
Young Khan, we've just met the slave whom you brought back.

116
00:10:34,465 --> 00:10:37,321
Do you dislike him too?

117
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:40,339
No. We've seen him before.

118
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,854
- When?
- When we were in You State.

119
00:10:42,854 --> 00:10:45,650
And also he helped Ashile Sun.

120
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,221
He's the friend of the scamp...

121
00:10:50,221 --> 00:10:54,290
<i>Khan, would you please keep him alive?</i>

122
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:58,339
<i>I will save him. I won't stand by and watch him die.</i>

123
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,330
As expected, their relationship is unusual.

124
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,230
Tuluk, go to bring him here.

125
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,890
Yes.

126
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,810
- General.
- General.

127
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,919
Have you seen a new slave with a nevus under his eye?

128
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:36,520
Yes, I have.

129
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,999
- Where's he?
- Young Khan's soldiers brought him to the archery field.

130
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,976
Wait for me here.

131
00:11:44,977 --> 00:11:48,640
No woman can enter the archery field so don't bring me more trouble.

132
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,430
Once again.

133
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:08,549
What did that scamp ask you to do in Wolf Division?

134
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,699
To frame my troop?

135
00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:13,550
I don't know what you're talking about.

136
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,960
Do you think I won't kill a slave?

137
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,799
I'll count to three. You still have time to regret.

138
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,280
Let's go to see Great Khan and confess that you're a member of Eagle Division.

139
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,110
I am not.

140
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,054
Fine. It seems you know no fear of death.

141
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,220
She'er, are you crazy?

142
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:12,890
It seems he's special to you.

143
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:16,720
You can start to fight against me for him.

144
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,200
Let a man be your target? Don't you fear to be damned by the gods?

145
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,320
Ashile Sun, wake up.

146
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,899
Here's the capital, not your place.

147
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:34,620
And he's not your man.

148
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,519
He's my slave. How can't I shoot him?

149
00:13:39,359 --> 00:13:41,920
You've come just in time.

150
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,750
We haven't had a competition for a long time, right?

151
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,900
I don't think we should have one.

152
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,240
Don't try to refuse me so easily.

153
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:53,810
As you mind him a lot, then he'll be the award.

154
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,720
What do you mean?

155
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,979
Do you remember that

156
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:05,000
we always scrambled for small rewards by battles of archery?

157
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,800
No.

158
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,550
Never mind. I still remember it clearly.

159
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:16,280
Our first competition was for such a tiny Ping Po.

160
00:14:20,033 --> 00:14:22,969
She'er, release him. Let's have the competition.

161
00:14:22,969 --> 00:14:25,180
How can I release the award?

162
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,169
It's a ready-made target.

163
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,332
- It's right for us to test our archery.
- You...

164
00:14:30,332 --> 00:14:31,732
Choose the winner within three rounds.

165
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:35,743
If you win, I'll allow him to go with you with no other words.

166
00:14:35,743 --> 00:14:37,380
Deal?

167
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,320
Deal.

168
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,090
Again!

169
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,490
You lost that game.

170
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,143
It's the past. It won't be the same now.

171
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:01,580
You not only lost the game but also cheated.

172
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,030
<i>Father.</i>

173
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:10,321
She'er, are you done playing?

174
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:13,960
I've told you to compete in three rounds so none can be omitted.

175
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,530
Let's change into a smaller target this round.

176
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:31,110
- You...
- What's wrong? Hate seeing it?

177
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,129
Or do you think I shouldn't do so?

178
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,129
It's too small. You can't hit the target as it's windy.

179
00:17:37,129 --> 00:17:40,810
Ashile Sun, you're really arrogant.

180
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,880
You can hit it. Of course, I can!

181
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,580
She'er!

182
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,850
You've suffered a lot.

183
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,932
- Why are you here?
- I...

184
00:19:14,566 --> 00:19:17,240
I've come to report to Great Khan.

185
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,240
General Sun!

186
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,230
Great Khan summoned you to report! Hurry up!

187
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:31,899
Ashile Sun, nobody hit the target in the last round so we drew.

188
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:34,620
And you can't take him away.

189
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,320
Leave now.

190
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,000
I'll be fine.

191
00:19:45,722 --> 00:19:47,450
Sun.

192
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,980
Wait for a few days.

193
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:54,650
I will bring you back.

194
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,287
Boring. Tuluk, take him back.

195
00:20:15,287 --> 00:20:16,930
Yes.

196
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:31,200
Get in!

197
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,980
Changge!

198
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,576
Mimi...

199
00:20:36,577 --> 00:20:37,999
Changge.

200
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,150
Why are you here?

201
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,800
You're injured...

202
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,260
Any wounds on your body?

203
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:51,719
Li Changge! General Sun told me that you would care for yourself!

204
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:55,150
Then, why did you get hurt?

205
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:59,079
- Why are you laughing?
- I'm fine.

206
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,840
Or you can touch it.

207
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,590
I refuse.

208
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,630
Sit here.

209
00:21:22,433 --> 00:21:23,930
Come on.

210
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:26,600
Does it hurt?

211
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,421
If you can't take good care of yourself, I'll...

212
00:21:34,421 --> 00:21:37,800
You can break my head, okay?

213
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,490
How can you make fun of it?

214
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,620
Don't worry. I'm okay.

215
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:50,550
I will return to Eagle Division

216
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:53,220
and eat the boiled mutton legs you made.

217
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:14,180
Eagle Division is brave and skillful indeed, with strict discipline.

218
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:18,550
During the battles in Weishui, your casualties are the least.

219
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,680
Thanks to Father.

220
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:27,243
As you've made a great contribution, I'll grant you a large reward.

221
00:22:27,244 --> 00:22:28,909
Thanks, Father.

222
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:33,599
Comparing with the reward, I hope that Father could grant my request.

223
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,811
Go ahead.

224
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:38,009
Kurultai will be held in three days.

225
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:42,090
I want to duel and win the award of Sirius.

226
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,421
I hope to gain Father's permission.

227
00:22:43,422 --> 00:22:46,665
It's a trivial matter. I agree.

228
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,909
You're really my son.

229
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:53,090
I'm waiting for your victory in three days.

230
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:57,999
By the way. I know what you want

231
00:22:57,999 --> 00:23:00,032
but I still need to remind you of one thing.

232
00:23:00,032 --> 00:23:05,921
You can fight for the victory but don't act precipitately and unfriendly.

233
00:23:05,921 --> 00:23:07,549
I see.

234
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,979
Father, please be at ease. I won't embarrass you.

235
00:23:11,255 --> 00:23:13,119
That's fine, good boy.

236
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:17,620
Kurultai is coming soon so don't leave in a hurry.

237
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,239
Stay here for a few more days.

238
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:26,210
Let's live together, chat all night and improve our skills.

239
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,890
Okay.

240
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,321
Report to Great Khan.

241
00:23:30,321 --> 00:23:31,944
Luo Yi has been captured.

242
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:34,390
He'll be taken to Khan's Tent soon.

243
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:36,643
Okay, leave.

244
00:23:36,644 --> 00:23:38,160
Yes.

245
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,050
Sirius!

246
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:56,130
I know you won't treat me badly all the way!

247
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,580
It's all your will!

248
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:04,365
Father, was he the General of Tang, Luo Yi?

249
00:24:04,365 --> 00:24:07,043
Yes. It's him.

250
00:24:07,043 --> 00:24:11,410
He has commanded the Tianjie Army to guard Jing State for years.

251
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,370
We fought many times

252
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,440
and I seldom won.

253
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,760
His good luck has simply run out this time.

254
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,549
I heard that Luo Yi was close to Li Jiancheng.

255
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,310
Therefore, he hates Li Shimin very much.

256
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:29,476
That's why he led the Tianjie Army to rebel,

257
00:24:29,476 --> 00:24:31,565
making Great Tang lose the north defense line.

258
00:24:31,565 --> 00:24:35,599
While he escaped and hid after the defeat, how did we capture him?

259
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,599
After Li Shimin defeated him,

260
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:42,529
only a few trusted followers survived and protected him.

261
00:24:42,529 --> 00:24:45,920
In desperation, he fled toward the grasslands.

262
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:51,500
As I got the news, I dispatched troops to find him along the border.

263
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:56,260
To my surprise, we found and captured him.

264
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:00,240
With Kurultai coming soon,

265
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,044
Sirius really gives me a lavish gift.

266
00:25:05,044 --> 00:25:07,690
Congratulations, Father!

267
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:11,520
How do you want to deal with him?

268
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:17,260
He knows the posts and the march deployments well.

269
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,633
If he can surrender to us, we could be more powerful

270
00:25:21,633 --> 00:25:24,233
and it'll be easy for us to succeed.

271
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:28,250
What if he refuses?

272
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,300
If so,

273
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:35,939
I'll keep on torturing him.

274
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:41,950
My resentment won't be eliminated only until his spirit is destroyed.

275
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:46,120
Once a day. Don't forget.

276
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,599
And here's the food.

277
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,590
Hide it.

278
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,840
So it doesn't be snatched by others.

279
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,779
You've stayed for a long time, so you'd better return now.

280
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:57,599
You shouldn't stay long here.

281
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,780
It'll be terrible to be found by She'er's men.

282
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:08,754
Don't drive me away.

283
00:27:08,755 --> 00:27:11,710
I don't know when we can meet again.

284
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:14,920
Maybe...

285
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:18,799
I'll be back to Eagle Division without finishing using them.

286
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,277
- Time to leave.
- I refuse.

287
00:27:29,688 --> 00:27:31,100
Mimi.

288
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,360
You go first, Mimi.

289
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,600
Take care of yourself.

290
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,740
Greetings to Young Khan.

291
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,560
Where have you been these years?

292
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:57,030
No matter where I am, I've been a slave in the grasslands all the way.

293
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,276
Not so bad...

294
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:00,230
I thought you were...

295
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,443
Where do you live now?

296
00:28:02,443 --> 00:28:03,354
I...

297
00:28:03,355 --> 00:28:05,500
What are you going to do?

298
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,810
She's now a member of the Eagle Division.

299
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,079
You're now in the Eagle Division?

300
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,620
You're his slave?

301
00:28:19,022 --> 00:28:22,660
Mimi, go back.

302
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,830
Yes.

303
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,599
Please forgive me for leaving, Young Khan.

304
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,680
I have to leave now.

305
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,280
Mimi.

306
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:39,160
Do you want to say something to me?

307
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,490
Li Changge is my friend.

308
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,340
I hope you do not kill him.

309
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,030
Could you?

310
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,470
Fine. I promise.

311
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:02,959
I promised her that I won't kill you.

312
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,300
That doesn't mean you will live in comfort.

313
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,890
I won't let you off that easy!

314
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,111
Have you seen Great Khan? Did he give you a hard time?

315
00:29:18,111 --> 00:29:21,610
No. Just a chat.

316
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,980
You've been arrested so why are you worrying about me?

317
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,509
You're right...

318
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:30,833
It'll be a long period for me to stay in Khan's Tent.

319
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:33,000
I'm afraid I can't come to accompany you.

320
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,450
Don't worry about me.

321
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,754
Mimi left something to me.

322
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:38,140
Three days.

323
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,740
Hang on for three days, I'll come to take you back

324
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,960
as soon as Kurultai is over.

325
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,879
Young Khan, why do you call me in a hurry?

326
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,944
Do you still remember Mimi Guli?

327
00:30:04,944 --> 00:30:07,532
Yes. A slave from Mobei.

328
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:09,100
Why do you suddenly mention her?

329
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,399
Tell me... where she went.

330
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:14,721
Why did she suddenly disappear without telling me?

331
00:30:14,721 --> 00:30:18,109
Great Khan worried you would lose your ambition for her

332
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,810
so he expelled her to some other place.

333
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:22,530
But why is she now with Ashile Sun?

334
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,930
She's now his slave!

335
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:29,140
The slave was handpicked by Great Khan.

336
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,120
Damn it!

337
00:30:34,219 --> 00:30:37,990
So I'm the only fool...

338
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,666
<i>Please give it to me.</i>

339
00:30:43,666 --> 00:30:46,232
<i>Okay. Just put it here.</i>

340
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,700
Why are you in a daze? Do you want to die?

341
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,739
Young Khan asked me to keep my eyes on you.

342
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:37,290
Don't try to loaf! Get to work!

343
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:32,932
I was wondering who would rush to see me.

344
00:32:32,932 --> 00:32:35,560
Well... It's you.

345
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,160
Long time no see.

346
00:32:41,238 --> 00:32:47,060
Luo Yi, I scarcely recognize you!

347
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:52,410
Are you still the brave and skillful man in my memory?

348
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,389
Ashile Chuobi,

349
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:58,840
I heard that you went out to battle yourself with nothing back.

350
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,160
You're now really a good-for-nothing!

351
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:09,326
As you're captured by me, you're still reluctant to admit your defeat!

352
00:33:09,326 --> 00:33:14,954
As long as you can kneel to surrender to the Ashile Tribe and fight for us,

353
00:33:14,954 --> 00:33:21,160
I'll now provide you a feast and a higher rank.

354
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,143
Ashile Chuobi, don't lose yourself in your daydream.

355
00:33:27,143 --> 00:33:30,740
How can I associate with rubbish like you?

356
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,320
Want to kill me? Just bring it!

357
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,509
Incorrigible.

358
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:43,150
You want it the hard way?

359
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:48,620
It must be a tiring journey for him

360
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,287
so give him a "nice massage"!

361
00:33:51,287 --> 00:33:53,030
Yes.

362
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,090
Young Khan, what are you looking at?

363
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,588
Mimi Guli called him Changge.

364
00:34:20,588 --> 00:34:22,069
Effeminate!

365
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,240
No machismo.

366
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,010
I really don't know why she's close to him.

367
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:29,829
Just a liking between young people.

368
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:32,759
Why do you worry about the two slaves?

369
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,319
She's my slave.

370
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,544
Why does she love him?

371
00:34:35,544 --> 00:34:37,510
That's past history now.

372
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,249
Just a female slave.

373
00:34:39,249 --> 00:34:41,719
You can have as many as you want.

374
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,199
If you need, I'll find one for you.

375
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,350
I didn't mean that.

376
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:55,110
Uncle Lei, instruct them to assign him more jobs.

377
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:58,000
Don't let him relax.

378
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,650
Yes.

379
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,930
Who's coming?

380
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,940
I'm ordered to clean the cell, General.

381
00:37:12,288 --> 00:37:14,530
Shiba, hold on!

382
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,260
He called me "General."

383
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:21,850
Bandits of Ashile won't call me "General."

384
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:24,140
You have the sleeping draught!

385
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,540
You made the guards faint.

386
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,350
You want to rescue General Luo?

387
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,939
Who are you?

388
00:37:31,939 --> 00:37:34,320
Ten years ago,

389
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,310
you sent me a horn bow and praised me as brave as my father

390
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:40,890
in the garden of Eastern Palace.

391
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,980
Princess Yongning.

392
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:52,500
Shiba, release her! Don't be rude!

393
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:02,060
But why are you here?

394
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,665
It's a long story.

395
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:05,900
Let me get you out first.

396
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,630
No need.

397
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,720
Even if you open the lock,

398
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,919
my legs will prevent me from escaping.

399
00:38:12,919 --> 00:38:15,910
How dare he hurt you so badly!

400
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:18,865
We fought against them continuously all the way.

401
00:38:18,866 --> 00:38:22,370
Then I was careless and hurt my right leg.

402
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,632
It's good to know that you're alive.

403
00:38:26,632 --> 00:38:29,120
It's still hopeful.

404
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:33,840
It seems I can reconsider his suggestion.

405
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:37,655
Yongning, listen to me.

406
00:38:37,655 --> 00:38:39,450
I know the position of the Tang Army well.

407
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,444
As long as I agree to cooperate with Ashile,

408
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,209
we can use their forces to storm Chang'an.

409
00:38:44,209 --> 00:38:47,610
We can appeal to His Majesty's former subordinates in your name and then kill the traitor, Li Shimin!

410
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,730
We can't!

411
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,980
Why?

412
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,850
Don't you want to get revenge?

413
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,400
I see...

414
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:06,310
That's it... You've been close to your uncle from childhood.

415
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:08,220
I didn't mean that.

416
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,350
Since then, he is not my second uncle anymore.

417
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:15,000
He's only my enemy.

418
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:19,130
I've suffered day by day

419
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:22,180
to find a chance to get revenge.

420
00:39:23,044 --> 00:39:25,230
But...

421
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,970
if we help Ashile Army to storm, we cannot repent anymore!

422
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:30,911
Uniting with another party to attack is a common occurrence.

423
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:33,043
We cannot find another good chance again!

424
00:39:33,043 --> 00:39:37,354
General, as a superb military commander,

425
00:39:37,354 --> 00:39:42,620
how can't you know it's hard to return the military forces?

426
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,829
When I ran away from Chang'an,

427
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,620
<i>I thought there was nothing more to lose.</i>

428
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:51,320
<i>Nothing could hold me back.</i>

429
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:56,030
<i>I thought to borrow troops from You State and Shuo State to attack</i>

430
00:39:56,030 --> 00:40:00,700
<i>but I knew I was wrong after a series of difficulties.</i>

431
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:07,090
Bodies are piling up at battles

432
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:10,340
and how innocent are they?

433
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,829
If we help the Ashile Army to attack,

434
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,976
how can the people of Great Tang yield without resistance?

435
00:40:15,977 --> 00:40:22,260
At that time, corpses and blood will be all over the land.

436
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,743
Soldiers will die for their nation.

437
00:40:23,743 --> 00:40:28,060
I hope you can think carefully!

438
00:40:36,177 --> 00:40:38,660
Why do you laugh?

439
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:41,630
I was to sound out your intention.

440
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:43,829
Princess of Tang. Crown Prince's daughter.

441
00:40:43,829 --> 00:40:48,610
It's suspicious for you to be in the capital of Ashile Tribe.

442
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:53,550
It seems what you've done is better than mine.

443
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,099
As your father was my friend,

444
00:40:57,099 --> 00:41:00,389
I just wanted to speak out against injustice.

445
00:41:00,389 --> 00:41:03,199
I thought to force Li Shimin to abdicate

446
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:06,109
while I've never thought to be defeated.

447
00:41:06,109 --> 00:41:08,700
An overwhelming defeat.

448
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:13,588
Ashile attacked Weishui for it lacked troops.

449
00:41:13,588 --> 00:41:17,154
I brought the people a disaster. I should be reviled.

450
00:41:17,154 --> 00:41:19,750
There's no need to blame yourself for this.

451
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,680
Though the Ashile Tribe attacked Weishui,

452
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,050
they soon retreated because of the trap.

453
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,699
You've been to Weishui.

454
00:41:27,699 --> 00:41:30,910
Is that the reason why you're arrested?

455
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,100
Brave girl.

456
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,800
You're really as courageous as your father!

457
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:43,222
I'm... very grateful to you for maintaining my integrity!

458
00:41:43,222 --> 00:41:44,766
Don't worry.

459
00:41:44,766 --> 00:41:46,510
Though I've been trying to rebel against Li Shimin,

460
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:48,619
I've never forgotten I'm a member of Great Tang.

461
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:52,230
I won't surrender no matter what!

462
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:56,610
The most critical thing for you is to take good care of yourself.

463
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,650
I will come to save you.

464
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:02,187
By the way, Shiba should leave here as soon as possible.

465
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:06,790
I'll contact you to fetch him when I rescue him. Is that okay?

466
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,854
Shiba, listen to her!

467
00:42:09,854 --> 00:42:11,550
Leave here now!

468
00:42:13,077 --> 00:42:14,033
You!

469
00:42:14,033 --> 00:42:15,232
Stubborn as a mule!

470
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:17,610
You dare to violate my words now?

471
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,509
You're the last one of 18 Cavalrymen of Yanyun.

472
00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:25,099
I've already ordered you to escape long ago.

473
00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:27,587
But you violated my order and came here secretly.

474
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:30,200
Do you want to drive me crazy?

475
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,421
The rules of 18 Cavalrymen of Yanyun are strict and can't be violated.

476
00:42:33,421 --> 00:42:34,832
Don't you remember?

477
00:42:34,832 --> 00:42:36,640
Leave now!

478
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:48,430
Go back, Yongning.

479
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:53,000
Be careful in the enemy camp.

480
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,843
General Luo, here's the medicine.

481
00:42:55,844 --> 00:42:58,110
It'll be useful.

482
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:04,850
Take good care of yourself and wait for my help.

483
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:07,190
Thank you.

484
00:43:26,455 --> 00:43:28,120
Don't move!

485
00:43:33,022 --> 00:43:34,760
Who are you?

486
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,069
♫ <i>The heart gradually responds,</i> ♫

487
00:43:49,069 --> 00:43:51,349
♫ <i>gradually revives,</i> ♫

488
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:54,769
♫ <i>gradually swims towards you</i> ♫

489
00:43:54,769 --> 00:43:59,010
♫ <i>Before bidding farewell,</i> ♫
