♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,959
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,530
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,869
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,250
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,820
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,760

20
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:33,040
   

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,280
   

22
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,409
Excuse me. Where's the Weaving Workshop of the Western Suburb?

23
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,069
- I don't know. 
 - Thank you.

24
00:01:45,069 --> 00:01:46,968
 - Change one. 
 - Okay. 

25
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:49,169
 How about this one? 

26
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:50,369
 - Look at this. 
 - How's it? 

27
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:52,668
Where's the Weaving Workshop of Western Suburb?

28
00:01:52,668 --> 00:01:54,328
Go ahead to the end.

29
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,349
Turn west a few times.

30
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:59,388
You can ask there.

31
00:01:59,388 --> 00:02:02,529
 Take care on your way. 

32
00:02:02,529 --> 00:02:03,970
 Want some wonton? 

33
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,710
 Try our delicious wonton. 

34
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:21,150
   

35
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:29,448
Where's Yueyan?

36
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:32,929
What Yueyan? I don't know her.

37
00:02:32,929 --> 00:02:35,168
It's urgent now.

38
00:02:35,169 --> 00:02:36,608
Look carefully.

39
00:02:36,609 --> 00:02:38,230
It's an official token.

40
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,729
- Yueyan is the daughter of the newly enthroned emperor. 
 - What?

41
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:44,528
If anything's wrong with Noble Princess Yongan Li Yueyan,

42
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:46,589
you can't afford it, can you?

43
00:02:48,089 --> 00:02:49,650
Is Yueyan really a princess?

44
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,669
You've met her?

45
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:53,008
Where's she?

46
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:54,569
Are you a fraud?

47
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,688
Listen. The officers searched for her everywhere, but failed at last.

48
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:02,230
Obviously you hid her.

49
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,569
I...

50
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,808
How about this...

51
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:07,609
I'll call the magistrate of Yun State right now.

52
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,590
Sir, you should have come here early.

53
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,209
Yueyan went away yesterday.

54
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,088
Went away?

55
00:03:15,089 --> 00:03:16,569
Do you know where she's gone?

56
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,728
The court is immigrating people on the frontier.

57
00:03:19,729 --> 00:03:22,110
She followed them to Luoyang.

58
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,448
If you go after her now, maybe you can find her.

59
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:27,049
Thanks a lot.

60
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,209
My god.

61
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,388
- Yueyan is a princess. 
 - Is truly a princess.

62
00:03:32,388 --> 00:03:33,369
- Noble Princess. 
 - She can't be.

63
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:35,069
We're all doomed.

64
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:36,209
What can we do?

65
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,168
It's over. We're doomed.

66
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:38,649
I scolded her.

67
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,470
I hit her palms several times.

68
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,248
Miss Chai, we asked the princess to do rough work and stay up late to embroider.

69
00:03:45,249 --> 00:03:47,568
- Are we going to lose our heads? 
 - You're right.

70
00:03:47,568 --> 00:03:49,000
If I had known she was a princess,

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,100
I would have given her more sesame cakes.

72
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,429
What can we do now?

73
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:54,650
What should we do?

74
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:58,040
   

75
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,610
Here, eat it now.

76
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,269
Let's go there and see it.

77
00:04:26,729 --> 00:04:28,448
Hello, your lanterns look fine.

78
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:33,848
Excuse me. Who is selling wool and fabrics around here?

79
00:04:33,849 --> 00:04:37,668
Just a few. There are some stores ahead. They're together.

80
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:38,929
I don't mean stores.

81
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,689
It's a girl with a basket on her back selling fabric.

82
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,050
She was here yesterday.

83
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,629
I know her.

84
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:51,530
A girl selling fabric stole a pouch and was caught by the owner.

85
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:54,789
Do you know where's she now?

86
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:58,288
Those who selling fabric are from

87
00:04:58,289 --> 00:04:59,790
the Weaving Workshop of Western Suburb.

88
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,649
You can go there and ask.

89
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,688
- Thanks a lot. 
 - You're welcome.

90
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,690
 Hao Du. 

91
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,590
 Why is he in Yun State, too? 

92
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,470
Yueyan?

93
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:33,408
Miss Chai.

94
00:05:33,409 --> 00:05:36,509
Miss Chai, another one for Yueyan.

95
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:39,229
You're here for the princess too, right?

96
00:05:39,229 --> 00:05:40,889
How do you know she's...

97
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:44,630
Just now a guy came here for Noble Princess Yueyan.

98
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,490
She left with the team to the south yesterday.

99
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,290
 Sure enough Hao Du's here for Yueyan. 

100
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,649
He just left.

101
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:56,910
If you go after him right now, you can meet him definitely.

102
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:08,149
 Yueyan must have suffered a lot. 

103
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:12,929
 I thought I could meet her and give it back to her. 

104
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:20,328
Why do you have this pouch?

105
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:22,008
Yueyan lost this pouch yesterday.

106
00:06:22,009 --> 00:06:25,229
She said it was a gift from her best friend then cried for a long time.

107
00:06:25,229 --> 00:06:27,369
We comforted her for a long time.

108
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:31,110
What's wrong?

109
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,630
Don't be sad.

110
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:37,168
Yueyan didn't suffer a lot here.

111
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:39,210
 Yes. We were good to her. 

112
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,888
She helped us embroider and made good money.

113
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:45,009
She had enough money to go to Luoyang.

114
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:47,449
She's a princess. She's blessed.

115
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,009
She'll be fine. Don't worry about her.

116
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:52,010
 - Yes. 
 - Don't worry. 

117
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,970
That's good.

118
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,510
Hang on.

119
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,850
Hang in there.

120
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,850
Keep up with the pace.

121
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:25,150
Why is nobody here?

122
00:07:36,169 --> 00:07:38,430
Why is the stable empty?

123
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:47,929
Where's Sun?

124
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:49,329
Why is there only you here?

125
00:07:49,329 --> 00:07:52,288
You don't report before going into Sun's tent now, do you?

126
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:53,929
Tell me where he is.

127
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,110
He's gone to Khan's tent.

128
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,649
Khan's tent?

129
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,288
You think I'm a 3-year-old kid?

130
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:00,750
He didn't need to go there with half of the troops.

131
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,168
Every time Great Khan calls him in, he takes away a lot of soldiers.

132
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:05,809
Yanli is paranoid.

133
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,929
How can he allow Sun to take so many soldiers there?

134
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,170
Not to mention they're all elites.

135
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,990
Tell me the truth. Is anything wrong?

136
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,509
No, nothing happened.

137
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,049
I just put these in order.

138
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,689
I told you nothing happened.

139
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:27,930
Are all the people from the central plains paranoid like you?

140
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,930
Jing State.

141
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,649
Luo Yi's Tianjie Army stations there.

142
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:37,288
What's the meaning of these lines?

143
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,089
They mean nothing.

144
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,000
   

145
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:50,290
Luo Yi's Tianjie Army failed.

146
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:53,449
How can he fail?

147
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,829
Changge, don't be paranoid.

148
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:57,790
Luo Yi's Tianjie Army failed.

149
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,180
The north gate of Great Tang is wide open.

150
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,130
Then, the Ashile Tribe will lead a large number of troops and flood in...

151
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,750
Chang'an.

152
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:13,150
Changge, what are you going to do?

153
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,400
Changge! I heard you returned from Yun State...

154
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:27,470
 Where's Changge's dagger? 

155
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,700
Mimi.

156
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,200
Mimi, it's cold at night.

157
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,970
Put it on.

158
00:09:47,969 --> 00:09:49,408
What happened?

159
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:50,648
General Sun is gone.

160
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:52,388
Changge sneaked out, too.

161
00:09:52,388 --> 00:09:53,689
Where did they go?

162
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:56,408
I guess she thought life here was too hard.

163
00:09:56,409 --> 00:09:59,350
She just ran away while Sun was out.

164
00:10:00,289 --> 00:10:02,590
Changge is not such a person.

165
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:05,049
Just joking.

166
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,569
Don't worry.

167
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,728
She won't suffer with her character.

168
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:12,369
I can guess where she went.

169
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,309
What do you mean?

170
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:16,549
She's chasing Sun.

171
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,928
It's due to my inattention.

172
00:10:17,928 --> 00:10:20,648
I forgot to put away the maps in Sun's tent.

173
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:22,848
Get to the point.

174
00:10:22,849 --> 00:10:25,349
The point is the order from Khan's tent.

175
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:27,388
Sun has to march to the south.

176
00:10:27,388 --> 00:10:30,748
South. Another attack?

177
00:10:30,748 --> 00:10:32,009
This time is different.

178
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,809
Luo Yi, Jing State's general, rebelled and was defeated by Great Tang.

179
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,889
They lost Jing State, so Great Khan marched to the south.

180
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:40,889
He has reached the central region of Great Tang.

181
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,690
That means...

182
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:57,208
Your Majesty, Yuchi Jingde pays respect to you.

183
00:10:57,209 --> 00:10:58,809
Arise.

184
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:01,689
Duke Fang. Duke Du. 
    

185
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,350
General Yuchi.

186
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,069
Give today's military intelligence to General Yuchi.

187
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:20,350
The Ashile Tribe has marched to Jing State.

188
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,030
Two forces in Wugong are going to Gaoling.

189
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,549
They can arrive in two days.

190
00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:27,509
How about our reinforcements from other cities?

191
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:28,789
It's too late.

192
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,968
Tang has just established.

193
00:11:30,969 --> 00:11:36,309
You know clearly how many troops we have.

194
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:42,350
I ask all of you here to consult with me in a discussion.

195
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:47,590
In your opinion, what's the target of Yanli this time?

196
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,830
We've lost Jing State and almost lost Gaoling.

197
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,010
If he continues, he is targeting at...

198
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,668
He wants Chang'an?

199
00:11:58,668 --> 00:12:00,608
Chang'an is the foundation of Great Tang.

200
00:12:00,609 --> 00:12:03,110
We must defend it.

201
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:07,600
If we can stop him in Gaoling,

202
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,380
we may buy some time for relief troops.

203
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:15,650
Your Majesty, let me go to fight in Gaoling.

204
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:17,429
No.

205
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:23,370
How about making the door wider open for him?

206
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:28,690
Does Your Majesty want to move the decisive battlefield to Jingyang?

207
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,030
They're good at horseback and archery, like direct tactics.

208
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,489
They have an invincible cavalry.

209
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,088
Jingyang is encircled by three mountains.

210
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:39,790
With complicated terrain, it's a natural cover for defense.

211
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,049
We can use its strengths and avoid its drawbacks.

212
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,408
Yuchi Jingde.

213
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:45,549
I'm here.

214
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:47,789
Now I order you the commander of Jing State force.

215
00:12:47,789 --> 00:12:49,728
Go with 50,000 soldiers today.

216
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:55,550
I want you to keep Ashile Tribe at bay and delay it.

217
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:02,748
You can only succeed, not fail.

218
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,269
As Your Majesty wishes.

219
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,930
Once the war starts,

220
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:17,088
the counties at the border will suffer a lot.

221
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:20,790
How's the south immigration of northern people?

222
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,569
Your Majesty, the order has been given.

223
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:29,309
In a few days, hundreds of groups have been gathered and started off.

224
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:36,110
Instead of winning the war with the Ashile Tribe,

225
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:39,829
I'd rather not start it from the very beginning.

226
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:45,469
Great Tang can't afford the cost.

227
00:13:45,469 --> 00:13:52,370
People can't bear the torment of war.

228
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,830
Let's get some rest.

229
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,470
 Get some rest. 

230
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,949
 Okay. 

231
00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:17,648
 Watch your step. 

232
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,749
 Sit here. 

233
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,809
 - Water. 
 - Thank you, Mother. 

234
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:31,389
 Do you have water? 

235
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:44,768
It's my cake.

236
00:14:44,769 --> 00:14:46,490
Stop!

237
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,350
You stop now!

238
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,208
Hey, you!

239
00:14:49,209 --> 00:14:51,309
Stop!

240
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,009
Stop now!

241
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,528
Stop... Listen... I've eaten your cake.

242
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:58,408
I'll never vomit it for you.

243
00:14:58,409 --> 00:14:59,689
It's you again.

244
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,309
The last time I gave a cake, you stole my money.

245
00:15:02,309 --> 00:15:03,449
Now you steal my cake again.

246
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,050
You...

247
00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:17,129
Are you full?

248
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:19,370
I have more if you're hungry.

249
00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:23,389
Are... Are you a fool?

250
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,110
You know it now.

251
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,948
Liar.

252
00:16:33,948 --> 00:16:38,389
I didn't tell you because I don't want you involved.

253
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:42,869
I'm a slave of Eagle Division, but I'm also a part of Great Tang.

254
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:45,329
In my vein flows the blood of Great Tang.

255
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:47,049
How can I not be involved?

256
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:51,748
You followed me because you want to investigate the army itinerary

257
00:16:51,748 --> 00:16:55,550
and send it to Great Tang court. Am I right?

258
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:57,270
Yes.

259
00:16:58,409 --> 00:17:00,670
Now it is not in my power.

260
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,648
Even if I stopped Eagle Division, you could have other forces.

261
00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:06,609
Even if I stopped you once, you could start war twice.

262
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:09,310
But if you want me to stay out of it,

263
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,168
it's better to kill me directly.

264
00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:15,250
I said, your life belongs to me.

265
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,849
Ashile Sun, Eagle Division lives a good life in the grasslands.

266
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,408
Why must you become a part of it?

267
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:22,288
You can be late and even later.

268
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:24,109
You won't fight against Great Tang.

269
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,168
Besides the Eagle Division, Great Khan dispatched 100 thousand troops.

270
00:17:27,168 --> 00:17:29,869
This battle can't be stopped.

271
00:17:30,489 --> 00:17:32,489
Su Yishe!

272
00:17:35,069 --> 00:17:37,269
Take her to Eagle Division.

273
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:38,689
But...

274
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,289
Go back now. Stop making a fuss.

275
00:17:42,289 --> 00:17:47,469
If you do anything against Great Tang, I won't forgive you.

276
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,530
Ashile Sun.

277
00:17:53,249 --> 00:17:57,869
Don't force me to meet you on the battleground.

278
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,229
Tie her up now.

279
00:18:04,229 --> 00:18:05,749
Take her to Eagle Division.

280
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:07,449
Yes.

281
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,550
Military Counselor, I'm sorry.

282
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,829
Go with me. Don't give me a hard time.

283
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:16,508
Nu Er! Ya Luo! Carry out my order and pick up speed.

284
00:18:16,508 --> 00:18:18,049
 Yes. 

285
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,190
Give me that.

286
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,248
I...

287
00:19:04,249 --> 00:19:05,648
You? Me?

288
00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:07,408
Take it back if you can.

289
00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:13,430
Listen! If you have other food, give it to me first, remember?

290
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:15,430
You bastard.

291
00:19:27,489 --> 00:19:30,749
Why didn't you scold him like what you did to me?

292
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:32,329
I...

293
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,430
Useless.

294
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,760
Here.

295
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,749
I'm not a disloyal man.

296
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,929
Young boy, why are you always acting like an old man?

297
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:57,269
I say it again. I'm not a boy.

298
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:59,430
At least I can protect the food in my hand.

299
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,628
Much better than you, wishy-washy.

300
00:20:01,628 --> 00:20:03,509
I don't know what you're afraid of?

301
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:06,389
If you're bullied, fight back.

302
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:09,949
I don't know how to fight.

303
00:20:09,949 --> 00:20:13,390
Bite, kick, grab, scratch, whatever works.

304
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,850
Where are you going?

305
00:20:18,129 --> 00:20:19,849
Luoyang.

306
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,430
You?

307
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,389
I... I don't know.

308
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,368
Everywhere is okay.

309
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:28,250
Where are your father and mother?

310
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,630
They...

311
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:35,408
They died early.

312
00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:39,289
I don't even remember what they look like and where they died.

313
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,509
What? Do you want to be my friend?

314
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:48,550
You? You're not good enough.

315
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,150
It smells good.

316
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,150
Here you are.

317
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,689
You're not happy, are you?

318
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,190
I'm not happy either.

319
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,648
I have to take you back, so I can't fight with General.

320
00:21:19,649 --> 00:21:23,090
A fight is to protect, not to bully.

321
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:30,629
Su Yishe, how about untying me?

322
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:32,168
I'm the same as you guys from Eagle Division.

323
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:34,849
I need to protect my family and friends.

324
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,389
No.

325
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:39,190
I promised Ashile Sun to take you back to Eagle Division.

326
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,329
Don't be so pious.

327
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,449
Listen to me first.

328
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:47,368
If you untie me, you can tell him I ran away.

329
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:48,729
You failed to avoid me.

330
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:51,389
He won't blame you.

331
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,648
Su Yishe.

332
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:56,349
Su Yishe, consider it carefully.

333
00:21:56,349 --> 00:22:00,329
- I'm not listening. You have a really glib tongue. 
 - You...

334
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:01,150
Su Yishe.

335
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,190
I won't listen.

336
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,209
Come here.

337
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,288
No, no, no.

338
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:05,669
- Take your hands down. 
 - No, no, no.

339
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,230
- Su Yishe, I'm hungry. 
 - Not a word, no.

340
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:09,649
Su Yishe, I'm hungry.

341
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:14,769
I'm hungry.

342
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,170
Here you are.

343
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,689
How can I eat it with my hands tied?

344
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,589
Untie me. I'll eat with my hands.

345
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:28,168
No.

346
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:31,228
Once I untie you, you will definitely run away.

347
00:22:31,228 --> 00:22:33,049
I'm not foolish.

348
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,190
But I'm hungry.

349
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:39,450
How about me tearing it up and feeding you?

350
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,609
In any case, I can't understand your big words.

351
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:47,008
So don't try to play tricks.

352
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:50,248
I only know it won't be wrong to follow General Sun's words.

353
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:52,749
Hurry up. Eat it and have a rest.

354
00:22:52,749 --> 00:22:55,770
We have a long way to go tomorrow.

355
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:06,310
I'm sorry, Su Yishe.

356
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,430
I must go back.

357
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,930
   

358
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,730
Your Majesty!

359
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:20,368
Your Majesty, what's going on?

360
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:23,209
Eagle Division has good military strategies.

361
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:26,790
They distracted Yuchi's troops and depleted them.

362
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,529
They're malicious.

363
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:31,709
Yuchi's force was exhausted because of their attack.

364
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:35,869
Their main force seized a chance and went across Jingyang.

365
00:23:35,869 --> 00:23:40,230
They'll arrive at Weishui River at dusk.

366
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:43,169
I heard Eagle Division was good but didn't expect they were so battle-wise.

367
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:45,530
No wonder Khan Yanli was so bold.

368
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:48,029
He even sent envoy Shixin Sili here.

369
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:52,070
He has submitted the paper and is waiting outside.

370
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,528
He sends a messenger now.

371
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:59,049
Does he really want to discuss an issue?

372
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:02,290
He is trying to explore the real condition of Chang'an.

373
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:07,269
Your Majesty, how should we deal with the envoy's visit?

374
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:17,369
Arrest him.

375
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,910
Strange.

376
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:49,609
Tang didn't fortify at Weishui River, why?

377
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,670
It's just 40 miles to Chang'an.

378
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,710
Even if Li Shimin were a 3-year-old boy,

379
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,969
he should know it's time to beg and run.

380
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,248
I think he just wants to abandon the city and escape,

381
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:01,248
ready to surrender without a fight.

382
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:05,849
We'd better speed up and cross the river before they get prepared.

383
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:09,550
We can camp outside Chang'an city tomorrow.

384
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:14,510
Sun, what do you think?

385
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:19,268
We've been here. No rush.

386
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,430
Be careful.

387
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,550
Report! Report.

388
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:30,989
- Khan. 
 - Why so panicked?

389
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:32,309
Why are you alone?

390
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:34,210
What happened?

391
00:25:43,409 --> 00:25:47,430
Uncle Khan, Shixin Sili has been detained by Great Tang.

392
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:48,769
What?

393
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:50,669
They're trying to seek their doom.

394
00:25:50,669 --> 00:25:55,910
If we can't conquer Chang'an today, Ashile Tribe will be embarrassed.

395
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,488
The messengers shouldn't be involved in the war.

396
00:26:00,489 --> 00:26:02,689
Tang detained Shixin Sili.

397
00:26:02,689 --> 00:26:06,870
Please think about the reason, Father.

398
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:12,788
Carry out my order. Stop and camp here.

399
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:14,049
 Yes! 

400
00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:17,389
Stop and camp here!

401
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:24,329
Uncle Khan, why did you stop?

402
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,230
It's a trap.

403
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,249
Fang Yi.

404
00:27:11,149 --> 00:27:13,289
Why is he here?

405
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,950
   

406
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:22,689
We've arrived here with a lot of effort.

407
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:26,610
Are we retreating now?

408
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:29,809
Father, we don't know the exact number of Tang forces.

409
00:27:29,809 --> 00:27:33,349
If we attack now, I'm afraid it's not appropriate.

410
00:27:33,349 --> 00:27:35,149
I agree.

411
00:27:35,149 --> 00:27:37,789
I'd like to try it for Uncle Khan.

412
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:40,689
Maybe we can get it in one hit.

413
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:42,309
Wolf Division alone can't do that.

414
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:44,368
Sun, go with him.

415
00:27:44,368 --> 00:27:47,308
Gather troops at once and attack Tang at night.

416
00:27:47,308 --> 00:27:51,488
I'd like to see how incredible the Tang army is.

417
00:27:51,489 --> 00:27:53,289
Yes!

418
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,850
 Changge should have returned to Eagle Division now. 

419
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,140
General!

420
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,689
General.

421
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,070
Su Yishe.

422
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,030
Why are you here?

423
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,008
I ruined everything.

424
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:21,288
Where's Changge?

425
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:22,590
She's fine.

426
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,268
But I fell into her trap by mistake.

427
00:28:25,268 --> 00:28:28,030
We just traveled for half a day and I fell into his snare.

428
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,130
He ran away.

429
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,168
Forget it.

430
00:28:35,169 --> 00:28:38,189
Su Yishe, get some rest.

431
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,710
Then fight with me.

432
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,210
Yes.

433
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:50,329
 If you do anything against Great Tang, I won't forgive you. 

434
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:56,108
 Ashile Sun, don't force me to meet you on the battleground. 

435
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,250
Who's that?

436
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:40,109
Princess Yongning.

437
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:56,150
Changge.

438
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:58,249
It's you.

439
00:30:00,629 --> 00:30:04,629
Fang Yi, bring her to the tent.

440
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,710
Your Majesty.

441
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:21,210
Fang Yi, go out now.

442
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,049
Yes.

443
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:43,329
Hao Du gave the news you'd been executed on the plains.

444
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:46,550
Seeing I'm alive standing here,

445
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:49,660
you're disappointed.

446
00:30:50,369 --> 00:30:56,909
Since you ran away from Chang'an, I tried my best to find you.

447
00:30:56,909 --> 00:30:58,888
You don't know...

448
00:30:58,889 --> 00:31:01,749
You don't know how I worried about you.

449
00:31:01,749 --> 00:31:04,109
Worried about me at large,

450
00:31:04,109 --> 00:31:05,849
getting in your way of ascending the throne.

451
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:09,570
So you want to find me and kill me at once, right?

452
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:18,670
I worried that you would do something bad for Great Tang.

453
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:23,880
I waited for your news every day,

454
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:28,040
but was afraid of bad news.

455
00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:30,648
Hao Du sent a message

456
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:33,629
saying you died to relieve the crisis of Shuo State.

457
00:31:33,629 --> 00:31:35,529
Do you know how I...

458
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,389
Fine.

459
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:42,629
You're alive, that's fine.

460
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:50,749
Changge, you suffered a lot in Shuo State.

461
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:52,989
I return what you want.

462
00:31:52,989 --> 00:31:55,310
Don't be hypocritical.

463
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:58,389
Compared to Governor Gongsun, compared to people in Shuo State,

464
00:31:58,389 --> 00:32:00,408
my suffering means nothing.

465
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:04,288
But you hide in Chang'an in comfort.

466
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:07,329
How much do you know about their pain?

467
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:11,689
Knowing we lost Shuo State and the sacrifice of you and Gongsun Heng,

468
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:14,349
I lost my sleep every night.

469
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,929
So why did you abandon Shuo State?

470
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:17,930
Why?

471
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:23,989
I never abandon an inch and anyone of Great Tang.

472
00:32:23,989 --> 00:32:26,190
Shuo State is located on the border.

473
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:27,849
We lost Bing State and Dai State,

474
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:30,790
so we couldn't get the news of losing Shuo State.

475
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:33,248
When I knew it, it was too late.

476
00:32:33,249 --> 00:32:37,268
Even if you had known it, you wouldn't have made every effort to help.

477
00:32:37,268 --> 00:32:41,950
After all, in your eyes, Shuo State is only a dispensable borderland.

478
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,790
You're right.

479
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,109
Even if I had known it,

480
00:32:48,109 --> 00:32:52,350
I couldn't have deployed lots of troops for it.

481
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:55,789
So cold-blooded as you are.

482
00:32:55,789 --> 00:33:00,750
I've taught you the truth of strength and weakness, offense and defense. Do you still remember?

483
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:05,109
When we're weaker, we should save power and strive to survive.

484
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:08,310
Now Great Tang's in its early stage, our military strength is weak.

485
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:11,609
Yanli knew it and made full use of it.

486
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,689
So he distracted his forces to attack our frontiers.

487
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,589
When we lose our defense, he will sweep in.

488
00:33:16,589 --> 00:33:21,209
I didn't fall for it, but Tianjie Army rebelled and then got defeated,

489
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,569
so he exploited this loophole.

490
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,288
What nonsense are you talking about?

491
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:26,389
Now Tang has several times more troops than Ashile.

492
00:33:26,389 --> 00:33:30,009
We have the upper hand. Now you're telling me about saving power and survival?

493
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,549
How can it be?

494
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:49,008
Why is there such a wide gap of strength?

495
00:33:49,009 --> 00:33:53,469
There're only 40 thousand troops left in Chang'an.

496
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:58,989
All of them have encamped along the Weishui River now.

497
00:33:58,989 --> 00:34:03,408
A vast spread of barracks you can see are all empty.

498
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:07,249
There's no Chang'an to rely on.

499
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,689
The army is fake.

500
00:34:12,309 --> 00:34:15,208
The situation of the strong beating the weak is fake.

501
00:34:15,209 --> 00:34:16,968
It's your empty fort strategy.

502
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:21,349
So far, Ashile Tribe has been bluffed only temporarily.

503
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:22,570
You're insane.

504
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:26,488
Once the soldiers know they have no backup and waver,

505
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:27,910
it'll be a catastrophe.

506
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:32,450
- How can you... 
 - That's why I must be here.

507
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:36,729
I'll identify myself to stabilize the condition when it's necessary.

508
00:34:37,669 --> 00:34:41,728
But with a few forces, how can you resist Ashile Tribe?

509
00:34:41,729 --> 00:34:44,190
How can you save the country?

510
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:48,728
Changge, I taught you another truth.

511
00:34:48,728 --> 00:34:50,869
You know it's impossible, but you'll still do it.

512
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:54,529
Even millions of people are holding you back, but you'll still do it.

513
00:34:56,209 --> 00:34:59,570
 Night attack! 

514
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:04,649
Your Majesty, the Ashile Tribe attacked us suddenly.

515
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,870
Your Majesty.

516
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:14,209
You're still alive.

517
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:17,170
Shuyu, perfect timing.

518
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:20,110
Send Changge out of here now.

519
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:22,029
Fang Yi, prepare horses.

520
00:35:22,029 --> 00:35:23,990
Your Majesty, the horses are ready.

521
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,928
We are ready to take Your Majesty away at once.

522
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:31,649
No. Embattle with me. Against the Ashile cavalry.

523
00:35:31,649 --> 00:35:33,850
You're fighting it yourself.

524
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,569
My order to all forces.

525
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,049
Hold high the dragon flag, light torches.

526
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:02,369
We must let the Ashile troops know I'm here.

527
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,070
 Yes! 

528
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:09,989
If the emperor of Great Tang is captured on the battlefield,

529
00:36:09,989 --> 00:36:12,470
Great Tang is all over.

530
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,510
We're facing an existential crisis.

531
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:19,310
If we show weakness and defense, the truth will be exposed.

532
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,069
I must be there.

533
00:36:21,069 --> 00:36:23,049
Only in this way could the Ashile Tribe believe

534
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:26,570
Tang is confident of success.

535
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:33,230
Don't worry. I'm always lucky.

536
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:39,069
Shuyu, you must take Changge to a safe place.

537
00:36:39,069 --> 00:36:40,669
Yes.

538
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:13,550
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

539
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,049
Your Majesty, please don't go.

540
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:17,230
Please don't go to war.

541
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,488
Now you two reach a consensus.

542
00:37:22,489 --> 00:37:24,329
- Hands off. 
 - Your Majesty.

543
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:27,169
Your Majesty, at present, the situation is still in control.

544
00:37:27,169 --> 00:37:30,750
Please reconsider it and find another way.

545
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,949
I'm the emperor of Great Tang.

546
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:37,729
I'm also a part of Great Tang.

547
00:37:37,729 --> 00:37:42,169
It's my final responsibility to defend the country.

548
00:37:42,169 --> 00:37:43,710
It's urgent now.

549
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,788
I must go and fight myself.

550
00:37:45,788 --> 00:37:49,828
Only in this way can I show Tang's prestige, improve morale, and reduce causalities.

551
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:54,968
I spent half of my life on the battlefield and never feared any battle.

552
00:37:54,968 --> 00:37:56,528
Now Yanli's isolated force has come here.

553
00:37:56,529 --> 00:37:58,248
He must be afraid now.

554
00:37:58,249 --> 00:38:01,609
He'll be more terrified when he sees me.

555
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:05,248
It's all or nothing.

556
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:07,750
Just stay here and see it.

557
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:09,710
Hands off.

558
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,309
Your Majesty!

559
00:38:11,309 --> 00:38:13,929
- Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty.

560
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:20,768
 Your Majesty! 

561
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:23,650
Your Majesty, be careful!

562
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:55,050
 Attack! 

563
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:43,110
Fight!

564
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,968
Let go of me, Wei Shuyu.

565
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:48,070
I won't let you go in any case.

566
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:51,089
Do you think you can hold me back?

567
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:52,789
I'll try my best.

568
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:54,528
I can't put you in danger again.

569
00:39:54,529 --> 00:39:56,329
You're ridiculous.

570
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:59,910
Who on earth put me in danger all the way?

571
00:40:00,589 --> 00:40:02,569
You haven't changed at all.

572
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:06,390
Just like before, you're still a self-righteous playboy.

573
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:09,489
I know you won't believe me no matter what I say.

574
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:12,528
But you met His Majesty now, you know he didn't intend to kill you.

575
00:40:12,529 --> 00:40:14,910
We still have time.

576
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:16,728
Go to Chang'an with me.

577
00:40:16,729 --> 00:40:18,229
Enough.

578
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:23,969
From the day my father was killed, nothing can return to the past.

579
00:40:24,729 --> 00:40:27,389
We can't go back as well.

580
00:40:27,389 --> 00:40:29,669
You don't need to tell me that.

581
00:40:29,669 --> 00:40:31,629
I don't need your care.

582
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:34,229
I didn't need it before.

583
00:40:34,229 --> 00:40:36,330
I don't need it now.

584
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,410
Changge.

585
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:44,568
Changge, it's a war out there. Where are you going?

586
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:47,330
It's none of your business.  Out of the way!

587
00:41:06,389 --> 00:41:09,088
Look, Khan. It's Li Shimin.

588
00:41:09,088 --> 00:41:12,169
The emperor of Tang came here in person.

589
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:14,570
It's strange.

590
00:41:15,189 --> 00:41:17,189
It can't be...

591
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:30,748
 Hail Great Tang! 

592
00:42:17,009 --> 00:42:19,028
You traveled a long way here.

593
00:42:19,028 --> 00:42:20,590
Won't you go ahead, Khan?

594
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:24,349
Li Shimin, stop your bullying.

595
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:27,270
Who on earth is bullying?

596
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:31,649
Ashile Tribe and Great Tang promised each other to be brothers.

597
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,950
You broke the promise first and led an army here.

598
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:38,610
You treat a brother like this, right?

599
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:44,829
I come here alone only to tell you I don't like war,

600
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:46,750
but I don't fear it.

601
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:51,329
Hundreds of thousands of soldiers gather on the Weishui River shore.

602
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:56,129
I don't want the blood of soldiers to flow into the river.

603
00:42:56,129 --> 00:42:59,448
I'm much less willing to see the warriors from the grasslands to die here.

604
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:01,349
We're the warriors from the grasslands.

605
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:04,150
We fight for faith and are not afraid of death.

606
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:08,670
If you insist to fight, along the Weishui River tonight,

607
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:11,030
we won't withdraw from the battle.
