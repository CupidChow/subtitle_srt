(This is a work of fiction.)

00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,239
(Episode 18)

4
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,959
All right.

5
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:40,799
Stop it.

6
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,400
Aren't you the newly appointed military strategist?

7
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
What's the matter?

8
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,079
Do you think that since His Highness values you,

9
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,920
you can ride roughshod over us?

10
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,760
We have our own rules in the grasslands.

11
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,120
Even if you're with His Highness,

12
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,239
you can't break the rules either.

13
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:54,280
What's the matter?

14
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,920
Do you want to join in too?

15
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,519
How about...

16
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:58,680
Come on. Join us.

17
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,719
Let's drink...

18
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,079
Get lost.

19
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,879
Didn't you hear him? He told you to scram!

20
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:14,680
- Don't go anywhere. - Just wait.

21
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,840
- Just stay there! - Just wait!

22
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,039
I...

23
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,280
Thank you.

24
00:02:54,919 --> 00:02:56,960
You should wipe your face. Your face is full of it.

25
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Let me help you.

26
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,000
You're so pretty.

27
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,080
Drink some of this.

28
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:14,840
I'm Li Shi Si.

29
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,360
What's your name?

30
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,759
Mimi Guli.

31
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,639
You look different from them.

32
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,120
You're not from the Ashina Tribe, right?

33
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
I am...

34
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,639
a slave sent to the Ashina Tribe.

35
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,000
I only have men's clothes here.

36
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,280
Just wear it for now.

37
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,280
I'll get changed.

38
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,759
Get changed first.

39
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,240
I'll wait outside.

40
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,639
I'm done.

41
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,050
What are you hiding in your clothes?

42
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:44,680
I...

43
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
I'm sorry.

44
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:04,360
I...

45
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
I promise.

46
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,839
I'll never steal again.

47
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,050
I won't do it again.

48
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,050
Please don't kick me out.

49
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,319
I can do a lot of things.

50
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:12,319
Look.

51
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,319
I can clean the place.

52
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,279
I know how to cook and do laundry too.

53
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,000
I can do anything. Look.

54
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,680
I'm good at what I do.

55
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,079
You don't have to hide things anymore.

56
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,279
You get to eat what I eat.

57
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,839
Sleep here tonight.

58
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,959
That's my bed.

59
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,279
I'll be right back.

60
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,439
Don't answer when someone calls you.

(Xijiao Textile Workshop)

62
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,759
Pick a line with your right hand.

63
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,759
Put your hands together.

64
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,439
Go through the line in the middle.

65
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,319
Pick one more with your left hand.

66
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,560
Very good.

67
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,839
Flip it over.

68
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,560
Do you want to play this?

69
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,720
Li Le Yan.

70
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,720
Are you stupid?

71
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,480
Look at what they're doing.

72
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,240
What are you doing?

73
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,439
Are you trying to make me mad?

74
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,839
I'm just trying to untangle it.

75
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,920
If you can't undo it tonight, you can't go to bed!

76
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,839
Did God send you to test me?

77
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,040
I'm so furious. Come.

78
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,120
Help her!

79
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,120
- Here. - I really don't understand.

80
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,360
You've been learning this for days.

81
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,920
What did you learn?

82
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:12,959
Who is it?

83
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,639
Why are you going through my stuff?

84
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,759
I'm working.

85
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,879
You did all these?

86
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,639
If you don't want others to touch your things,

87
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:33,960
I won't do it again.

88
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,639
I'm sorry.

89
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,090
Please don't kick me out.

90
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:39,879
That's her!

91
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,159
Li Shi Si.

92
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,330
You can't let this woman stay here.

93
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:46,330
What is going to happen if she can't stay here?

94
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,450
Should I kill her?

95
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:48,919
What's the point of doing this?

96
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,240
You can just kick her out.

97
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:52,960
I'm begging you. Don't kick me out.

98
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,960
If I get kicked out,

99
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,679
the wolves will eat me up!

100
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,039
Even if I do get out of here,

101
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,519
if Great Khan finds out that I am a runaway slave,

102
00:08:58,519 --> 00:08:59,919
he'll kill me too.

103
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:02,240
- Don't... - Why do you talk so much nonsense?

104
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,759
- Come on! - No!

105
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,639
You...

106
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,679
Are you a dog?

107
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,879
You go around biting people!

108
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,919
You...

109
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,360
Are you done?

110
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,679
Ashina Sun.

111
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:29,279
Your Highness, can you give this servant to me?

112
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:33,879
You may go.

113
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
In this place,

114
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:41,879
randomly taking in people...

115
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:43,759
isn't a good thing.

116
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,360
Since I'm here to work for you,

117
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,210
then I'll also manage my people.

118
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:49,639
Don't you trust me?

119
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
Let's go.

120
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,039
I got bitten for nothing!

121
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,330
What's wrong?

122
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:10,000
Did you catch a cold last night?

123
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:13,279
How about this? I'll get you some horse milk wine.

124
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,759
Wait here.

125
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,450
- Ashina Sun. - Come and catch me!

126
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,450
Although you agreed to let Li Shi Si be your military strategist,

127
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,090
I advise you to be wary of him a bit.

128
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,120
Don't trust him too much.

129
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,279
Why?

130
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,450
We don't know where he came from.

131
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,720
I know who he is.

132
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,399
But he's not from the grasslands.

133
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,399
He is now.

134
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,240
But people from the Central Plain have always been tricky.

135
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:42,840
Ashina Sun.

136
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,159
I don't mean anything by that.

137
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,840
Are you all right?

138
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,519
I'm fine.

139
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,879
Here.

140
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:07,840
Have some hot soup. It's good for you.

141
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Just mine?

142
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,639
What about you?

143
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,480
I'm not hungry yet.

144
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
Drink up.

145
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,720
You drink it.

146
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,200
I don't have an appetite.

147
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:22,000
Drink this and go to sleep.

148
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,759
Even if that cot is small, make do with it.

149
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,879
There's no need.

150
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,440
I'll just sleep on the floor.

151
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,799
You should sleep early.

152
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,480
That's how you'll get better.

153
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,039
Do whatever you want.

154
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,799
But you don't have to be wary of me.

155
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,320
I won't hurt you.

156
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,639
Mother, don't go. Mother.

157
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,480
Mother.

158
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,159
Mother.

159
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:23,879
Mother.

160
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:25,960
Mother.

161
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,600
Mother, come back.

162
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:34,960
I'm so cold.

163
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,720
Bu Zhen, don't move.

164
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,279
Bu Zhen?

165
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,639
Who is Bu Zhen?

166
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,879
Li Shi Si. I'm coming in.

167
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,279
I'll go ahead.

168
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,279
Hold on!

169
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:37,879
Wait!

170
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,000
Wait!

171
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,360
Stop!

172
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,600
Stop! I have something to tell you!

173
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,559
- Let me warn you. - Me?

174
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,000
From now on, don't wander around the camp.

175
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
And don't go near Prince Sun's tent.

176
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,960
Why are you acting like this?

177
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
Don't come near me!

178
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,360
Do you want to bite me again?

179
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,120
I'm warning you. Don't wander around too much.

180
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,399
Or you'll be sorry!

181
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,320
I really have something to tell you.

182
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,000
I live with Military Strategist Li now.

183
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,840
There's not enough food for both of us.

184
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,679
You have to prepare some food for us.

185
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,720
Why are you telling me that? Tell Military Strategist Li.

186
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,200
- You're eating here? - Yes.

187
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,559
- Here. - Here. Pour him a cup full.

188
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,559
Drink up.

189
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:21,960
Pour the wine.

190
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,480
Hey!

191
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,480
Why did you follow me?

192
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,720
Military Strategist Li is sick.

193
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,919
Yesterday, he gave me the last remaining food.

194
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,120
We need food.

195
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:35,240
There's a quota for every tent.

196
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,720
You've already taken yours.

197
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,200
- You can't take that. - Move!

198
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,240
You...

199
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,080
I'm almost done.

200
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Have a seat.

201
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,200
By the way,

202
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:24,559
don't the people of Tang like to use this?

203
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,279
I made these using a branch.

204
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,440
I hope you like it.

205
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,200
Do as the locals do.

206
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,440
I don't use these anymore.

207
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,960
But I really like your gift.

208
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,440
Thank you.

209
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:49,960
Etiquette requires reciprocation.

210
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,559
Is there anything you want?

211
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:52,919
Me?

212
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,480
Is Bu Zhen your family?

213
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,720
Do you want to be freed...

214
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,080
and go back to your family?

215
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,279
My clan...

216
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,480
has already been invaded by the Ashina Tribe.

217
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,120
They're either dead...

218
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
or dispersed already.

219
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,120
I no longer have a family.

220
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:20,559
So I'm really grateful that you're letting me stay...

221
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,679
by your side.

222
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,559
So we're the same.

223
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
The same?

224
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,559
Could it be that your family...

225
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,039
My family is also dead.

226
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:36,440
They were killed by my enemy.

227
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:41,200
Let's not talk about unhappy things.

228
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,879
Since we met under these circumstances,

229
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,159
this must be fate.

230
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,600
From now on,

231
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,200
you can think of me as your family.

232
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,399
Here.

233
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,200
Take the bigger one.

234
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:13,799
I'm exhausted.

235
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,319
We're almost done.

236
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,799
Let's take a break.

237
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,200
That sounds good.

238
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:37,170
I'm exhausted.

239
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:39,759
- I'm exhausted. - You're exhausted?

240
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,240
Don't you know that we must deliver the goods tomorrow?

241
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,170
Have you finished all your work?

242
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,680
If we can't deliver this batch of goods,

243
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,920
get out of here!

244
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,279
Get back to work.

245
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,200
Madam Zhang.

246
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,440
Don't cause trouble!

247
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,759
Li Le Yan, did you do that on purpose?

248
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:01,839
Look at what you did.

249
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:03,240
Scram! Get out of here!

250
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,279
Get her out of here!

251
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,079
- Come on. Hurry up! - Don't...

252
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,170
That's enough.

253
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:08,240
- Get out. - Stop.

254
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,359
- Get out of here. - Get her out of here.

255
00:18:10,599 --> 00:18:11,650
Get out!

256
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,720
- Get out. - Get out!

257
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:15,650
- Is Li Le Yan really stupid? - Indeed.

258
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:18,079
- Why is she so stupid? - Yes, she's not helping at all.

259
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,410
We finally managed to deliver Mr. Hu's order.

260
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,170
Let's all take a break.

261
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,359
My neck is so sore.

262
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:51,759
Why is she still here?

263
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:54,200
- Yes, she's still here. - Why are you still here?

264
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,480
- That's right. - Madam Chai.

265
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,359
I'm sorry.

266
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,240
Please give me one more chance.

267
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:02,599
Please.

268
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,440
- Ms. Li. - Why is she still...

269
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,410
You're undaunted by repeated setbacks.

270
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,519
Actually,

271
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,519
I need someone like you here.

272
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,079
But...

273
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:19,410
Do you think that after bowing,

274
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:20,680
I would say that?

275
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,200
You just say some words, and you're able to eat for free here?

276
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,079
Dream on.

277
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,599
- That's right. - Later,

278
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,200
I still have to entertain Mr. Hu.

279
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm begging you.

280
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,359
Please go.

281
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,960
My shop is too small.

282
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,920
Go and make trouble somewhere else.

283
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:41,119
Are you going to cry?

284
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,650
Look at them.

285
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:44,240
Because of you,

286
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,759
- they didn't sleep at all. - That's right.

287
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:47,759
- They want to cry. - Yes.

288
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:49,920
Tears are worthless.

289
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,000
You must earn money using your hands.

290
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,960
If I were your mother,

291
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,240
I would have hit my head and die.

292
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,759
Go.

293
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,170
Better get a crooked tree and hang yourself.

294
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,960
People like you...

295
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,480
will just eat for free in this world.

296
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,559
What a waste of food.

297
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:07,799
Well...

298
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,720
- Will she be all right? - Will she kill herself?

299
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,039
She won't really kill herself, right?

300
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,410
- You never know. - Why are you looking at me?

301
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,119
If she's bold enough to do that,

302
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,650
she died for a good cause.

303
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:26,410
She's so useless.

304
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,119
There's no point in staying alive.

305
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,119
That's enough. Go home and sleep.

306
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:33,410
I'm exhausted.

307
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:34,890
Let's go.

308
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm exhausted.

309
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,599
Have you heard?

310
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,920
The military strategist's servant...

311
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,960
kicked Mu Jin when she got angry.

312
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,240
- Really? - It's true.

313
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,480
The military strategist's slave...

314
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,650
is so fierce.

315
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:54,000
Mu Jin is weaker than her.

316
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,359
She's incredible.

317
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:57,890
That's terrible.

318
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,200
It's so embarrassing.

319
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Does it smell good?

320
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,599
Why does it smell so good today?

321
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:04,240
My kids love it.

322
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,359
Mimi Guli.

323
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:07,440
- You're washing your man's clothes? - Right.

324
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,480
I...

325
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,839
That's right, Mimi Guli.

326
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,440
We've heard about you hitting Mu Jin.

327
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,680
Mu Jin is a military strategist.

328
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,170
Did he cause you any trouble?

329
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,039
No.

330
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:19,279
He'd better not come looking for me.

331
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,440
That's good.

332
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,650
Do your laundry then.

333
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,119
- That's right. - We're leaving.

334
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,680
- We'll get going. - Get back to work.

335
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:51,519
You're crazy.

336
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,880
Pick it up.

337
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
No.

338
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,640
You and Li Shi Si totally humiliated me.

339
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:58,599
As for you two, you seem relaxed.

340
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,599
That's because you're incompetent.

341
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:02,079
Who are you calling incompetent?

342
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm talking about you. It's you.

343
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:05,519
Say that again.

344
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,720
- Tell me who's incompetent! - You!

345
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:09,279
It hurts.

346
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,119
You wench.

347
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:14,559
You're the one who's wet.

348
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:15,759
You're the wench.

349
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:16,759
It's you!

350
00:22:18,599 --> 00:22:20,240
You and Li Shi Si...

351
00:22:20,519 --> 00:22:21,680
are both bad people.

352
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:24,759
Who are you talking about?

353
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,200
You two.

354
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:28,000
How dare you comment about Shi Si.

355
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:33,440
You can't hit me!

356
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,559
You can't kick me!

357
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:36,759
You can't kick me!

358
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,240
You're a jerk!

359
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,799
Why was my heart beating so fast just now?

360
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,200
You're a fool, Mu Jin.

361
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,119
She's Li Shi Si's woman.

362
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,920
What are you thinking about?

363
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Chang Ge.

364
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:49,279
I heard that...

365
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,599
when you hang yourself,

366
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,680
your tongue will stick out.

367
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,559
If I enter your dream,

368
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:01,039
will you feel scared?

369
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,279
You talk so much nonsense.

370
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:07,559
Will you kill yourself or not?

371
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:19,319
This is how you can die from hanging.

372
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:20,880
What you did...

373
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,799
will only exert your neck a bit.

374
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,599
Back then,

375
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,680
my man thought that he was a failure.

376
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,880
He couldn't support his family,

377
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,720
so he hung himself and ended it once and for all.

378
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:37,000
Is your life so cheap?

379
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,799
If someone tells you to die, would you really do it?

380
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:41,759
If you want to die,

381
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:42,920
no one can stop you.

382
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,640
If you want to live, no one can stop you either.

383
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:47,839
You must rely on yourself.

384
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:49,079
Do you understand?

385
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,920
All right. That's enough.

386
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,559
That's enough.

387
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,960
I was a bit harsh.

388
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:09,640
I apologize.

389
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,240
Thank you, Madam Chai.

390
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Mr. Hu, look.

391
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,000
These are last month's new designs.

392
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,799
Here, this way.

393
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,279
These are designs from the western region.

394
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,480
They're very popular.

395
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,000
- Yes. - Not bad.

396
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,640
Take a look here.

397
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:57,880
Look at this embroidery.

398
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:02,039
We used gold threads for this.

399
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,079
Look at the stitches. They're so dense.

400
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,079
Yes.

401
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Not bad.

402
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,640
Here's your order this time.

403
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,839
I've long heard how meticulous Madam Chai's blankets are made.

404
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,519
This time,

405
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:22,119
why are there uneven stitches in my orders?

406
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,759
If you give us a little more time,

407
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:25,279
we'll surely do better.

408
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,079
Please be lenient to us this time, Mr. Hu.

409
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,319
That's right.

410
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,279
This...

411
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,880
Who made this?

412
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,640
- This one... - This is...

413
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,400
I told you not to follow me.

414
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,039
It's her.

415
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:46,880
Mr. Hu.

416
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,319
She embroidered it.

417
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:50,079
Isn't that right, Ms. Li?

418
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,640
Did you make the embroidery?

419
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,519
Yes, I did.

420
00:26:58,039 --> 00:26:59,119
It's nice.

421
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,359
It's really nice.

422
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:01,880
I'll take this.

423
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,720
Miss, can you make a few more...

424
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,240
and sell them to me?

425
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,039
The price is negotiable.

426
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,319
As long as you agree,

427
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:11,720
I'll buy this lichen clothing too.

428
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,920
She's our new embroiderer.

429
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,079
As for the handkerchief,

430
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,759
if the price is good,

431
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:21,519
you can have as many as you want.

432
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,160
All right. Name your price.

433
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,000
- You're amazing. - Have some dates as a reward.

434
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,039
Come on.

435
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,839
Eat more. Eat up.

436
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,519
Your Highness, why did you want...

437
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:48,759
to have roasted lamb shanks with me today?

438
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,000
Your slave is fighting with Mu Jin...

439
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,160
over a lamb shank.

440
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,359
You're my military strategist after all.

441
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,799
I don't want people to think that I'm treating you so badly.

442
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:59,000
Before,

443
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,119
would you also roast lamb shanks for Mu Jin and the others?

444
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,400
No.

445
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:08,480
This is the first time.

446
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:12,759
When I was little,

447
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,599
my father took me to roast a goat once.

448
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:16,920
Back then, I insisted on roasting it myself.

449
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,119
And I made a mess.

450
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,240
It was all burnt.

451
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,359
Then Father...

452
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,240
took all the burnt parts and ate them.

453
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,160
So from then on, I worked hard to learn how to roast lamb shanks.

454
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,920
I don't want to disappoint him anymore.

455
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:30,039
I didn't expect that something like that would've happened...

456
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:31,039
between you and your father.

457
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:32,920
When I was little,

458
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:34,680
my father used to dote on me.

459
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,680
But later on...

460
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,079
Enough about me.

461
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:46,839
Tell me about your father.

462
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:48,960
I have nothing to say about him.

463
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,319
He rarely kept me company.

464
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,200
You can't blame him.

465
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,920
He was the crown prince after all.

466
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,839
It wasn't unusual for him to be busy.

467
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,079
When did you find out?

468
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,079
When you were able to freely enter Youzhou's Governor's Manor,

469
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,079
I already knew that you're not an ordinary person.

470
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,039
Later on,

471
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,160
I heard them calling you "Princess Yongning".

472
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,119
And everything was clear.

473
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,400
Since you've long known my identity,

474
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,440
the reason you didn't expose me...

475
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,880
is so you can use me?

476
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:21,160
Yes.

477
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:22,799
I used you.

478
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,319
I used you...

479
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,519
to torment myself.

480
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,359
I saved you in Chang'an.

481
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:32,799
I saved you in Youzhou. I still saved you in Shuozhou.

482
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,400
Now, in the grasslands,

483
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,799
I'm roasting lamb shanks for a slave like you.

484
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,599
I've really used you.

485
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:51,319
What's the matter?

486
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,160
You didn't forget everything, did you?

487
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
No.

488
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:57,640
Let's eat.

489
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,400
I'm already considered dead in Tang anyway.

490
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,119
I have nothing to worry about now.

491
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,559
I'll change my name from now on.

492
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:15,240
I'm Li Chang Ge.

493
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:17,359
I like the name Chang Ge.

494
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,559
Chang Ge?

495
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,400
Chang Ge.

496
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,119
What is she doing?

497
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,880
Does she wish to give herself to me?

498
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,880
Hey.

499
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,079
It's dark and windy.

500
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:58,000
I'm a hot-blooded man after all.

501
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,160
You shouldn't be doing this.

502
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,920
You...

503
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:09,759
Chang Ge.

504
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
Chang Ge.

505
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,640
Chang Ge, you...

506
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:24,559
Why is he carrying her in the middle of the night?

507
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,200
Shi Si Lang, what's wrong?

508
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,960
I don't know what happened either.

509
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,960
He suddenly...

510
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:42,160
Are you not feeling well?

511
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,519
Lie down first.

512
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,319
Blood?

513
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,519
Why are you bleeding?

514
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,640
Mimi.

515
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,160
Place this on your stomach.

516
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:03,920
What's wrong with Military Strategist Li?

517
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,039
Is he hurt?

518
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,240
It's all right. He's fine.

519
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,359
- He's fine. - He...

520
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,440
He seems to be in so much pain.

521
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,440
I told you he's fine.

522
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:15,359
No. He seemed to be in pain. He's injured!

523
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,440
I told you he's fine.

524
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,720
But he...

525
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,799
Could it be...

526
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:25,400
Could it be...

527
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,279
I knew it.

528
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:29,880
You treat her so differently.

529
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,599
Have you long known that she's a woman?

530
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:34,160
You're becoming more and more dishonest.

531
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,240
Chang Ge is weak.

532
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:38,160
We must give her a sheep to nourish her.

533
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,319
Chang Ge?

534
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:40,680
It's Shi Si Lang's name.

535
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:43,119
So Shi Si Lang's name is Chang Ge.

536
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,039
How many secrets have you been keeping from me?

537
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:49,359
Tell me.

538
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:52,319
Ashina Sun.

539
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,039
I thought you were a man.

540
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,599
I wanted to rely on you...

541
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:01,839
for the rest of my life.

542
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:05,559
Why are you laughing?

543
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:06,680
You shouldn't laugh!

544
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,599
I'm really sad.

545
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,119
Mimi.

546
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,160
You can still treat me as your family.

547
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,359
It's fine.

548
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,960
But it's still different.

549
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,200
How is it different?

550
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,079
I realized that...

551
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:24,200
it's not that you're good at pretending to be a man.

552
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,279
But you actually...

553
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,680
don't even realize that you're a woman.

554
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,519
In this world,

555
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:29,640
men must fight.

556
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,680
They must look after their territory and women.

557
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:32,880
And women...

558
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,720
must find a strong man to have children with...

559
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,319
and protect the elderly and children.

560
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,400
And yet...

561
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:41,440
you have been fighting with them like a man.

562
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,359
But you're using a woman's body.

563
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,160
What are you thinking?

564
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:48,559
I don't know what I'm thinking either.

565
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,960
What is a man?

566
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,559
What is a woman?

567
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:56,279
I never really tried to figure it out before.

568
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,680
Those gentlemen are men.

569
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:00,559
Scholars can bring stability to the land.

570
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,799
Martial artists can bring peace to the nation.

571
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:03,680
They're all outstanding.

572
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,000
They're all talented people.

573
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,200
But how am I different from them?

574
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:09,880
My father's wife and concubines were all women.

575
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:12,159
They were dressed up so elegantly.

576
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,880
He's got sideburns.

577
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:17,719
Everyone's mind has changed.

578
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:19,639
But what does that...

579
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,400
have to do with me?

580
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:25,039
Anyway,

581
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:27,840
in the next few days, just stay here.

582
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,840
Don't go with them...

583
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,880
and let the cold wind blow on you out there.

584
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,880
This isn't right.

585
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:36,809
You lied to me.

586
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,039
Your name must not be Shi Si Lang then.

587
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,719
My name is Li Chang Ge.

588
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:43,679
"Li Chang Ge".

589
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:47,809
Then...

590
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:49,239
does Prince Sun...

591
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:51,239
know about this?

592
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,840
Then he has been hiding it all along.

593
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:58,199
Could it be...

594
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:00,329
that he has feelings for you?

595
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,920
What are you talking about?

596
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,400
He just knows that I'm useful to him.

597
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,559
That's why he's a bit concerned about me.

598
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,400
Are you feeling better?

599
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,679
It would feel better if you warm your stomach with it.

600
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,920
What are you waiting for?

601
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,119
Move them.

602
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,769
Moving wool is the simplest task.

603
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,769
Can you do it or not?

604
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,360
I can do it.

605
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,119
Why are you still standing there?

606
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:00,559
Come and help me!

607
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:02,000
- I'm coming. - Come on.

608
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,119
It's all over the place.

609
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:05,840
Here and here too.

610
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,480
- Get them off me. - There's another one here.

611
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,329
It's on your head too.

612
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:11,840
You've got some here.

613
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:16,360
Wool Yan Er!

614
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,960
- Wool Yan Er! - Wool Yan Er!

615
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,360
It's all over you.

616
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:21,119
Li Wool Yan.

617
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:22,440
Are you stupid?

618
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,159
I just told you to move the wool. Look.

619
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:25,719
You got it all over us.

620
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:26,840
Madam Chai, I...

621
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,079
Look at your hair.

622
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,119
- Right. - My goodness.

623
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,519
Look at you.

624
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,769
This little fool doesn't know how to do anything.

625
00:36:49,769 --> 00:36:52,239
- How is she still alive? - Exactly.

626
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,199
It's all thanks to you.

627
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,440
You're such precious people.

628
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,599
You saved me.

629
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:00,519
That's why I'm still alive.

630
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:02,599
This is the first time someone called me precious.

631
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:03,769
Is she talking about you?

632
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:05,159
Count your pay.

633
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,360
You're not precious at all.

634
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,599
How is it not precious?

635
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,239
Our wool clothing...

636
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:11,289
is given as an offering to the prefecture offices.

637
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:12,480
Perhaps...

638
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,639
they're even sent to the palace.

639
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,880
Lichen clothing for the imperial family.

640
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:19,880
You're working so hard.

641
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,480
They might not cherish the clothing you made.

642
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,519
Why should we talk about this nonsense?

643
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,480
They were born without having to worry about making a living.

644
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,289
How would they know that behind their clothes,

645
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:32,719
there are a lot of grievances?

646
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,719
God is fair.

647
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,199
The people in the palace...

648
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:38,880
are being worshipped and fed by the citizens.

649
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,679
They can get anything they want.

650
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:42,920
So they must be responsible...

651
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:45,079
for the citizens.

652
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,599
As for us,

653
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,119
even though we're poor,

654
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:49,329
we just need to fill our stomachs.

655
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,199
- Am I right? - Exactly.

656
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,679
Let's just focus on ourselves...

657
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:53,920
and do things right.

658
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,519
If we can't do things right, we just go to sleep.

659
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,039
If the imperial family can't do things right,

660
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,840
can they fall asleep?

661
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:02,719
We...

662
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,599
are just after our salary.

663
00:38:04,599 --> 00:38:05,599
Yes.

664
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,599
Do the work that you need to do.

665
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:11,400
Don't run away once we mention our salaries, Madam Chai.

666
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,360
- Yes. When did we last get a raise? - Get back to work.

667
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,119
We're talking about salary. Don't run away.

668
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,360
Let me talk to you about the salary.

669
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,519
If you won't increase our salary, at least buy some biscuits for us.

670
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:20,360
- That's right. - Stop.

671
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,360
Don't run away.

672
00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:27,289
Stop.

673
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:46,079
Le Yan.

674
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:48,400
I must find you.

675
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:51,639
Go!

676
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,199
Go!

677
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:57,719
Mimi.

678
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,239
You're a woman.

679
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,559
Don't work too hard.

680
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:01,559
From now on,

681
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:02,719
you can ask me to help you.

682
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:03,960
I'll carry the water for you.

683
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:06,679
Don't look down on me. I'm really incredible. Look.

684
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:09,559
Be careful. My clothes...

685
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:10,679
Don't let my clothes...

686
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:13,289
What's wrong? Is it too heavy?

687
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:14,400
No.

688
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
My foot!

689
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,360
You're bleeding!

690
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,039
What rotten luck.

691
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:27,199
Who threw away this nail?

692
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
I'm fine.

693
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,199
I'm just making a fuss because this rarely happens.

694
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:33,639
Go ahead.

695
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:34,920
I need a minute.

696
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,119
I'll bring you back.

697
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:40,239
Let's leave the stuff here first.

698
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,599
- Be careful. - I'm really all right. I'm fine.

699
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,440
Take it slow.

700
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:06,199
You've just recovered.

701
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:07,840
Don't get sick again.

702
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,440
Don't worry. I'm not that weak.

703
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,039
Keep it.

704
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,480
You can wear it when you feel cold.

705
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:19,199
You haven't accomplished anything yet.

706
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,289
I don't want to lose my investment.

707
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:24,079
Don't worry, Your Highness.

708
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,599
I'll surely accomplish the three things I promised you.

709
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:29,519
Do you have any instructions for me today?

710
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:31,840
I was making my rounds in the camp and I just passed by.

711
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:33,559
All by yourself?

712
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,119
Where's that woman with you?

713
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:40,719
She's doing laundry.

714
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:42,809
She's lucky...

715
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,769
to have you as her master.

716
00:40:45,289 --> 00:40:46,480
I'm not her master.

717
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:48,880
We're friends who treasure each other.

718
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,559
In life, the people around you...

719
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:53,400
always leave one by one.

720
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,199
Trusting new people...

721
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,639
and saying goodbye to old friends...

722
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,920
are all very difficult to do in life.

723
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:02,840
Instead of saying that she's lucky,

724
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,960
consider me...

725
00:41:05,559 --> 00:41:06,719
the lucky one instead...

726
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:09,039
for meeting someone I want to cherish.

727
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,480
Me too.

728
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,039
Go make your rounds, Your Highness.

729
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,599
Otherwise, the sun will set soon.

730
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:25,400
Why don't you join me?

731
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:27,559
You haven't really gotten to know the grassland yet.

732
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,480
When it gets dark,

733
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,039
I'll take you somewhere.

734
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:32,880
I just don't know if you'll dare.

735
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,639
Why wouldn't I?

736
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,039
It's so beautiful.

737
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:12,159
I accidentally found this place when I was doing my rounds.

738
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:14,079
Do you like it?

739
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:18,809
This should be the last time...

740
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:20,289
that we'd get to see fireflies this year.

741
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:22,440
We'll get to see them again next year.

742
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:26,719
Who knows where we'll be next year...

743
00:42:27,769 --> 00:42:30,000
and if we'd get a chance to see fireflies again?

744
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:33,079
If you want to see them again next year,

745
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:35,639
just let me know.

746
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,079
No matter where you are,

747
00:42:38,769 --> 00:42:39,920
I'll surely be there.

748
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:52,079
I'm afraid I can't make it.

749
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,960
Besides, beautiful things like fireflies...

750
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,440
are fleeting.

751
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,360
So why look forward to them?

752
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:49,760
