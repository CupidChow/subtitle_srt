23
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:49,709
I'm surprised you hit His Highness for me.

24
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:51,169
Thanks.

25
00:01:51,169 --> 00:01:52,729
Why are you here?

26
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:54,949
Did you ask the emperor for this?

27
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:57,410
I'm here to get you out.

28
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,228
You'll be able to leave soon.

29
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,729
Me?

30
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:02,429
How about you?

31
00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:06,490
You...

32
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,700
What does it take to free you?

33
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,409
She'er, before you leave,

34
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:18,530
there's something I would like to tell you.

35
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:21,670
I didn't kill your wolf.

36
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:25,909
Over the years, this is the only thing I can't let go of.

37
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,610
Father didn't want us to bond with each other.

38
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,850
Only our rivalry was in the best interest of his reign.

39
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,409
So he had your wolf cub killed,

40
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:39,830
made a quiver from its skin and gave it to me.

41
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,847
Why wait to tell me now?

42
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:44,743
I just wanted you to know it.

43
00:02:44,743 --> 00:02:46,323
Well?

44
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,309
Are you afraid this is your only chance?

45
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,619
Or do you think I can't take the truth?

46
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,858
Can you?

47
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:56,480
Even if you could,

48
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,800
would you dare to stand up to him?

49
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,239
She'er, for the tribe,

50
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,539
one of us must stand up and do it.

51
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,638
And that is me.

52
00:03:14,638 --> 00:03:18,500
Sun, what are you going to do?

53
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,088
I believe you all recognize Mu Jin of the Eagle Division.

54
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:43,230
He's been lurking in Dingxiang for days, plotting a rebellion.

55
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,548
The Ashile Tribe has been relocated to Dingxiang.

56
00:03:45,548 --> 00:03:47,248
You should always keep it in mind.

57
00:03:47,249 --> 00:03:48,989
Swear your loyalty here.

58
00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:53,770
This is how traitors will end up.

59
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,650
Don't worry,

60
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,449
I won't let you die before your master is here.

61
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:13,149
I won't blink an eye if you want to kill me.

62
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,670
   

63
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,390
Mother.

64
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:42,070
I thought you would never come here.

65
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,540
I am and will always be your son.

66
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,899
If we don't agree with each other,

67
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:54,419
we will only end drifting away from each other.

68
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,188
Mother, during these days in prison,

69
00:05:01,188 --> 00:05:03,290
I kept thinking about the old days.

70
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,788
I slept in your arms every day as a little boy.

71
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:07,429
You were always there for me.

72
00:05:07,429 --> 00:05:10,310
We didn't have to fight for anything,

73
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,130
nor did we worry or fear anything.

74
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,249
It was the happiest time.

75
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:27,049
But this happiest time in your memory was nothing but fragile.

76
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:32,299
It would easily fall apart
with one word from your uncle.

77
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:34,598
Everything I do now,

78
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:39,900
I do it to make sure no one can tear us apart in the future.

79
00:05:42,354 --> 00:05:46,628
Only when we are strong,

80
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:49,189
can we secure happiness.

81
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:51,289
Understood?

82
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,359
Come on. Come home with me.

83
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:35,058
Your Majesty, this princess of Great Tang here claims to be the Princess of Mobei. 
    

84
00:06:35,058 --> 00:06:38,759
I wonder if it is your arrangement.

85
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:43,309
I really wish it was my arrangement.

86
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,589
It's a pity that she would rather be the Princess of Mobei

87
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,029
than come back to Chang'an.

88
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,309
Envoys, whatever is between me and Great Tang is personal. 
    

89
00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:02,509
It's complicated,

90
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:04,768
which I won't tell to save your time.

91
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,259
Now that I'm here on behalf of Mobei,

92
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,139
it means it is authorized by the Emperor of Mobei,

93
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,599
which I believe you all know.

94
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,578
That's true.

95
00:07:13,578 --> 00:07:18,219
The Emperor of Mobei has reached an agreement with my father to make an alliance with Tang.

96
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:27,289
Also, I don't think I need to tell you what I'm going to do with her, do I?

97
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:29,508
Or is it that the identity of this princess 
    

98
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:32,749
is important to our alliance?

99
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:34,209
No, it isn't.

100
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:38,599
It's the domestic affair of Great Tang, which is none of our business.

101
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,738
I'm just wondering since you set free Young Khan

102
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:44,358
and made a deal with the Ashile Tribe,

103
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:48,500
why did you lie that you would ally with us?

104
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,510
   

105
00:08:13,644 --> 00:08:18,418
Is this a list of our people who were abducted by the Ashile Tribe?

106
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:19,879
 There is a list? 

107
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,428
Since the beginning, we had been planning to get your captives back for you.

108
00:08:24,428 --> 00:08:27,828
Envoys, this is a list of captives kept by the Ashile Tribe, 
    

109
00:08:27,828 --> 00:08:29,524
without anyone left out.

110
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:33,205
Your Majesty, is this why you freed Young Khan?

111
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:37,429
Young Khan intended to assassinate my son

112
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:40,169
and had his bodyguard killed.

113
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,130
The list is the only reason

114
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:48,170
why I set free someone who had committed such a felony.

115
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,410
This Treaty of Alliance will be valid forever. 
    

116
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,567
If you don't want to sign it, for now, I will not force you.

117
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:02,389
And you don't need to worry,

118
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:08,108
as I will still send your people home safe and sound.

119
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:12,909
If we don't sign it, will we still be able to leave here?

120
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,210
 Yes, can we? 

121
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,009
You can leave as you please. 
    

122
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:20,789
Instead of stopping you, we'll send soldiers to escort you.

123
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:25,589
It's a long journey which will take you some time.

124
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,729
By the time you get home,

125
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:32,130
you will find your people once imprisoned are already there.

126
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:37,472
So they've already sent them back.

127
00:09:38,801 --> 00:09:42,409
I promise whether you sign the treaty or not,

128
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:45,768
you'll have nothing to worry about.

129
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:49,400
For those who sign the treaty, shall you need our help in the future,

130
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,199
you will have our full support.

131
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,639
 - Sounds good. 
 - That's a big relief. 

132
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:58,379
 Right, it's wonderful. 

133
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:00,918
I just had a narrow escape from death. 
    

134
00:10:00,918 --> 00:10:04,439
I guess I do owe Great Tang a debt of gratitude. 
    

135
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:06,399
I believe you.

136
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,520
The Tiele Tribe is willing to sign the Treaty of Alliance.

137
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,420
   

138
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,380
So is Monan.

139
00:10:36,164 --> 00:10:40,545
Princess, if you're afraid of the pain, we've prepared a red seal.

140
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,439
Envoys, we came here to make an alliance. 
    

141
00:10:58,439 --> 00:11:01,260
Do you want to leave here without signing the treaty?

142
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,759
 Let's sign it. 
   

143
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,760
 Okay. 
   

144
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,220
   

145
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,020
   

146
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,935
 This is... 
   

147
00:12:47,239 --> 00:12:50,520
On the blood pledge signed today,

148
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,219
in face of any disaster and war,

149
00:12:56,219 --> 00:12:59,279
the Great Tang shall stand by your side.

150
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,799
You have my word.

151
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:52,850
Mimi.

152
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:58,108
If you want, I can pull you out of my mother's service.

153
00:13:58,108 --> 00:13:59,269
No, thank you.

154
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,690
Why?

155
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:05,270
I have to stay by her side because there's someone I want to meet.

156
00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:11,869
I'll protect you when we get to Dingxiang.

157
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:51,089
Changge, I know you detest me,

158
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:54,690
but I'm still your second uncle.

159
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:59,810
If you like, I'll put you down as a daughter of the empress,

160
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,389
so that you'll enjoy the same treatment as Yueyan.

161
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,969
You can lead a carefree life in Chang'an.

162
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:09,349
No one will force you to marry or do anything you don't like.

163
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:14,170
Is this why you let Sun go to Dingxiang alone, facing the unknown?

164
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:18,589
So that I will lead a carefree life?

165
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:21,669
That was General Sun's own decision.

166
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:25,890
You should know why he did it.

167
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,069
I don't want a glamorous life in Chang'an

168
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:31,729
or the title of a princess.

169
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:35,269
Wherever Sun is, I'll follow him there.

170
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:38,109
Dingxiang will be a dangerous place soon.

171
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:40,408
I can't let you take another risk.

172
00:15:40,408 --> 00:15:45,630
Changge, you're home now.

173
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,988
I won't let you leave again.

174
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,889
Home?

175
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:56,140
As far as your administration is concerned, I'm a snake in the grass.

176
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,680
Why do you want me to stay?

177
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,748
Or is it that you're trying to make up to me

178
00:16:02,748 --> 00:16:05,069
to feel better about yourself?

179
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:07,330
Make up to you?

180
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:18,910
I'm doing it because this is your mom's last wish.

181
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,308
She wanted you to be safe.

182
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:29,250
This is the only thing she asked of me before she died.

183
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,950
My mother?

184
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:01,209
 I knew this day would come. 

185
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,830
 I'll have you and Changge escorted away. 

186
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:11,410
 No matter what life you would like to lead, I'll make sure you have it. 

187
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,788
 Under this circumstance, 

188
00:17:14,788 --> 00:17:19,810
 you're still as considerate as in the old days. 

189
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:24,809
 However, I won't be able to enjoy it anymore. 

190
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,869
 Madam, please don't say this. 

191
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:29,750
 Politics is by nature very complicated. 

192
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:35,579
 Even if you hadn't done it, we might be facing the same result. 

193
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:37,580
 No. 

194
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,940
 My conscience won't leave me alone. 

195
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:49,760
 It was me who wrote you the letter the other day. 

196
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,120
 I knew I could never go back then. 

197
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,579
 His Highness didn't love me, but he did treat me well. 

198
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,959
 Yet I betrayed him. 

199
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,838
 It was not my intention to kill him. 

200
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:34,539
 If you hadn't killed him, you would have been killed. 

201
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:40,139
 A woman like me has no voice in political affairs. 

202
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:48,978
 You saved my life once and treated Changge like your own daughter. 

203
00:18:48,978 --> 00:18:51,118
 You've taught her so much. 

204
00:18:51,118 --> 00:18:56,299
 She looked upon you as her father, too. I'm well aware of it. 

205
00:18:57,089 --> 00:19:01,420
 Now, by doing what I did, 

206
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:08,520
 I've requited your kindness. 

207
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,600
 But His Highness... 

208
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,460
 How could I ever be able to requite his kindness to me? 

209
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:26,620
 Still, I should thank you. 

210
00:19:34,152 --> 00:19:35,113
 Don't! 

211
00:19:35,113 --> 00:19:37,413
 You stay there. 

212
00:19:37,413 --> 00:19:38,978
 Promise me. 

213
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:44,400
 Keep Changge safe. 

214
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,099
 Make her happy. 

215
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:49,699
 Let her do whatever she likes. 

216
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:53,358
 Don't you force her to marry someone she doesn't love. 

217
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,159
 Don't ever make her sad. 

218
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,059
 Promise me! 

219
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:00,158
 I promise you. Put that down. 

220
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:07,059
 Finally, I owe no one now. 

221
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,480
 Jin! 

222
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,468
My father and you.

223
00:20:24,468 --> 00:20:28,489
No matter who died, my mom would die too. Right?

224
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,029
Where's the letter?

225
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:36,990
I want to see it.

226
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:41,030
I burned it.

227
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,509
I can't keep it as evidence.

228
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:47,068
The letter was your mother's way of returning my favor.

229
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:54,829
In that difficult situation, she chose to kill herself for closure.

230
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:58,583
I find myself having not owing anyone my whole life,

231
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,499
but every time I think of her,

232
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:06,890
my heart will ache so much.

233
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:13,130
Changge, believe it or not,

234
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,380
I've never ever wanted to kill you.

235
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:20,710
I've always wanted to protect you, but I couldn't find you.

236
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:24,908
With so much going on, I got so busy

237
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,829
that I wasn't able to keep track of a lot of things.

238
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:31,249
It was only till later that I knew about what you'd been through,

239
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:34,869
and the sacrifices you'd made for Great Tang.

240
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:37,830
I feel so sorry for you.

241
00:21:39,489 --> 00:21:43,910
Changge, please stay.

242
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:47,550
Let me take care of you.

243
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,300
If I was given a second chance to choose,

244
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,899
I would make the same decision.

245
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,660
I'm willing to sacrifice myself for the Great Tang people,

246
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:04,138
but I'll never allow those who love me to sacrifice themselves for me.

247
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:07,960
I must go to Dingxiang.

248
00:22:09,468 --> 00:22:11,899
I'm supposed to be pleased to hear it.

249
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,520
But now we're on the verge of war with the Ashile Tribe.

250
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,059
If you must go to Dingxiang,

251
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,980
then I'm afraid...

252
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,930
I'll let your mother down.

253
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,639
If you leave now,

254
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,059
we might never...

255
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:43,139
Fine.

256
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:47,200
We're not common people after all,

257
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,219
whose everyday happiness is beyond our reach.

258
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,818
Changge, you are no longer a little girl.

259
00:22:55,818 --> 00:22:58,781
You've made your own choice.

260
00:22:58,782 --> 00:23:00,883
I won't hold you back.

261
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,910
Child, take care.

262
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:10,289
I'll be here waiting for you.

263
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:12,970
This will always be your home.

264
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,380
Second Uncle.

265
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,540
You killed my father,

266
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:09,219
but you're also my second uncle.

267
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,300
If you turn into a bad emperor one day,

268
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,059
I will return to settle the score with you.

269
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:17,780
Okay.

270
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,520
Jin...

271
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,280
your daughter is just like you.

272
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:12,499
Your Majesty, Princess Yongning had me bring this to you when she left just now.

273
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:28,100
Mother, so this was your own choice.

274
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,180
It hurts me that you went through all this alone.

275
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:34,890
I'm sorry I only come to know it now.

276
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,560
   

277
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:41,479
I'm here today to say goodbye.

278
00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:44,279
I'm going to save the man I love.

279
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:49,060
You will support me, right?

280
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,160
   

281
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,560
   

282
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,799
 Madam Jin, I, Ashile Sun, would like to marry your daughter, Li Changge. 

283
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,280
 I would like to be with her forever. 

284
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:23,819
 On my life, I will protect Changge. 

285
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:26,279
 Care for and love her till the end of time. 

286
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,819
 I'll defend her freedom, make her happy, 

287
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:32,020
 and never abandon her. 

288
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:37,100
 Sincerely, Ashile Sun. 

289
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,430
So he has already visited you.

290
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,160
   

291
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,060
   

292
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:12,620
Mother, this one is for my union with Sun.

293
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:28,519
This one is from Sun.

294
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,250
   

295
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,760
The third one.

296
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:50,598
Mother, Ashile Sun is my husband from now on.

297
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:55,800
If you can hear me, please bless him with safety.

298
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,440
   

299
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,770
   

300
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:22,140
   

301
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,760
   

302
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,110
- Young Khan. 
 - Young Khan. 
    

303
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,550
   

304
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,779
What do you mean?

305
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:55,799
Commander Lei said that Great Khan is very ill now.

306
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,559
No one shall disturb him.

307
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,930
Commander Lei? You do know who I am, do you?

308
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:04,099
Please, sir. 
    

309
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,078
Hurry, go inform Commander Lei.

310
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:14,579
Okay.

311
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,980
Uncle!

312
00:30:55,959 --> 00:30:57,879
It's me, She'er.

313
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,680
Uncle.

314
00:31:00,719 --> 00:31:02,419
What's wrong with you?

315
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:05,859
Uncle.

316
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,659
I'm She'er. Don't you recognize me?

317
00:31:22,659 --> 00:31:25,940
Okay, I'll leave.

318
00:31:40,139 --> 00:31:41,580
Leave us alone.

319
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,280
Yes.

320
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:54,519
You're more obedient than before, which I like.

321
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:56,398
Thank you, Master.

322
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:02,239
If you keep it, I will let you see your brother.

323
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,659
- Thank you, Master. 
 - I must remind you,

324
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:11,899
you can't afford to make a mistake again when we're in Dingxiang.

325
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:14,819
If you aren't good,

326
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:17,318
you'll never ever see your brother.

327
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:21,599
No, I promise I'll be good.

328
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:33,110
Princess, Young Khan went to visit the Great Khan the minute he came back.

329
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,579
Well, I guess no one can stop him.

330
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,200
Let him be.

331
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,560
Do be more careful from now on,

332
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,830
in case of some unnecessary accidents.

333
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,260
Yes.

334
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:04,719
Your Highness.

335
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,720
Look how freely it flies.

336
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:21,960
- Your Highness! 
 - What are you doing?

337
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,198
Your Highness, be a good boy and stay where you are.

338
00:33:25,198 --> 00:33:27,119
Buzhen!

339
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,759
- Your Highness! 
 - Come with me.

340
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:30,560
Let go of me.

341
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,160
You...

342
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,040
Buzhen!

343
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,399
Sister! Sister.

344
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:44,860
   

345
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,600
Buzhen.

346
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:57,179
Buzhen, let me see you.

347
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:59,480
Sister.

348
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,280
Your finger.

349
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,600
I don't know why they wanted to cut off my finger,

350
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,478
but His Highness Sui saved me from it.

351
00:34:09,478 --> 00:34:11,520
I'm fine.

352
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,899
That's good. That's good.

353
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:22,170
Commander Lei, news from the western front.

354
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:27,768
Don't worry, Sister. It doesn't hurt anymore.

355
00:34:27,768 --> 00:34:30,069
Don't cry. Please.

356
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:31,449
Okay.

357
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:32,668
Take Buzhen back.

358
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:34,089
Yes, Sir.

359
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:36,888
- Buzhen! 
 - Sister!

360
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:37,688
Buzhen!

361
00:34:37,689 --> 00:34:39,089
Sister!

362
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,768
- Buzhen! 
 - Sister!

363
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:42,888
- Come with me. 
 - Let go of me.

364
00:34:42,888 --> 00:34:45,410
- Sister. 
 - Buzhen.

365
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:48,810
- Time for you to go back. 
 - Sister!

366
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,649
Young Khan, why are you here?

367
00:35:02,649 --> 00:35:05,470
Open the door for me.

368
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,889
Well... but... but Khatun has ordered that...

369
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:12,470
Well? My words don't work here in Dingxiang?

370
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,929
Sorry, Sir.

371
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:18,210
Tell your men not to report to Khatun about my presence here today.

372
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,209
Yes, Sir, I understand.

373
00:35:20,209 --> 00:35:23,729
I will shut them up.

374
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,070
Take me to Ashile Sun.

375
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,329
Yes, Sir.

376
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:30,030
- Open the door. 
 - Yes, Sir.

377
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,309
Young Khan, please.

378
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,950
   

379
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:37,469
   

380
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:41,569
To the dungeon. I'll go talk to Ashile Sun.

381
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,728
I can go there alone.

382
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:47,629
Yes.

383
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:55,350
Since when do you like drinking in the dungeon?

384
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:58,248
Since when you were put here.

385
00:35:58,248 --> 00:36:01,148
Is there a better snack to go with wine?

386
00:36:01,148 --> 00:36:02,989
I have no time for this.

387
00:36:02,989 --> 00:36:05,989
Finish it and go, in case your mother finds out.

388
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:08,090
I'm here as I please.

389
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,069
If she finds out, so be it.

390
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:11,969
The look on your face suggests otherwise.

391
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,669
Shut up.

392
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,390
I've seen Great Khan.

393
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,449
How is he?

394
00:36:28,449 --> 00:36:31,628
Ill, just like what my mother said.

395
00:36:31,628 --> 00:36:33,890
He can't recognize me now.

396
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,149
And he sent me away.

397
00:36:37,049 --> 00:36:41,710
Do you really believe he could fall this ill overnight?

398
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,369
Why don't you?

399
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:44,309
Stop alienating me from my mother.

400
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:47,468
I like to see uncle like this because my mother doesn't have to tread on eggshells now.

401
00:36:47,468 --> 00:36:49,370
Isn't it nice that she can see me whenever she wants?

402
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,628
Don't lie to yourself, She'er!

403
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:56,690
If you truly believe it, why are you here drinking with me?

404
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,589
Young Khan.

405
00:37:16,589 --> 00:37:18,768
Young Khan, Khatun is here.

406
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:19,849
Go.

407
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:20,989
He's right, Young Khan.

408
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,889
I've let you in against Khatun's order.

409
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:25,429
If she finds out about it, then even if I've got ten lives...

410
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:27,248
Calm down.

411
00:37:27,248 --> 00:37:28,890
I'll go by the back door.

412
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:31,088
Yes, Sir. I'll show you out.

413
00:37:31,088 --> 00:37:33,789
Nothing shall happen if you keep your mouth shut.

414
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:36,988
Yes, Sir. Please.

415
00:37:57,449 --> 00:38:00,069
Young Khan, please hurry.

416
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,670
This way.

417
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:14,449
Come on.

418
00:38:14,449 --> 00:38:16,629
This way.

419
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:19,538
You can leave me here, in case she gets suspicious.

420
00:38:19,538 --> 00:38:21,739
Thank you, Sir.

421
00:38:31,845 --> 00:38:33,645
Khatun.

422
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,179
Why are you here?

423
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:38,860
I... I...

424
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,019
I asked him here.

425
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:45,939
I want wine. Get me more.

426
00:38:45,939 --> 00:38:50,580
Do you think we're at your Eagle Division?

427
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,620
Leave us alone.

428
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,420
Yes.

429
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,998
The used-to-be mighty god of war on the grasslands

430
00:38:59,998 --> 00:39:03,720
is now locked in this dark dungeon.

431
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:08,758
To be honest, I kind of feel sorry for you.

432
00:39:08,758 --> 00:39:11,119
Just get to the point.

433
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,158
Save the small talk.

434
00:39:13,158 --> 00:39:15,980
Ashile Sun, you're indeed smart.

435
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,559
No wonder your father likes you.

436
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:20,799
My father likes She'er, too.

437
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:23,418
Without a mother who is a plotter,

438
00:39:23,418 --> 00:39:27,519
She'er will establish himself on the grasslands by himself one day.

439
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:31,598
How I help my son establish himself is none of your business.

440
00:39:31,598 --> 00:39:35,359
Your love for him has led you on the wrong path after all.

441
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,300
I won't argue with you today.

442
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,420
I'm here to negotiate with you.

443
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,520
Negotiate?

444
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,498
Great Tang has allied with the other tribes.

445
00:39:44,498 --> 00:39:47,438
They will attack Dingxiang very soon.

446
00:39:47,438 --> 00:39:51,979
Yicheng, you're in no position to negotiate with me.

447
00:39:51,979 --> 00:39:55,718
Since you've guessed it, I'll be straight with you.

448
00:39:55,718 --> 00:39:59,898
You're smart. Smart people always suit their actions to the time.

449
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:03,559
If you lead your Eagle Division to fight for our tribe,

450
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,180
I promise I'll keep you alive.

451
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,859
I won't be leading the Eagle Division to fight for the tribe,

452
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:16,660
but for you and the former Sui Dynasty, will I?

453
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,180
If I'm not wrong,

454
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,979
since the Khan's tent refused to give us the gromwell... No.

455
00:40:21,979 --> 00:40:23,579
Probably prior to that.

456
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:27,900
The master of the Khan's tent is no longer my father but none other than you, Khatun. Am I right?

457
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:34,678
The plague, the attack from the Bear Division in Mobei, and my father's illness...

458
00:40:34,678 --> 00:40:36,739
You're behind all of these.

459
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:39,159
You've given me no choice.

460
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:40,378
Have I?

461
00:40:40,378 --> 00:40:45,219
If you are dead, She'er will no longer be threatened on the grasslands.

462
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:49,420
Ashile Sun, aren't you very nice to your friends?

463
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,419
Now it's time to be nice to your brother.

464
00:40:52,419 --> 00:40:56,319
I won't help him, nor will I ever help you.

465
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,420
Fine.

466
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,579
Bring Mu Jin here.

467
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:23,219
Mu Jin. Mu Jin!

468
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,439
Yicheng!

469
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:29,488
He withheld the intelligence and sneaked in here without reporting,

470
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:31,129
which is a capital offense.

471
00:41:31,129 --> 00:41:36,969
The only reason I've spared him is because of you.

472
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:37,990
Take him away.

473
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,990
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

474
00:41:41,059 --> 00:41:42,859
Mu Jin.

475
00:42:02,629 --> 00:42:06,829
Okay, I'll do it, on two conditions.

476
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:07,908
What are they?

477
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:11,069
First, cure Mu Jin.

478
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,329
Second, cure my father.

479
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:17,988
That's a lot to ask.

480
00:42:17,988 --> 00:42:21,048
I can promise you to cure Mu Jin.

481
00:42:21,048 --> 00:42:25,929
As for your father, when the Eagle Division wins the war for me,

482
00:42:25,929 --> 00:42:29,009
I'll let you see him.

483
00:42:29,009 --> 00:42:31,470
You finally admit it.

484
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:34,330
It is you who made my father ill.

00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:11,229
♫  As your silhouette weaves  ♫

492
00:43:11,229 --> 00:43:16,630
♫  and locks in my nostalgic dream  ♫

493
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:19,370
♫  Before the daybreak,  ♫

494
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:21,749
♫  through the obsession of love,  ♫

495
00:43:21,749 --> 00:43:25,569
♫  the yearning flowing through thoughts  ♫

496
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:29,049
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

497
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:34,969
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

498
00:43:34,969 --> 00:43:38,389
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

499
00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:44,849
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

500
00:43:44,849 --> 00:43:47,309
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

501
00:43:47,309 --> 00:43:49,629
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

502
00:43:49,629 --> 00:43:54,269
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

503
00:43:54,269 --> 00:43:56,950
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

504
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:59,110
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

505
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:04,730
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

506
00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:13,209
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

507
00:44:13,209 --> 00:44:19,029
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

508
00:44:19,029 --> 00:44:22,489
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

509
00:44:22,489 --> 00:44:28,949
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

510
00:44:28,949 --> 00:44:31,409
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

511
00:44:31,409 --> 00:44:33,809
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

512
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:38,309
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

513
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:41,129
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

514
00:44:41,129 --> 00:44:43,130
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

515
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:49,810
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

516
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:59,170
♫  It is sleepless  ♫

517
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:12,050
