<i>The inksticks in Chang'an are of superior quality.</i>

<i>The inferior folk inksticks you used will fade in water.</i>

25
00:01:46,419 --> 00:01:50,700
Besides, you used defective silk fabrics.

26
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:53,660
Keep quiet.

27
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:59,960
What happened?

28
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:02,879
Don't worry.

29
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,220
Hide yourself. Your master will be safe.

30
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,480
All of these shows that—

31
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:14,279
Shows that the seal of the crown prince is in You State, in your hands.

32
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:16,599
- Take her down.
<i>- Yes, Sir!</i>

33
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,093
Take her away.

34
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,460
Turn the room upside down.

35
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:28,300
Master told me Li Yuan was the only one he can trust.

36
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,199
I didn't expect he was a coward.

37
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,680
This won't do. I have to save him.

38
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,160
Go out now, he'll die sooner.

39
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,960
What you have is about his life.

40
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,780
Hide it well.

41
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,060
I believe he can escape successfully.

42
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,119
Don't you believe in him?

43
00:02:47,119 --> 00:02:49,180
Of course, I do. Master has nine lives.

44
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,240
Sure. Listen to me.

45
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,019
You should go to the city gate and wait for him there.

46
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:56,619
And you? Will you save him?

47
00:02:56,619 --> 00:02:57,960
Just take care of yourself.

48
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,493
Go now.

49
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,073
You seller.

50
00:03:02,073 --> 00:03:03,732
I believe you.

51
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,113
Nothing found.

52
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,953
Nothing found.

53
00:03:29,739 --> 00:03:32,980
Let me ask you. Where is it?

54
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:41,179
Don't think I won't strangle you because you're Princess Yongning.

55
00:03:41,839 --> 00:03:45,189
<i>She's Princess Yongning, Li Jiancheng's daughter.</i>

56
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:47,860
<i>No wonder she can steal the seal of the crown prince.</i>

57
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,939
<i>So Li Shisi wants to get revenge on Li Shimin.</i>

58
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,593
Junkuo,

59
00:03:54,593 --> 00:03:58,520
if you strangle her, no one can find what we want.

60
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,593
Bring her back.

61
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,200
<i>[Qingxiang Inn]</i>

62
00:04:27,119 --> 00:04:28,799
Wait here secretly.

63
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,520
Take down anyone who comes here.

64
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,033
Yes, Sir.

65
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,340
You still refuse to tell me where it is.

66
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:54,299
You have a pretty face.

67
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,259
But you may lose it in a little while.

68
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:03,820
I suggest you be frank with me,

69
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:06,880
in case you suffer for nothing.

70
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,140
I know how changeable you are.

71
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,200
If I tell you everything, I'll die earlier, won't I?

72
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:21,480
As a princess, you would rather die than surrender it.

73
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,459
But since you don't care about your life,

74
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:27,819
I wonder if you care about others.

75
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,200
I'm afraid today is the time for the Envoy Wei to die.

76
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,300
Go and kill him.

77
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,959
It's none of my business.

78
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:39,859
None of your business?

79
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,760
I know how you protected Envoy Wei.

80
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,800
I saw it with my eyes.

81
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,520
How about bringing him here?

82
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,439
You can have a really good talk with your old friend.

83
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,099
Maybe this will jog your memory.

84
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:58,332
<i>Yes, Sir!</i>

85
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,440
It seems you want to estrange yourself from

86
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,480
your old friend from Chang'an.

87
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,760
Fine.

88
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,300
I'll kill him right now.

89
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,219
If you dare to kill him,

90
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:47,779
you will never get what you want.

91
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:49,639
Just as expected.

92
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,240
It seems you still can't part with him.

93
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:56,920
I'll give you a little bit more time.

94
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,720
Look at him and recall your memory.

95
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:05,199
If you can't satisfy me, both of you will die.

96
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:22,119
Wei Shuyu. Wei Shuyu.

97
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,400
<i>If I cooperate with Wang Junkuo,</i>

98
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,040
<i>You State will fall into Ashile's hands,</i>

99
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,599
<i>but maybe I can conquer Chang'an by rebels.</i>

100
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:36,879
<i>Li Changge, what are you thinking about?</i>

101
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,559
<i>It's Ashile Tribe.</i>

102
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,020
<i>If you help Wang Junkuo this time,</i>

103
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:43,850
<i>you'll be a flagitious traitor to Great Tang.</i>

104
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,672
<i>Come in.</i>

105
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:57,992
Princess.

106
00:07:57,992 --> 00:07:59,799
Are we leaving today?

107
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:01,040
Yes.

108
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,239
Wei Shuyu has almost finished his work.

109
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:05,320
We'll meet today.

110
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,220
I'll guard you to the East Gate to meet with Wei Shuyu later.

111
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,559
You won't go with me.

112
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,192
I'm staying.

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,780
Hao Du,

114
00:08:18,079 --> 00:08:21,299
if you meet Changge one day,

115
00:08:21,299 --> 00:08:24,199
can you spare her life?

116
00:08:26,239 --> 00:08:27,972
Hao Du.

117
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,599
It's late.

118
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,349
Please pack your luggage as soon as possible, Princess.

119
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,100
How did they catch you?

120
00:09:00,719 --> 00:09:02,459
I know.

121
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:05,359
You're still mad at me.

122
00:09:05,359 --> 00:09:07,620
Why did you come to You State?

123
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:11,759
It's not enough to shoot me down on the cliff with arrows.

124
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,159
You won't stop until I die in front of you.

125
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,692
Changge,

126
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:17,152
I...

127
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:21,872
Stop talking.

128
00:09:21,872 --> 00:09:23,580
Have some rest.

129
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,740
No matter if you believe it or not,

130
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:30,260
I've never betrayed you from the very beginning.

131
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,679
That day I was set up by Hao Du.

132
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,280
He wanted to confuse you.

133
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,539
So what?

134
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:40,579
You chose to yield to him in the end.

135
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:42,919
I've let you down.

136
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:46,640
I don't want you to be trapped because of me.

137
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:50,180
You're overthinking.

138
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,300
It's my consequence in this dangerous game.

139
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,920
That's all.

140
00:09:56,499 --> 00:09:59,332
What? Wang Junkuo...

141
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:02,559
Wang Junkuo wants to give You State to Khan Yanli.

142
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:04,920
What a schemer with ruthless ambition!

143
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:09,000
Does Prince of Lujiang just ignore this kind of traitor?

144
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,100
Prince of Lujiang is the ringleader.

145
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,520
What?

146
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,140
How can you escape?

147
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,830
How can I escape?

148
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:23,220
My ending now is what you and your new master want to see, isn't it?

149
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:26,212
Changge.

150
00:10:26,212 --> 00:10:28,000
His Highness loves you the most.

151
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,660
- He never—
- Shut up.

152
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,059
Even if I'm crushed to pieces,

153
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:35,200
I will never beg Li Shimin as you did.

154
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:45,260
Are you alone in You State?

155
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,333
No.

156
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:51,759
I appointed Hao Du to meet at 16:00 today at the east gate.

157
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,300
Trust me.

158
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,300
I won't tell him I met you.

159
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,750
You think you can survive to meet Hao Du?

160
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:02,919
If you want to leave here safely,

161
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:05,039
you have to rely on him.

162
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:10,719
Anyone here? I want to see Li Yuan.

163
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,780
- Anyone?
- Changge, what are you going to do?

164
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,840
None of your business.

165
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,119
Anyone here?

166
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:17,200
You're not planning to hand over the seal of the crown prince.

167
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,700
Or else?

168
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,660
Give it to you?

169
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,760
You have no qualified cook here, right?

170
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,819
None of these are edible.

171
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:43,840
I advise you to stop while you are ahead.

172
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,690
The governor's patience is limited.

173
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,399
I'm a princess.

174
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,819
Show me some respect.

175
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:55,280
General Wang is making such a big scene. I am not able to eat at all.

176
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,613
No appetite now.

177
00:11:56,613 --> 00:11:59,000
It seems you are courting your own death.

178
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,293
Uncle, this is the man you've taught.

179
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,940
Yongning, you dragging this out is no use.

180
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,760
I know.

181
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,840
I've set up the time to meet with my man.

182
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,220
I can't see him if I arrive early.

183
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:23,399
If I can't go there without a scratch,

184
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,900
he'll do what I told him to do.

185
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,740
At that time, no one can get the seal of the crown prince.

186
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:34,479
That is so like you, Yongning.

187
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:36,619
I underestimated you.

188
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:40,259
But we're a family.

189
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,359
There's no need to break the deal.

190
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:44,819
You're right, Uncle.

191
00:12:45,579 --> 00:12:48,140
It's getting late. Time to go.

192
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,359
Fine. I'm waiting for your good news.

193
00:12:51,359 --> 00:12:54,592
Uncle, Wei Shuyu belongs to me.

194
00:12:54,592 --> 00:12:57,080
If he dies, he should be killed by my hands.

195
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:02,009
If anything happens to him, you can't imagine what I can do then.

196
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,633
Please.

197
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,920
<i>Princess Yongning can get off Chang'an safely.</i>

198
00:13:43,599 --> 00:13:46,300
<i>Wang Junkuo can never catch her.</i>

199
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:03,399
What benefits did Ashile Tribe promise to you?

200
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:05,660
You'd rather be Yanli's dog

201
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,559
than take the first feat to wipe out the rebels?

202
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:10,092
Princess,

203
00:14:10,092 --> 00:14:13,039
do you really believe they'll die for you

204
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,619
with an empty promise?

205
00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:17,919
What's more, the so-called eradicating rebels under orders

206
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:20,159
is all nonsense.

207
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,600
Now only the seal of the crown prince counts for something.

208
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,799
You may sell it for a good price.

209
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,900
You're worried about the wavering You State's military

210
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,640
once the news of you capitulating to Ashile Tribe spreads.

211
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,320
At that time, surrounding towns will gang up on you.

212
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,999
You'll be doomed by then.

213
00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:39,619
It's none of your concern.

214
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:42,660
You'd better worry about yourself.

215
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:32,160
<i>[Best Soy Paste in the World]</i>

216
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,973
<i>Hao Du, don't let me down.</i>

217
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,159
Brother Shuyu, why is he...

218
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:10,952
- Chang... Chang...
- Shut up.

219
00:16:10,952 --> 00:16:13,500
Once you shout her name, she'll die.

220
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:15,769
Look at that man.

221
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:19,899
Li Changge has been stalked.

222
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,100
Who are they?

223
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,633
No idea.

224
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:30,219
But Li Changge is here.

225
00:16:30,219 --> 00:16:32,139
Something happened with Wei Shuyu.

226
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:34,179
Brother Shuyu.

227
00:16:34,179 --> 00:16:36,539
If you want Wei Shuyu to be fine,

228
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:38,440
stay here and keep quiet.

229
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,073
Don't move.

230
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,053
It's a trap.

231
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,193
Move away.

232
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,093
Go away.

233
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,820
<i>What is happening?</i>

234
00:17:50,199 --> 00:17:52,940
Princess, you still want to run?

235
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,680
Who are you?

236
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,520
Give it to me.

237
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,360
Or I'll kill your master now.

238
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,693
Be my guest.

239
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:25,299
But you have to give her head to me.

240
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:27,709
So I can report to my master.

241
00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:30,380
You're not with her.

242
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:33,139
Who exactly are you?

243
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,880
How dare you ask who I am?

244
00:19:01,239 --> 00:19:03,189
Something happened to Wei Shuyu.

245
00:19:03,189 --> 00:19:04,913
I guessed it.

246
00:19:04,913 --> 00:19:06,759
Hao Du!

247
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,499
Changge.

248
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:24,000
Changge.

249
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,160
Free her.

250
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,919
After you.

251
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,480
One for one.

252
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,212
A fair game.

253
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,392
Yueyan, why are you here?

254
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,260
Changge, I...

255
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,409
What are you waiting for?

256
00:19:40,409 --> 00:19:42,680
This is the Princess of Great Tang.

257
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,540
Do you know who she is?

258
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:48,379
I don't care.

259
00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:50,212
Let her go.

260
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,400
I'll count to three.

261
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,680
If you don't let her go, she'll die.

262
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,580
A'Zhun, don't act recklessly.

263
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:04,119
Hao Du,

264
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,680
don't hurt Changge.

265
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:07,160
Let her go.

266
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,793
Hao Du.

267
00:20:10,859 --> 00:20:12,592
One.

268
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,540
If Wang Junkuo comes back with his army, no one can leave here.

269
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,173
Two.

270
00:20:24,499 --> 00:20:26,649
Who the hell are you?

271
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:31,752
Three.

272
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:34,439
Changge.

273
00:21:34,439 --> 00:21:35,900
- Go.
- Changge, go.

274
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,099
- Changge.
- Princess.

275
00:21:38,719 --> 00:21:40,252
Princess.

276
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:43,499
- Changge, go.
- Pardon me, Princess.

277
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,959
I thought you'd gone back.

278
00:22:08,839 --> 00:22:10,372
I...

279
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:12,920
I have something to do here.

280
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,700
Something to do?

281
00:22:15,239 --> 00:22:18,040
You want to take back your horses from Wang Junkuo,

282
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,540
or line up for Wang Junkuo to collude with Ashile Tribe?

283
00:22:22,239 --> 00:22:25,972
A'Zhun, don't force me to be your enemy.

284
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,599
I just wanted to save you.

285
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,010
Thank you for that.

286
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:41,000
I won't ask about your past.

287
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,280
Leave me alone from now on.

288
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,359
Leave You State.

289
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:47,740
It's what I should tell you.

290
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,000
They won't let you go.

291
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
If you go back now, you'll die.

292
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,533
Come with me.

293
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,919
I don't need a lecture.

294
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,380
I'll never let You State fall into Ashile Tribe's hands.

295
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,160
If you follow me, I'll turn you in.

296
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:05,760
The court wants to kill you, why do you still defend them?

297
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,510
I hate the person who destroyed my family.

298
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,919
But I still belong to Great Tang.

299
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:23,479
Did you want this?

300
00:23:23,479 --> 00:23:25,270
Protect yourself.

301
00:23:45,439 --> 00:23:48,239
Let go of me, it hurts.

302
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,520
Hao Du, let go!

303
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,379
Let go now!

304
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,800
Didn't you hear what Changge said?

305
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,880
Brother Shuyu is in danger now.

306
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,839
I just care about where Li Changge is.

307
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:05,970
But Brother Shuyu is—

308
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,750
Let me tell you again.

309
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,119
I just care about Li Changge.

310
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:13,099
<i>I'm here!</i>

311
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,293
Changge.

312
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:18,599
Changge, why are you back?

313
00:24:18,599 --> 00:24:21,580
Stop pulling me, or I'll kill her now.

314
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:27,400
Li Changge, why didn't you run away?

315
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,209
If you don't do as I say,

316
00:24:29,209 --> 00:24:31,099
none of us can leave here.

317
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:33,839
Follow your order?

318
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,680
You think you're still a princess, right?

319
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,640
Li Yuan and Wang Junkuo ganged up with Young Khan of the Ashile Tribe.

320
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,959
They're going to give You State to Ashile Tribe.

321
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:44,309
Now, the Wolf Division army is marching towards You State.

322
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:46,230
Do you still think you can leave now?

323
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:48,560
Don't doubt it.

324
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,419
Wei Shuyu is now locked in the dungeon of Governor Manor.

325
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:55,339
If not for You State, I wouldn't be standing here in front of you.

326
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,080
Hao Du, let's go and save Brother Shuyu.

327
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,869
Why should I believe you?

328
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:03,319
Now it's me standing here, not Wei Shuyu.

329
00:25:03,319 --> 00:25:05,580
Wei Shuyu has the entire Wei Family to support.

330
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,479
Do you think he'll risk his entire family lives

331
00:25:07,479 --> 00:25:09,729
to put on an act with me?

332
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,359
No need to look around.

333
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:20,192
It's just me.

334
00:25:20,192 --> 00:25:21,599
Why are you safe?

335
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:23,680
Because I have the seal of the crown prince.

336
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,599
Give it to me.

337
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:28,439
You State is falling and you still care about that thing.

338
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:30,639
You State has nothing to do with me.

339
00:25:30,639 --> 00:25:34,560
My priority is to take you and the seal of the crown prince back.

340
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,319
Nothing to do with you?

341
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,919
You said the fall of You State has nothing to do with you.

342
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,199
If Du Ruhui heard about your words, he would kill you for sure.

343
00:25:43,199 --> 00:25:45,479
Don't mention my foster father.

344
00:25:45,479 --> 00:25:49,060
You're just a thief who stole the seal of the crown prince. Who are you to tell me the overall situation?

345
00:25:51,699 --> 00:25:53,660
Li Changge.

346
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:57,119
Even if you're telling the truth, I won't let you go.

347
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:59,680
You care less about priorities than about personal gain or loss.

348
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,119
How can you complete a major task?

349
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:03,199
I don't need you to teach me how to complete my business.

350
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:05,640
My biggest business is to bring back the seal of the crown prince.

351
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,479
If Wang Junkuo gets it, it's too late to ask the court for help.

352
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,573
Li Changge,

353
00:26:19,573 --> 00:26:22,040
I don't care if what you said is true or not.

354
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,920
My top priority now is to guard the princess out of You State safely.

355
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,673
If the princess is still your friend, work with me.

356
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:36,800
Useless!

357
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,020
We have so many people. And you just let her run away?

358
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,199
Beg your pardon, Governor.

359
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,620
I've ordered to look for Li Changge in the whole city

360
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,079
and close the gate.

361
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:47,040
I don't care what methods you use to catch her.

362
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,680
I must get the seal tomorrow.

363
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,640
Otherwise, Young Khan will put you and me on the line.

364
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,659
Governor, there's another thing to report.

365
00:26:54,659 --> 00:27:00,039
I found out that another group is tracking Li Changge.

366
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:02,000
He's a more skilled warrior than me.

367
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,750
He can't be an amateur.

368
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,889
Is he from the court?

369
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:09,539
- Then you and me—
- Governor, no need to worry about that.

370
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:12,719
I found out that he didn't care whether Li Changge was alive.

371
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:14,760
He just wanted to catch her.

372
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,199
So I suspect he comes for the seal of the crown prince, too.

373
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:29,279
Given the situation,

374
00:27:30,239 --> 00:27:32,239
there's no turning back.

375
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:34,959
Li Changge and the men from the court, I want them both.

376
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:36,492
Get it.

377
00:27:36,492 --> 00:27:38,140
As long as she's alive,

378
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,149
she can never take a step out of You State.

379
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,860
How about Young Khan?

380
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,479
Khan Yanli's army is about to march south.

381
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:51,560
All we should do is to lock You State and the news to other places.

382
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:56,560
We have nothing to worry about once Wolf Division comes.

383
00:27:56,560 --> 00:28:01,340
Our glory and wealth are fastened completely as a result of this.

384
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,739
As the governor commands.

385
00:28:22,199 --> 00:28:24,339
Close the gate now. No one can go in or out.

386
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:25,319
Close the gate?

387
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:26,479
Why in such a hurry?

388
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:28,560
General Wang's order. Hurry up.

389
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,560
If the criminal runs away, you'll be held responsible.

390
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,993
Yes, Sir.

391
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,570
<i>[You State]</i>

392
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,433
Changge,

393
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:59,420
since young, I liked to rest on your shoulder.

394
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:04,700
With you, I particularly have peace of mind.

395
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:09,479
No need to be worried.

396
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:11,800
I don't know

397
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:17,490
when I can put my head on your shoulder again.

398
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:23,359
Untie me.

399
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:25,092
It hurts.

400
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,960
Li Changge, don't underestimate me.

401
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,860
<i>[Yi]</i>

402
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,340
Is it that important to catch Changge?

403
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,679
Is it more important than our lives, than all the people in You State?

404
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:31,640
You State is already locked down.

405
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,679
I can't save them.

406
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:36,509
I can't save Wei Shuyu.

407
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:40,440
So you just stand by and watch him die.

408
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,920
Go out and light the beacon, inform the court of the emergency here.

409
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,879
It's all we can do.

410
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:51,040
You mean...

411
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,019
we can save Brother Shuyu.

412
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,979
God knows the end.

413
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:26,640
You?

414
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,373
Come in now.

415
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,160
Why are you here?

416
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,040
The seller asked me to wait for you at the gate.

417
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,780
I waited without even a blink.

418
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:39,239
Then I saw the soldiers locking the gate.

419
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:41,760
Only one carriage went out at the last minute.

420
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,640
I guessed it was your last chance to get out.

421
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,240
So I just followed it.

422
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,700
I didn't expect the seller was right.

423
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,800
What did he say?

424
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,660
He believed you could go out.

425
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,819
- Where is it?
- Here.

426
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:00,309
I'm fine and it's fine.

427
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:06,280
Master, who kidnapped you?

428
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,520
They're from Chang'an.

429
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,620
To You State?

430
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,280
This is an emergency.

431
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,079
I have to ask for some help.

432
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:14,800
A'Dou, wait here for me.

433
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,133
Master, don't leave me alone again.

434
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:20,439
Now I'm facing the You State's army.

435
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,920
If I don't go now, Wang Junkuo will get what he wants.

436
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,479
We have nowhere to go then.

437
00:32:24,479 --> 00:32:26,040
Why are you still going there?

438
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,939
Cause I have no choice.

439
00:32:27,939 --> 00:32:32,360
Besides, I don't believe the You State army will follow Wang Junkuo as a stooge.

440
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,219
Master, don't leave me alone.

441
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:37,959
I've been dreaming about going to the war and fighting with an army.

442
00:32:37,959 --> 00:32:41,019
This time, no matter what, I won't let you go alone.

443
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,160
Okay. I'll take you with me.

444
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,279
See the true army with thousands of soldiers.

445
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,520
Okay.

446
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,520
I have to see someone before we set off.

447
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,420
Wait for me out there.

448
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,793
Changge!

449
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,119
Ask Hao Du to take you to Chang'an.

450
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:15,239
Here is not a good place to stay.

451
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:19,172
Changge, I can't go back.

452
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:23,879
Grandpa wanted me to marry someone in Ashile Tribe for peace.

453
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:25,512
What?

454
00:33:25,512 --> 00:33:30,839
But father said I was gravely ill and asked me to rest in Luoyang.

455
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,199
Listen to him, stay in Luoyang.

456
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,039
Changge,

457
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,699
I don't want to go anywhere.

458
00:33:42,699 --> 00:33:45,859
I want to go back to the past.

459
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,493
It's impossible.

460
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,333
But...

461
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,420
can we meet again in the future?

462
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,679
Better not.

463
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,333
Changge.

464
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,719
Hao Du said the only chance is to light the beacon.

465
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:32,260
Do you think we can save Brother Shuyu?

466
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,179
I will save him.

467
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:36,072
Don't worry.

468
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:09,980
Young people nowadays are always in a hurry.

469
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,579
You State is locked down.

470
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,479
No one can get in.

471
00:35:17,479 --> 00:35:18,919
It's late now.

472
00:35:18,919 --> 00:35:20,399
There's a horse post.

473
00:35:20,399 --> 00:35:22,239
We can go there and take a rest.

474
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:24,479
Let it run its course.

475
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:28,360
The blessings and misfortunes of the world are unpredictable.

476
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,999
Right? Susu.

477
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,660
Go.

478
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:51,520
Stop.

479
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,760
Who are you?

480
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:53,760
Here's the Official Seal.

481
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,719
Chang'an envoy Wei Shuyu wants to speak to generals.

482
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:58,252
Let them go in.

483
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:09,560
<i>[Success cease to exist if not together]</i>

484
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,760
You say that both Governor Li and General Wang have surrendered to the enemy?

485
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,910
How can you prove it?

486
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,740
My messengers and attendants were all detained

487
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,520
in the dungeons of Governor Manor.

488
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,859
You'll know it clearly if you and your men go to check it.

489
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:29,040
The garrison outside the city can't go in without military orders.

490
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,099
If you have no other proof, I'm afraid I can't go.

491
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:35,040
But the city is controlled by Wang Junkuo.

492
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,479
Once the Ashile army comes, Li Yuan will surrender You State to them.

493
00:36:39,479 --> 00:36:42,479
Great Tang will lose strategic bases in the north.

494
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:44,520
Every word I said is the truth.

495
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,670
I beg you to dispatch troops.

496
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:50,879
What if I refuse?

497
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:58,060
Then forgive me.

498
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,120
You're not the Chang'an envoy.

499
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,199
Tell me who are you?

500
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,993
Governor!

501
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,279
Governor. The beacon...

502
00:37:11,279 --> 00:37:12,893
The beacon?

503
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,560
The beacon's been lit.

504
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:28,280
Governor, please dispatch troops quickly.

505
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,499
My order. Gather all men.

506
00:37:30,499 --> 00:37:31,832
Yes.

507
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,639
Young Khan.

508
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:24,172
What's the situation?

509
00:38:24,172 --> 00:38:25,159
Seems to be a news leak.

510
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,560
The Tang army's gotten prepared.

511
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,610
We have to leave right now.

512
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:32,040
Wang Junkuo, a good-for-nothing!

513
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,600
You State warehouse is empty now, right?

514
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,719
Fortunately, you asked us to get prepared.

515
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:39,719
We've transferred all maps, household register materials,

516
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:42,040
silk, gold, and silver in You State warehouse.

517
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,040
Carriages are hidden in the woods outside the city.

518
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,473
Fine.

519
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:47,280
We didn't come here for nothing.

520
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,280
Get out now with Wang Junkuo's token.

521
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,693
Yes.

522
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,953
Stop.

523
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,419
We should hide first and talk after we avoid them.

524
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,719
Ashile Sun.

525
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:53,669
Don't go there, Young Khan.

526
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,399
They have so many horsemen.

527
00:39:58,399 --> 00:40:01,199
We can't get out of here if we expose ourselves.

528
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,120
Young Khan, you have a special status now.

529
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,919
You can't put yourself in danger.

530
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:06,239
Let's go.

531
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:07,672
Go now.

532
00:40:08,259 --> 00:40:09,692
Go.

533
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,579
Someone's hiding here.

534
00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:20,720
- Check it.
- Yes.

535
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,520
<i>[Map of You State Warehouse]</i>

536
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,920
It belongs to You State warehouse.

537
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,639
Something's wrong in You State.

538
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:48,520
Everybody, hurry up.

539
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,319
We must arrive in You State before dawn.

540
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,659
<i>-Yes!</i>
- Go.

541
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:57,030
<i>[Gugai Post House]</i>

542
00:41:05,399 --> 00:41:07,649
Don't think of shouting for help.

543
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,080
You can give it a try.

544
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:14,379
Let's see if your shout is faster or my dagger is faster.

545
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,800
She's a little girl.

546
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,860
Don't scare her.

547
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,180
Susu.

548
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,980
Susu, don't worry. It's okay.

549

<i>Why is no one back yet?</i>

<i>Can Changge save Brother Shuyu successfully?</i>

551
00:41:58,919 --> 00:42:04,459
Susu, how about finding a companion for you?

552
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:27,719
Brother Shuyu.

553
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,160
Uncle, are you all right?

554
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,439
Water.

555
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:46,620
- Water.
