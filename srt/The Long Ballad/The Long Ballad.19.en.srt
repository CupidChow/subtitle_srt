22
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,020
Mu Jin, thank you for helping me carry water today.

23
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,418
Does your foot feel better?

24
00:01:49,418 --> 00:01:54,219
I made some lamb bone soup for you, do you want to drink it?

25
00:01:55,279 --> 00:01:57,079
Mu Jin?

26
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,860
I'm coming in, all right?

27
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,310
Mu Jin.

28
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,140
Mu Jin.

29
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,399
Mu Jin, what's wrong?

30
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,859
Mu Jin! Are you okay? Wake up!

31
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,480
Oh, no.

32
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,139
He's so hot.

33
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:26,039
No.

34
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,918
Right, alcohol! Any alcohol?

35
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,619
Alcohol.

36
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,780
Be careful.

37
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:55,440
Does it work?

38
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,959
Once the fever is brought down, it should be okay.

39
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,838
I will go find the witch doctor.

40
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:02,038
I will get more alcohol.

41
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,639
Okay.

42
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:06,779
You must get better soon!

43
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:09,299
You can't die.

44
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,139
Why are you here?

45
00:03:35,139 --> 00:03:37,140
You're awake!

46
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,279
Why did you take off all of my clothes?

47
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,439
The fever is brought down. Lie down, quickly.

48
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,700
You will be dead if you get a fever again.

49
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,599
How can you curse my death?

50
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,400
You...

51
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:01,439
You stepped on the rusty pin for helping me.

52
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,019
If you die, I...

53
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,500
My mother had a similar experience

54
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,678
of stepping on a rusty pin.

55
00:04:08,678 --> 00:04:11,280
Her fever lasted for many days.

56
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,519
When I figured out this method,

57
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,739
it was too late.

58
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,740
Fortunately, you survived.

59
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,979
Mimi, don't feel sad.

60
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:26,699
I'm very strong. I won't die easily.

61
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,919
I'm one of the warriors from the grasslands.

62
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,549
Your look now is not that persuasive.

63
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,518
Stop flaunting your manhood.

64
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,439
I didn't.

65
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,159
I'm a great man, indeed.

66
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,559
You are if you're alive, or else you're just a dead man!

67
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,518
So, did you take care of me for the whole night?

68
00:04:48,518 --> 00:04:50,320
Of course.

69
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:52,919
Lie down.

70
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,280
It's a little bit cold.

71
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,518
Why are you smiling?

72
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:08,679
It's itchy, itchy.

73
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,160
<i>The northwest region is on the left, much more away from Luoyang.</i>

74
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,599
<i>Her Highness can't be there.</i>

75
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,838
<i>Ji State is in the middle.</i>

76
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:46,040
<i>Cang State is on the right.</i>

77
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,839
<i>Princess, if you left Yun State, where would you go?</i>

78
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:57,600
<i>This is from you. I hope it can tell me about your whereabouts.</i>

79
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,960
<i>Ji State on the front, Cang State on the reverse.</i>

80
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,700
Sun.

81
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,558
Didn't I tell you to get some good rest?

82
00:06:28,559 --> 00:06:30,159
You've just gotten well. Why did you come here?

83
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,699
I've been recovered long before.

84
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:34,879
Well, our provisions are running out, right?

85
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,619
I want to purchase some with Mimi Guli.

86
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,599
Why? Do you still suspect her?

87
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,479
Only taking her with you can convince yourself?

88
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,499
No! No! It's not what I mean!

89
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:55,159
Well, I think this girl is smart.

90
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,879
I can get better bargains with her.

91
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,509
Besides, I want to show my appreciation to her

92
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,880
for taking care of me that day.

93
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,358
Okay.

94
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:09,959
Great.

95
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:23,319
Look at your lambs. All of them look like you!

96
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
They are white!

97
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,420
Mimi!

98
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,820
Wait a minute.

99
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,659
- Look, Mu Jin is here again.
- Right.

100
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:37,199
What's wrong?

101
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,019
I want to ask if you're willing to purchase goods in Yun State with me?

102
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:43,218
Me?

103
00:07:43,218 --> 00:07:44,499
Don't be overthinking.

104
00:07:44,499 --> 00:07:48,159
Just because a woman is better at bargaining than a man.

105
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:52,479
Although Yun State is not comparable to Chang'an, it's bustling enough.

106
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,879
You must haven't seen it before.

107
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,740
I will tell Military Counsellor Li later.

108
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,879
Just come with me.

109
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,778
Okay. See you later!

110
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,740
Changge, what are you embroidering?

111
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,379
It's quite ugly.

112
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,078
This is the only pattern I'm able to embroider.

113
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:21,859
If you don't like it, just use the package.

114
00:08:21,859 --> 00:08:24,958
No. No. I like it. Who said I didn't like it?

115
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,000
Go on.

116
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:33,520
This money bag is indeed ugly.

117
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,119
It's not, it looks good.

118
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:42,860
What's wrong? Are you okay?

119
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,619
Yes.

120
00:08:44,619 --> 00:08:46,238
I didn't mean that.

121
00:08:46,238 --> 00:08:49,520
Anyone who said it's ugly shows no appreciation.

122
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,880
You said it, too.

123
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,959
I think that each one you embroider is pretty.

124
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,939
Changge, how about telling me something interesting

125
00:09:00,939 --> 00:09:04,839
or delicious in the markets of the central plain?

126
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,718
Or tell me what do you want? I will buy it for you.

127
00:09:07,719 --> 00:09:09,760
Do you have money?

128
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,340
I can borrow from Mu Jin.

129
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:18,939
I can be his servant for some days as payment.

130
00:09:18,939 --> 00:09:21,679
I don't allow you to be the servant of others.

131
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,118
Changge, you like rabbits very much, don't you?

132
00:09:34,119 --> 00:09:35,839
I used to like them.

133
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,840
What about now?

134
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:41,519
<i>[Rabbit.]</i>

135
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,220
It's done.

136
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,399
Here.

137
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,100
Is this for me?

138
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,099
I've got some payment as a military counselor.

139
00:09:58,099 --> 00:09:59,519
Just buy anything you want.

140
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,480
No need to save money for me.

141
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:12,119
I haven't been treated so well for so long.

142
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,159
Thank you, Changge.

143
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:18,319
I will buy anything you want for you.

144
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:21,678
When you arrive in Yun State, it will be the Mid-Autumn Festival.

145
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:24,720
In my hometown, we would eat moon cakes

146
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,279
and stay with our family at this festival.

147
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,220
Besides, we would light the sky lanterns as well.

148
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,218
There is no mooncake in the grasslands.

149
00:10:30,218 --> 00:10:33,280
You may taste it in Yun State.

150
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,899
Are you homesick?

151
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:44,999
Be assured, I'll definitely buy many mooncakes for you.

152
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:03,478
The stitch is not tight enough.

153
00:11:03,479 --> 00:11:06,399
It's still the problem of the warping.

154
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,760
Lack of practice.

155
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,319
This is a completed fabric.

156
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,359
Send it to the cloth shop. They will be happy.

157
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,559
Bad news!

158
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:36,979
The purchasing manager said that

159
00:11:36,979 --> 00:11:38,900
due to the constant heavy rain and their dead stock,

160
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,699
they want to withdraw this cloth order.

161
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,678
We tried every method to persuade them, but they insisted on canceling the order.

162
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,579
Luckily, they didn't ask for the front money back.

163
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,730
<i>- What should we do?
- Right.</i>

164
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,460
The front money is useless.

165
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,730
It seems that we might suffer a heavy loss.

166
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,680
Miss Chai, I've got an idea.

167
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:07,480
We can take our cloth products to the market for selling.

168
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,260
- This idea is practical.
- Right.

169
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,479
It's a good idea.

170
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,239
Okay.

171
00:12:13,239 --> 00:12:16,249
Let's follow Xiao Yan's advice and sell the cloth at the market.

172
00:12:16,249 --> 00:12:17,999
Get ready now, let's go and sell our cloth.

173
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,960
<i>- Okay.
- Okay.
- Hurry.</i>

174
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,760
- Be careful.
- Okay.

175
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,060
This is good.

176
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,459
Right, let's come again later.

177
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,560
Waiter.

178
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,460
Waiter!

179
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,798
How many days does it take to Cang State?

180
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,259
Sir, it isn't far away.

181
00:12:48,259 --> 00:12:50,439
It would take one or two days if you speed up.

182
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,240
Thank you.

183
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,300
What a coincidence.

184
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:04,500
What's wrong? You're sick?

185
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:07,959
Not serious.

186
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,598
I was caught in the rain and got a cold.

187
00:13:09,599 --> 00:13:11,558
You must take care of yourself,

188
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:15,600
or else you may get worse before finding the princess.

189
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,118
It's nothing comparing to Yueyan's safety.

190
00:13:19,119 --> 00:13:22,320
Don't worry, I can stick it out.

191
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,358
Let's deal with Her Highness's business later.

192
00:13:24,359 --> 00:13:27,699
His Majesty has decreed to call you back to Chang'an for reporting.

193
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:29,660
You will be appointed as Supervisory Censor.

194
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,419
What?

195
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:32,580
How do you know?

196
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,879
It's no doubt that I always keep in contact with the people in Chang'an.

197
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,198
- But...
- Stop it.

198
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:39,238
Do you want to resist the decree of His Majesty?

199
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:44,019
Yueyan hasn't been found, how can I just leave?

200
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:48,180
I hope to atone for my fault.

201
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,999
I won't shirk from my responsibility.

202
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,640
I must find Yueyan back.

203
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,079
Look at your current condition.

204
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,918
If you don't get treatment in time,

205
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:02,199
you will hardly be able to Her Highness in the future,

206
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,379
not to mention working for His Majesty.

207
00:14:04,379 --> 00:14:08,400
You should think twice about which one is the most important.

208
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,740
I can go back to report.

209
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,439
However, Brother Hao, Yueyan is just like my sister.

210
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:17,118
Please remember...

211
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:19,400
I will try my best.

212
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,290
<i>[Dou'an Inn]</i>

213
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:57,139
Boss, do you really think this handkerchief can sell well in Cang State?

214
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:59,350
Yun State is famous for the handicraft industry.

215
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:01,478
Most people there are weavers.

216
00:15:01,479 --> 00:15:02,959
What about Cang State?

217
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:09,598
Look. This delicate skill and stitch look like the royal style.

218
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:14,779
If we bring this to Cang State, the royal ladies will treasure it!

219
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:17,549
<i>Look! I embroidered a rabbit.</i>

220
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,959
<i>Other people always embroider the rabbit's eyes in red</i>

221
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,598
<i>but I embroidered them in green.</i>

222
00:15:23,599 --> 00:15:27,439
<i>Because there are meadows in the rabbit's eyes, that means freedom.</i>

223
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,170
I think the girl who embroidered this must be sophisticated.

224
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,038
What are you doing?

225
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,439
Where is this handkerchief from?

226
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,558
Do you want to be my competitor?

227
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:39,859
I'm not interested in the business. I'm asking you again.

228
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:41,999
Where did you get the handkerchief?

229
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,358
I've been a merchant for decades but never been afraid of threats.

230
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:51,660
Let me tell you! A business man only cares about profit.

231
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,399
Is this enough?

232
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,200
Boss?

233
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,199
Weaving Workshop of Western Suburb in Yun State,

234
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:01,598
It's made by a young lady.

235
00:16:01,598 --> 00:16:05,319
<i>Your Highness, it turns out that you are still in Yun State.</i>

236
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:07,120
<i>I was too careless.</i>

237
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,000
He left so quickly!

238
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,550
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival,

239
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,180
a festival for families to gather together.

240
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,340
However, I have something sad to tell you.

241
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,279
What's that?

242
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,519
Actually, it can't be called a sad story.

243
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,479
It's good news.

244
00:16:26,479 --> 00:16:31,918
Because of the military havoc, the government notes door to door

245
00:16:31,918 --> 00:16:34,539
that if anyone in the border who wants to go back to the central plain

246
00:16:34,539 --> 00:16:37,118
can go with their army to the south.

247
00:16:37,118 --> 00:16:41,260
At that time, a new identity will be registered.

248
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,839
It's said that they also distribute lands.

249
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,839
Really?

250
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,919
- That means I can go back home!
<i>- Perfect!</i>

251
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:48,338
We have the fate to meet each other,

252
00:16:48,338 --> 00:16:53,379
how about we selling Miss Chai's cloth before we leave?

253
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:54,279
Okay.

254
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,380
Of course!

255
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,100
Whatever happens, the Weaving Workshop of Western Suburb is always our home.

256
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,239
It will be here forever.

257
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,900
Okay, go sell the cloth now.

258
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,660
Nobody can go if she sells even a penny less.

259
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,839
<i>- Yes.
- Okay.</i>

260
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,240
<i>- Let's go.</i>
- Xiao Yan.

261
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,359
<i>- Here.
- This one.</i>

262
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:20,559
Xiao Yan. Just stay, you're homeless anyway.

263
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,118
I won't let you go hungry when I have food.

264
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,039
Thank you, Miss Chai.

265
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:31,739
Miss Chai, may I ask where is the troop to the south going?

266
00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:33,599
They will go straight to the south.

267
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,180
I think they may pass by many places.

268
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,118
Will they go to Luoyang?

269
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:41,438
What? Do you want to go to Luoyang?

270
00:17:41,439 --> 00:17:45,860
One of my houses is located in Luoyang.

271
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,838
Miss Chai, please let me go with them to sell the cloth for you.

272
00:17:50,839 --> 00:17:54,460
I want to pay your favor back as much as I can.

273
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,478
Don't you worry about the manhunt of the local authority?

274
00:17:56,478 --> 00:17:58,358
I think it is fine.

275
00:17:58,359 --> 00:18:02,859
Didn't you say that no one is asking about me now?

276
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:05,218
Okay. Go with them.

277
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:07,830
It's good to get more experience.

278
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,680
Here.

279
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:15,439
Go.

280
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,500
Go!

281
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,218
- Here.
- Thank you, Mother.

282
00:18:27,218 --> 00:18:28,999
Good.

283
00:18:31,439 --> 00:18:33,039
Come here.

284
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,620
<i>[Yun State.]</i>

285
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,400
Let's go.

286
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:49,959
Let's go.

287
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:57,870
<i>Toys. Come take a look.</i>

288
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,300
<i>- Toys.
- Let me take a look at that one.
- Okay.</i>

289
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,319
I knew you'd like it here.

290
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,919
There!

291
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,540
There are more!

292
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:19,379
Looks nice!

293
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,780
How much is it?

294
00:19:26,739 --> 00:19:28,019
Hurry, hurry up!

295
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:29,919
Coming!

296
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,439
- Taste this, is it yummy?
- Yes.

297
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:36,330
<i>What color is good? Pick one that looks good.</i>

298
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:37,920
Mimi, what do you think?

299
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,179
Did you enjoy it? Should we go purchasing now?

300
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,380
There is no rush.

301
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,349
This is my first time to see so many people and goods!

302
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,198
What's more, they look so happy!

303
00:19:46,199 --> 00:19:47,478
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

304
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:49,109
Of course, it is bustling.

305
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,740
Mid-Autumn Festival?

306
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,799
The Mid-Autumn Festival is also called the festival of the moon.

307
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,699
Every year, the people in the central plain

308
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,559
gather together to appreciate the moon on this day.

309
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,539
- And—
- Eat mooncake.

310
00:20:00,539 --> 00:20:01,899
How do you know?

311
00:20:01,899 --> 00:20:05,579
Do you think you're the only one who is knowledgeable?

312
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,438
Mimi.

313
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:12,759
Mimi, did I say anything wrong?

314
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:14,118
No.

315
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:19,919
So, the Mid-Autumn Festival should be spent with family?

316
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,399
Actually, it's not that interesting.

317
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,438
Just see the moon with the family members.

318
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:25,819
Nothing special.

319
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,900
Look there!

320
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,600
Let's go!

321
00:20:31,379 --> 00:20:33,880
<i>Candid haws on sell!</i>

322
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,820
This cloth looks good.

323
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,219
Mimi, look. It's suitable for you.

324
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,369
Come on!

325
00:20:42,369 --> 00:20:43,639
This color?

326
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,020
I think it's more like Auntie Su Yili's style.

327
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,979
How about this?

328
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:52,219
This color is special.

329
00:20:52,219 --> 00:20:54,858
This is suitable for Su Yishe.

330
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:56,040
Let's go.

331
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,740
Lady.

332
00:21:00,499 --> 00:21:03,858
Look, Lady. Do you like this pattern?

333
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:05,519
Unfortunately, the cloth with embroidery was sold out.

334
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:08,958
If it wasn't, you would have looked great in that pattern.

335
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:10,500
You should have shown this earlier.

336
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,479
This is really good.

337
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,718
Today is a festival, I want to buy it as a gift.

338
00:21:16,719 --> 00:21:17,979
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

339
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,980
If you like, you can pick more for your family.

340
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,820
They would feel happy to see it.

341
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,559
No need.

342
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,259
Lady, did I say anything wrong?

343
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:34,339
Don't bother with me. I won't buy it.

344
00:21:34,339 --> 00:21:37,018
Lady, I didn't mean to let you buy my cloth.

345
00:21:37,018 --> 00:21:40,940
When I mentioned your family, you—

346
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:47,239
Mimi.

347
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,439
Get away from me.

348
00:21:50,979 --> 00:21:53,759
That girl said it without thinking just now. Don't mind it.

349
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:55,880
You shouldn't talk about it, either.

350
00:22:09,439 --> 00:22:15,299
Well, I've gotten into a bad mood just now.

351
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:17,559
I'm sorry.

352
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:19,219
No need to say sorry.

353
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:22,000
It's fine once you feel happy.

354
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,939
- Shall we go on shopping?
- Do you want to eat this?

355
00:22:27,939 --> 00:22:32,139
<i>Sachet, come and have a look.</i>

356
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:35,840
<i>Be careful to hold it.</i>

357
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,100
<i>Mooncake. Mooncake on sale.</i>

358
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,598
This looks tasty.

359
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,100
How about I buy one for you?

360
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,839
As my apology.

361
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,420
Okay, I accept that.

362
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,459
Mooncakes. Mooncakes on sale.

363
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:51,579
Hello. How much for a mooncake?

364
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,939
Three coins for five, reasonable price.

365
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:54,699
Okay.

366
00:22:54,699 --> 00:22:56,860
They're all just ready.

367
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:01,999
What's wrong?

368
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,640
Do you have Changge's money bag?

369
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,040
No.

370
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,919
I don't have it.

371
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,859
Oh no.

372
00:23:08,859 --> 00:23:11,318
It seems I've lost Changge's money bag.

373
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:13,279
Just lost some money, I've got enough.

374
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,859
It's not a matter of money.

375
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:17,318
This is a money bag made by Changge.

376
00:23:17,318 --> 00:23:18,739
Just a bag.

377
00:23:18,739 --> 00:23:20,078
I will buy ten for her later.

378
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,738
- She won't blame you.
- No.

379
00:23:21,738 --> 00:23:24,718
I can never lose the gift from Changge!

380
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:26,039
I have to find it back!

381
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,358
I'll go back now.

382
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:28,918
Mimi!

383
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,919
Where are you going?

384
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,359
Don't be anxious.

385
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,499
Let's recall which stalls we've been to.

386
00:23:34,499 --> 00:23:35,999
You might have left it behind in one of those stalls.

387
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,759
Right.

388
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,078
Trust me, I'll help you find it.

389
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:39,559
You can look for it in this market.

390
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,279
I will go back to the previous stalls to have a look.

391
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,679
Let's meet here later.

392
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,119
Okay, go now.

393
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,260
The stalls just now.

394
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:54,238
One hundred and sixty-one.

395
00:23:54,239 --> 00:23:55,838
One hundred and sixty-two.

396
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,859
One hundred and sixty-three.

397
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:03,520
Finally, I can pay Ms. Chai's favor back this time.

398
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,939
<i>But I feel so sorry for that lady.</i>

399
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,519
<i>She might think of something grievous by my words.</i>

400
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,510
<i>I should apologize to her if I can see her again.</i>

401
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,318
Don't move!

402
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,200
You're back.

403
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,879
Certainly, I would be.

404
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,639
I knew it! Lady, you must like this cloth.

405
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:38,859
Let me give you this as a gift of apology.

406
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,400
What? Do you want to end this by giving me a roll of cloth?

407
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,759
What do you think?

408
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,919
I certainly want you to return me the money bag you've stolen.

409
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,319
What are you doing? This is my bag!

410
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:50,119
How could it be yours!

411
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,039
What a coincidence? This is exactly the same as the one I lost.

412
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:57,199
Even the ugly rabbit on it is the same.

413
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,958
Give it back to me!

414
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:02,619
You must recognize it wrongly, this is really mine.

415
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,858
Thief! You stole my bag but deny it!

416
00:25:05,858 --> 00:25:06,919
- How dare you grab it?
- Give it to me.

417
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,839
What are you doing?

418
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,639
I said it was my money bag, how can you behave so rudely?

419
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,759
I...

420
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,559
<i>Unreasonable.</i>

421
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,379
I didn't!

422
00:25:20,379 --> 00:25:22,958
I discussed this with you in a nice manner and tone.

423
00:25:22,959 --> 00:25:24,519
But you refused to return it to me.

424
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,519
Give it back to me, or else I'll take it myself.

425
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,999
You're so unreasonable.

426
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,138
Fine. You want to be reasonable, right?

427
00:25:31,138 --> 00:25:34,899
Tell me. Can you prove this is your money bag?

428
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:38,299
There are one hundred and sixty-three coins in the bag.

429
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,259
I earned it by selling the cloth roll by roll.

430
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:45,399
The bag is in your hand, of course, you know how many coins in it.

431
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,279
Fine.

432
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,219
Show me your proof if you think this is yours.

433
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,419
This rabbit.

434
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,639
I used the ugly but cute colors of white and green.

435
00:25:53,639 --> 00:25:56,879
Besides, the stitch has been repeatedly removed and sewed.

436
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,099
The most important is,

437
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:01,599
there is a twisted character of "rabbit" sewed in the bag.

438
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,920
<i>[Rabbit]</i>

439
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,399
How do you know that?

440
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,900
This is my money bag!

441
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,460
See? I'm telling the truth.

442
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,418
<i>Really.</i>

443
00:26:17,418 --> 00:26:18,840
<i>See?</i>

444
00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:23,039
This thief stole my bag but said it was hers.

445
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,458
She's a liar!

446
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,999
Listen, I won't take any one of your coins.

447
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,639
I'm in a hurry today, or else I would not let you go.

448
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,979
Thief!

449
00:26:31,979 --> 00:26:33,958
Stop there!

450
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,399
<i>Shame on her.</i>

451
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,598
<i>How could she steal from others?</i>

452
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:38,999
<i>Right.</i>

453
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,879
<i>Let's go.</i>

454
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,580
<i>What a bad girl.</i>

455
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,059
What happened?

456
00:27:13,239 --> 00:27:14,118
Forget it.

457
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:17,039
If you didn't sell it well, it's okay.

458
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,198
This is your first time selling at the market,

459
00:27:19,199 --> 00:27:21,318
you must be shy to cry your wares.

460
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:24,919
If you sincerely want to go to Luoyang, I won't deduct your money.

461
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,520
It's okay.

462
00:27:35,939 --> 00:27:37,519
You earned so much money!

463
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,358
Yueyan, you're amazing!

464
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,759
I looked down upon you.

465
00:27:43,959 --> 00:27:47,280
Yueyan, have you decided to go back to Luoyang?

466
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,090
Give me your hand.

467
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:53,159
Take this money.

468
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,279
You need lots of money on your way.

469
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,078
Don't tell them.

470
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:59,799
I will pay you all your wages later.

471
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,999
This is my secret reward to you.

472
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,420
This is our fate.

473
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,598
But there would be hardness and evil conditions on the way.

474
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:10,838
It won't be as cozy as Yun State.

475
00:28:10,839 --> 00:28:12,238
Can you stand it?

476
00:28:12,239 --> 00:28:16,318
I had never gone out of my home alone before.

477
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,739
Even though I was driven out,

478
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,859
I would not be able to know how to go back home.

479
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,198
But now I've learned a lot from you and the ladies.

480
00:28:27,199 --> 00:28:30,238
I can even sell the cloth at the market.

481
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:31,839
I think...

482
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:35,639
I can find the way back home.

483
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,800
I will never forget you.

484
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,240
Okay, okay.

485
00:28:58,439 --> 00:29:00,979
Mimi, I found it!

486
00:29:00,979 --> 00:29:02,399
How can you be so careless?

487
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,799
You left it in the previous shop.

488
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,258
Check it. Anything missing?

489
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,400
Well...

490
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:13,539
Oh no.

491
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,198
This was embroidered by Changge.

492
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:16,799
So the thief just now...

493
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,358
What thief?

494
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:19,859
The girl...

495
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,438
Mimi, where are you going?

496
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:24,679
The market is off. The gate of the city is closing.

497
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:30,679
We made some money these days.

498
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:34,759
I will distribute the money to each of you.

499
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:40,379
Now that you've decided to leave, we should say goodbye in harmony.

500
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,819
In a word, I hope you all be safe and sound.

501
00:29:44,819 --> 00:29:46,718
There are some flapjacks in the kitchen.

502
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:48,838
Take some with you.

503
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:50,838
When you leave Yunzhou,

504
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:54,040
it will be hard to eat something warm on the way.

505
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:57,079
Here.

506
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:01,438
I'm worried about you the most!

507
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:05,239
You've been here just for a few days, learning only some brief skills.

508
00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:10,118
But at least you've got craftsmanship to make a living.

509
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:15,499
You should be diligent on your way so that you can survive.

510
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,099
Why are you crying?

511
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:24,719
Everyone has its destiny.

512
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,339
I'm still here to weave.

513
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:32,019
Everybody, promise me you will live a good life.

514
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:35,660
Someday we might meet each other in the future.

515
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:40,859
Come on.

516
00:30:40,859 --> 00:30:42,578
Go and pack up.

517
00:30:42,578 --> 00:30:46,338
Go with the troop before the city gate is closed.

518
00:30:46,338 --> 00:30:47,939
Go and pack up.

519
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:53,619
Go.

520
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,519
Mimi, it's getting dark, who are you looking for?

521
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,379
Oh no. She has left.

522
00:31:12,379 --> 00:31:15,358
The girl who sells the cloth, this money bag is really hers.

523
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:18,680
I grabbed it from her just now.

524
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,580
Look! Although the bags are nearly the same,

525
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,639
one is brand new, the other has been used for some time.

526
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,958
Maybe they were both made by Changge.

527
00:31:27,959 --> 00:31:30,639
The only difference is the time Changge embroidered it.

528
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,198
They are exactly the same.

529
00:31:32,199 --> 00:31:34,519
How could it be such a coincidence?

530
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,718
I don't know it, either.

531
00:31:35,719 --> 00:31:38,578
Maybe only Changge knows the true story.

532
00:31:38,578 --> 00:31:41,300
Let's go back and ask her.

533
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,019
<i>[Yun State]</i>

534
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:49,399
I've blamed you frequently these days,

535
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,078
but that is for helping you to improve your skill.

536
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:53,099
Don't be mad at me.

537
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,679
Remember to follow them closely later.

538
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,199
The weather is cold, remember to put on more clothes,

539
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:05,659
don't catch a cold.

540
00:32:05,659 --> 00:32:09,019
Miss Chai, are you sure you won't go with us?

541
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,159
All generations of my family live in Yun State.

542
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,899
This is my home.

543
00:32:14,479 --> 00:32:17,358
Thank you for taking care of me these days.

544
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:22,019
Yueyan can't give you anything else but a bag

545
00:32:22,019 --> 00:32:25,999
made by myself as a souvenir.

546
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,560
<i>Come on, time to go!</i>

547
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:33,298
When you meet with trouble alone, don't be anxious or scared.

548
00:32:33,298 --> 00:32:35,298
Learn to ask for help if necessary.

549
00:32:35,298 --> 00:32:37,418
Just stay away from danger.

550
00:32:37,418 --> 00:32:39,419
Don't get injured.

551
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:43,180
I believe that you can protect yourself well.

552
00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:46,459
By the way, I packed many flapjacks in your bag.

553
00:32:46,459 --> 00:32:48,418
You can eat them for a long while.

554
00:32:48,418 --> 00:32:50,478
Don't let them see it.

555
00:32:50,479 --> 00:32:52,358
The gate is closing.

556
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:53,859
Go.

557
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,559
Miss Chai, take care.

558
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,679
Stand up.

559
00:33:01,239 --> 00:33:03,279
Be careful on the way.

560
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,030
<i>[Yun State]</i>

561
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:15,959
We can't go out?

562
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:17,960
Let's go back tomorrow.

563
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,478
It's all my fault.

564
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:22,459
I lost the bag so we are late.

565
00:34:22,459 --> 00:34:25,820
It's impossible for us to go back to Eagle Division today.

566
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,229
It's not a big deal.

567
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,989
Every year I purchase in the border market,

568
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:32,149
I'd stay for one or two nights.

569
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,749
Nobody would worry about this.

570
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,229
What should we do tonight?

571
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,419
Go with me. Brother Mu Jin will take you to live in the post house.

572
00:34:40,910 --> 00:34:42,210
I...

573
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,970
Wait for me.

574
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:57,310
I've asked Mu Jin to buy the cloth and herbs we need.

575
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,510
<i>[August 15th of lunar calendar.]</i>

576
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,509
What's wrong?

577
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,819
Today is August 15th of the lunar calendar.

578
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,760
Right, the winter is coming.

579
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,960
August 15th of the lunar calendar...

580
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:22,220
It is the Mid-Autumn Festival of your hometown, right?

581
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,249
I heard that in the central plain,

582
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:29,269
people would appreciate the moon and lights,

583
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,579
and eat mooncakes every Mid-Autumn Festival.

584
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,540
Can Auntie Su Yili make moon cakes?

585
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,439
I will let her have a try.

586
00:35:36,439 --> 00:35:38,440
No need to bother.

587
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,010
The meaning of this festival is not about these.

588
00:35:41,769 --> 00:35:45,189
Once the home and the family is with you,

589
00:35:45,189 --> 00:35:47,190
it can be called as Mid-Autumn Festival.

590
00:35:49,309 --> 00:35:53,168
General Sun, if you have no more commands, I'm leaving now.

591
00:35:53,168 --> 00:35:54,569
Wait.

592
00:35:56,309 --> 00:35:58,089
I've got something for you.

593
00:36:04,109 --> 00:36:05,609
Here you are.

594
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,790
How can this stone shine?

595
00:36:15,789 --> 00:36:17,629
Look at the light.

596
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,270
Is it like the glowworm we saw that night?

597
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,339
Why are you giving this to me?

598
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,339
I just want to tell you

599
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,949
that once you sincerely pursue the beautiful things,

600
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:32,070
they can surely be saved.

601
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:35,569
Likewise,

602
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,949
the place with family is home

603
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,870
while the place that makes you feel secure can be called home as well.

604
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:47,420
There is also a happy reunion in the grasslands.

605
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:52,340
Actually, I hope peace and happiness

606
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:58,020
will last forever, both in the grasslands and the central plain.

607
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,050
I hope there will be no more war.

608
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:09,949
Thanks for your gift, General Sun.

609
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,850
Goodbye.

610
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:28,770
Mimi.

611
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,779
You scared me.

612
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,819
Haven't you gone to bed?

613
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,059
What are you doing here?

614
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:36,379
I'm watching them spend the festival here.

615
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:40,720
The boy over there held a pile of moon cakes,

616
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,080
staying with his family. They are happy and harmonious.

617
00:37:47,789 --> 00:37:48,828
Try it.

618
00:37:48,829 --> 00:37:50,269
Where did you buy it?

619
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,229
When I searched the money bag for you,

620
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,299
the mooncake stall hadn't packed up yet.

621
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,290
And you were not back, so I bought one there.

622
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,099
Have a taste, it's still warm.

623
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,909
It's been a long time, how could it still be warm?

624
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:06,820
I kept it in my arms, warming it with my body.

625
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,230
- How is it?
- It tastes good.

626
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,970
How about having a taste as well?

627
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,429
Don't tear it.

628
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:20,749
Mooncakes should look like the moon.

629
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,589
If you tear it up, the meaning of reunion would be ruined.

630
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,539
Really?

631
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,859
Absolutely.

632
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:27,040
The is the local custom.

633
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,450
Well...

634
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,480
It tastes just so-so and may hurt my teeth.

635
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,670
Anyway, I think it tastes good.

636
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,380
Let me take one more bite, I didn't get the flavor.

637

00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,000
Very tasty.

641
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:09,550
It's tasty.

00:39:22,389 --> 00:39:25,349
Mimi, are you homesick?

646
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,830
No.

647
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,469
You can tell me about your past.

648
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,730
I won't tell anyone else, I swear.

649
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:45,090
I was kidnapped as a servant since my childhood.

650
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:51,070
So I can remember little about my hometown.

651
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,229
What a coincidence.

652
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,868
I was a servant, too.

653
00:39:54,869 --> 00:39:55,859
You?

654
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,199
I was a servant born in the Khan's tent,

655
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:00,329
so I haven't been to my hometown at all.

656
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,549
If so, how can you...

657
00:40:01,549 --> 00:40:04,479
Become the military counselor of Eagle Division,

658
00:40:04,479 --> 00:40:07,099
admired and followed by ten thousand people?

659
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,870
Stop the narcissism.

660
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:12,569
Actually, these are all because of Sun's help.

661
00:40:12,569 --> 00:40:14,749
When I was a child, I was nearly beaten to death.

662
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,019
Sun saved me.

663
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,719
Later, he was titled "Great Warrior" by the Great Khan.

664
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:21,469
He took me to the Eagle Division.

665
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:25,130
Later, Eagle Division became my home.

666
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,989
Mimi.

667
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,628
Actually, Eagle Division is a nice place.

668
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:32,059
Look at Li Changge.

669
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,249
She also lives well there, doesn't she?

670
00:40:34,249 --> 00:40:39,110
I hope someday, Eagle Division can be your home as well.

671
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:51,470
It's getting really late.

672
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:53,850
Go back and have a good rest.

673
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,959
Okay, you should go to bed early, too.

674
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:01,950
We'll set off tomorrow.

675
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,730
Changge.

676
00:41:34,750 --> 00:41:36,180
Where did you get this?

677
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,059
You can say I stole it.

678
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:43,249
Yesterday, I carelessly lost the money bag you gave me in the market.

679
00:41:43,249 --> 00:41:47,539
And a girl's bag was exactly the same as yours.

680
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,249
I thought she stole mine.

681
00:41:49,249 --> 00:41:51,150
So..

682
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:55,299
However, Changge, I saw you embroider this money bag here.

683
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,539
How could she have the same one?

684
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:01,100
I made one to a friend of mine as well.

685
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,749
Mimi, what does the girl look like?

686
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:10,619
She is not tall, but her appearance is comely.

687
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,339
And she's timid.

688
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:16,989
I didn't say anything harsh while she dared not to speak more.

689
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,870
It's really Yueyan.

690
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,469
Why is Yueyan in Yun State?

691
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,989
Yueyan?

692
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:25,110
She is a best friend of mine from before.

693
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:28,349
Mimi, where did you meet her?

694
00:42:28,349 --> 00:42:30,399
At Yun State's market.

695
00:42:30,399 --> 00:42:36,388
She took a bamboo basket with her to sell cloth at the market.

696
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:38,149
<i>There must be something wrong.</i>

697
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:40,028
<i>How could Yueyan be in Yun State?</i>

698
00:42:40,029 --> 00:42:44,009
<i>A girl like her who has never worked should do business now.</i>

699
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:47,429
<i>No.</i>

700
00:42:47,429 --> 00:42:48,859
<i>I have to go to find her.</i>

701
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,288
Mimi. Thank you.

702
00:42:52,288 --> 00:42:53,410
Changge, where are you going?

703
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,709
To Yun State.

704
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:57,610
Do you need... my company?

705
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:03,550
<i>[Orders to infiltrate Chang'an]</i>

706
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:06,770
- Great Khan decided to set off now?
- Lower your voice.

707
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:09,249
This is way too sudden.

708
00:43:09,249 --> 00:43:11,850
Great Khan has planned about this long before.

709
00:43:14,409 --> 00:43:16,269
General Sun, the military counselor made me inform you

710
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:18,630
that she went to Yun State for some business.

711
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,910
Hey.

712
00:43:23,589 --> 00:43:25,989
Does she really want to inform you?

713
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,490
Let her be this time.

714
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:32,950
Mu Jin, do not tell her about my military expedition.
