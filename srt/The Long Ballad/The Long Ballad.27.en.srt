I promised to give him a cart of rice.

I would take him to Chang'an

00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,340
I dare not waste time.

169
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,640
Please receive it, Commander.

170
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,560
<i>[I've seen your report. I ordered the crown prince to Luoyang to inspect around counties for the damage for me.]</i>

171
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,159
Thanks a lot. Please report for me.

172
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,379
Princess Yongan has been found in Luoyang. She's fine.

173
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:58,650
Please rest assured.

174
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,270
Yes.

175
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,560
Forgive me, please. I forgot you were...

176
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,249
I'll send some guards for you tomorrow. To protect you.

177
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:10,740
I came here for...

178
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,400
- I'll come tomorrow.
- Wait.

179
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,299
It's late now. You must have come here because of an emergency.

180
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:19,830
Yes.

181
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,670
I just received a handwritten letter from His Majesty from Chang'an.

182
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,770
Please have a look.

183
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:32,139
Crown Prince has left Chang'an to inspect the damage to show grace on behalf of His Majesty.

184
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:34,640
He'll arrive in a few days.

185
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,149
Thank you for delivering the letter, Young Master Hao.

186
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:39,540
I'll read it later.

187
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,240
In that case, I won't hurry to go back.

188
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,750
The crown prince is young and naughty.

189
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,880
I have to look after him.

190
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,670
I can help you with that.

191
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,150
- But...
- I've decided it.

192
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,890
You have to stay with me in Luoyang for a while, Young Master Hao.

193
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:02,200
Princess, you've changed a lot.

194
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,380
What happened is a mixed blessing.

195
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,010
I lost, I gained.

196
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,470
Now I know what Father often said to me.

197
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,550
People live hard. How can we stand by?

198
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,200
I'm his daughter.

199
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,160
How can I stay ignorant?

200
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,530
You've suffered a great deal, haven't you?

201
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,680
I met many difficulties

202
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,050
and many people to express my gratitude, as well.

203
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,350
Difficulties will be gone,

204
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:40,500
but the gratitude will be cherished in my heart forever.

205
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,250
In the past, I only saw people's appearance.

206
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:51,140
Now I know I need to see what's in their mind.

207
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,460
Someone seems kind but hides a malicious heart.

208
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,170
Someone has a cold face but a kind heart.

209
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:04,000
Just like you, Young Master Hao.

210
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,390
<i>[Silence Room]</i>

211
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,979
Why can't I master it?

212
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:16,439
<i>Your Dao is different.
(T/N: Dao: Taoism teaches about the various disciplines for achieving "perfection" by becoming one with the unplanned rhythms of the universe)</i>

213
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:19,319
<i>You can't do it. Give up now.</i>

214
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:21,580
Different Dao?

215
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,120
Where's the difference?

216
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,420
<i>In your opinion, what's my reason to defend Shuozhou?</i>

217
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,380
<i>Fights or surrenders are just the means</i>

218
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,079
<i>to guarantee that the citizens stay away from war and live a happy life.</i>

219
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,200
<i>These are the most important.</i>

220
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,460
<i>This is the Dao I stick to.</i>

221
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:58,520
<i>[Non-interference]</i>

222
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:02,319
What exactly is my Dao?

223
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:09,998
Senior Qin, did Yuan fall asleep?

224
00:20:09,998 --> 00:20:12,559
- Yes.
- Okay.

225
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,099
We asked Luo Shiba to share messages with us.

226
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,338
But when we sent the message, she never wrote back.

227
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:22,079
Now she suddenly wanted to see us and would bring a friend to us.

228
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:24,130
A friend?

229
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,178
We have no progress so far.

230
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:33,239
Maybe this friend can bring some messages of Young Master.

231
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:43,000
Luo Shiba, here you are.

232
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,439
Your friend is...

233
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,959
Luo Shiba.

234
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:53,320
This is your friend?

235
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,940
Everyone listen, kill Ashile Sun to take revenge for the governor.

236
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,499
Wait.

237
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,940
About Gongsun Heng, I have a clear conscience.

238
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,779
Now Changge is missing.

239
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,739
I come here only to find her.

240
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,380
Find her?

241
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,218
It's you who took her to the grassland

242
00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:22,039
where she encountered misery, isn't it?

243
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:25,798
Luo Shiba, you don't know what Ashile Tribe means to us, do you?

244
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:27,439
How can you bring him to Great Tang?

245
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:29,180
I only want to find her.

246
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,379
I'll find a way to find her even without your help.

247
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,080
You...

248
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,998
Ashile Sun, answer me.

249
00:21:36,998 --> 00:21:41,238
Did you provoke by posting up the notice that Commandant Li sacrificed for the country?

250
00:21:41,238 --> 00:21:43,159
It was me.

251
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,999
It was the best way to defend Commandant Li.

252
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:51,659
So what's your purpose to find her?

253
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,879
I have no purpose.

254
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:59,160
Only because... she's my friend.

255
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,320
Friend?

256
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,480
Commandant Li is your friend?

257
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,938
Senior Qin, you're confused by him.

258
00:22:06,938 --> 00:22:09,319
Do you believe he's a friend of Commandant Li's?

259
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:14,279
You should know how the whole city reviled Commandant Li.

260
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:19,839
It's Ashile Tribe's notice that subsided their rage.

261
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,959
Ashile Sun from Eagle Division is a master in archery.

262
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:27,619
Commandant Li was shot by him that day but survived.

263
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:30,539
I felt strange at that time.

264
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,538
Now I know why.

265
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:36,819
You're old friends.

266
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:40,880
So you put Commandant Li first.

267
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,799
How about the revenge for the governor and his wife?

268
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,639
The war always causes many casualties.

269
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:52,130
Ashile Sun granted the governor's wish

270
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,490
to save those citizens.

271
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,519
It's his mercy.

272
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:01,679
Xu Feng, it's not the moment for rash actions.

273
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,079
Now our goal is to find Young Master.

274
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:08,619
She has a special status. We can only search for her stealthily.

275
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,080
More hands, more power.

276
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,719
Get prepared, Xu Feng.

277
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:18,419
Let's go to the city together.

278
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,599
Please.

279
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,019
Thanks a lot.

280
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,418
There's no need for that.

281
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:31,019
This way, please.

282
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,119
Where's the magistrate of Luoyang?

283
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:51,420
Why hasn't he welcomed me by now?

284
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,880
He ignored me.

285
00:23:57,699 --> 00:23:59,859
Young Master Wei, the refugees are disturbing order outside the office.

286
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,418
They have enclosed the office.

287
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:03,499
The people inside can't get out, and we can't get in.

288
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,538
Let's change the route.

289
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:05,818
Don't catch their eyes.

290
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,058
Yes.

291
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:08,459
Wait!

292
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:14,019
Your Highness.

293
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,439
Father asked me to inspect Luoyang.

294
00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:19,300
He wanted me to observe what people are suffering.

295
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,280
Now I get to observe and be in charge.

296
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,339
Young Master Wei, go with me to the office.

297
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:30,100
I'll let the people know their

298
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,690
crown prince is the best one.

299
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:36,460
Your Highness.

300
00:24:39,219 --> 00:24:41,879
<i>Food! Food!</i>

301
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:43,058
<i>Out! Get out now!</i>

302
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:44,359
<i>Food!</i>

303
00:24:44,459 --> 00:24:46,218
<i>We want food!</i>

304
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:47,700
<i>Give us food!</i>

305
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,339
<i>Out now! Give us food!</i>

306
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:51,979
<i>Food! We want food!</i>

307
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,280
<i>Get out!</i>

308
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,420
<i>Food! Get out!</i>

309
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,979
<i>Give us food!</i>

310
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,699
<i>Food! Get out!</i>

311
00:24:57,699 --> 00:24:58,880
<i>We want food!</i>

312
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,099
- Everyone listen to me!
<i>- Get out!</i>

313
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,859
I'm the crown prince of this country.

314
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,779
<i>Food! Give us food!</i>

315
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,198
<i>- We want food!</i>
- Stop shouting! I'm the crown prince!

316
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,899
<i>We want food! Food!</i>

317
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,940
<i>We want food!</i>

318
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,518
Crown Prince, are you really the crown prince?

319
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,880
<i>You want us to die of hunger.</i>

320
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,438
Everyone! Come here!

321
00:25:24,438 --> 00:25:25,739
Crown Prince is here!

322
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,580
Everyone! Come here! It's the crown prince!

323
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,619
Protect His Highness!

324
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,178
<i>Crown Prince is here. Come here. It's the crown prince.</i>

325
00:25:30,178 --> 00:25:32,339
<i>Crown Prince is here. Give me food.</i>

326
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:33,298
Wei Shuyu.

327
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,379
Stop them!

328
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,458
Don't let them get close to me.

329
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:36,259
Back off!

330
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,299
Don't hurt anyone. They're all ordinary people without any weapons.

331
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:43,218
<i>We want food! Food! We want food!</i>

332
00:25:43,218 --> 00:25:44,900
<i>We want food!</i>

333
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,698
<i>Crown Prince! Crown Prince!</i>

334
00:25:47,698 --> 00:25:49,919
<i>Give some food to us.</i>

335
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,860
Blood.

336
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,859
Blood. He's bleeding.

337
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,958
They're killing us. It's bleeding. He hit us.

338
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,938
I'm scared.

339
00:25:57,939 --> 00:25:59,058
Protect the prince and retreat.

340
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:02,199
Crown Prince can't be hurt. Retreat.

341
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:04,418
<i>The guards beat us.</i>

342
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:05,178
Back off.

343
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:07,718
<i>He beat me. They're killing us.</i>

344
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,058
<i>Crown Prince killed a man.</i>

345
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:11,759
<i>Back off.</i>

346
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,640
What happened?

347
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,859
Princess, some refugees are creating a disturbance. No need to worry, Princess.

348
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:21,578
Will my brother arrive today?

349
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,540
It should be today.

350
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,439
Open the door.

351
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:28,439
Princess, it's a mess out there, so please don't go out.

352
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:30,580
I know them well.

353
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,338
They come from Yunzhou.

354
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:34,659
I was one of them.

355
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,460
They're just too hungry.

356
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,180
Besides, my brother is coming.

357
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,760
It's okay if they know His Majesty sent Prince here to console them.

358
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,079
- But it's dangerous...
- Besides, you're with me, aren't you?

359
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,399
Princess, Young Master Hao. Crown Prince has arrived.

360
00:26:58,399 --> 00:26:59,979
His Highness is outside the door.

361
00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:01,060
Open the door.

362
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,479
But...

363
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:05,580
- If...
- If the prince gets hurt, nobody can take responsibility.

364
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,639
I'll take care of Her Highness. Open it.

365
00:27:07,639 --> 00:27:09,040
Yes.

366
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,560
<i>They are killing us!</i>

367
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,958
<i>Guards are killing us. People are dying.</i>

368
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,899
Young Master Wei, what should we do?

369
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,698
His Highness left us behind.

370
00:27:23,699 --> 00:27:25,178
We'll die of hunger in Luoyang.

371
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:26,578
Nobody cares about us.

372
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:28,219
<i>- He's right. Nobody cares.</i>
- Everyone, listen.

373
00:27:28,219 --> 00:27:30,460
Please calm down and listen to me.

374
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,820
His Highness will never leave you behind.

375
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:36,359
<i>Is it true?</i>

376
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,839
<i>Really?</i>

377
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,040
You're talking nonsense.

378
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,840
His Highness does not care about us.

379
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,859
<i>He's right. He doesn't care.</i>

380
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:48,858
<i>We want food! He doesn't care!</i>

381
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,760
<i>We want food!</i>

382
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,800
<i>Give food to us.</i>

383
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,499
<i>[Luoyang Office]</i>

384
00:28:13,499 --> 00:28:16,320
The noble who can save you is coming.

385
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,058
Tell us what you want.

386
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:28,040
Why do you make a disturbance outside the office?

387
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,659
Who are you?

388
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,578
His Highness doesn't care about us.

389
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:33,499
How can you keep your word?

390
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,178
<i>Yes. He's right.</i>

391
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,420
<i>His Highness doesn't care about us.</i>

392
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,059
<i>- What can you do? Am I right? Yes.
- Yes.</i>

393
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:39,259
- Please listen to me.
<i>- What can you do?</i>

394
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,259
<i>What can you do?</i>

395
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:42,640
I'm Princess Yongan of Great Tang.

396
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,420
You have my word.

397
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,079
This country will never leave you alone.

398
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,818
Please don't worry.

399
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:52,779
Food, water, clothes, and beds. You'll have them all.

400
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,680
We have to face the difficulties of Luoyang together.

401
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:00,299
<i>Really?</i>

402
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:02,938
<i>We won't die of hunger.</i>

403
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:04,739
<i>Yes.</i>

404
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,239
What are you doing?

405
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:19,879
Your wound will fester if the bleeding doesn't stop.

406
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:23,518
- Don't move.
- I don't need it!

407
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:26,679
Hao Du.

408
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,979
You pretend to be injured and agitate these people.

409
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,820
What's your purpose?

410
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:40,999
Answer me.

411
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,420
Very good. You don't answer me.

412
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,540
Then never answer me.

413
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,300
Hao Du, he did that because of starvation and fear.

414
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,119
Don't hurt him.

415
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,060
Do you see that?

416
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,160
Her Highness sympathizes with these kinds of people.

417
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,520
How can Her Highness leave you alone?

418
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:08,920
<i>Yes. He's right. Yes.</i>

419
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,719
<i>Brother Shuyu.</i>

420
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,680
Yueyan, it's you.

421
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,480
It's great. You're finally here.

422
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,119
I've been looking for you for such a long time.

423
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:54,178
I almost missed no relevant inch in the north lands.

424
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:56,219
I was afraid of losing you.

425
00:30:57,499 --> 00:31:01,640
Sorry, it's all my fault.

426
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,060
I lost you and made you suffer a lot.

427
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,900
Brother Shuyu, it's not your fault.

428
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,299
No one predicts good or bad fortune.

429
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:15,540
See? I'm fine.

430
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:20,020
But you've lost weight.

431
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:24,979
I dare not pile on pounds without finding you.

432
00:31:24,979 --> 00:31:29,799
Yueyan, tell me what happened from You State to Luoyang.

433
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,739
Many things happened during the journey.

434
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,660
If I hadn't experienced it,

435
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,319
I'd never know so much of the world

436
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:44,300
and only be a canary in a cage.

437
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,700
Please rest assured.

438
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,820
I won't let you suffer anymore in the future.

439
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,760
What's wrong?

440
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,960
Princess, please go and see the crown prince.

441
00:32:23,499 --> 00:32:24,660
Your Highness.

442
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,298
His Highness asked me to tell Your Highness that

443
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:30,379
His Highness is scared and suddenly has a fever.

444
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,218
I'm afraid His Highness can't meet refugees

445
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:34,219
in South Hill with Your Highness.

446
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:35,779
He's ill?

447
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,380
Yes.

448
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,119
Your Highness.

449
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:43,420
His Highness was afraid of passing it to Your Highness.

450
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,959
Her Highness visits her younger brother. How dare you block the way?

451
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:48,139
If His Highness's condition is delayed,

452
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,539
you won't survive even with ten lives.

453
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,420
Don't pretend in front of me.

454
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:32,200
Sister.

455
00:33:34,219 --> 00:33:36,439
Father sent you to Luoyang

456
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:39,060
to console the people who are suffering from the drought,

457
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,418
and build your image as a crown prince.

458
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:42,779
You're pretending to be ill here.

459
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,719
How could you do that?

460
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:48,580
Sister, you've seen that.

461
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,920
These people are not poor men but gangsters.

462
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,120
Look at them. With blood all over their faces,

463
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,659
they're making threatening gestures.

464
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,859
They've scared me to death.

465
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,139
Just thinking of them, my head is aching.

466
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:03,260
I'm not going anywhere.

467
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:09,899
Brother, I know that as a child,

468
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:13,239
when you're facing such situations, you'll be scared.

469
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,498
But you need to know that sooner or later,

470
00:34:16,499 --> 00:34:19,120
we have to take on the responsibilities on our own,

471
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,239
especially for you.

472
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:26,338
I know, Sister.

473
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:27,559
I really understand.

474
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,058
But I just arrived here.

475
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:31,619
Can you just give me a break?

476
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:34,300
I know what you're talking about.

477
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,659
Please be assured.

478
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:39,179
I'll grow up and be a man.

479
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:41,939
I'm the son of our father.

480
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,179
I heard you.

481
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:46,519
You need to do what you say.

482
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,000
I've experienced a lot in the past few months.

483
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,978
<i>I've some new understandings.</i>

484
00:34:53,979 --> 00:34:57,338
<i>Since we're taking from people in our land, in return,</i>

485
00:34:57,339 --> 00:35:00,059
we should give them a stable life.

486
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:04,880
Brother, do you know what a crown prince is?

487
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,540
It means you're the future of the country.

488
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,559
And you'll be the leader of our people.

489
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,239
Be a man, brother, like our father.

490
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,920
Win the trust of our people.

491
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,460
And be a wise emperor.

492
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,260
Hao Du.

493
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,398
You found Yueyan first.

494
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:50,899
Thank you.

495
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:55,700
Have you accompanied her all this time?

496
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,980
What do you mean?

497
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,059
Nothing. I just felt regretful.

498
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:03,238
If I hadn't been recalled by His Majesty,

499
00:36:03,238 --> 00:36:07,199
I might have been the one who found Yueyan.

500
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,179
Does that matter?

501
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,180
It matters between you and me.

502
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,759
Is this because of Li Changge?

503
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,939
Protect the crown prince well.

504
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,859
Don't lose His Highness again.

505
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:24,540
Hao Du, Yueyan wouldn't have been left alone in that state

506
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,300
if you didn't insist on hunting Li Changge.

507
00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:29,419
Are you finding yourself some excuses?

508
00:36:29,419 --> 00:36:31,419
I can take responsibility.

509
00:36:31,419 --> 00:36:35,298
I just want you to know those who are obsessed with something

510
00:36:35,299 --> 00:36:37,299
will easily get lost.

511
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:56,879
A'Bi.

512
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,420
Mr. Situ.

513
00:36:59,439 --> 00:37:01,339
What's wrong?

514
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:03,800
What has Changge done to you?

515
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,058
Nothing, really.

516
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:08,979
Ever since she came into the house, she hasn't slept or eaten anything.

517
00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:12,379
I've checked her several times, but she keeps staring at the writing on the wall.

518
00:37:12,379 --> 00:37:14,279
She hasn't moved at all.

519
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:17,700
Is there something wrong with her?

520
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:21,500
Look at her. She's just as stubborn.

521
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,499
I've told her she can't make it, she just doesn't listen.

522
00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:26,239
I'll check her out.

523
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,619
Good to see you, Mr. Situ.

524
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:32,799
Master.

525
00:37:32,799 --> 00:37:35,859
Can I talk to her?

526
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:46,860
<i>[Non-interference]</i>

527
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,820
The night you came,

528
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,400
I was just passing by.

529
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,139
I saw you practicing swordsmanship in the middle of the night.

530
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:14,580
You've stayed in the Silence Room ever since you came to our temple.

531
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,479
Do you have any thoughts?

532
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,220
I've been taught by my teacher since childhood.

533
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,799
I've read books from all classes of authors.

534
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,720
I've never liked the thought of non-interference of Taoism.

535
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,520
To struggle with people, you can find your refuge.

536
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,619
To struggle with people, you can achieve your pursuit.

537
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:38,560
For all these years,

538
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,999
I've held a strong belief in it.

539
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,380
But in these few days,

540
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,400
I started to realize that

541
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,420
I was wrong.

542
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:54,219
If I hadn't struggled,

543
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:59,800
someone like my real brother wouldn't have died for me.

544
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:04,220
If I hadn't struggled,

545
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:09,079
someone who has treated me like his daughter wouldn't have died for me.

546
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,700
If I hadn't struggled,

547
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,850
someone who had given all he had to me wouldn't have been in danger,

548
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:24,500
while his dear family wouldn't have died for me as well.

549
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,720
One senior saved my life

550
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,679
and taught me to find my own Tao.

551
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:36,679
Non-interference.

552
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,579
This is the way.

553
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:43,540
God bless us all.

554
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:48,679
If you really think in this way, you've spent some good time

555
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:51,678
in this Silence Room.

556
00:39:51,678 --> 00:39:53,959
What about now?

557
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:58,679
Dead people are gone forever.

558
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:01,360
I've wasted so much time on this.

559
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,219
It's really precious for us to be enlightened.

560
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,699
There are lots of refugees in Luoyang.

561
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,659
We're busy helping those in need.

562
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,439
If you have time,

563
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:18,039
you can help me and Taoist Sun.

564
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:21,519
Everything in Taoism is about people.

565
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,120
We should appreciate the world we live in.

566
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:29,100
Dwelling in the past will only bring you more trouble.

567
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,220
<i>[Non-interference]</i>

568
00:41:05,779 --> 00:41:07,679
From the way she talks,

569
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:10,298
Master must know that she is not an ordinary person.

570
00:41:10,299 --> 00:41:14,519
Do you want to hear more about her story?

571
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:17,138
What are you talking about?

572
00:41:17,138 --> 00:41:18,419
Things come and go.

573
00:41:18,419 --> 00:41:20,600
People come and go, too.

574
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,780
I've never asked.

575
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,578
But I do miss the old times.

576
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:27,440
When I was of her age,

577
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,799
I also regarded myself as the smartest person in the world.

578
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:39,420
It seems that you and she have some connections.

579
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,119
Tell me about it.

580
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:44,718
In this world, we all come and go.

581
00:41:44,718 --> 00:41:47,099
We share the same fate.

582
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:51,478
Will you come to South Hill with me tomorrow?

583
00:41:51,478 --> 00:41:55,800
I heard that there are more refugees than we have here.

584
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,659
Sure.

585
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:03,440
If we can encounter some rare diseases, that'll be worth trying.

586
00:42:04,259 --> 00:42:05,959
Have some tea.

587
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,859
I'm so glad to see you eat something.

588
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,338
I've been worried about you.

589
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:18,978
I heard that Taoist Sun has tried so hard to save you.

590
00:42:18,979 --> 00:42:21,139
Would you like to get changed now?

591
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:44,659
Isn't it beautiful?

592
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,519
Liuyun Taoist Temple is the most beautiful place in Luoyang.

593
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,438
The one you just talked to is our master, Taoist Jingdan.

594
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:54,699
She has sheltered many refugees suffering from the drought.

595
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,640
She is such a nice person.

596
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,538
She wants to know your plan for the future.

597
00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:02,799
Taoist Sun is going to stay in Luoyang for some days.

598
00:43:02,799 --> 00:43:06,540
Are you going back to your hometown or staying here?

599
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:12,139
My hometown is somewhere I can never go back.

600
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,260
I'll stay.

601
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,779
That'll be great. I've got a mate.

602
00:43:17,779 --> 00:43:21,538
Except for us, Tianjing and Liu'er also live here.

603
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:23,160
We're about the same age.

604
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,659
We can be good friends.

605
00:43:25,659 --> 00:43:28,499
I'm A'Bi from Family Wang. What's your name?

606
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,299
<i>Since Changge is no longer in Great Tang,</i>

607
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
<i>I'd avoid some troubles.</i>

608
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,640
I have no family name.

609
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:43,959
