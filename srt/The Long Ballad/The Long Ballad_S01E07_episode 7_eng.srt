00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,000
♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,960
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,930
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,770
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:24,850
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,820
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,690
♫   Tears and regrets go hand in hand   ♫

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,790
♫  But my heart is still fiery-hot  ♫

9
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,740
♫  To the distance  ♫

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,710
♫  The miserable past is like a dagger  ♫

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,620
♫  Though my wings are broken  ♫

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,940
♫  I will keep flying  ♫

♫  Following the direction of the light  ♫

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,360
♫  I'll forget you  ♫

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:04,460
♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

16
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:07,360
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,310
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,370
♫  The river of life is under my feet  ♫

19
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:17,860
♫  I don't regret my craziness  ♫

20
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,580
   

21
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,760
   

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,139
I'm not here for shelter.

23
00:01:39,139 --> 00:01:41,500
I'm here to help you.

24
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,980
What do you mean?

25
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,700
Now, Li Shimin is in a dilemma.

26
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:53,580
He'll surely scatter the troops to guard for safety.

27
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:57,779
The You State Army can come in two directions and attack when they're not ready.

28
00:01:57,779 --> 00:02:01,529
One goes south to Pu and Jiang, the other goes west to Tongguan.

29
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:03,519
Then the two troops can join forces.

30
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,159
Within a month, we'll win the war.

31
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:09,540
Princess, you mean...

32
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:14,460
Princess is so intelligent.

33
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:18,100
There's no fool in the Li family.

34
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:22,332
Princess, you're from the capital.

35
00:02:22,332 --> 00:02:24,280
How's the situation of Your Majesty

36
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,839
and did Crown Prince have other commands?

37
00:02:25,839 --> 00:02:28,179
I came here for this.

38
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,050
Before Father died, he gave me the imperial edict.

39
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,750
Listen to my order, Prince of Lujiang, Li Yuan.

40
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,479
"Now, Prince Qin Li Shimin wants to rebel,

41
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:45,960
which astonished the capital and will harm the country.

42
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,239
Prince of Lujiang, I command you to lead a troop and kill this rebel

43
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,400
to keep our country and empire safe.

44
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,000
That's all of the order, do as I said."

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,099
I will do as the edict says.

46
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,960
Your edict saved us from the emergency in You State.

47
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,039
We prepared an armament in a hurry,

48
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,280
in case we'll lack strength after we start the war.

49
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,640
With this imperial edict, I believe Crown Prince's troops will help us.

50
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:24,270
 Governor, the envoy from Chang'an is here. 

51
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,320
 He is waiting for you in the lobby. 

52
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,540
Li Shimin's envoy is here so soon.

53
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,379
Uncle, in my point of view, you'd better not meet this envoy.

54
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:37,079
Relax, Princess.

55
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:39,939
Now the plan is settled, and we have this edict,

56
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:42,860
we'll surely live up to Crown Prince's expectation.

57
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:45,819
Since that rebel's envoy is here,

58
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:50,579
we can catch him to show our determination to kill this rebel.

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,940
   

60
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,779
By the order of Crown Prince Jiancheng's edict, catch this rebel.

61
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,470
Wang Junkuo delivers a false edict.

62
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,280
You'll be punished!

63
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,540
Kill him now.

64
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,073
Kill him!

65
00:04:37,073 --> 00:04:38,573
Wait!

66
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,440
Wei Shuyu.

67
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,192
Changge.

68
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:11,640
Changge, why are you here?

69
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,499
How dare you ask me this?

70
00:05:13,499 --> 00:05:14,380
Let me explain.

71
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,680
You have nothing to explain!

72
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:23,110
If you surrender now, I can spare your life.

73
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,540
Changge, are you crazy?

74
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,240
Do you know what you are doing now?

75
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,540
You are helping them plot a rebellion.

76
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:33,260
That's because I'm not lucky as you are.

77
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:38,039
You can find another master and work for him.

78
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:42,272
Now, I'm the prey and they're the predator.

79
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:45,139
Do you want me to witness You State to be another East Palace?

80
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:46,839
Changge, listen to me.

81
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:48,220
The crown prince is kind.

82
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,799
He asked me to be the envoy to You State.

83
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:51,540
His purpose is to set Prince of Lujiang at ease.

84
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,100
There's a misunderstanding between us.

85
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,750
Misunderstanding?

86
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,619
Enough nonsense.

87
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:00,432
Arrest him!

88
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:36,929
Put the sword down.

89
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,890
I'll repeat it again.

90
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,940
Put the sword down then I won't kill you.

91
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,440
Princess,

92
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,839
today, we need a life to sacrifice here.

93
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,933
General Wang, do you know Prince's advisor, Wei Zheng?

94
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:00,700
Wei Zheng is the backbone of Eastern Palace.

95
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,860
He is the son of Wei Zheng.

96
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,679
If we kill him, the ministers in East Palace will feel disappointed.

97
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:10,359
I've heard Advisor Wei is loyal to Crown Prince.

98
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:13,359
I didn't imagine he had such a cowardly son.

99
00:07:13,359 --> 00:07:14,979
You rebel!

100
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:16,459
How dare you talk about my father?

101
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:18,192
You...

102
00:07:18,192 --> 00:07:20,939
 You shouldn't trust Prince Qin. 

103
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,919
Everyone can see my loyalty to Great Tang.

104
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,620
It's Prince Jiancheng's last wish.

105
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,990
We'll kill the rebel as the edict says.

106
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:34,780
Changge.

107
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,720
Guards! Take him to the dungeon and keep an eye on him.

108
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,399
Changge, you!

109
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:41,013
Go!

110
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:44,359
Go. Hurry up!

111
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,819
Yongning, although we arrested the envoy,

112
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,840
people in Chang'an will doubt if he stays here for too long.

113
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,119
Besides, if anyone knows you're in You State,

114
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:58,800
it will be bad for our future plan.

115
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,800
In my point of view, what about staying in my manor and rehabilitating?

116
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,060
It's okay, Uncle. I have somewhere else to live.

117
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,179
I'll come for you tomorrow morning.

118
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:11,220
You just arrived and are not familiar with this place.

119
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,620
Besides, if the spies in You State find you, it'll be troublesome.

120
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,660
How about this?

121
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,259
I can ask a force to protect you secretly, okay?

122
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:23,880
Uncle, since I can come here from Chang'an alone,

123
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,980
I can take care of myself.

124
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,512
Goodbye.

125
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,373
Junkuo.

126
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,860
 I saw the envoy from Chang'an entering the manor. 

127
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,399
 Why hasn't Shisi been caught? 

128
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:21,780
 Her injury is so weird. 

129
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,500
 Come take a look! 

130
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:03,412
Let's go.

131
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:32,652
That way.

132
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,990
 Why are the people from Governor Manor following Shisi? 

133
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,580
 It's becoming more and more interesting. 

134
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,612
 Shisi, who are you? 

135
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,310
   

136
00:10:58,699 --> 00:11:00,232
Governor.

137
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,000
   

138
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,953
Governor, is there anything wrong with this edict?

139
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,090
   

140
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:31,620
   

141
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,900
Go out of town now.

142
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,180
Find the thatched cottage and tie a white towel.

143
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,600
Remember, don't let anyone see you.

144
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,019
Wait for the distinguished guest from the North to contact you.

145
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:54,652
 Yes, Sir! 

146
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:04,719
Master, you're back.

147
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:11,960
Master, why're you hurt?

148
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:23,692
Master.

149
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:30,360
Master, why're you hurt so badly?

150
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,953
It's okay.

151
00:12:31,953 --> 00:12:35,713
A'Dou, someone was following me.

152
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,459
Master, who was following you?

153
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,292
I don't know.

154
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,150
I think they might be Uncle's people.

155
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,860
But I can't do things with my instinct now.

156
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,940
Because we can only depend on uncle now.

157
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,080
Master, I'm also with you.

158
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,240
 She knows art of war 

159
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,300
 and is good at strategy. 

160
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,840
 If I don't write my name nor appear, then what? 

161
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,319
 There're goods and carriages in the trade caravan. They won't check carefully. 

162
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:39,220
 I only ask for a place to hide. 

163
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,500
 She's not afraid of death. 

164
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,200
 There's such an extraordinary girl in this world. 

165
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,460
 Wei Shuyu. 

166
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,340
 You are really a good friend of the princess. 

167
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:26,259
 You knew she would pass here. 

168
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,733
Who is it?

169
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,573
What's wrong?

170
00:14:52,573 --> 00:14:53,873
You cried?

171
00:14:53,873 --> 00:14:55,513
No.

172
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,960
Men can cry as well. Don't be embarrassed.

173
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,419
I seldom cried when I was young.

174
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:07,279
I prefer to bleed.

175
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:09,059
Stop trying to be strong.

176
00:15:09,059 --> 00:15:11,600
People will feel sad.

177
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,430
If there's nothing wrong, I shall go back to sleep.

178
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,580
I'm in a bad mood.

179
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,519
Can you go for a walk with me?

180
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,292
Now?

181
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,100
It has already passed curfew now.

182
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,519
Strange.

183
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,159
You're afraid of a curfew.

184
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:37,499
Where are we going?

185
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:40,359
What? Afraid I'll sell you?

186
00:15:40,359 --> 00:15:42,790
I'm afraid you don't have that ability.

187
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:10,900
Why did you bring me here?

188
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,979
This place is far from troubles,

189
00:16:13,979 --> 00:16:15,869
and is close to the moon.

190
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:23,819
Instead of being close to the moon, I'm close to you, annoying guy.

191
00:16:23,819 --> 00:16:25,552
Isn't it good?

192
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:29,119
It's getting colder.

193
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:37,059
What? You want me to give you my coat?

194
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,690
Are you feeling better?

195
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,933
Much better.

196
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:47,900
So what happened?

197
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:52,540
Let me think. What can make a man like you be so sad?

198
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,699
I guess you failed in today's marriage proposal.

199
00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:57,740
And your wife ran away with someone else.

200
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,939
Nonsense.

201
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,579
I just met an old friend.

202
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:09,713
Well, we're not friends anymore.

203
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,593
Friend?

204
00:17:12,593 --> 00:17:13,979
What kind of friend?

205
00:17:13,979 --> 00:17:16,679
Why aren't you friends anymore?

206
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,980
We grew up together.

207
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,220
We studied together.

208
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,970
I thought our friendship would be like this forever.

209
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:27,960
But later...

210
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:32,040
Maybe, later, you'll forgive each other.

211
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,080
Impossible.

212
00:17:35,639 --> 00:17:40,069
Maybe, in the future, I won't have a friend like him anymore.

213
00:17:40,069 --> 00:17:42,700
It's natural.

214
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,640
Natural?

215
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,840
Someone told me,

216
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,979
some people are soft like water and they tolerate everything.

217
00:17:52,979 --> 00:17:56,760
But some people are like fire.

218
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,479
They will blaze,

219
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:02,000
and people who get close to them will get burned.

220
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,650
If you insist on staying with him,

221
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,719
you'll become ash.

222
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,819
Who told you this?

223
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:10,739
Your friend?

224
00:18:10,739 --> 00:18:12,613
It's my...

225
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,440
It's my foster father.

226
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,580
After he told me this,

227
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,770
I broke up with my best friend,

228
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:26,739
and we became enemies forever.

229
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:30,220
Maybe I'm like the blazing fire.

230
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:35,439
Well, will we be friends?

231
00:18:35,439 --> 00:18:37,639
Aren't we friends now?

232
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,993
A'Zhun, thank you.

233
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:50,629
You don't need to thank me.

234
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,800
You brought me here at night and enlightened me in a roundabout way.

235
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,099
I should thank you.

236
00:18:57,099 --> 00:18:58,813
Shisi,

237
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:01,809
you can't stay here for long.

238
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,359
Leave here soon.

239
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,460
Why do you say so?

240
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,400
What rumors did you hear?

241
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,640
Something is happening in the You State Army.

242
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,840
And Chang'an is also in turmoil.

243
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,159
This is a key position.

244
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:18,060
I'm afraid this place will be involved soon.

245
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,793
A'Zhun.

246
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:23,820
Do you think I can't protect myself?

247
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,859
- I... 
 - Thank you for caring for me.

248
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:30,620
Since you know You State is in a state of emergency,

249
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,680
after you settled your business, just leave here soon.

250
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:37,772
Okay.

251
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:41,819
Just go back. It's almost dawn.

252
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:23,139
I miss my father.

253
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:26,920
When can we go back to Chang'an?

254
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:36,159
Have some rest, Princess.

255
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,040
I shall leave.

256
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,573
Don't go.

257
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,820
I don't want to rest.

258
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,680
You can just stay here.

259
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:58,259
Why don't you say something?

260
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:01,500
You asked me to stay here, I'll just stay here.

261
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,659
It's funny to see you talk seriously.

262
00:21:11,659 --> 00:21:12,619
It's getting late.

263
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:16,219
It's not proper for a man and woman to stay in the same room together.

264
00:21:16,219 --> 00:21:18,780
- I shall leave. 
 - Don't go!

265
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:22,300
You didn't obey my order again?

266
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:50,832
See? This is the rabbit I embroidered.

267
00:21:50,832 --> 00:21:54,580
The rabbits that others embroidered have red eyes.

268
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,520
But my rabbit has green eyes.

269
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,980
Because there's a grassland in its eyes.

270
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,580
That's freedom.

271
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,999
And I want freedom.

272
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:15,640
Why are you so impolite?

273
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,580
Have you always been cold to others?

274
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,219
You're so cold to Minister Du as well?

275
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,300
I never see you smile.

276
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,460
Can you smile?

277
00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:32,300
Hao Du, I'm talking to you.

278
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,599
Are you deaf?

279
00:22:42,139 --> 00:22:44,599
I'm so pathetic.

280
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:47,019
Now we can't find Changge.

281
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:50,540
I was asked to make peace with another regime by marriage.

282
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:54,639
Now I was taken to this strange place by you.

283
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:57,780
No one can talk with me.

284
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:01,060
I've never slept alone.

285
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,580
I miss my father.

286
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,900
I want to go home.

287
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:14,699
What're you doing?

288
00:23:14,699 --> 00:23:16,233
You...

289
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,019
Put me down.

290
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:21,219
Put me down!

291
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,140
Hao Du!

292
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,480
Have some rest, Princess. I'll sit here and not leave.

293
00:24:20,199 --> 00:24:22,699
Shisi, rest early.

294
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:24,313
You, too.

295
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,113
General.

296
00:24:33,113 --> 00:24:34,610
Why are you here?

297
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,060
I've been waiting for you the whole night.

298
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,060
You didn't come back, so I went out to check.

299
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,199
What?

300
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:43,049
Did you have a date with that East Palace boy?

301
00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:47,272
Enough joking.

302
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,200
Wang Junkuo sent a surrender letter to us.

303
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,704
Go back. I have something to do.

304
00:24:55,704 --> 00:24:58,839
Well, that guy went back to his room, you...

305
00:25:03,099 --> 00:25:04,880
For how long do you want to hide?

306
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,313
Come out.

307
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,080
When did you arrive?

308
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,080
Today.

309
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,813
He's here?

310
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,373
Take me there.

311
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,960
   

312
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:34,020
 Sir, you haven't been here for a long time. 

313
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,700
 Did you miss me? 

314
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,920
 Let's have a drink in the room. 

315
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,119
 Let me kiss you. 

316
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,733
Young Khan.

317
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:50,372
He's here.

318
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:00,940
Sir, is it comfortable?

319
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,492
Why're you here?

320
00:26:02,492 --> 00:26:04,379
What do you think I'm here for?

321
00:26:04,379 --> 00:26:06,139
Do you want to have fun?

322
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,620
You never had a woman by your side before.

323
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,879
If you don't like women, it's boring to just watch me here.

324
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:24,660
I have hated your domineering attitude since I was little.

325
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,073
Get out!

326
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:06,520
Why are you here?

327
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,880
We're here for the same reason.

328
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,909
How do you know where I live?

329
00:27:10,909 --> 00:27:12,559
It's your old habit.

330
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,780
You won't live too far or too close to the Governor Manor.

331
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:18,880
You won't live in a luxurious place.

332
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,999
There are few places left.

333
00:27:23,319 --> 00:27:25,019
Finally, you're smart.

334
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:27,319
I can also ask you to leave.

335
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,130
   

336
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:36,139
Father wants me to go to Shuo State.

337
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,100
Father will start the war?

338
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,170
Just be a servant.

339
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,670
Don't ask things you don't need to know.

340
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,800
Remember, you go, leave the horses.

341
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,700
You really know much.

342
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,459
We grew up together.

343
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,000
You can't hide this from me.

344
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,019
The horses are mine.

345
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:55,590
But you agreed on the conditions.

346
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,819
Then I should finish it.

347
00:27:57,819 --> 00:28:00,039
You're not qualified to do so now.

348
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:10,519
Eagle Division, General Sun will obey Great Khan's order.

349
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:18,079
You State's surrender letter.

350
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:19,180
It's for Father.

351
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,130
You didn't open it?

352
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,180
Begging for shelter. There's nothing to read.

353
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:25,180
I want to see you beg.

354
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,099
For all these years,

355
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:29,600
you're still the most ugly dog.

356
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,800
You like to grab bones from the mouths of others.

357
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,079
You don't understand.

358
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:35,279
It's interesting to do so.

359
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,259
It's more interesting to grab yours.

360
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:56,319
 Wang Junkuo is becoming more and more interesting. 

361
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:00,419
 I want to see if he really has that ability. 

362
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:15,880
Master.

363
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,340
You've been wandering around here all morning.

364
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,940
You can't totally trust your uncle?

365
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,499
I don't know.

366
00:29:24,499 --> 00:29:27,119
After I was betrayed by the person I trusted most,

367
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:29,419
I became vigilant to people.

368
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:31,959
But now we have no other solution.

369
00:29:31,959 --> 00:29:35,719
Except staying in Governor Manor and depending on Uncle,

370
00:29:35,719 --> 00:29:37,719
we have no way out.

371
00:29:37,719 --> 00:29:40,240
But we can't let anyone see this.

372
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,520
Otherwise, If there's something wrong with Uncle's plan,

373
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,070
the consequences would be serious.

374
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:49,400
Master, let's not live in Governor Manor for now.

375
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,950
I think this woodshed is good.

376
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:53,700
Even if we don't live in Governor Manor,

377
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,820
Uncle will know where we live sooner or later.

378
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,700
We can't let anyone find this.

379
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,132
Master,

380
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,000
how about giving this to me?

381
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,400
We can live separately.

382
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:09,640
After you totally trust your uncle, I can give this back to you.

383
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:14,629
Master, you don't trust me?

384
00:30:14,629 --> 00:30:16,280
Of course, I trust you.

385
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,700
But I'm a little suspicious now.

386
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:24,239
I think it's right to be vigilant now.

387
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,939
We can't put all eggs in one basket.

388
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,339
You're smart now.

389
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,332
Okay.

390
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,469
You can keep this for me.

391
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,280
Remember, don't let anyone find it.

392
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,760
Keep it always with you.

393
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:41,839
No problem, Master.

394
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:43,599
This thing will be with me from now on.

395
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:45,899
I'd rather bleed than lose this.

396
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,400
I'll go to Governor Manor.

397
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,980
You can stay here.

398
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,600
Sir, these are the customer's horses.

399
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,739
If you take them away, how will I explain?

400
00:30:53,739 --> 00:30:55,572
Do you want to die?

401
00:30:55,572 --> 00:30:57,839
 Sir, these are the customers' horses. 

402
00:30:57,839 --> 00:30:59,820
 Sir, you can't take them away. 

403
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,300
If you do so, how could I explain?

404
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,333
Sir! Sir.

405
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,719
What's wrong? What happened?

406
00:31:07,719 --> 00:31:08,840
I don't know.

407
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,839
These are the customers' horses.

408
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:12,560
He went out in the morning.

409
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,060
If he comes back and finds it out, he...

410
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,353
Wait!

411
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,680
These are not your horses.

412
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,319
Now they're ours.

413
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:28,700
Why should I trust that?

414
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,599
We don't need you to trust it.

415
00:31:30,599 --> 00:31:32,532
These are our carriages and horses.

416
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,132
Or...

417
00:31:34,132 --> 00:31:37,300
Or... why would he run away secretly?

418
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,379
Don't waste our time.

419
00:31:38,379 --> 00:31:39,912
Go away!

420
00:31:44,499 --> 00:31:46,599
 What happened to A'Zhun? 

421
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,839
 Forget it. 

422
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,839
 I'll find Uncle first. 

423
00:32:01,959 --> 00:32:05,040
Wait for my order at any time.

424
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,959
I've arranged things over there.

425
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:12,119
Remember, when I get the goods, I'll launch a signal shell.

426
00:32:12,119 --> 00:32:13,880
Then you can act at once.

427
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,413
 Yes, Sir. 

428
00:32:15,413 --> 00:32:16,733
Go.

429
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,680
- General. 
 - Say it.

430
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,299
She'er will trade horses with Wang Junkuo at the thatched cottage today.

431
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:54,220
Besides, it is said She'er forced Wang Junkuo

432
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,319
to give the seal of the crown prince in two days.

433
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:58,039
Seal of the crown prince?

434
00:32:58,039 --> 00:32:59,680
What happened?

435
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,000
 You State's surrender letter. 

436
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,533
 It's for Father. 

437
00:33:07,533 --> 00:33:09,660
 You didn't open it? 

438
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,499
Ya Luo, did you read Wang Junkuo's surrender letter?

439
00:33:12,499 --> 00:33:14,640
How dare I read it?

440
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,713
I was careless.

441
00:33:16,713 --> 00:33:18,969
I underestimated Wang Junkuo.

442
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:22,689
Seal of the crown prince?

443
00:33:26,496 --> 00:33:28,964
   

444
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:48,340
 No wonder she ran away. 

445
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,060
General, what are you doing?

446
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,880
Go back. I need to figure out something.

447
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,729
But You State's matters have nothing to do with us.

448
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:58,239
But there's someone related to me.

449
00:33:58,239 --> 00:34:00,580
You can leave first, don't wait for me. Go!

450
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,239
General Wang is so punctual.

451
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,790
Why are you here, Young Khan?

452
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,020
Ashile Tribe is interesting.

453
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,900
I meet different people each time.

454
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,339
People don't do business like this, right?

455
00:34:32,339 --> 00:34:35,680
You only need to know, I'm the man in charge now.

456
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,160
After all, I'm the Young Khan in Ashile Tribe.

457
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,360
And I'm the person Khan Yan Li trusts most.

458
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,360
Cooperating with me is the best choice for you.

459
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,679
I don't care what happened in Ashile Tribe

460
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:52,180
and who will trade with me, I only care about the goods.

461
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,219
You bring nothing with you,

462
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:57,560
how can I trust you?

463
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,370
I'm taking care of the precious goods.

464
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:03,159
If I bring those with me, some people will try to steal them.

465
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:06,199
General Wang, we can check the goods first.

466
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:10,120
After we have a deal, I'll give you the horses.

467
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,620
 This is the person at the inn 

468
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,960
 who stole A'Zhun's horse. 

469
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,059
 Why is A'Zhun related to Ashile Tribe? 

470
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:40,599
It's the horse I want.

471
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,420
 He's here to trade with Wang Junkuo. 

472
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,819
Can you give the goods today?

473
00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:51,259
Why are you in such a hurry?

474
00:35:51,259 --> 00:35:54,700
With these horses, I'll become even stronger.

475
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,159
And I'll kill Li Yuan today.

476
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,739
Then I'll control You State.

477
00:36:01,739 --> 00:36:03,193
General Wang,

478
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:05,539
I can give you the goods you want at any time.

479
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:07,779
But you didn't give me the thing I want.

480
00:36:07,779 --> 00:36:09,439
You should give me a pledge.

481
00:36:09,439 --> 00:36:12,460
I'll give you the thing you want soon.

482
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,539
Say it.

483
00:36:13,539 --> 00:36:17,220
I want the key of You State Manor, in case you betray me.

484
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:21,319
And your token, in case there's any trouble.

485
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:24,412
Okay.

486
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,919
Then Khan Yan Li and I will be waiting for your good news.

487
00:36:34,499 --> 00:36:37,399
 Wang Junkuo wants to sell You State to Khan Yan Li. 

488
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:38,853
 Impossible. 

489
00:36:38,853 --> 00:36:40,839
 I'll save my uncle. 

490
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,860
Yongning, why are you here in a hurry?

491
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,200
Uncle,

492
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:23,000
Wang Junkuo has betrayed you and is cooperating with Ashile Tribe now.

493
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,060
And he wants to control You State and kill you.

494
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,979
Yongning, you don't know him.

495
00:37:28,979 --> 00:37:30,540
The reason why Junkuo was promoted to a general

496
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,840
is because of his merits on fighting against Ashile Tribe.

497
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,200
You said he wants to kill me? That's more ridiculous.

498
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,299
We've been friends for a long time and we're relatives.

499
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:38,719
You think too much.

500
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:41,060
Impossible. I heard this in person.

501
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,800
Uncle, leave with me now.

502
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,080
If he comes here in advance, we can't leave here.

503
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,039
- Let's go. 
 - You!

504
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,170
You can't escape now.

505
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:02,579
Princess Yongning, I underestimated you.

506
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,059
Wang Junkuo, this place is the Governor Manor.

507
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:07,399
How dare you do it here!

508
00:38:07,399 --> 00:38:09,349
Back off, all of you!

509
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:18,459
How can you command You State's troop?

510
00:38:18,459 --> 00:38:21,460
You can be companions on the way to hell.

511
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,893
Kill them!

512
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,073
Go.

513
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,133
Chase them!

514
00:39:27,479 --> 00:39:30,159
Yongning, what can we do now?

515
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,860
Wang Junkuo has occupied Governor Manor.

516
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,140
I... I have no place to stay.

517
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,159
It's okay, Uncle.

518
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:37,760
As long as we are not caught, we can still think of a solution.

519
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,539
What about going to my place?

520
00:39:40,539 --> 00:39:42,699
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

521
00:39:46,372 --> 00:39:48,912
   

522
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,799
Yongning, what's this place?

523
00:39:58,799 --> 00:40:00,719
It's where I'm staying.

524
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:01,919
Where's he?

525
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:03,452
He?

526
00:40:03,452 --> 00:40:05,612
Who is it?

527
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:09,739
Did you give something to your friend?

528
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,450
I didn't say I was looking for things, Uncle.

529
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:26,520
Yongning,

530
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,170
since we're escaping,

531
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,000
we need to take something precious.

532
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,840
Think about where your friend is now.

533
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,253
 A'Dou, 

534
00:40:39,253 --> 00:40:40,679
 don't come back now. 

535
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,919
Yongning, we don't have time now.

536
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:45,959
If Wang Junkuo gets here, we'll be in trouble.

537
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,220
We went out from the back door in the alley.

538
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,799
Wang Junkuo couldn't have followed us.

539
00:40:54,799 --> 00:40:56,652
Or to say,

540
00:40:56,652 --> 00:40:59,040
you arranged this before?

541
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:06,479
It feels sick to eat too much.

542
00:41:06,479 --> 00:41:08,600
My legs are numb.

543
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:12,072
Master is back.

544
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,750
Your master is trapped. I'm here to help you.

545
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,733
Yongning.

546
00:41:27,733 --> 00:41:30,250
If I didn't use this battered-body trick,

547
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,959
how could you save me?

548
00:41:31,959 --> 00:41:36,719
To be honest, I'm moved by what you've done recently.

549
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:37,840
Why?

550
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,720
Young Khan asked me to give him the seal of the crown prince in two days.

551
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,700
If the situation were not urgent, I wouldn't do so.

552
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:49,239
 Those tribe people want the seal of the crown prince. 

553
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:50,959
 And they want us to give it to them in two days. 

554
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:53,759
 It seems they want to use it to start a war. 

555
00:41:53,759 --> 00:41:55,312
 But, Governor, 

556
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:58,259
 I think Yongning is troublesome as well. 

557
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:03,639
 It seems we need to perform a play. 

558
00:42:03,639 --> 00:42:05,450
 Please tell me how. 

559
00:42:09,299 --> 00:42:11,900
 When I get the goods, I'll launch a signal shell. 

560
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,850
 Then you can act at once. 

561
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:15,373
 Yes, Sir. 

562
00:42:16,399 --> 00:42:20,240
 With these horses, I'll become even stronger... 

563
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,820
 and I'll kill Li Yuan today. 

564
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,980
 Then I'll control You State. 

565
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,039
Yongning, If you don't believe me,

566
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:36,639
how could I know where the seal of the crown prince is?

567
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,579
How do you know I have that?

568
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:42,099
I tested the imperial edict.

569
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:44,800
High-class ink is used in Chang'an.

570
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,100
But the inferior ink you used melted after I poured water on it.

571
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:57,690


572
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,710
♫  The heart gradually responds,  ♫

573
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,990
♫  gradually revives,  ♫

574
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:08,410
♫  gradually swims towards you  ♫

575
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:12,660
♫  Before bidding farewell,  ♫

576
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:15,890
♫  we expect an encounter  ♫

577
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:21,370
♫  As your silhouette weaves  ♫

578
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:26,600
♫  and locks in my nostalgic dream  ♫

579
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,300
♫  Before the daybreak,  ♫

580
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,690
♫  through the obsession of love,  ♫

581
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:35,520
♫  the yearning flowing through thoughts  ♫

582
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,990
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:44,790
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

584
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:48,230
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

585
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:54,950
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

586
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:57,240
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

587
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,520
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

588
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,090
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

589
00:44:04,090 --> 00:44:06,950
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

590
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:08,790
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

591
00:44:08,790 --> 00:44:15,560
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

592
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:23,170
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

593
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:28,900

00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:38,820
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

603
