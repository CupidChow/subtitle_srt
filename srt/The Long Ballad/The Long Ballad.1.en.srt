Follow us back to Chang'an and confess your sins.

Chang'an is indeed a lively city.

It's so much more fun here than our grasslands.

How dare you?

00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:44,680
I'm the guard there.

00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,200
Prin...

44
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:53,979
Young Master, I... I didn't know any better.

45
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,100
Please, Young Master, have mercy on me.

46
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,500
Get lost.

47
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes.

48
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,100

Are you okay?

50
00:06:13,859 --> 00:06:15,199
You've got some nerve.

51
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,078
I can't believe you'd confront the crown prince's men.

52
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:18,838
But given that he stirred up trouble first,

53
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:20,620
I'll let you go.

54
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,660
Next time, you won't be so lucky.

55

If it wasn't for that boy,

I'd definitely kick their ass hard.

Yes, I did sneak out.

76
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:21,778
But, Mother, don't worry. I didn't cause any trouble.

77
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,620
Changge, there's something I want to tell you.

78
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,780
What is it, Mother?

79
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,039
Why are you so serious?

80
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,139
Changge, you're always running wild

81
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:41,520
and I've never been strict with you.

82
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,359
But this time, you must promise me

83
00:08:44,359 --> 00:08:46,238
that you'll stay right in the manor tomorrow.

84
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:48,118
Don't come out, no matter who sends for you.

85
00:08:48,119 --> 00:08:49,880
Why?

86
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,479
I heard that the Ashile Tribe sent out envoys

87
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,379
without being invited.

88
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:56,279
They've arrived in Chang'an.

89
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,220
They came from the grasslands?

90
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,879
Why are they coming to Chang'an?

91
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,359
In name, they're just envoys.

92
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:02,839
But they requested for a Cuju game
<i>(T/N: Cuju is an ancient Chinese football, soccer)</i>

93
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:04,560
the instant they arrived.

94
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,380
Everybody knows it's just an excuse.

95
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,180
A Cuju game?

96
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,920
It'll be so much fun.

97
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,699
Changge, when your emperor grandpa just started the war,

98
00:09:14,699 --> 00:09:17,238
he made a marriage contract with the Ashile Tribe.

99
00:09:17,239 --> 00:09:19,279
It was a stopgap back then.

100
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,199
But now, Wu City is at war.

101
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,358
And there are only a few girls of the right age in the palace.

102
00:09:24,358 --> 00:09:28,519
I'm worried that they'll bring it up this time.

103
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:31,558
Mother, that was a long time ago.

104
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,118
I doubt they still remember that.

105
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:35,359
You're worrying too much.

106
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:38,719
Changge, you're still young.

107
00:09:38,719 --> 00:09:42,240
Some things are better left unsaid.

108
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,520
I want nothing but your safety and happiness.

109
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:51,340
That you'll live carefreely in Chang'an, warm and fed.

110
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,178
Lady Jin, you were looking for His Highness.

111
00:09:58,178 --> 00:10:00,560
He's back now.

112
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,699
Mother, you're going to see my father?

113
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:10,279
He just came back.

114
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,499
I suppose he has no time for me.

115
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:13,819
I'll go later.

116
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,939
Changge, go back and stay in your room.

117
00:10:18,939 --> 00:10:22,019
Don't upset your father again.

118
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:31,059
San Niang, doesn't she always hate to see my father?

119
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:33,019
Why would she want to see him now?

120
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:42,239
It appears that Second Brother is raging a war against me.

121
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:46,059
Eldest Brother, that's the last straw. We need to handle it immediately.

122
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:49,100
Let's return to my study to discuss this further.

123
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,018
- Chang He.
- Yes.

124
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:55,740
Send someone to keep an eye on Hongyi Palace. If any movement happens around Prince Qin,
<i>[Li Jiancheng]</i>

125
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,439
report it immediately.

A'Jin.

130
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,140
Why are you here?

131
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,199
I thought you hated this place.

132
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,579
Your Highness,

133
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:07,060
I heard that Ashile Tribe has sent out envoys

134
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,840
to Chang'an without invitation.

135
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,300
If tomorrow they bring up that marriage contract...

136
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,420
It was Emperor Grandpa's decision.

137
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,580
It's not up to me.

138
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:21,099
And it's not for you to worry about what happens in the imperial court.

139
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:22,880
Yes.

140
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,259
This is the dessert I made for you, Your Highness.

141
00:12:35,359 --> 00:12:38,798
Is there anything else you want to say?

142
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,600
I... Nothing.

143
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:48,390
All right. If so,

144
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:51,960
maybe you should keep away from this place.

145
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,640
Yes.

What will you do when I'm not by your side in the future?

Don't you want to see him?

Why would I want to see him?

157
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:18,660
Since he saved you from drowning years ago,

It's so ugly. What is this?

166
00:15:42,979 --> 00:15:46,118
I even pierced my hand while making this. You still saying it's ugly.

167
00:15:46,119 --> 00:15:47,860
- Forget about it.
- It's a bit ugly.

168
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,830
But I like it.

169
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,059
Let me see. Where did you pierce your hand?

170
00:15:52,059 --> 00:15:54,079
I'm fine now.

171
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,378
Let's hurry before the game ends.

172
00:15:56,378 --> 00:15:58,460
I got something for you, too.

173
00:16:00,479 --> 00:16:03,560
This is the amulet I got from the temple.

174
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,979
One is for you, the other one...

175
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:10,839
Another one... is for Older Brother Shuyu.

176
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:15,538
You got this yourself. You need to give it to him yourself.

177
00:16:15,538 --> 00:16:17,819
Come on, wear this.

178
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:19,118
What for?

179
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:22,919
So that no one can recognize you. I need to protect you.

180
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,519
What about you?

181
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:27,840
Come on, I fear no one. Let's go.

182
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:33,020
Please, I'm begging you. Please.

183
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,659
Please, don't kill me.

184
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:38,399
I didn't sell Prince Qin out. I didn't leak the information.

185
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,540
Please! Please, let me go!

186
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,178
Please don't kill me.

187
00:16:45,178 --> 00:16:47,459
Please!

188
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:50,358
Please don't kill me. I didn't sell Prince Qin out!

189
00:16:50,359 --> 00:16:52,358
It wasn't me!

190
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:54,180
Please don't kill me!

191
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,578
Don't kill me! Please!

192
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:23,079
Let's go.

193
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:35,679
Yueyan,

194
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,198
Hao Du is definitely not a nice guy.

195
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:39,838
Stay away from him. Don't get close to him.

196
00:17:39,838 --> 00:17:42,020
Older Brother Shuyu once told me that

197
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,900
he's a cold-blooded person.

198
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:48,439
Forget about it.

199
00:17:48,439 --> 00:17:51,000
Let's go to cheer for Shuyu now.

200
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:53,279
Let's go.

201
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,680
Come on.

202
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,579
What a large venue, right?

203
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:55,419
Thank you.

204
00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:58,999
Go!

205
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,919
My amulet! My amulet is gone!

206
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,580
I must've lost it on the way here.

207
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,200
<i>Come on. Get it!</i>

208
00:19:15,579 --> 00:19:17,979
Give this one to him.

209
00:19:17,979 --> 00:19:19,760
No. This one is for you.

210
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,270
We see each other every day.

211
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,919
Next time you go to the temple, get a hundred amulet and I'll accept it.

212
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,159
Take it.

213
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:28,818
But, after today, you don't know when you will see him next.

214
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:50,759
Look.

215
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,659
16 points for the Ashile Tribe.

216
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:15,459
<i>Nice!</i>

217
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,258
Changge, it seems that we're losing.

218
00:20:23,258 --> 00:20:25,179
We mustn't lose this game.

219
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:29,760
If we lose, it'll affect the morale of our forces.

220
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:18,019
Great Tang Team scores 14 points.

221
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:21,779
Team Ashile Tribe scores 16 points.

222
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,020
Yaluo!

223
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,780
Hang on, hang on there.

224
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,520
Changge!

225
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:42,539
Hold on.

226
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,439
Your Highness, don't you underestimate this dagger.

227
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:09,599
It can cut clear through copper, iron,

228
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,399
gold, and jade.

229
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,800
It can kill people without a sound.

230
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,160
Your Highness, do you want to try it out yourself?

231
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,180
You're so humorous.

232
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:28,599
To me, cuju is just like war.

233
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:32,200
What matters is one's courage, strength,

234
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,099
and weapons.

235
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,640
I think this Great Tang player is an arrow at the end of its flight.
<i>(T/N: Idiom for at the end of the rope)</i>

236
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:41,920
The result of the game is determined.

237
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,820
There's nothing to see.

238
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,958
<i>[Li Shimin]</i>

239
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:48,580
The outcome of the game is still to be determined.
<i>[Li Shimin]</i>

240
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:52,319
And you're talking so wildly in front of everyone.

241
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,179
Aren't you afraid that you'll be proven wrong later?

242
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,139
You!

243
00:23:00,479 --> 00:23:04,078
He's always so arrogant and willful.

244
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:05,899
He shouldn't have said that.

245
00:23:05,899 --> 00:23:09,579
Please don't take it personally.

246
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:11,478
Since the dagger is so sharp,

247
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:13,379
why don't we make it a bonus

248
00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:16,419
and award it to the best warrior?

249
00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:19,238
I've heard a lot about Prince Qin's lofty goals and open mind.

250
00:23:19,239 --> 00:23:20,659
Now that I finally see him,

251
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:23,140
I suppose he's just merely clever and eloquent.

252
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,360
You're the sensible one, Your Highness.

253
00:23:34,439 --> 00:23:38,119
Both His Majesty and Your Highness want to foster cordial relations between our two nations.

254
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:42,320
Back at that time, His Majesty made a marriage contract with the Ashile Tribe.

255
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,399
How about we take this opportunity

256
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,039
and settle it down?

257
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,600
What?

258
00:23:50,719 --> 00:23:53,820
Whose daughter is that girl?

259
00:24:14,479 --> 00:24:17,118
Young Master, you're seriously wounded.

260
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,799
You need time to recover.

261
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,279
Young Master, you mustn't...

262
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,400
This game is about the honor of the Tang Dynasty.

263
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,078
How can I run away when the battle has just begun?

264
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,760
If you go back to the game, it might turn chronic.

265
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,999
Young Master...

266
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,018
Doctor, I've been well-built since my childhood.

267
00:24:31,018 --> 00:24:32,318
I'll be fine.

268
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:34,119
Older Brother Shuyu.

269
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,938
Why are you here?

270
00:24:35,938 --> 00:24:37,900
Does it hurt?

271
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,620
Lady.

272
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,579
It's just a minor injury. No need to worry.

273
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:44,680
See? I'm fine now.

274
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,739
This is an amulet for you.

275
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:55,839
If I had given it to you earlier,

276
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:58,360
you wouldn't have gotten hurt.

277
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,080
Thanks.

278
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:10,200
Wh... Where's my suit?

279
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,979
I can't believe there'd still be a player who'd volunteer to seek his doom.

280
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,259
No matter who you are,

281
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:53,159
we'll kick your ass.

282
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,780
Just ignore them.

283
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,560
You two, remember...

284
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,560
All I want is...

285
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,598
Victory!

286
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:39,099
<i>Yes!</i>

287
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:58,240
Array of Echelon.

288
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,940
Interesting.

289
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,799
<i>Nice!</i>

290
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:15,520
<i>Great!</i>

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,558
<i>Nice!</i>

00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:19,639
<i>Nice! Nice one!</i>

293
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,519
<i>Great!</i>

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,238

00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:23,159

00:29:05,998 --> 00:29:06,859
<i>Nice!</i>

302
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:07,579
<i>Nice one!</i>

303
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,639
<i>Great!</i>

304
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,840
<i>Nice!</i>

305
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,980
<i>Nice! Nice!</i>

306
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,679
<i>Nice! Nice!</i>

307
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,738
<i>Nice!</i>

308
00:30:25,738 --> 00:30:26,759
<i>Great!</i>

309
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,120
<i>Nice!</i>

310
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:34,420
Team Great Tang scores 17 points.

311
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,839
Team Ashile Tribe scores 17 points.

312
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:41,598
Your dress looks so nice.

313
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:44,060
Yes, it took me a long time to choose it.

314
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,200
There, don't be afraid.

315
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,398
<i>Nice!</i>

316
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:54,159
<i>Nice!</i>

317
00:32:01,439 --> 00:32:03,180
<i>Great!</i>

318
00:32:04,439 --> 00:32:06,239
<i>We won!</i>

319
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,659
<i>Nice! Nice!</i>

320
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:17,899
<i>Nice!</i>

321
00:32:26,479 --> 00:32:27,780
Game over.

322
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,459
Team Great Tang scores 18 points.

323
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:31,958
Team Ashile Tribe scores 17 points.

324
00:32:31,959 --> 00:32:34,180
Team Great Tang wins!

325
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,580
We won! We won!

326
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,420
- He is...
- She's Changge, of course.

327
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:47,879
Who else could mess with those Ashlie guys?

328
00:32:52,479 --> 00:32:54,079
Lady.

329
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:58,799
Prince Qin ordered me to escort you back to the manor.

330
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,020
How could Father know I'm here?

331
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,839
Father...

332
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,979
I'm just following the order.

333
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,479
Yueyan, there must be something important.

334
00:33:13,479 --> 00:33:14,400
Just go back.

335
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,318
I'll explain it to Changge.

336
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:18,019
I...

337
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,338
Don't worry. You're the lady.

338
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,719
<i>- Nice work.
- Great! Nice job!</i>

339
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,879
You won.

340
00:33:51,879 --> 00:33:55,599
This dagger is yours now.

341
00:33:57,719 --> 00:34:01,139
Give it to that lad.

342
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:04,138
- Yes.
- Nice!

343
00:34:04,138 --> 00:34:05,139
You've worked hard.

344
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:06,919
Hold on.

345
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:10,700
You talked about that marriage contract.

346
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:15,000
We should give this matter further thought.

347
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,798
That girl you've just seen is indeed a royal lady of our empire.

348
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,039
Would you mind coming to my palace

349
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,620
so that we can discuss it in detail?

350
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,119
Your sincerity is really a surprise to me.

351
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:36,120
It'd be impolite for me to decline then.

352
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:09,099
<i>- Nice, great.
- You too.</i>

353
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:10,679
<i>Good job.</i>

354
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:35,778
Thank you for what you did just now. The cuju ball is so heavy.

355
00:35:35,778 --> 00:35:39,058
If it really hit that child, the consequences would have been unimaginable.

356
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,338
Don't be like this.

357
00:35:41,338 --> 00:35:44,619
As the old saying goes, "It is a glorious failure."

358
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:49,740
You can't understand Chinese, right?

359
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,600
I can.

360
00:35:54,859 --> 00:35:57,059
He's so mean.

361
00:36:00,779 --> 00:36:03,320
The boy who made that winning kick.

362
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,660
Me?

363
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,140
Yes, come here.

364
00:36:07,919 --> 00:36:08,638
What?

365
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:12,159
As per His Highness's order, this dagger presented by the Ashile Tribe

366
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:13,939
will be awarded to...

367
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:17,379
How could you still keep your mask on?

368
00:36:17,379 --> 00:36:19,379
Just state your name.

369
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:06,320
Shixin Sili greets General Sun.

370
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:12,878
General Sun, why would you get interested

371
00:37:12,878 --> 00:37:14,279
and take part in the game personally today?

372
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,339
I wanted to test their ability.

373
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:17,699
And how are they?

374
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:21,900
If it was a real war, they'd be annihilated completely.

375
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,740
But that lad who entered at the last minute seemed smart.

376
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,359
I wonder who he is.

377
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,918
He's from the East Palace.

378
00:37:28,919 --> 00:37:31,079
His ranking must be higher than the eighth rank.

379
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,040
General Sun, you're omniscient.

380
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:34,559
Speaking of which,

381
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,398
I brought up the marriage contract today

382
00:37:36,399 --> 00:37:38,360
and Li Jiancheng really took the bait.

383
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,760
But shall we give Great Khan a notice in advance?

384
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,500
No need.

385
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,339
They're so eager to sue for peace.

386
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:49,780
I suppose their forces must be weak.

387
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,759
Great Khan has nothing to worry about.

388
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,438
Our envoy was expected to leave Chang'an tomorrow.

389
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,200
Shall we change the schedule?

390
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,999
No.

391
00:37:57,999 --> 00:38:00,439
Leave as scheduled.

392
00:38:00,439 --> 00:38:02,660
Leave as scheduled...

393
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:19,400
<i>[Success cease to exist if not together]</i>

394
00:38:21,579 --> 00:38:22,619
Second Uncle!

395
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:25,359
It hurts, Second Uncle! Let me go!

396
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,880
Troublemaker.

397
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,878
Isn't the limelight you received today not enough for you?

398
00:38:31,878 --> 00:38:34,399
Why are you here?

399
00:38:34,399 --> 00:38:37,939
Uncle, I'm here today because I got you a gift.

400
00:38:37,939 --> 00:38:39,740
Gift?

401
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,779
Show me, then.

402
00:38:43,579 --> 00:38:45,600
You've just won it.

403
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,359
Why are you giving it to me?

404
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,218
Since I was seven, I started horse riding and swordplay with you.

405
00:38:51,218 --> 00:38:53,979
You taught me martial arts and the art of war.

406
00:38:53,979 --> 00:38:56,979
That's why I could pitch into the cuju game.

407
00:38:56,979 --> 00:38:58,958
I can never repay your kindness.

408
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:01,319
I won this dagger myself.

409
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,660
Of course, I should give it to you, Uncle.

410
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,579
Xiao Yongning, you've grown up.

411
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:11,819
Today, you managed to apply the art of war to cuju

412
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:14,398
and set the formation for players.

413
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:16,199
Good job.

414
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,800
Nice dagger.

415
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,679
It's this dress.

416
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:49,320
If it wasn't for this suit, I'd definitely win over you, Uncle.

417
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,220
You're wrong.

418
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:54,200
That loophole was the bait I left.

419
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,420
You were too eager to win.

420
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,220
That's why you'd fall into my trap.

421
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,238
But you're more powerful than me.

422
00:39:59,238 --> 00:40:02,819
If I don't take the opportunity and make a surprise attack, how am I going to win?

423
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:04,900
The strong attack while the weak defend.

424
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,239
If you aren't strong enough, all you can do is to draw in your claws

425
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,859
and bide your time before you gain the strength

426
00:40:09,859 --> 00:40:11,840
and can finally launch the attack instead.

427
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,198
Sounds depressing.

428
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:15,420
This is the price the weak ones must pay.

429
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,458
It's not easy but you must struggle through it.

430
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:19,218
It's the only way to survive.

431
00:40:19,218 --> 00:40:20,538
Lie low and work hard.

432
00:40:20,538 --> 00:40:22,638
Whatever you're fighting for, someone or the world,

433
00:40:22,638 --> 00:40:24,660
it's always the case.

434
00:40:25,439 --> 00:40:28,378
Changge, remember this.

435
00:40:28,378 --> 00:40:30,800
Okay. I'll keep it in mind, Uncle.

436
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,479
All right. You should go home now.

437
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:34,800
I have business to attend to.

438
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,259
Okay. Then I'll come to visit you next time.

439
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,650
<i>[Success cease to exist if not together]</i>

440
00:40:43,979 --> 00:40:45,679
Changge,

441
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:58,479
send my regards to your mom.

442
00:40:58,479 --> 00:41:00,100
Got it.

443
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,140
<i>[Du Ruhui]</i>

444
00:41:16,399 --> 00:41:18,099
Your Highness,

445
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,260
I'm sorry I'm late.

446
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:25,180
I have had so many eyes on me lately.

447
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,020
Changge.

448
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,399
Father.

449
00:41:45,399 --> 00:41:47,559
That "lad" who reversed the game today.

450
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,760
It was you, right?

451
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,660
I didn't mean to break into the arena.

452
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,360
But we were on a losing streak at that time.

453
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,080
So...

454
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,959
