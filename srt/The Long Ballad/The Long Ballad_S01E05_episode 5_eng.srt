22
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,120
General, the water is ready.

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,818
Su Yishe and Nu'er are exploring the way ahead.

24
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:46,839
And found substitutes for us to head for the grassland through the pass.

25
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:49,159
But according to our speed now,

26
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,120
it will take us half a month to get to Youzhou.

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,599
Half a month?

28
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,199
Half a month will be too long.

29
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:58,098
- We have to hurry up. 
 - Yes.

30
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,740
That is...

31
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,899
How could there be a dead body?

 Timing and Subtitles by The Ode to Love Team @Viki.com 

33
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,420
Why is it him again?

34
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,378
General, what's wrong?

35
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:48,158
Ya Luo, find a place to stay.

36
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:49,639
Yes.

37
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:55,438
- General, let me carry him. 
 - No.

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,339
When did he change to a busybody?

39
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:01,819
Hold him as if it's a treasure.

40
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:14,999
Search carefully!

41
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:17,259
Dead or alive, we must find the body!

42
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:19,060
 Yes! 

43
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,859
Wei Shuyu, congratulations!

44
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:30,739
For what?

45
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:32,719
You intercepted Li Changge yourself.

46
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,959
And then you took the first place to shoot her.

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,020
You made great contributions to clearing the leftover traitor.

48
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,799
Of course, I should tell His Highness to publicize your contribution.

49
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,038
Hao Du, you are so ruthless. Are you not?

50
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:48,319
Aren't you clear whether Changge is guilty or not?

51
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,219
It's not important what I am thinking.

52
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:54,939
I just follow Father's order. What he orders is what I think.

53
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:57,620
But, Wei Shuyu, I also have some advice for you.

54
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,120
We cannot have it both ways in this world.

55
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,318
If you want your family, be obedient and follow my order.

56
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,719
General, this is where hunters take a rest.

57
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,100
Few people will come.

58
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,238
Take the wine bottle and medicine, and a set of clothes.

59
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,639
Yes.

60
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,560
Shameless!

61
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,958
Why did you hit me?

62
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,938
- What are you doing? 
 - Can't you see what I am doing?

63
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:39,000
What did you see?

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,038
You are a man. What can I see?

65
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:44,120
Then, why are you covering your eyes?

66
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,079
I don't like blood.

67
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,300
I don't want to see your wound.

68
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,100
Since you are so marvelous, then do it yourself.

69
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,359
I didn't ask you for help.

70
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Aliqi.

71
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,958
- What does it mean? 
 - Spirit Wine from the West.

72
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,819
Much better. Thanks!

73
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:53,879
Are you foolish?

74
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,439
Bear it!

75
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,199
You are a real man.

76
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,939
Give him the medicine.

77
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,460
Don't touch me!

78
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,278
Don't cry aloud like a woman!

79
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,798
We don't have to wait till now if we want to hurt you.

80
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:20,799
Leave him alone. He's really ungrateful.

81
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:22,320
Go.

82
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:55,858
Father, what's wrong?

83
00:07:55,858 --> 00:08:00,280
Prince Qin was here just now and I scolded him.

84
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,759
I think he will send someone here soon,

85
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,400
and put me to death.

86
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:10,098
Father, I'll prepare for the carriage now.

87
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:12,219
Please escape to our hometown of Quyang first.

88
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:13,639
I'll find Mr. Du now.

89
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,440
Shuyu, your father is not a coward.

90
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:22,800
But...

91
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,010
sorry for getting you involved.

92
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:40,259
Father, it's my fault.

93
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:46,059
I'm not strong enough to protect my father, nor my family.

94
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:53,300
Stand up.

95
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,119
What I did has nothing to do with you.

96
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:01,079
Today, Prince Qin came to our house,

97
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:05,500
so he is really a broad-minded man.

98
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,780
If you want to work for Prince Qin,

99
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,180
I won't stop you.

100
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:18,778
Father, I don't know whether it is the right choice or not.

101
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,680
   

102
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,998
Mr. Wei, this is what His Highness asked me to deliver to you.

103
00:09:49,998 --> 00:09:52,218
Father. No!

104
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:54,610
I'll plead to his Highness and Mr. Du.

105
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,390
- Shuyu. 
 - Father!

106
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,540
Accept it.

107
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,280
Mr. Wei, please enjoy.

108
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:22,839
Father. Father, no!

109
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:26,239
I'll plead to His Highness and Mr. Du.

110
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:32,159
What have I taught you since you were young?

111
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:34,579
Take off your hands.

112
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,340
Vinegar celery.

113
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:56,079
 Advisor Fang always says that Mr. Wei loves vinegar celery. 

114
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,840
 Crown Princess Zhangsun made it with five flavors in person. 

115
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,259
 Just to show my gratitude. 

116
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:04,018
 Today it was my fault. 

117
00:11:04,018 --> 00:11:07,099
 Please forgive me. 

118
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,739
F-Father.

119
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,960
Father!

120
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,759
Father! No!

121
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,659
Fa...

122
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,379
I was too narrow-minded.

123
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:39,880
But Prince Qin knows when to yield and when not.

124
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,979
Although we are from different sides,

125
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:46,180
I never say it out, but I am clear in mind.

126
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,860
Prince Qin is benevolent and generous,

127
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,879
but also resolute in his decisions.

128
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,919
No one can stop this mishap.

129
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:00,118
As for my loyalty to my master,

130
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:03,859
I can decline him for my whole life.

131
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:08,379
But the lands we are in still belong to Great Tang.

132
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:14,060
People here are still people of Great Tang.

133
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:22,159
My long-cherished wish is just for repaying Great Tang.

134
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,199
Father, I know.

135
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,900
For my whole life, I'm convinced by only a few people.

136
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,980
This vinegar celery...

137
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,780
has convinced me!

138
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:24,539
Thanks.

139
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:26,759
I misunderstood you earlier.

140
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:31,359
- You saved my life, I will— 
 - No need for it.

141
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,058
You don't owe me anything. There's nothing between us.

142
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:39,559
That would be good.

143
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,780
Well... Can I have a sip of this wine?

144
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,840
Yes,

145
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,060
but I never suffer any loss in business.

146
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,259
Why not make an exchange? I can give you the wine.

147
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:58,439
You need to answer my questions. What do you think?

148
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,678
It is impolite not to reciprocate.

149
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:03,599
Then let's play a game. Do you dare?

150
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:05,880
Of course.

151
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,299
We ask each other questions in turn.

152
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:13,219
If one can not answer, then one should drink as a forfeit.

153
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,759
Okay.

154
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,959
Go ahead.

155
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,579
Where did you get the wound on your shoulder?

156
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,680
Soldiers from the court shot me.

157
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,299
You are so straightforward.

158
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:38,939
Since it's an exchange, no one is allowed to lie.

159
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:41,000
My turn.

160
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,358
What's your name?

161
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:46,239
Surname, Qin. Zhun.

162
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:48,100
You can call me A'Zhun.

163
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,800
A'Zhun...

164
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,440
You?

165
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,579
Surname, Li. I was the 14th child in the family.

166
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:56,019
Call me Shisi.

167
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:59,379
Why did you want my dagger?

168
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:02,379
I just wanted to embarrass you.

169
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,699
I knew you were a bad guy.

170
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,999
A'Zhun, where are you from?

171
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm from the central plains; born beyond the Great Wall.

172
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,539
- Then, where's your home? 
 - That's another question.

173
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,520
Next,

174
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,000
where are you planning to go?

175
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
To take revenge.

176
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,780
Then, what about you?

177
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,799
To the north. Revenge for what?

178
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:46,220
- What to do in the north? 
 - A huge business.

179
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,819
Since you have answered it, why did you take a drink?

180
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:56,939
Because you will ask me about the business,

181
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:58,680
and I cannot answer.

182
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,740
I will be drunk if I keep drinking.

183
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,180
Then the last question.

184
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:16,800
Are you really called A'Zhun?

185
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,399
Then, Shisi,

186
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,599
are you really Shisi?

187
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,398
 - Good! Cheers! 
 - Come on! 

188
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,599
 - Again! 
 - Drink! 

189
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:45,920
What is General talking with him?

190
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,299
I've not heard a laugh like that from him in a long time.

191
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,479
General has been leading Eagle Division for years,

192
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:52,419
but Great Khan is always suspicious of him.

193
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:55,158
And he always got impeded by that deadly foe.

194
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:57,079
Under such a situation,

195
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:59,939
if it were you, could you laugh?

196
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,959
Yes, you are right.

197
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,219
But never mind that, don't be upset by that.

198
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,059
But I haven't seen him caring about anyone so much.

199
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,750
   

200
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,360
Your Highness,

201
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,900
Princess Yongning has nothing to do with the rumor.

202
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,719
It seems that it was done by others.

203
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:42,758
As for Princess Yongning, it was my fault to let her escape.

204
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,600
Fine.

205
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,900
These days, massive forces have already yielded surrender.

206
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,119
Even if she has any movement, it won't cause big trouble.

207
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:56,199
Just pay more attention to her.

208
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,819
Yes.

209
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:00,779
Keming.

210
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,439
Do you need anything else, Your Highness?

211
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,340
What Changge took away with her,

212
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,660
is an important item of the court.

213
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,000
No matter what,

214
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,900
no one can keep it.

215
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,940
I understand.

216
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,659
 Wei Zheng was right. 

217
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:55,019
 I'm the most ruthless person in this world. 

218
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,359
- Princess. 
 - Mr. Du.

219
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:11,619
His Highness is in there. You can go in.

220
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,020
General.

221
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,700
Let's set off.

222
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:55,798
- Where is that boy? 
 - He's gone.

223
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:57,539
Gone?

224
00:19:58,439 --> 00:20:00,699
Why didn't he say anything and just left?

225
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,160
Su Yishe, send a scout back to the Eagle Division.

226
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,839
Ask them to prepare these, and wait for me outside You State,

227
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,800
and hand this to Great Khan.

228
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,819
Don't worry, General.

229
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:13,319
Go.

230
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,600
General, what should we do after we get You State?

231
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,259
I've already asked Su Yishe to prepare the road stone.

232
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,760
   

233
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:45,260
Greetings, Father.

234
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,680
It's hard for you to see me yourself.

235
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,480
Did anything happen?

236
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,200
Nothing.

237
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,379
I just want to come to see you.

238
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:55,999
That's so considerate of you.

239
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:58,879
If nothing is wrong, just go back and have some rest.

240
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,920
I still have some business to handle.

241
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:14,020
I want to ask you... about Changge.

242
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:19,120
Please don't harm her.

243
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,238
Changge just has a bad temper.

244
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,039
- But she— 
 - Yan'er.

245
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:36,759
Yan'er,

246
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,720
forget that Changge exists in this world.

247
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,219
It's good for both you and her.

248
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:49,099
Father!

249
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,879
Your Highness, the court sent someone here.

250
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,879
He is here to see the princess.

251
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,119
His Majesty heard that the princess harbors great righteousness in mind,

252
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,459
and would love to marry into the grassland.

253
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:06,079
I am here to send rewards and the imperial edict.

254
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:08,800
Please accept it, Princess.

255
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:25,338
Crown Prince's daughter, young and quiet,

256
00:22:25,338 --> 00:22:26,858
as one of the members of the royal family,

257
00:22:26,858 --> 00:22:30,239
all your reward is according to the regime.

258
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:32,179
Now you are Royal Princess Yongan,

259
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:33,879
you can get the rewards of 3,000 households,

260
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,660
and this is executed at once.

261
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:48,018
Noble Princess Yongan, hurry and accept it!

262
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,980
I accept it with pleasure.

263
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,339
Thanks to Your Majesty!

264
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:26,800
I still have to marry into the grassland, right?

265
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,940
   

266
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:56,939
Father, you have been upset since you came back from Hongyi Palace.

267
00:23:56,939 --> 00:24:00,600
Is that because His Highness is still concerned about Li Changge?

268
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,879
If she is still alive,

269
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:07,598
then she'll be big trouble.

270
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,619
I can't understand.

271
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:12,999
Why can Li Changge make Crown Prince, Princess,

272
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,660
and the Wei family protect and defend her?

273
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,519
His Highness the Crown Prince is very affectionate towards her.

274
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,260
Princess is her good friend.

275
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,500
As for Young Master Wei,

276
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:34,920
if Li Changge is alive,

277
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,260
she must go and find Wei Shuyu.

278
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,340
Keep an eye on Wei Shuyu.

279
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,199
Find the seal of the crown prince. And kill her.

280
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:45,159
I understand.

281
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:49,779
Hao Du, remember.

282
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:53,160
Never mind the trivial things when doing something important.

283
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,960
Never be tied by any affections.

284
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,880
Yes.

285
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,100
   

286
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,540
 From here I will leave Chang'an. 

287
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:32,560
 I never thought that I would come here one day. 

288
00:25:33,459 --> 00:25:36,240
I hurt! I hurt!

289
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,718
A'Dou?

290
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:40,619
Master! What's wrong?

291
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,900
Nothing.

292
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,279
Why are you here?

293
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,980
I asked you...

294
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,900
I've been here waiting for a whole day.

295
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,999
Since I know Master will head north,

296
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,899
then you must pass these boundary tablets on your way.

297
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:54,999
Master, I've been with you for some days.

298
00:25:54,999 --> 00:25:57,559
Am I making any progress?

299
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:59,780
But if you didn't show up,

300
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,800
I would doubt myself if I was wrong.

301
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:04,959
A'Dou,

302
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,159
I still have no idea where my future is.

303
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:11,779
You have a bright future.

304
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,578
Although you can't stay at Pinxiang Store,

305
00:26:14,578 --> 00:26:16,358
you have many other choices.

306
00:26:16,358 --> 00:26:17,780
Why must you follow me?

307
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,078
Master, you are my future.

308
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,879
I will be with you no matter alive or dead!

309
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,200
I said that and I won't be wrong.

310
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,058
My master must be a big hero!

311
00:26:26,058 --> 00:26:28,279
Which hero has no general with him?

312
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,079
I am my master's general!

313
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:36,339
Master! I'm serious!

314
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,079
A'Dou.

315
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:44,838
Master! Let me follow you.

316
00:26:51,979 --> 00:26:53,679
Kowtow.

317
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,540
Since you take me as your master, we have to obey the ritual.

318
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,599
Master, please accept your apprentice's bow!

319
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:10,679
From now on, you are my apprentice.

320
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,860
We will never betray each other.

321
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,539
Okay.

322
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:18,419
Master, where are we going now?

323
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:20,680
You State.

324
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,260
My father's soldiers and horses are there.

325
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,699
Li Yuan, the Governor of You State, is my father's good friend.

326
00:27:26,699 --> 00:27:31,199
Besides, if we can persuade him to help us,

327
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:33,040
there will be hope for us.

328
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:36,239
Then, I am going to be a general so quickly?

329
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:38,339
Far from that!

330
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:40,080
But...

331
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:45,000
I will never give up.

332
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,460
   

333
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:23,180
   

334
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:32,780
My house is not good enough for you.

335
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,080
I am here to say sorry.

336
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,180
Mr. Wei was right.

337
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:44,979
I scolded you so much. Which one do you mean?

338
00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:16,179
This is for that plate of vinegar celery.

339
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:23,779
Mr. Wei is also a father.

340
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:26,340
When you were risking it for Jiancheng,

341
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,459
did you think about Shuyu?

342
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:33,820
Don't worry. I have some farmlands at home,

343
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,078
it's enough for my boys.

344
00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:41,819
So a man like Mr. Wei also worries about his sons.

345
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:45,638
Your Highness, what do you want to say?

346
00:29:45,638 --> 00:29:48,500
Just a chat.

347
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,899
I also have kids and always worry about them.

348
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:54,860
I have read a lot.

349
00:29:54,860 --> 00:30:00,319
But I have no idea how to protect them as their parent.

350
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,020
I'm a father,

351
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,520
I can feel your love for your kids.

352
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,860
I heard about the marriage of Princess Yongan.

353
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,880
If you're worried about it,

354
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,959
then I may give you a suggestion.

355
00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:23,839
Please.

356
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,359
What? I suffer a strange disease?

357
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,300
Yes.

358
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,718
Remember. This strange disease can not be cured so quickly,

359
00:30:31,718 --> 00:30:34,380
and you have to go to Luoyang to get medical treatment.

360
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,579
Luoyang?

361
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:36,819
Yes.

362
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:39,299
I have already arranged for you.

363
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:42,020
Start your trip as soon as possible.

364
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,720
Go!

365
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,358
You always cry.

366
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:01,659
How could you be a princess if you are so weak?

367
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,199
You should learn from Changge!

368
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,740
Yan'er, because you suffer from this,

369
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,679
for the time being, you can't marry so far.

370
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,399
Understand?

371
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,939
Stay in Luoyang for treatment.

372
00:31:31,939 --> 00:31:36,719
I will send someone to take you back as soon as you are recovered.

373
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,039
I know you get on well with Young Master Wei.

374
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,120
I have asked him to escort you to Luoyang.

375
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,759
You don't have to worry about anything with his help.

376
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,859
As ordered.

377
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:11,990
   

378
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,739
Brother Shuyu.

379
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,879
I will take you to Luoyang.

380
00:32:17,879 --> 00:32:20,300
Thanks, Brother Shuyu.

381
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,200
 You will understand your father someday. 

382
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,779
 You! Come here! 

383
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,318
 Okay. 

384
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:53,780
 Next. 
   

385
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,480
   

386
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,879
 Be careful! 

387
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,580
 Next. 

388
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,580
 Go. 

389
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,819
 Okay, okay!  Go. 

390
00:33:09,819 --> 00:33:11,480
 Okay. 

391
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:13,620
 Next. 

392
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,459
 Go. 

393
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:18,059
 Thanks. 

394
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,119
What's in your carriage?

395
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:23,238
They are all grains.

396
00:33:23,238 --> 00:33:24,319
- Grains? 
 - Yes.

397
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:26,379
You. You. Go and search.

398
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,079
Yes!

399
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:33,539
No... No need to search. Just some grains.

400
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:36,540
It's not up to you.

401
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,459
Any problems?

402
00:33:42,459 --> 00:33:43,419
No.

403
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:45,419
Okay.

404
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:46,639
- Thanks! 
 - Go. 
 - Thanks!

405
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:48,159
Go!  Let's go.

406
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,960
Wait!

407
00:33:56,099 --> 00:33:58,099
Sir.

408
00:33:58,099 --> 00:33:59,619
Why are you so nervous?

409
00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:01,219
No, Sir.

410
00:34:01,219 --> 00:34:02,859
What's in here?

411
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:06,000
Officer, just some grains.

412
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:12,959
Sir...

413
00:34:19,439 --> 00:34:20,539
Open it and search.

414
00:34:20,539 --> 00:34:22,639
Yes!  Yes!

415
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,139
No...

416
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,418
- Take them all. 
 - Yes!

417
00:34:49,418 --> 00:34:51,520
No, no, no... No, sir!

418
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,779
 - Go, go.  
 - I'm wronged, sir! Wronged!

419
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,820
General, what's that?

420
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,858
Today we didn't find anything

421
00:35:02,858 --> 00:35:05,338
and you didn't see anything. Remember?

422
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:06,939
Yes!

423
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,139
I was wronged! Officer!

424
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:13,960
Go quickly!

425
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,679
I was wronged! Officer!

426
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:25,239
- Thanks. Thanks! 
 - You're welcome.

427
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:31,458
Master, you're so clever.

428
00:35:31,458 --> 00:35:34,918
If we didn't get on this carriage, how could we get here so quickly?

429
00:35:34,918 --> 00:35:37,259
There would be many blisters on our feet.

430
00:35:37,259 --> 00:35:40,259
This is leveraging. Learn from it.

431
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,919
 Their food is quite good! 

432
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:54,379
 Slow down, Madam! 

433
00:35:54,379 --> 00:35:55,918
 What will we do next? 

434
00:35:55,919 --> 00:35:57,819
 - Wander around. 
 - Okay, let's go! 

435
00:35:57,819 --> 00:35:59,680
Let's stay here.

436
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,800
- Please. 
 - Waiter?

437
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,519
Here!

438
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,279
Two gentlemen, which room do you want?

439
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,260
The cheapest?

440
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,918
The cheapest.

441
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:16,118
This way. Go.

442
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,859
Please.

443
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,519
Have a look here.

444
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,359
Although our room is not big,

445
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,278
it is enough for you two.

446
00:36:26,278 --> 00:36:27,918
Besides, it's quiet here.

447
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,039
Are you satisfied, client?

448
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:31,499
Yes.

449
00:36:31,499 --> 00:36:33,280
Okay, have some rest first.

450
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,760
And I will prepare the hot water for you.

451
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,718
I will explore around Governor Manor. You stay here.

452
00:36:42,718 --> 00:36:44,479
Don't expose yourself.

453
00:36:44,479 --> 00:36:46,060
Yes.

454
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,279
Master, just endure it.

455
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,398
It is good enough for the boss to provide us with the warehouse.

456
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:03,600
I will clean it up.

457
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,999
And make it a cozy place for you to have a rest.

458
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,198
A'Dou, don't be too tired.

459
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,519
I'm okay with that.

460
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,199
I'm not tired, Master. Have some rest now! Rest now!

461
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,239
Nothing, I will explore a little bit.

462
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:16,020
Master, I will follow you.

463
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,859
You are just a little boy, it'd be strange for you to go with me.

464
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:21,659
Sleep early. I'll bring you some food.

465
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,640
   

466
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,559
This is the last stop.

467
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,740
Tomorrow, we will arrive at the palace in Luoyang.

468
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:03,238
Brother Shuyu, am I going to leave tomorrow?

469
00:38:03,238 --> 00:38:05,119
The view of Luoyang palace is very splendid.

470
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,579
Those servants will be by your side.

471
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:17,579
Those days when we could play together are just like a dream.

472
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:21,919
We three were so good together,

473
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:25,919
but now we have to be separated remotely.

474
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:27,478
And head to different places.

475
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:29,880
All good things must come to an end.

476
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,659
No one can stay with each other for their whole life.

477
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:35,399
Brother Shuyu, I understand.

478
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,539
I have to wake up.

479
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,579
We have grown up.

480
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,920
Brother Shuyu, could you...

481
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,900
could you write to me when you are free?

482
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:58,739
As soon as you get news about Changge, tell me.

483
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:02,279
I promise you. I will find her.

484
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,759
It's getting late. Go back and get some rest.

485
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:40,039
I never thought that you could be so quick.

486
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,280
I can catch up with you until you are almost at Luoyang.

487
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:46,060
Listen, Wei Shuyu!

488
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,479
A decree from Crown Prince.

489
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:53,299
Wei Shuyu is assigned as the special envoy of Chang'an.

490
00:39:53,299 --> 00:39:55,180
No need to go back to Chang'an.

491
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,738
Go with Hao Du to You State.

492
00:39:58,738 --> 00:40:03,439
Call Li Yuan, Prince of Lujiang, to come to the court.

493
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,060
Please tell me. Do you have news about her?

494
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,500
You hope it's a yes, or a no?

495
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:16,839
No matter what, you have to go with me.

496
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:20,558
Besides, you just need to issue the decree.

497
00:40:20,558 --> 00:40:24,319
As for others, stay away from it.

498
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:40,299
Someone saw that Princess Yongning and a boy appeared on the way to the north, heading to You State.

499
00:40:40,299 --> 00:40:42,279
Listen.

500
00:40:42,959 --> 00:40:45,679
Keep an eye on Wei Shuyu.

501
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,660
If they meet each other privately,

502
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:51,400
kill Yongning.

503
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,279
If Wei Shuyu stops you,

504
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,300
the same to him.

505
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,060
Yes.

506
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:20,320
   

507
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:25,290
   

508
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:40,279
Boss, which is your best ironware?

509
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:11,010
 ''Cocoon'' - Zhou Shen 

510
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:16,689
♫  The heart gradually responds,  ♫

511
00:42:16,689 --> 00:42:18,969
♫  gradually revives,  ♫

512
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:22,480
♫  gradually swims towards you  ♫

513
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,640
♫  Before bidding farewell,  ♫

514
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,270
♫  we expect an encounter  ♫

515
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:35,249
♫  As your silhouette weaves  ♫

516
00:42:35,249 --> 00:42:40,580
♫  and locks in my nostalgic dream  ♫

517
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,380
♫  Before the daybreak,  ♫

518
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,669
♫  through the obsession of love,  ♫

519
00:42:45,669 --> 00:42:49,600
♫  the yearning flowing through thoughts  ♫

520
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,969
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

521
00:42:52,969 --> 00:42:58,960
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

522
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,409
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

523
00:43:02,409 --> 00:43:08,929
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

524
00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:11,319
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

525
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:13,599
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

526
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,169
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

527
00:43:18,169 --> 00:43:21,030
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

528
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,870
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

529
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:29,340
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

530
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:37,249
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

531
00:43:37,249 --> 00:43:43,079
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

532
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:46,490
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

533
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:53,000
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

534
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,360
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

535
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,730
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

536
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:02,309
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

537
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:05,079
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

538
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:07,080
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

539
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:13,590
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

540
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:23,060
♫  It is sleepless  ♫

541
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:35,790
