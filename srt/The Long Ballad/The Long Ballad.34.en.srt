The notice wrote that the court will distribute the unclaimed fields to refugees.

23
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:44,019
And those refugees will be free from rent and forced labor.

24
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:45,860
To build water conservancy projects and local public welfare barns.

25
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,779
Help disaster areas by creating jobs. That's all.

26
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,860
The water can float a boat, but also overturn it.

27
00:01:56,419 --> 00:01:58,980
Do you think that he would be a good emperor?

28
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:01,799
If he dares to slow the progress,

29
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,250
I could kill him then.

30
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,799
It is not a bad choice to let him go.

31
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:09,490
Maybe.

32
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,520
Although I'm not resigned to it,

33
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:16,460
I'm clear that he is the best choice for the Tang Dynasty now.

34
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,159
What's your next plan?

35
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,660
Now they know I am staying here,

36
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,059
so staying in Luoyang is not a good choice.

37
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:28,220
The border invasion of the Tang Dynasty has finished.

38
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,639
I plan to go to the desert.

39
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:32,760
Then come with me.

40
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,879
It's been a while for me staying here.

41
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,620
I have no idea how the Eagle Division is now.

42
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,700
It's time to go back.

43
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,099
I heard from Elder Qin that we could leave today.

44
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,000
So fast!

45
00:02:57,279 --> 00:03:03,300
The passport I got from the officials is a literati family from the north.

46
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,720
Please call each other brother and sister later,

47
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,910
don't make any mistakes.

48
00:03:12,419 --> 00:03:14,720
Thanks for your arrangement, Elder Qin.

49
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,259
Brother, let's go!

50
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,979
You are so beautiful, my sister.

51
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:25,439
Put this on. Don't make bad men covet you.

52
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:27,220
Disciple!

53
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,839
Master! Taoist Sun.

54
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,899
Taoist Sun!

55
00:03:38,899 --> 00:03:40,159
Luoyang is such a small place.

56
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,758
I never thought I would meet you here.

57
00:03:41,758 --> 00:03:43,919
It seems that destiny brought us together.

58
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,459
Where are you going?

59
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,139
Why not stay here for a little while longer?

60
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:48,799
No, no!

61
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,658
I heard that the emperor was asking to see me.

62
00:03:50,658 --> 00:03:54,699
If His Majesty keeps me at the Imperial Medical Academy, that will be too bad for me.

63
00:03:54,699 --> 00:03:58,078
No! I... I have to run!

64
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,340
<i>[Lamb Tarven]</i>

65
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,220
<i>This experience is both a disaster and a blessing for me.</i>

66
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,460
<i>I lost something but also gained a lot.</i>

67
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,880
<i>I finally understand my father's saying.</i>

68
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,140
<i>"People are still living a hard life. How could I look on with folded arms?"</i>

69
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:59,519
<i>As my father's daughter, how could I fall behind with no progress?</i>

70
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,678
Sister! Let's go faster!

71
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:06,200
I'll never come to this hell again!

72
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,080
<i>Changge, I hope you all the best!</i>

73
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,060
Brother Li, what are you doing here?

74
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,240
I'm here to see you off.

75
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,299
General Li.

76
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,459
Just call me Brother Li.

77
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:11,420
Brother Qin, you are so bad!

78
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:15,139
You didn't even tell me that you were leaving.

79
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,540
Your girl is the princess.

80
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,340
What good taste you have!

81
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,178
What are you talking about? So mysterious!

82
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:30,278
Nothing.

83
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:32,559
How do you do, Princess?

84
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,700
How do you do, Duke Wei?

85
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:38,679
Hope that you are well, Princess.

86
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:42,700
I never thought that Duke Wei was also a free and unfettered man.

87
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,320
I have no more time to be free.

88
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:50,518
Several days later, I will head to Chang'an with Minister Du.

89
00:06:50,518 --> 00:06:52,118
Duke Wei is endowed with the talent to govern and to serve.

90
00:06:52,119 --> 00:06:55,420
It's a pity to keep you in this countryside.

91
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,079
I have to say I envy you, Princess.

92
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,659
The vast grassland is abundant with rivers and vegetables,

93
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:05,260
flocks and herds.

94
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,540
I really want to see it once I have a chance.

95
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:16,359
Brother Li, how did you know that?

96
00:07:16,359 --> 00:07:19,499
Don't be nervous. I am here alone.

97
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,819
I have some words to say to you here.

98
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,040
Please, go ahead.

99
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,399
Actually, there is no Warcraft of Lord Wei.

100
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:34,820
That book was a lie.

101
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:41,119
I just wanted to see if you would give up your original aspiration for that warcraft.

102
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,079
But although warcraft doesn't exist in this world,

103
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:48,019
strategists do.

104
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:51,260
Strategists can be generals and also swordsmen.

105
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,380
But a real strategist will never be defined by military accomplishments,

106
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,760
but his mind.

107
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,579
A benevolent heart is invincible.

108
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,398
Think about it.

109
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:10,259
Don't be anxious.

110
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:14,299
Some can't figure it out in their whole life,

111
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:18,400
but I believe you can.

112
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:24,879
If one day we meet on the battlefield,

113
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,240
I will remember this.

114
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,599
A benevolent heart is invincible.

115
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,019
You are worth teaching.

116
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,519
Fine! It's time for me to go back,

117
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,420
or my wife will be angry.

118
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,800
Goodbye!

119
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,599
Take care.

120
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:07,219
Duke Wei passed his lifetime experience to you.

121
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:11,239
No one can ever compare to his generosity!

122
00:09:24,239 --> 00:09:25,939
Come on!

123
00:09:34,359 --> 00:09:38,298
Just a few days passed, this is the thirteenth one!

124
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:42,459
Grand Witch, what is happening now?

125
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,959
I've tried all my methods, but I couldn't help it.

126
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:51,439
More and more people have been laid up these days.

127
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,980
That can't be possible.

128
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,740
The water and food here are all clean.

129
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,458
- How could it be?
- I made a divination today.

130
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,540
I'm afraid that...

131
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:06,130
this is a curse from the gods.

132
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,519
A curse?

133
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,139
No, we have to let Sun know about it.

134
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:23,320
This disease is infectious.

135
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,980
I've put them in danger.

136
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:31,819
No!

137
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:34,180
It can't be like this anymore.

138
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,900
No...

139
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:41,699
We can't stay here any longer.

140
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:44,060
We must go!

141
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:47,660
- Sister...
- Go!

142
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,420
Where are we going?

143
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,460
<i>Master said that if you didn't listen to her,</i>

144
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,819
<i>you should know the consequences.</i>

145
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,000
Buzhen...

146
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:05,439
Where are we going?

147
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:08,440
Buzhen... Buzhen...

148
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,619
Help me!

149
00:11:19,619 --> 00:11:21,779
Help!

150
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,719
Help!

151
00:11:31,339 --> 00:11:33,139
Your Majesty.

152
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,159
Minister Du, you're back.

153
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,319
Your Majesty, I saw Li Changge in Luoyang.

154
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:45,740
You saw Changge?

155
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,579
God has blessed me!

156
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,818
It would be good if she is safe.

157
00:12:02,818 --> 00:12:07,659
After she killed the leftover villains of Chini at Liuyun Taoist Temple,

158
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:11,219
she escaped with a man from the Ashile Tribe.

159
00:12:11,219 --> 00:12:13,180
I failed to catch her.

160
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,800
Please forgive me, Your Majesty!

161
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,979
You are saying that she was with a man from Ashile Tribe?

162
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:24,158
Before she escaped, she saved me at Liuyun Taoist Temple,

163
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:26,459
as well as the people there.

164
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,459
Please stand up, Minister Du.

165
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
Yes...

166
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,559
Her adamant temper will never change no matter where she is,

167
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:44,679
or with whom she is getting along with.

168
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,280
Thanks to that, she is still alive,

169
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,319
or I would be guilty all my life.

170
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:54,340
No worries, Your Majesty!

171
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,158
Li Changge not only lives a powerful life,

172
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:02,080
but also is killing people fiercely.

173
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,939
Minister Du, you've been a cautious man,

174
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:19,499
why did you let her go this time?

175
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:21,460
It's my fault.

176
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:27,100
But Li Changge is so cunning.

177
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,780
<i>[Nan'an Courier Hostel]</i>

178
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,919
I'm so tired!

179
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:54,219
I have to take a good shower first and then have a big meal!

180
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:56,499
- Go!
- Yes.

181
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,219
<i>Princess, it's time for dinner.</i>

182
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,039
Princess.

183
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,380
This is Princess's dinner.

184
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,999
Yes.

185
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:18,719
Come on. Give it to me.

186
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:26,359
Go out, I don't want to eat.

187
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,839
Brother Shuyu, why is it you?

188
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,498
I heard Hao Du's voice just now.

189
00:15:38,498 --> 00:15:41,019
Still angry with Hao Du?

190
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:43,279
He lied to me and took advantage of me,

191
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,779
I'll never forgive him.

192
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,040
But you should eat.

193
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,860
Come on.

194
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:54,498
I'm also a bit hungry. Let's have it together.

195
00:15:54,498 --> 00:15:57,159
These are all from Hao Du.

196
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,959
Then put it away.

197
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,460
I won't eat his food.

198
00:16:03,799 --> 00:16:08,699
Do you feel that Hao Du has changed?

199
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,179
I admit that Hao Du is much kinder

200
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:21,980
and softer than before.

201
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,519
But he lied to me,

202
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,620
and almost harmed Changge.

203
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,318
- Whenever I thought this, I feel...
- What if Hao Du saved Changge?

204
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:34,879
What do you mean?

205
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,959
I have to tell you something.

206
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:40,658
That day when we were fighting with the Chini at Liuyun Taoist Temple,

207
00:16:40,658 --> 00:16:43,478
Changge was there, too. You know that.

208
00:16:43,478 --> 00:16:46,239
But do you know how she escaped?

209
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,139
Changge is such a clever girl.

210
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:50,099
There were so many ways for her to escape.

211
00:16:50,099 --> 00:16:51,478
Even if she were the cleverest man in the world,

212
00:16:51,479 --> 00:16:54,598
she was encircled by soldiers at Liuyun Taoist Temple.

213
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:58,039
How could she escape without being noticed?

214
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:04,879
Are you saying that it was Hao Du who secretly let her go?

215
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,639
I sent someone to ask about it.

216
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:10,539
When a soldier was counting bodies,

217
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:12,819
he found that a body was moving.

218
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:16,979
But Hao Du scolded him and said he was blind.

219
00:17:16,979 --> 00:17:21,539
It seemed that it might have been Changge.

220
00:17:21,539 --> 00:17:24,620
But hasn't he been catching Changge all the time?

221
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,680
Who knows?

222
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,118
Maybe Changge changed him,

223
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,640
or you might have woken him up when you slapped him.

224
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:39,479
Brother Shuyu, why are you telling me this?

225
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:41,759
You changed your view of him?

226
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,860
Change?

227
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,000
I still hate him.

228
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,338
But it's a fact.

229
00:17:47,338 --> 00:17:48,699
You have the right to know.

230
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:52,739
I'm telling you this because I want you to accept his protection.

231
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:57,200
After all, he is a quite good bodyguard.

232
00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:08,760
Thanks, Brother Shuyu.

233
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,500
Have your dinner, or it will get cold.

234
00:18:20,619 --> 00:18:24,279
The grassland is ahead of us.

235
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:27,219
Young Master, no matter where you are,

236
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:30,379
I will always be with you.

237
00:18:30,379 --> 00:18:33,979
Elder Qin, for these years in Shuozhou,

238
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:37,780
you should hate and fear the Ashile Tribe the most.

239
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,839
Elder Qin, why not...

240
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:45,540
I'll only follow masters with wisdom this whole life.

241
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,440
Others never matter to me.

242
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,199
Elder Qin, I promise you safety when you are at the Eagle Division.

243
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,939
A'Sun, you underestimated me.

244
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:59,320
I'm such an old man, what do I fear?

245
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,880
I didn't mean that.

246
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:04,160
It's quite late now. Get some rest.

247
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,940
We have to continue our journey tomorrow.

248
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,979
Young Master, you too.

249
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:10,859
I'll let Xu Feng stay here.

250
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:13,098
Xu Feng might lull Yuan to sleep.

251
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:14,379
Don't wake him up.

252
00:19:14,379 --> 00:19:16,379
Elder Qin, go and get some rest now.

253
00:19:16,379 --> 00:19:18,079
Okay.

254
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,680
Go.

255
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,600
Stop.

256
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,700
General, I never thought that you would really bring our young counselor back.

257
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,459
Ya Luo, why are you here?

258
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:43,578
Mu Jin asked me to look for you in Great Tang, but I find you here.

259
00:19:43,578 --> 00:19:46,559
General, come back quickly! The Eagle Division is in trouble.

260
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,739
What?

261
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:50,360
Grand Witch said that we were cursed.

262
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,700
Cursed?

263
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,019
I... I don't know it.

264
00:19:54,019 --> 00:19:56,139
But many people in the Eagle Division have a disease.

265
00:19:56,139 --> 00:19:58,219
Pox has appeared on their bodies,

266
00:19:58,219 --> 00:19:59,879
and many people have died.

267
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,399
Grand Witch has no way to solve it.

268
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:03,460
Go back and have a look!

269
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,180
Pox?

270
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,318
A disease?

271
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:08,119
Yes.

272
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,118
But Taoist Sun just left.

273
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:11,940
Elder Qin, can I ask you for help?

274
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,119
Go ahead, Young Master.

275
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:15,398
Could you send people to find Taoist Sun back?

276
00:20:15,398 --> 00:20:18,419
Because they are going on a donkey carriage, they can't have gone too far.

277
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:21,978
No worries. I'll send someone to find Taoist Sun back.

278
00:20:21,978 --> 00:20:23,700
Thanks, Elder Qin.

279
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,638
Ya Luo, get some rest now.

280
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:27,459
We will go back to Eagle Division tomorrow morning.

281
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:29,260
Yes.

282
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:34,159
Changge.

283
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,960
Sun, you can't shake me off.

284
00:20:39,099 --> 00:20:42,260
We've been through so many scary things together.

285
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,378
We agreed to go through all the hardships together.

286
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:46,860
The same this time.

287
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,600
Okay.

288
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,770
Together.

289
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:04,219
Buzhen.

290
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,200
Brother, you're awake.

291
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,999
Sorry...

292
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:14,679
It's okay.

293
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,159
I'm here. You'll be okay.

294
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,600
Sister, I'm dying...

295
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,300
Don't say that.

296
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,739
You are still young.

297
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:27,158
You will live to a hundred.

298
00:21:27,158 --> 00:21:28,660
So good.

299
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:35,680
I can have a sister with me at last...

300
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,619
You'll be okay.

301
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:48,600
They sent me to pass a message to you.

302
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:55,300
But I accidentally got infected on my way here.

303
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,479
You'll be okay.

304
00:22:00,739 --> 00:22:06,620
They said that, as long as you see my face,

305
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:12,759
you would bring me back.

306
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:14,859
It's okay.

307
00:22:14,859 --> 00:22:16,078
It's okay.

308
00:22:16,078 --> 00:22:18,079
You'll be okay.

309
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:21,460
Buzhen. Buzhen.

310
00:22:22,339 --> 00:22:25,160
Is his name Buzhen?

311
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:29,919
He's so lucky to have you as his sister.

312
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,679
It's okay.

313
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:50,900
I'll be with you.

314
00:22:51,959 --> 00:22:54,619
There's no slave in Heaven.

315
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,940
I'll get a basin of water for you

316
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,700
and send you away with a clean body.

317
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:16,959
Mimi Guli, are you there?

318
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,260
Mu Jin is with the Grand Witch now.

319
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,740
He asked me to take some spices for you to ward off evil.

320
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:24,499
You can burn it on the fire.

321
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,700
Are you in there?

322
00:23:28,819 --> 00:23:30,719
I'm coming in.

323
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,100
This boy is the curse.

324
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,579
And she is the one who brought the curse here.

325
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,920
<i>- It's her!
- It's her!</i>

326
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,060
Fine, Mimi Guli.

327
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,600
We Eagle Division kept you here, but you dared to curse us!

328
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,340
You harmed my son.

329
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,180
He is dying now. Give him back to me!

330
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,159
Sorry.

331
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,299
- Excuse me...
- What can a sorry do?

332
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:12,179
- Give my son back!
- Leave her alone!

333
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,699
Make this clear first!

334
00:24:17,699 --> 00:24:21,380
Mimi, where did he come from?

335
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,500
You had nothing to do with him, right?

336
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,720
I saved him.

337
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,820
I secretly hid him here in my tent. I...

338
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,210
I...

339
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,939
I didn't think that he would be... He...

340
00:24:38,939 --> 00:24:40,860
She was bewitched.

341
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,080
So she could curse everybody!

342
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,080
Or why did she stay with the curse all the time

343
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,859
without getting infected?

344
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:52,859
- Yes...
- Mu Jin, you heard what Grand Witch said?

345
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:55,100
It was because of her that we were all harmed.

346
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,359
She is already bewitched. We can't keep her here.

347
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:00,339
<i>- Kill her! Kill her!
- Yes!</i>

348
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:02,599
<i>- Kill her!
- Kill her!</i>

349
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:08,959
Mu Jin, Mimi Guli can't stay here any longer.

350
00:25:11,379 --> 00:25:19,199
<i>Kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!</i>

351
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,299
You still want to protect her.

352
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:30,880
Mu Jin, you are obsessed with this demon. Are you not?

353
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,740
Mimi Guli is also a member of the Eagle Division.

354
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,980
I can't see you burning her to death without doing anything!

355
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,718
<i>Burn her! Burn her! Burn her!</i>

356
00:25:37,719 --> 00:25:38,980
<i>She can't stay.</i>

357
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,139
<i>Burn her! Burn her!</i>

358
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:45,400
<i>Burn her! Burn her! Burn her!</i>

359
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:48,820
You hear that?

360
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,419
Stay away.

361
00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:52,279
Get out of the way!

362
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:54,880
Do you want everyone to die with her?

363
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,720
If you want to burn her, burn me first!

364
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,900
<i>Burn her! Burn her!</i>

365
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,059
- Mu Jin!
<i>- Burn her! Burn her!</i>

366
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:05,159
- Mu Jin!
<i>- Burn her!</i>

367
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:08,399
<i>Burn her! Burn her! Burn her!</i>

368
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:10,559
Stay away!

369
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:25,400
- Stop!
<i>- General! General!</i>

370
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,600
Sun!

371
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,799
General, you came back just in time!

372
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:36,660
Mimi Guli brought a curse to us.

373
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,660
We have had so many people ill.

374
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,340
They are dying.

375
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,580
General, you have to uphold justice for us.

376
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,640
<i>Yes, yes! Uphold justice for us!</i>

377
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,800
<i>Uphold justice for us! Yes!</i>

378
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,020
We, Eagle Division, never kill each other!

379
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:54,079
Nothing will be a reason for us to kill each other!

380
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,670
<i>That's right.</i>

381
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,179
<i>Yes, he's right!</i>

382
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:01,840
- But General...
- I will take charge of it.

383
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,859
I'll give everybody an answer.

384
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:06,859
Everybody, go back now.

385
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08,580
<i>- Go, let's go.
- Go, go.</i>

386
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,300
<i>- Go back.
- Let's go.</i>

387
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,600
<i>Forget it.</i>

388
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:19,019
Untie her.

389
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:29,740
- Mimi. Mimi!
- Changge...

390
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:33,659
You finally came back! You finally came back!

391
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:37,279
Are you frightened? It's okay now, it's okay.

392
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,119
Don't be afraid. I'm back.

393
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:42,098
Everything will be okay. Don't cry.

394
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,799
I just checked on those clansmen who got cursed.

395
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,199
- How are they?
- It may not be a curse.

396
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:52,999
It's the plague.

397
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,479
Plague?

398
00:27:56,479 --> 00:27:58,179
Follow me.

399
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,540
Go, follow me.

400
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,999
Mimi.

401
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,359
Where did you save him?

402
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,940
I herd sheep every morning.

403
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,739
He fainted outside the sheepfold.

404
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:46,139
I...

405
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,599
Do you know where he came from?

406
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,360
Since he got infected, he couldn't have gone far.

407
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,279
Maybe he's from a tribe nearby.

408
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,760
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

409
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,459
I know you wanted to save him.

410
00:29:04,459 --> 00:29:07,079
But I think it's a little abnormal.

411
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,879
Did he say anything to you before he died?

412
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,880
No, Buzhen...

413
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,099
Buzhen? Is his name Buzhen?

414
00:29:14,099 --> 00:29:15,819
No...

415
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:18,079
I don't know his name.

416
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:20,338
I just call him this.

417
00:29:20,338 --> 00:29:22,380
But if I hadn't brought him back,

418
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,399
he would have died.

419
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,539
I know, I know.

420
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:28,160
Calm down.

421
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,620
We will be with you all the time.

422
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,139
Stay here. I'll go find Sun.

423
00:29:32,139 --> 00:29:33,919
I'll be back soon.

424
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,339
I...

425
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,240
The plague is an incurable disease on the grasslands.

426
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,318
What's the difference between it and a curse?

427
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,040
If we call it a curse,

428
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,179
people will have a glimmer of hope.

429
00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:10,559
The plague can't have no source.

430
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,900
It must be related to the boy brought back by Mimi.

431
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,439
Any information?

432
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:21,100
She calls him Buzhen.

433
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,399
I feel quite acquainted with this name.

434
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:25,279
Buzhen...

435
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,799
Did he know Mimi?

436
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:30,819
Maybe in some other relationship.

437
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:32,399
I'll go and ask her.

438
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,760
Wait.

439
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,039
Mimi won't say anything she doesn't want to say.

440
00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:43,159
Okay. I won't ask.

441
00:30:43,159 --> 00:30:44,759
I will accompany her for a while later.

442
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,079
Leave Mimi alone first.

443
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:49,319
Sun, what are you going to do about the plague?

444
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:52,639
Tonight, new tents should be built outside the campsite...

445
00:30:52,639 --> 00:30:54,159
The patients will be treated in new tents.

446
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,480
This should be done as soon as possible.

447
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,940
Mu Jin, arrange people and horses.

448
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,780
Help them transfer and move goods and materials.

449
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,478
Relatives can apply to go together.

450
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:05,140
We will cure them at any costs.

451
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:07,779
Yes.

452
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,079
Is this your routine?

453
00:31:13,819 --> 00:31:15,419
Changge.

454
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:18,159
You know in our grasslands,

455
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,140
if we encounter a snowstorm during the migration,

456
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,940
what would we do?

457
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:26,799
Unite in a concerted effort to protect women and children?

458
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,459
No.

459
00:31:28,459 --> 00:31:32,719
The old, weak, sick, and disabled would stand outside,

460
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:37,179
to fend against snowstorms for those strong warriors and women.

461
00:31:37,179 --> 00:31:39,219
And then they would die.

462
00:31:39,219 --> 00:31:41,580
But I don't want this sacrifice.

463
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,020
There's also a saying in our central plains.

464
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,860
"Do one's best and leave the rest to God."

465
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,339
But if you don't exert all your energies and try your best,

466
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:51,840
you can't leave it to God.

467
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,379
Maybe...

468
00:31:55,379 --> 00:31:57,800
Maybe we missed some other ways.

469
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,099
What way?

470
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:01,300
It's been such a long time for Mimi to look after this boy.

471
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,400
And he was the source of the plague.

472
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,879
Why didn't Mimi get infected?

473
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:29,900
You demon!

474
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,960
Give my son back!

475
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,040
- Wait!
- I'll kill you!

476
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,579
Only if you are killed, can we be saved!

477
00:32:37,579 --> 00:32:40,199
<i>And my son would be saved!</i>

478
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:42,479
Don't run!

479
00:32:56,439 --> 00:32:58,239
How could you be so silly?

480
00:32:58,239 --> 00:33:02,600
Why... Why were you protecting me? Why?

481
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,079
It's good that you are okay.

482
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,240
Mu Jin...

483
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:13,480
Sorry!

484
00:33:28,479 --> 00:33:30,460
These red spots...

485
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,699
It's all my fault.

486
00:33:33,699 --> 00:33:36,139
Mu Jin is infected now.

487
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:42,178
All these spots are the same as those on the dead.

488
00:33:42,178 --> 00:33:43,479
We can't wait anymore.

489
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,218
I'll stay with Mu Jin outside our campsite.

490
00:33:45,218 --> 00:33:46,179
No.

491
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:47,739
We have no other choice now.

492
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:49,280
Mu Jin can't be left behind.

493
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:53,798
I will treat Mu Jin. But if you got infected too, what could Eagle Division do?

494
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:59,180
Send him to my place, I'll look after him.

495
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,800
No.

496
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,560
I'll look after him.

497
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,500
All this was because of me.

498
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:14,179
And Mu Jin became like this due to my fault.

499
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,620
No, Mimi.

500
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,860
You will die if you go out now.

501
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:24,279
Even if I die, I deserve that.

502
00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:27,920
Don't worry. I'll take good care of him.

503
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,080
Taoist Sun! Master!

504
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,380
Elder Qin was so fast to bring you here.

505
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,440
You are clever to ask Elder Qin to find me.

506
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,539
What curse?

507
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:54,439
Nonsense!

508
00:34:54,439 --> 00:34:56,859
I have seen this situation so many times.

509
00:34:56,859 --> 00:34:58,599
It must be a serious plague.

510
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,939
If I were not here, how could you two deal with it?

511
00:35:03,939 --> 00:35:04,958
Yes.

512
00:35:04,959 --> 00:35:06,120
Thanks, Taoist Sun!

513
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,499
But you have to be cautious! Because many people have been infected.

514
00:35:09,499 --> 00:35:14,359
If not, why would I come?

515
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,799
Taoist Sun, let me lead you. Please follow me.

516
00:35:18,799 --> 00:35:19,799
Please, Taoist.

517
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,900
You lead the way.

518
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,499
Elder Qin, how are Shiba and Xu Feng?

519
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:27,058
Yuan is still too young, I was afraid of her getting infected.

520
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:31,919
I asked Shiba and Xu Feng to wait outside the tent of Eagle Division with Yuan.

521
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:34,518
That would be good. Then, Elder Qin, you don't have to come inside either.

522
00:35:34,518 --> 00:35:35,638
Wait for our news.

523
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,239
Okay.

524
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,420
Greetings, Father.

525
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,360
Father.

526
00:36:10,539 --> 00:36:14,339
Yan'er, it's good for you to come back!

527
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,639
It's good for you to come back!

528
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:21,259
Greetings, Father.

529
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,540
Come on.

530
00:36:31,499 --> 00:36:36,599
Yan'er, you... you are thinner than before.

531
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:41,639
It's my fault for worrying you, Father.

532
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:43,958
Father, I am thinner too.

533
00:36:43,959 --> 00:36:45,759
I nearly couldn't make my way back.

534
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,840
In Luoyang... I...

535
00:36:50,859 --> 00:36:55,238
Father, my life was so hard in Luoyang.

536
00:36:55,238 --> 00:37:00,599
Why did I hear that you had a good time in Luoyang?

537
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:04,439
Even Minister Du couldn't control you.

538
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:09,338
I know I was not right and made big trouble.

539
00:37:09,338 --> 00:37:10,999
I regret doing it too.

540
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,539
Sister has already scolded me for Father.

541
00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:15,860
Right, Sister?

542
00:37:17,479 --> 00:37:19,100
You're being polite.

543
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,320
I didn't scold you.

544
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,139
You asked for it.

545
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:29,699
Father, Sister beat me many times for this.

546
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:34,120
She held a stick like this to beat me.

547
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:39,540
I offended the crown prince.

548
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,359
I accept my punishment.

549
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:54,000
Yan'er, I think you are more and more like Changge now.

550
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,600
Father, although I am not Changge,

551
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,900
I improved a lot after this disaster.

552
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,299
Sorry, Father. I was wrong.

553
00:38:17,019 --> 00:38:21,380
Father, please forgive me for my sister's sake.

554
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:25,740
Go back to your East Palace and ponder upon your faults!

555
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,859
Okay.

556
00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:31,199
I will not disturb Father's conversation with Sister.

557
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:50,419
Yan'er, it's been

558
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,919
a hard journey for you.

559
00:38:54,919 --> 00:38:59,519
Father, I don't think it was hard for me.

560
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:04,180
And this experience is worthy of volumes of books,

561
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,740
and I'm so lucky to have it in my life.

562
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:11,400
My Yan'er is much different from the one in the past.

563
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,619
Are you hungry?

564
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:16,578
Have dinner with me, and chat while eating. Okay?

565
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,199
I'll listen to Father.

566
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:24,239
Taoist Sun, how is it?

567
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:25,699
What curse?

568
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:28,059
Nonsense!

569
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:31,100
Just the plague.

570
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:34,938
Then can it be treated?

571
00:39:34,938 --> 00:39:40,460
Only an invalid herb exists in this world, but no incurable disease.

572
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,378
So you already have a method to cure them?

573
00:39:43,378 --> 00:39:47,799
Although this is serious, we still have time.

574
00:39:47,799 --> 00:39:50,160
Give me a pen and paper.

575
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,158
<i>[Gromwell, stemmed, five qian; cicada slough; Angelica sinensis]</i>

576
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:06,059
These herbs are quite common.

577
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:10,220
Eagle Division has these, but we don't have one of them.

578
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,479
What?

579
00:40:11,479 --> 00:40:13,380
Gromwell.

580
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:19,079
Could it be substituted by others?

581
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:22,759
No. Adjuvant could be a substitute,

582
00:40:22,759 --> 00:40:26,619
but this can't be changed.

583
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,759
There's something that you don't know.

584
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,860
The plague came from the desert,

585
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:38,599
but it never came to the grassland.

586
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:43,779
That's because the locals usually eat and wear lithospermum.

587
00:40:43,779 --> 00:40:45,519
That's it!

588
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:47,478
No wonder I didn't get infected.

589
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:48,878
Every time I got a fever when I was young,

590
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:51,520
my father treated me with gromwell.

591
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,120
As far as I know, once you get this plague,

592
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,800
you won't get infected again.

593
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:01,079
So she was not just lucky,

594
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:07,079
but has immunity against it.

595
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:09,859
We can find this gromwell.

596
00:41:09,859 --> 00:41:14,780
But how can we control his state of illness now?

597
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,460
Don't worry,

598
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,599
I can give you a prescription, and let them drink it.

599
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,019
It can relieve their illness a little, and save them out of danger.

600
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:29,978
But they have to have gromwell in ten days,

601
00:41:29,978 --> 00:41:35,459
or even the immortals can not save them.

602
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,220
Gromwell is from the north of the desert,

603
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,800
I thought that you would have it.

604
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,400
Khan's Tent must have it.

605
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,078
- I'll go and ask for it.
- Wait.

606
00:41:47,078 --> 00:41:48,879
Eagle Division is quite unstable now.

607
00:41:48,879 --> 00:41:53,679
If you go now, I'm afraid that they would find ways to harm Mimi.

608
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:56,320
It would be a mess again.

609
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,538
General, I can go. I'm fast.

610
00:42:03,538 --> 00:42:05,718
Besides, I am just a nobody.

611
00:42:05,719 --> 00:42:08,560
Great Khan won't bewilder me.

612
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,619
Don't worry, General.

613
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:13,299
I promise that I'll be back with the herb safely.

614
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:14,980
Okay.

615
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,840
I've written down the moves of Dingxiang in the Central Plains.

616
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,380
Give this to Great Khan.

617
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,780
He will understand as soon as he finishes reading.

618
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,739
Yes.

619
00:42:25,739 --> 00:42:27,439
Go.
