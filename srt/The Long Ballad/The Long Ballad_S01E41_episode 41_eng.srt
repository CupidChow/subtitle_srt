21
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,720
   

22
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,280
   

23
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:52,079
Your Highness.

24
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,420
Anrou, do you think I'll be sent to the Ashile Tribe?

25
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,099
Your Highness, you're the apple of His Majesty's eye.

26
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,780
There's no way he would send you so far away from home.

27
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,298
Your Highness, we don't know anything for sure now.

28
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:12,938
Please don't worry.

29
00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:16,499
You've seen Ashile Khatun today.

30
00:02:16,499 --> 00:02:19,700
I've heard about her from the elder maids.

31
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,410
She had married into the tribe long ago.

32
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:25,079
And changed husbands, one after another.

33
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:28,720
She does seem to lead a glamorous life, but is it really so?

34
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,999
Nobody knows what she has been through.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,498
Hao Du, am I being too selfish?

36
00:02:35,498 --> 00:02:37,639
I'm only thinking for myself.

37
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,199
You Highness...

38
00:02:45,089 --> 00:02:47,090
If you want...

39
00:02:50,429 --> 00:02:51,869
I...

40
00:02:51,869 --> 00:02:53,466
Yueyan!

41
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,389
Brother Shuyu.

42
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:02,328
- Here you are. 
 - You don't have to say anything, I already know.

43
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,149
I heard what happened at Sifang Pavilion.

44
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,708
Brother Shuyu, what should I do?

45
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,210
I have no idea what to do.

46
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,839
Brother Shuyu...

47
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,650
Don't be afraid.

48
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,899
I'll go back and write to His Majesty now.

49
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,199
I'll write as many words as it takes to make His Majesty change his mind.

50
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:56,889
If it doesn't work,

51
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:58,424
I'll go and ask my father.

52
00:03:58,424 --> 00:04:00,179
I'll make him see His Majesty with me.

53
00:04:00,179 --> 00:04:02,798
- If my father is there, His Majesty— 
 - It won't work.

54
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:06,099
Now it is a critical moment of alliance making.

55
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:08,838
The Ashile Tribe knows and is taking advantage of it.

56
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:10,478
If my father takes his words back,

57
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,398
they will surely make an issue of it.

58
00:04:12,399 --> 00:04:15,118
If I disrupt the process of alliance making,

59
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:18,060
I will never be able to face the people of Great Tang.

60
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,739
But if the Great Tang princess is dead...

61
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,020
No one wants a political marriage with dead people.

62
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,458
Yueyan, don't do anything stupid.

63
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:37,840
Brother Shuyu, I'm not being stupid.

64
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,478
In the reign of Emperor Nan of Zhou,

65
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:42,920
Fan Ju faked his own death to avoid working for him.

66
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,199
Changge... she knows how to feign death.

67
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,998
I'm sure she can come up with something.

68
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,560
Without the Noble Princess Yongan,

69
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,519
I can get out of this marriage.

70
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
My father won't get into trouble either.

71
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,480
But... this is the worst move.

72
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,860
Then, what do you have in mind?

73
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,639
Wait here and do nothing?

74
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,539
There must be a way.

75
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:11,300
If the Ashile Tribe takes this to my father officially,

76
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,660
and after everything is settled,

77
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,220
I will be married into the tribe for sure.

78
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,779
There must be a way.

79
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,600
There must be something we can do.

80
00:05:26,769 --> 00:05:28,409
Brother Shuyu,

81
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,730
if I marry into the Ashile Tribe,

82
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,379
it doesn't really matter that much to you, does it?

83
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,299
Of course, it does.

84
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,129
We grew up together.

85
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,328
You're like a little sister to me.

86
00:05:44,328 --> 00:05:47,189
Like a little sister... A little sister...

87
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:58,989
Little sister?

88
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:07,690
After I made my confession to you the other day,

89
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:11,290
how can you still see me as a little sister?

90
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,310
Yueyan...

91
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,439
Please leave now.

92
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,659
Just leave me alone.

93
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,629
Wei Shuyu.

94
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,009
What are you going to do?

95
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,109
You don't know?

96
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,170
So you never thought of doing something from the beginning?

97
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:07,009
To negotiate peace with us, the Ashile Tribe is sure to demand a hostage.

98
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,449
Noble Princess Yongan is the apple of His Majesty's eye.

99
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,108
Everyone knows she will be that hostage.

100
00:07:11,108 --> 00:07:13,189
Yet you've never thought of it?

101
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:18,318
I was asking you just now, but you didn't have an answer.

102
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,239
Hao Du, you overstepped the line.

103
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,158
If you only take yourself as a courtier of His Majesty,

104
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,959
I wouldn't have asked you about it.

105
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,100
But you know it clearly.

106
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,280
She likes you.

107
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,579
She cares about how you feel and what you think.

108
00:07:33,579 --> 00:07:35,598
How can you be okay since she is sad and upset?

109
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,220
That is my business.

110
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,580
Stop it!

111
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,719
Go back, both of you.

112
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:46,000
Just leave me alone.

113
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,760
Mimi.

114
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,358
- Mimi. 
 - They are here, right?

115
00:08:14,358 --> 00:08:15,519
Yes, they are.

116
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,099
But don't worry. They won't find you.

117
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:19,399
It's okay, Changge.

118
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,158
I'm not afraid anymore. I've thought it through.

119
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:24,978
As long as I'm still breathing, it's only a matter of time before they find me.

120
00:08:24,978 --> 00:08:26,539
It's no use in running away.

121
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:29,458
We should live happily if we're not dead.

122
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,640
I don't have to hide just because she's here.

123
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,039
Dead-alive like a walking corpse.

124
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,759
According to the Eagle Division, Mu Jin has gotten into the Khan's tent.

125
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:39,839
He should be at the Dingxiang Palace by now.

126
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:41,730
Really?

127
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:45,049
No.

128
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:47,798
They already know Mu Jin has tricked them.

129
00:08:47,798 --> 00:08:51,959
If they find he is in Dingxiang, will they...

130
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,379
Mu Jin once saved a soldier in the tent.

131
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,759
They're friends, so I think he will go to find him.

132
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,619
Please, Sirius.

133
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:06,068
Bless Mu Jin and get him out of danger.

134
00:09:06,068 --> 00:09:08,529
It doesn't look good now.

135
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:10,395
Yicheng must have come prepared.

136
00:09:10,395 --> 00:09:12,830
It must be hard for Yueyan now.

137
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:44,190
Your Highness, are you disappointed that it's not Wei Shuyu who is with you now?

138
00:09:50,509 --> 00:09:52,789
I forbid you to go and find him.

139
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:58,089
Your Highness, if you really like him, I can abduct him and bring him here.

140
00:09:58,089 --> 00:09:59,508
Then you two may leave together.

141
00:09:59,508 --> 00:10:01,628
I'll take all the consequences.

142
00:10:01,629 --> 00:10:03,789
How do you plan to bear them?

143
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,590
With your position, official and personal,

144
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,969
if my father is enraged with my departure,

145
00:10:10,969 --> 00:10:13,170
how can you take it?

146
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,089
I'm a big man, who honors the deities and cares for...

147
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:21,168
families and friends.

148
00:10:21,168 --> 00:10:22,930
If Your Highness wants it,

149
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:26,029
if you see me as a friend, I can get you the money and horses.

150
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:28,050
All you have to do is leave here.

151
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,329
I won't leave.

152
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:38,369
I'm the Noble Princess Yongan.

153
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:41,829
From the moment I buried Xiao Wu,

154
00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:46,290
I'd decided to play this role with my whole heart.

155
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,450
So I can't just leave,

156
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,550
but face up to it.

157
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,968
You'll go into this marriage?

158
00:10:52,968 --> 00:10:56,490
No, I won't.

159
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,710
But I want to do this on my own.

160
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:02,069
I want to fight for myself.

161
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:09,250
Hao Du, will you be there for me?

162
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,830
Khatun.

163
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:42,390
I thought you wanted to stay far away from me.

164
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,149
Why are you here then?

165
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:48,129
Why did you come to Chang'an?

166
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,010
Are you interrogating me?

167
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,280
So what?

168
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,999
Since when are you in charge of the affairs of the tribe?

169
00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:02,990
Well, the Khatun of the Ashile Tribe

170
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,229
is only an empty title to you?

171
00:12:06,229 --> 00:12:08,648
Ashile Sun, in your eyes,

172
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:12,088
who else deserves respect besides your father?

173
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:15,909
I asked you a question first.

174
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,140
No matter what, I'm your elder.

175
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,059
It's fine that you have no respect for me,

176
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:27,519
but you don't want to embarrass your father, do you?

177
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,480
My father sent you here?

178
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,779
What do you think?

179
00:12:30,779 --> 00:12:32,199
How's he doing?

180
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:34,288
As long as you come back with the Eagle Division

181
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:36,129
and swear an oath of loyalty to the tribe,

182
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,929
your father will take you back.

183
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:41,768
The past will never be brought up.

184
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:44,129
I'm afraid this is only your idea.

185
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:45,989
Is there a difference?

186
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,888
My presence in Chang'an now is enough to prove

187
00:12:49,888 --> 00:12:52,809
that I can speak for your father.

188
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:58,290
Too bad that you're nothing to me.

189
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:04,810
Then how about Li Changge?

190
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:10,489
The well-renowned former General of the Ashile Eagle Division

191
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,970
is now willing to be a guard for Li Changge.

192
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,969
Sun, sometimes I really can't figure you out.

193
00:13:19,609 --> 00:13:22,489
What do you see in Li Changge?

194
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:27,050
How did she become a soft spot of yours?

195
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:35,549
To be invincible on the battleground,

196
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:39,610
you should not fear the attack of your enemies or fellowmen,

197
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,290
but your own weakness.

198
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:48,029
Your weakness is now exposed.

199
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:50,290
If you dare lay a finger on her,

200
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,610
I will make you die a terrible death.

201
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:11,689
Your Highness.

202
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,569
What is it?

203
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,569
Mimi Guli is still alive.

204
00:14:14,569 --> 00:14:16,970
She's one of the Mobei envoys.

205
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:21,030
Your Highness, aren't you surprised?

206
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,489
Since the first time I saw Ashile Sun here,

207
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,449
I knew Mimi Guli was not dead at all.

208
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,109
Shall we...

209
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,009
Write to Lei Meng in Dingxiang.

210
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,430
Those who should be dead are all alive.

211
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,689
Yes, Your Highness.

212
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,168
How did it go?

213
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:56,608
I looked into it as you had asked.

214
00:14:56,609 --> 00:14:57,889
The drug residues are poisonous.

215
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:01,728
They're not lethal, but will slowly get into the patients' organs,

216
00:15:01,729 --> 00:15:04,768
causing them to shut down over some time.

217
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,510
What a cruel woman.

218
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:07,929
You saved my life once before.

219
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,768
Now I've returned the favor.

220
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:11,968
I won't tell anybody you're here in Dingxiang.

221
00:15:11,969 --> 00:15:13,669
- But I hope— 
 - I understand.

222
00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:15,249
Thank you.

223
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,769
I won't trouble you anymore with this matter.

224
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,329
Uncle Lei keeps a strict daily patrol.

225
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,709
Be careful.

226
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,800
Hold on. One more thing.

227
00:15:23,849 --> 00:15:26,249
Have you ever heard of a captive named Buzhen?

228
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,648
He's a child.

229
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:29,250
A child?

230
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:32,510
There's no child in the prison.

231
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:33,929
In the Dingxiang Palace,

232
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,208
the only place where a child may live is the chamber of Prince Sui.

233
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:38,129
The chamber of Prince Sui?

234
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,049
That's all I know.

235
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:43,369
Take care.

236
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:07,730
Why did my mother want to see you?

237
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:12,449
Answer me. Why did my mother want to see you?

238
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:18,009
Out of my way.

239
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,909
Did she ask you to come back with the Eagle Division?

240
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,349
Come back?

241
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,209
The arrow she fired at my back in Mobei almost killed me.

242
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:39,290
Tell me. How's my father doing now?

243
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,589
My mother takes good care of him. No need to worry.

244
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,889
Why are you looking at me like this?

245
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,049
Do you really want to live like a fool?

246
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,208
I dare you to say it again.

247
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,109
Has it never crossed your mind

248
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:54,050
why a strong man like him suddenly fell ill

249
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,490
and moved the Khan's tent to Dingxiang?

250
00:16:57,429 --> 00:17:01,510
His illness and the power shift to Dingxiang.

251
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,969
Do you really think it was an accident?

252
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:07,768
Don't you slander my mother and me.

253
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:09,910
I'm not talking about you.

254
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:18,889
Someone like you could never have plotted it so cleverly.

255
00:17:32,069 --> 00:17:36,469
I'm sure that Yicheng is in charge of the Ashile Tribe now.

256
00:17:37,009 --> 00:17:38,308
I see.

257
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,229
So she has been setting traps for me all the time.

258
00:17:42,249 --> 00:17:43,929
And she's onto you now.

259
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:47,150
It's only a matter of time before she knows who you really are.

260
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,090
I'll roll with her punches.

261
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:51,469
I'm not afraid of her.

262
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:55,469
If only I hadn't taken you to the tribe.

263
00:17:55,469 --> 00:17:58,129
If you hadn't taken me with you back then,

264
00:17:58,129 --> 00:18:00,670
we wouldn't be so close now.

265
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,569
A distinguished general like you

266
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,290
would never have cared for a traitor of Tang like me.

267
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,729
You're here.

268
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,750
Well?

269
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,669
Aren't you glad that I've found you?

270
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,070
You really think that by feigning death,

271
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,389
you can get out of it?

272
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:42,429
You should understand that death isn't the solution.

273
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:47,310
If someone living in hell seeks death as a relief,

274
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,949
then the other child who's still alive...

275
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:55,790
will take her place in hell.

276
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,528
I'd really hate to do that.

277
00:19:00,529 --> 00:19:02,610
What did you do to Buzhen?

278
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:15,870
How could you?

279
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:18,689
How could you do it?

280
00:19:18,689 --> 00:19:20,880
He's a child! He's still a child!

281
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,118
How could you do this to him?

282
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,980
Why?

283
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:26,380
Because you betrayed me.

284
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,378
I would never have done it if you had been obedient.

285
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,540
But you betrayed me.

286
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:34,999
I only cut off one finger of his.

287
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:40,500
Doesn't that impress you as being merciful?

288
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:48,459
Buzhen...

289
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,240
Mimi.

290
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,480
Mimi?

291
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,430
Mimi!

292
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,829
- Mimi? 
 - What's wrong?

293
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:16,648
Sun, I can't find Mimi.

294
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,128
Yicheng intimidated her.

295
00:20:18,129 --> 00:20:19,869
I'm worried that she...

296
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:23,489
Calm down. Let's split up.

297
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:24,849
I'm sure we'll find her.

298
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,150
Okay.

299
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,730
Mimi?

300
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,150
   

301
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:32,620
Father!

302
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:40,218
Father, are you going to see His Majesty and discuss the princess' marriage?

303
00:20:40,218 --> 00:20:43,449
Could you please persuade His Majesty so the princess...

304
00:20:43,449 --> 00:20:46,149
Shuyu, let me ask you.

305
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:48,368
You and the princess grew up together.

306
00:20:48,368 --> 00:20:51,689
Do you like her?

307
00:20:51,689 --> 00:20:53,008
Father, I...

308
00:20:53,008 --> 00:20:56,628
The marriage of Noble Princess Yongan is a state affair.

309
00:20:56,629 --> 00:21:01,690
You're in no place to ask His Majesty to change his mind, understand?

310
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:13,090
If you really like her,

311
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,490
you need to fight for her by yourself.

312
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,579
And only one title can save her.

313
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,240
The Consort Prince.

314
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,838
You're no longer a little boy.

315
00:21:25,838 --> 00:21:29,459
If you want something, think it through

316
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:31,899
and fight for it.

317
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,500
Buzhen...

318
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,980
It's all my fault...

319
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,119
I should have been there for you.

320
00:22:12,019 --> 00:22:14,419
Please take care of yourself...

321
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:17,940
and wait for me.

322
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:21,219
I'm so sorry...

323
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,280
If you want to see your brother,

324
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,840
do as I say.

325
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,959
Her Highness wants you to do something for her.

326
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:47,140
If you fail her,

327
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,399
your brother will lose more than one finger.

328
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,480
Mimi?

329
00:23:29,059 --> 00:23:31,000
Mimi, it's really you.

330
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Ashile Sun feigned death.

331
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,560
So I knew you were still alive.

332
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,218
Please excuse me.

333
00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:38,179
Are you so reluctant to see me?

334
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:39,538
You're the Young Khan.

335
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,418
Why waste your time on a slave like me?

336
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,899
I've never considered you as a slave.

337
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:46,739
Mimi, would you come back with me?

338
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,020
I promise I'll treat you well.

339
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,680
Mimi, believe me.

340
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,299
My marriage with the Princess of Great Tang is nothing but...

341
00:23:55,319 --> 00:23:58,338
I promise you I will never ever fall in love with her.

342
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:00,760
Why are you telling this to me, a slave?

343
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,058
Why shouldn't I tell you?

344
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:04,159
I'm also telling you that I...

345
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,219
I like you.

346
00:24:18,199 --> 00:24:21,379
When we were young, and you were riding by my side,

347
00:24:21,379 --> 00:24:23,760
I was always amazed by how beautiful your hair was.

348
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,179
They looked like the Tang silk in the wind.

349
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:30,939
You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.

350
00:24:30,939 --> 00:24:33,079
And the best one.

351
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:35,399
When I played with you,

352
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:37,379
were you happy?

353
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:40,059
Of course. I was always happy with you.

354
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:42,880
That was because I didn't dare to make you unhappy.

355
00:24:43,719 --> 00:24:46,339
Because if you were upset,

356
00:24:46,339 --> 00:24:50,040
Buzhen and I would be punished in a cruel way.

357
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,559
In fact, every time I saw you,

358
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,039
I would get so scared.

359
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:56,159
I would even resent you.

360
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,058
Why did you save us?

361
00:24:58,059 --> 00:25:00,800
I would rather die than suffer like this.

362
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,419
I am a human being,

363
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:07,259
not some toy without feelings.

364
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:10,259
I don't want to tread on thin ice every day to please others.

365
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,060
I hate it if I slip even a bit,

366
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,599
I would be abused, starved, and scolded.

367
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,020
Do you understand this feeling?

368
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,920
No, you don't.

369
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:31,639
That's why it's impossible for me to go back with you.

370
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,080
Mimi.

371
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,700
Mimi, where have you been? I've been looking for you.

372
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,539
I... I'm fine.

373
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:07,719
I just took a walk around.

374
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,660
Relax, for we're here for you.

375
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:17,298
Changge, the Young Khan marrying the princess is a strategy.

376
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:20,818
If the princess really marries him, she will suffer in the future.

377
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:21,979
Don't worry.

378
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,920
I won't let Yueyan be married into the Ashile Tribe.

379
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,720
Okay.

380
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,340
Changge.

381
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:45,339
Shuyu, shouldn't you be at the Taiji Palace now

382
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:47,139
discussing the princess' marriage?

383
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,319
Why are you here?

384
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,460
Shuyu?

385
00:27:01,939 --> 00:27:04,139
I want to stop the marriage,

386
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,218
but I'm in no place to do it.

387
00:27:07,219 --> 00:27:09,419
You'll be doing it for Yueyan's happiness,

388
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,698
which puts you in a good place already.

389
00:27:11,699 --> 00:27:13,619
What is holding you back?

390
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:19,379
My father said if I did it as the consort prince, it might work.

391
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,780
Understandable.

392
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,380
Given that you and Yueyan have grown up together,

393
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,740
it's no wonder he would suggest so.

394
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,580
And Yueyan would be happy, too.

395
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,039
You know that she always—

396
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:32,039
I know.

397
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,779
She confessed her feelings to me.

398
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,319
Then, what are you waiting for?

399
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:38,860
It is the best way to stop the marriage now.

400
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,079
Shuyu, you and I—

401
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,879
I know.

402
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:58,100
I respect your decision

403
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:00,999
and I don't want to hurt her.

404
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:03,139
I don't want to let her down

405
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,619
or let her marry into the Ashile Tribe.

406
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:08,920
However, I also know that asking her to marry me

407
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,219
will be like putting her through another misery.

408
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:18,499
She's no more to me than a little sister.

409
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:21,219
I see.

410
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,499
Such being the case,

411
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,381
I believe Yueyan would not accept a marriage without love.

412
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,298
All we can do now is to wait and see.

413
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:31,480
We'll see what their next move is,

414
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,720
and roll with the punches.

415
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,760
Changge... since the incident at the East Palace,

416
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,379
I feel you and Li Yueyan have become more estranged from me.

417
00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:45,539
I feel like I can't catch up with you.

418
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:48,479
When you said those words just now,

419
00:28:48,479 --> 00:28:50,940
you have become different.

420
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,359
Sometimes the hardest thing to do is to face yourself.

421
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,479
And you've done it.

422
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,800
Actually, this is not as bad as you think.

423
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,820
We are not the only ones who want to stop this marriage.

424
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,339
You mean His Majesty?

425
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:17,100
He is the Emperor of Great Tang, but he is also a father.

426
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,979
There's no way he would want to ruin Yueyan's happiness.

427
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,480
However... he's probably waiting for the right time.

428
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,620
What right time?

429
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:28,780
It depends on the situation.

430
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:32,479
I'm not sure now.

431
00:29:40,699 --> 00:29:44,619
Your Majesty, we can't go back on our words on the marriage.

432
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,000
We've agreed on it.

433
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,479
If we break the promise, the Ashile Tribe may falsely accuse us of

434
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:51,640
of being capricious and dishonest.

435
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,760
That will compromise other tribes' trust in us.

436
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,439
Assistant Minister Wang, you're not seeing the big picture.

437
00:30:00,439 --> 00:30:03,079
Noble Princess Yongan is the daughter of His Majesty,

438
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:05,178
not a regular noble lady.

439
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:06,520
Such being the fact,

440
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,620
what if the Ashile Tribe takes advantage of it in the future?

441
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,659
Your Majesty, this marriage is indeed intractable,

442
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,439
but it's a future problem.

443
00:30:18,439 --> 00:30:20,439
Right now, acting on this agreement

444
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:24,000
is the only effective way to win the trust of the other tribes.

445
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:29,379
Your Majesty, I agree.

446
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:32,319
If the misgivings about this marriage

447
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:34,458
prevent us from keeping our promise,

448
00:30:34,459 --> 00:30:37,739
the Ashile Tribe will not let go of it.

449
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:42,759
And the peace negotiations with the other tribes will fall apart.

450
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:47,220
Your Majesty, I think it's imperative that we agree to this marriage.

451
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:52,218
If this marriage is happening, it can't be with the Ashile Tribe.

452
00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:54,139
Right, if we agree to it,

453
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,860
the Ashile Tribe will certainly ask more from us.

454
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,178
Your Majesty, the Ashile Tribe is clearly

455
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:03,059
provoking us with marriage.

456
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:04,899
If we don't keep our original promise,

457
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,199
how can we win the trust and respect of the other tribes?

458
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:15,938
Your Majesty, I think this marriage will be a noble deed.

459
00:31:15,939 --> 00:31:19,419
The princess will be doing so for the people and the country.

460
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,359
If the Ashile Tribe rebels against us in the future,

461
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:26,840
and uses this marriage against us,

462
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,210
we can always get her back then.

463
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,299
You're all well-learned scholars,

464
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:40,280
but your knowledge doesn't seem to serve you well.

465
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,540
The only thing you've learned is how to accept others' requests.

466
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:49,119
Your Majesty!

467
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:50,979
Please forgive me.

468
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,880
I tried to stop the princess but failed.

469
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,700
Your Majesty.

470
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,599
 - Why is the princess here? 
 - This is ridiculous. 

471
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:18,839
Your Majesty,

472
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:23,959
the princess claimed I've learned nothing in front of everyone.

473
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:27,739
However, to discuss her own marriage on the court,

474
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:31,099
the princess is interfering in politics and being impertinent.

475
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,338
This really makes no sense.

476
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:37,938
Noble Princess Yongan is entitled by His Majesty's father.

477
00:32:37,939 --> 00:32:40,959
She wants to discuss the marriage of the Princess of our state.

478
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,339
How's that impertinent?

479
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:55,539
Assistant Minister Chen of the Ministry of Rites?

480
00:32:55,539 --> 00:32:59,080
My marriage is a national affair now.

481
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,698
As a subject of His Majesty,

482
00:33:01,699 --> 00:33:04,519
I should express my opinion in an honest manner.

483
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:07,019
Your Majesty, I have something to say.

484
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,080
I'm listening.

485
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,179
I also beg Your Majesty's pardon for my transgression.

486
00:33:22,339 --> 00:33:25,218
I'm the daughter of Your Majesty,

487
00:33:25,219 --> 00:33:29,980
but I'm no more different than other women of the Great Tang state.

488
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,979
The purpose of our life

489
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:36,180
lies with our fathers, our emperor, and the righteous cause.

490
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,818
But there's much more to our life other than these.

491
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:41,178
Families are the foundation of a country.

492
00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:45,019
Our country is prosperous because the people are well protected.

493
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,938
If we keep this prosperity by compromising with the enemy,

494
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:51,538
then how can we run our country?

495
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:52,859
How can our people lead a good life?

496
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,279
 The princess makes a good point. 

497
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:55,578
 No, she doesn't. 

498
00:33:55,579 --> 00:33:57,139
 That's nonsense. 

499
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:59,298
 It's clear that she doesn't want to get into the marriage. 

500
00:33:59,299 --> 00:34:00,599
 That's true. 

501
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:05,319
Your Majesty, Noble Princess Yongan resents this marriage.

502
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:08,818
There's no need to sugarcoat it.

503
00:34:08,819 --> 00:34:12,300
The incumbent Khatun of the Ashile Tribe

504
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,640
is Princess Yicheng of the Sui Dynasty.

505
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:21,079
Princess Yicheng's decision back then was admirable.

506
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:25,839
Is it that our princess cannot compare to that of the Sui Dynasty?

507
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,379
You're very straightforward.

508
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,260
I'm impressed.

509
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:35,880
But what you just said is an insult to all the men of our country.

510
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,478
 - What... 
 - That's nonsense. 

511
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:41,759
Please be careful with your words.

512
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:53,939
Do you have any idea how Princess Yicheng got where she is today?

513
00:34:53,939 --> 00:34:55,459
She's a princess of the former dynasty,

514
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,498
living her life as a nobody in a strange place.

515
00:34:58,499 --> 00:35:00,880
She has no dignity or whatsoever.

516
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,419
The Sui Dynasty is weak.

517
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:07,260
They feared the Ashile Tribe, so a woman had to make such a sacrifice.

518
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,018
There are so many heroes in our country.

519
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:11,600
They won't be intimidated by strong enemies.

520
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,258
If we can't even protect our own people,

521
00:35:15,259 --> 00:35:19,578
how can we persuade the other tribes that we can protect them?

522
00:35:19,579 --> 00:35:20,920
 That's true. 

523
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,300
 Good point. 

524
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,320
Her Highness is right.

525
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,819
Minister Du.

526
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:46,800
Have a seat.

527
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,959
Thanks, Your Majesty.

528
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,960
Your Majesty, I think what the princess just said

529
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,279
was a mere excuse to get out of this marriage.

530
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,778
Minister Du, what do you think?

531
00:36:08,779 --> 00:36:11,219
As a young lady,

532
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:15,619
the princess has the courage to stand up to the strong enemy.

533
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:20,260
I'm very impressed by what she just said.

534
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,960
Good.

535
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,540
If the Ashile Tribe asks so,

536
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:35,020
we will give our princess to them.

537
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,660
This is no different than surrendering.

538
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,239
Your Majesty is indeed wise.

539
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:43,420
We should choose the lesser of two evils.

540
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:49,659
As far as I'm concerned, the Ashile Tribe having our princess by mere verbal threat

541
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,000
is the greater evil.

542
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,018
The Ashile Tribe accusing us of being cheaters

543
00:36:55,019 --> 00:36:58,400
is the lesser evil we can manage.

544
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:05,430
We will never seek momentary peace

545
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:08,020
by sacrificing a woman.

546
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,859
I'm not saying this because Princess Yongan is my daughter.

547
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,799
All the women out there are the subjects of Great Tang.

548
00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:21,920
I will never ever sacrifice any one of them.

549
00:37:22,799 --> 00:37:28,419
Yongan, come with me to the Sifang Pavilion in three days.

550
00:37:28,419 --> 00:37:32,539
If the Ashile Tribe brings this up then,

551
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:38,640
tell them yourself that the agreement doesn't stand anymore.

552
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,160
 His Majesty is coming! 

553
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,690
   

554
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,890
   

555
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:12,338
Envoys, you have come from afar for the peace alliance with us.

556
00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:15,700
I'd like to extend my gratitude to all of you.

557
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:32,499
Your Majesty of Great Tang,

558
00:39:32,499 --> 00:39:34,859
Yanli Khan is under the weather now.

559
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:37,920
So he sent me here to ask you

560
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,480
if we can reach an agreement on the marriage of my son and the princess.

561
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,960
Then we can talk about other things.

562
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:55,419
Seems the identity of the emperor of Great Tang means nothing to her.

563
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:04,479
Since Khan is concerned about this marriage despite his illness,

564
00:40:04,979 --> 00:40:08,819
I'll give him an answer here and now.

565
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,980
Tell Khatun my decision.

566
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,678
I appreciate Great Khan, Khatun, and Young Khan for picking me.

567
00:40:35,678 --> 00:40:39,039
But I'm not good enough for Young Khan.

568
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:41,260
I'm very sorry.

569
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,359
 What's going on? 

570
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:53,179
Princess, are you declining our proposal?

571
00:40:53,179 --> 00:40:55,440
Khatun, you're an extraordinary woman.

572
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,459
I can never compare to you.

573
00:40:59,459 --> 00:41:02,799
I really regret to disappoint you.

574
00:41:03,539 --> 00:41:08,360
Your Majesty of Great Tang, are you going to break our previous agreement

575
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:12,460
because you're allied with other tribes?

576
00:41:14,109 --> 00:41:17,710
The future is full of uncertainties.

577
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:21,939
Could it be possible that you'll do the same to them?

578
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,200
 That's true. 

579
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,478
 What if they do the same to us? 

580
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:26,979
 What should we do then? 

581
00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:29,320
 They should keep their words. 

582
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:35,028
You had already agreed to this marriage

583
00:41:35,028 --> 00:41:37,670
as an offer of friendship with our tribe.

584
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:40,169
Now you're going to walk away from your promise.

585
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:44,590
Should anything unpleasant happen in the future, you can't blame us.

586
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:55,099
Why is everybody so hesitant?

587
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:58,179
You've come here from afar for the peace alliance.

588
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,498
It means you're willing to coexist in harmony with Great Tang.

589
00:42:00,499 --> 00:42:02,600
In other words,

590
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:07,419
everyone present has the chance to become the consort prince.

591
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,058
 - The consort prince? 
 - What does that mean? 

592
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,980
I can be the consort prince, too?

593
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,139
What do you mean?

594
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,459
Young Khan, you said that the marriage will be a token of friendship.

595
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,960
Everybody here wants to develop a friendship with Great Tang.

596
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,859
Such being the case, the able man shall win.

597
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:25,538
Your Majesty of Great Tang, how about holding a contest?

598
00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:28,579
It will be fair to all of us.

599
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:33,079
Good idea.

600
00:42:33,779 --> 00:42:36,939
Only the winner shall have Noble Princess Yongan.

601
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,840
Young Khan, do you dare to accept the challenge?

602
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:47,019
Well, Young Khan, are you scared?

603
00:42:47,019 --> 00:42:50,079
That's nonsense. Why should I be scared?

604
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:55,078
Good. Young Khan is truly a hero.

605
00:42:55,078 --> 00:42:56,680
Such being the case,

606
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,678
we'll hold a contest here tomorrow.

607
00:42:59,678 --> 00:43:04,659
No matter where you are from, you can sign up for it.

608
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:10,379
The final winner shall deserve my Princess Yongan.

609
