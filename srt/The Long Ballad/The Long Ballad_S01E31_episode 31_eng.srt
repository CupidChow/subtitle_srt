00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,999
♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,959
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,030
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,869
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,050
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,820
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,690
♫   Tears and regrets go hand in hand   ♫

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,590
♫  But my heart is still fiery-hot  ♫

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,740
♫  To the distance  ♫

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,610
♫  The miserable past is like a dagger  ♫

11
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:43,620
♫  Though my wings are broken  ♫

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,140
♫  I will keep flying  ♫

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,199
♫  Following the direction of the light  ♫

14
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:58,459
♫  I'll forget you  ♫

15
00:00:58,459 --> 00:01:03,680
♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,359
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,309
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,370
♫  The river of life is under my feet  ♫

19
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,960
♫  I don't regret my craziness  ♫

20
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,370
   

21
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:36,300
   

22
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,519
Keep guard.  Report to me if anything is wrong.

23
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:47,139
Yes, Sir.

24
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,560
Who are you?

25
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,880
Who are those people?

26
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,439
How dare you! People with no duty can't enter the Ziwei Palace.

27
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,639
So... they are the people on duty?

28
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,639
You asked for it!

29
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,298
Say it! Who are you?

30
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:23,800
Why are you pretending to be a guard at Ziwei Palace?

31
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:32,379
There're so many men of sacrifice in Luoyang.

32
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:34,620
Since you're not afraid of death,

33
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,880
who're you working for?

34
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:39,039
Since you want to commit suicide,

35
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:43,379
it means you know you'll suffer under our torture.

36
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:44,920
Think about it.

37
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,260
Just tell us who you're working for.

38
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,199
They've put out the fire.

39
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,879
It seems we don't need to be here anymore.

40
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,719
Take this guy away.

41
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,138
As for your old friend,

42
00:02:56,138 --> 00:02:59,340
it's a bad choice to look for your friend now.

43
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,138
Madam! Bad news, Madam!

44
00:03:17,138 --> 00:03:19,660
Something's wrong! Madam!

45
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,179
- Why're you so anxious? 
 - Bad news, Madam.

46
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:25,958
It was reported that there was something wrong at Ziwei Palace.

47
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,679
I heard that someone saw our master.

48
00:03:28,679 --> 00:03:31,340
What happened at Ziwei Palace?

49
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,860
I heard there was a fire.

50
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,579
I shall leave now, Madam.

51
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,940
   

52
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,979
Princess. Father.

53
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,138
Someone poured kerosene outside Ziwei Palace.

54
00:03:52,138 --> 00:03:54,620
I'm afraid someone did it on purpose.

55
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,860
Who wants to kill my brother?

56
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,000
Who was the last one to see His Highness?

57
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:08,700
You only need to tell us the situation when you last saw His Highness.

58
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,699
As long as you can tell us clearly,

59
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:13,459
you'll atone for your fault.

60
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:17,559
Princess. Minister.

61
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:19,739
Although I didn't see His Highness,

62
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,619
I saw a group of people dressed like refugees break into his room.

63
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:25,599
Some assassins have broken into Ziwei Palace?

64
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,059
Did you see their faces clearly?

65
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,659
Minister, there was smoke everywhere.

66
00:04:31,659 --> 00:04:35,439
And I stood far from them, so I didn't see clearly.

67
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,178
Minister. I saw a girl dressed like a Taoist nun.

68
00:04:45,178 --> 00:04:47,420
She ran out of Your Highness's room.

69
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm not familiar with her, so I remember her face.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,979
Would she be the accomplice of those assassins?

71
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:55,758
Did you see the girl's face clearly?

72
00:04:55,758 --> 00:04:56,958
She's pretty.

73
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,600
There was a mole under her eye.

74
00:05:10,599 --> 00:05:12,940
Could it be her?

75
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,519
God damn it.

76
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,560
Minister Du!

77
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,899
Minister Du, listen to me.

78
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:25,499
Minster Du!

79
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:28,560
- Father!  Father! 
 - Minister!

80
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,780
Why are you still standing by? Prepare a carriage to Liuyun Temple!

81
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,499
 Yes, Sir! 

82
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,758
Now, we haven't found my brother.

83
00:05:42,758 --> 00:05:44,920
I hope nothing will happen to Changge.

84
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,138
I'll inform Changge.

85
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,399
No.

86
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,720
If you meet Hao Du, you...

87
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,719
Brother Shuyu, I didn't mean that.

88
00:05:52,719 --> 00:05:55,680
I mean, if you meet Hao Du and Du Ruhui,

89
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,200
they won't listen to you.

90
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,640
You can stay here.

91
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,779
If they have a confrontation with Changge in Liuyun Temple,

92
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:04,179
they won't suspect you and you can continue to support her.

93
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:05,520
Okay.

94
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,039
I'll prepare food and a token to leave the city.

95
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:10,278
- Be careful. 
 - Okay.

96
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,358
Help! A'Li!

97
00:06:17,358 --> 00:06:18,639
Miss Quan, help! A'Li, help!

98
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,699
Taoist!

99
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:21,500
Taoist, help!

100
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,179
Be careful.

101
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,779
Help Minister Du in.

102
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,059
Taoist Sun is in the room.

103
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:46,460
Okay.

104
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:52,400
Catch her.

105
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,060
Yes, Sir.

106
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:24,899
Sir!

107
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,080
If you want to see a doctor,

108
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,179
I'm afraid you are heading in the wrong direction.

109
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:36,180
I heard Liuyun Temple harbors refugees and does good deeds.

110
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,359
Since I'm here now,

111
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:39,499
of course I need to walk around,

112
00:07:39,499 --> 00:07:41,900
so that I'll praise your kindness in the future.

113
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,500
Thank you.

114
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,559
But we have both external and internal beauty.

115
00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:50,979
These good things mean nothing to us.

116
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,340
What?

117
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,139
It seems you don't want to just walk around.

118
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,459
You want to fight with me?

119
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:03,439
I have important business.

120
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,840
Please do me this favor.

121
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,700
I'll do you a favor.

122
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,499
Do you a favor, it means do myself a favor.

123
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:12,839
Now it's late at night,

124
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,959
I don't want to fight with you.

125
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,380
Please step aside.

126
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,500
I've stepped aside.

127
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,459
Whether you can pass here,

128
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,960
it depends on whether you have the ability.

129
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,319
What?

130
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,680
You don't want to walk around now?

131
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,980
Where are you going?

132
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,900
You tried to stop me,

133
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,039
so I should behave well.

134
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,760
Or to say,

135
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,259
you want to stop me after I leave Liuyun Temple?

136
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,640
Where did I get this apprentice from?

137
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,478
Someone in the martial world is looking for her,

138
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:10,559
while someone from the imperial court is also looking for her.

139
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:13,819
She's really somebody.

140
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,019
Princess?

141
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:36,019
Why are you here alone?

142
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:37,798
I worried about Minister Du,

143
00:09:37,798 --> 00:09:39,319
so I came here to see him.

144
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:42,379
But I got lost somehow.

145
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:43,720
How's Minister Du now?

146
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,840
Take me to see him.

147
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,499
Did you see anyone suspicious?

148
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:54,120
Suspicious?

149
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,700
No.

150
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:58,139
I'm here alone.

151
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,940
Hao Du, it's getting dark.

152
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,840
I'm a little afraid.

153
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,559
Let's go back now.

154
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,259
Okay.

155
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:22,440
I'll send you to Liuyun Temple first.

156
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,059
This way, Princess.

157
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,379
- Father. 
 - Minister Du.

158
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:19,720
Don't bother us.

159
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:36,759
You two, check around to see if there's anyone suspicious.

160
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,919
 Changge. 

161
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:48,719
 - Yueyan? 
 - Why are you here? 

162
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:51,658
  Changge, Minister Du found out that you had appeared at Ziwei Palace. 

163
00:11:51,658 --> 00:11:53,458
 He doubts if you're related to this. 

164
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,979
 But now he has an acute disease and was sent to Liuyun Temple. 

165
00:11:55,979 --> 00:11:57,778
 I'm afraid you'll meet, so I'm here to find you. 

166
00:11:57,778 --> 00:11:59,138
 Leave this place. 

167
00:11:59,138 --> 00:12:02,079
 If I leave now, I'll never have a chance to explain. 

168
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,339
 Where's the crown prince? 

169
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:05,139
 We haven't found him yet. 

170
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:06,839
 But you must be safe now. 

171
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:08,759
 Changge, if you're still alive, 

172
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:11,520
 I'm sure you'll have the chance to explain. 

173
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,979
 Someone is chasing you? 

174
00:12:13,979 --> 00:12:15,780
 It's Hao Du. 

175
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,359
 - I'll stop him. Just leave. 
 - What about you? 

176
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:22,199
 Relax. Minister Du won't harm me. 

177
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,219
 Trust me. 

178
00:12:24,219 --> 00:12:26,519
 Be careful. 

179
00:12:36,019 --> 00:12:38,278
- Go. 
 - Yes, Sir.

180
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,519
You...

181
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,459
Why are you back?

182
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,959
How did you know?

183
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:24,018
My apprentice, I've settled many troubles for you.

184
00:13:24,018 --> 00:13:25,840
But they're from the imperial court.

185
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,839
I don't want to piss them off, so I can only wait here.

186
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:31,399
But if they leave,

187
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:34,600
I have no reason to stop them.

188
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,440
Thanks.

189
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:38,819
Who are you?

190
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:42,220
- How do you— 
 - Did Du Ruhui leave?

191
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,500
I think he's gone.

192
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,438
But I heard, because that guard didn't catch you,

193
00:13:46,438 --> 00:13:48,179
he spit out more blood.

194
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:51,799
Taoist Sun was so anxious that he almost fainted.

195
00:13:54,099 --> 00:13:59,799
Apprentice. What if those soldiers come to catch you again?

196
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:03,399
They won't. They wouldn't expect me to come back again.

197
00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:13,200
My apprentice is so interesting.

198
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:31,858
- Wife, you've worked hard. 
 - Be careful, Madam. 
 - I know you too well.

199
00:14:31,858 --> 00:14:34,779
Here, be careful. This way.

200
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:36,579
Have a seat.

201
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:38,799
Did he confess?

202
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:40,358
Yes, he did.

203
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:42,999
He is a soldier of Sui.

204
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:45,459
He canceled his registration.

205
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:50,199
He created a new identity and sneaked into Ziwei Palace.

206
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:52,579
Who did they work for?

207
00:14:52,579 --> 00:14:55,139
And where did they take the crown prince to?

208
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,320
He is an abandoned soldier.

209
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,159
He doesn't even know who his leader is.

210
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:06,479
But it must be related to Sui.

211
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:08,919
People of Sui?

212
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:11,400
You mean...

213
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,220
They work for Dingxiang.

214
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,939
Dingxiang.

215
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:19,159
Madam, you helped us a lot.

216
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:21,419
I really admire you.

217
00:15:21,419 --> 00:15:24,898
Where's he? Take me to see him.

218
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:29,940
Young Master Qin, we'd better not engage in the thing my wife settled.

219
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,418
We've been working all night. What about having breakfast together?

220
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:36,080
This way.

221
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,900
Father, Taoist Sun said you need to have medicine according to time.

222
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:18,200
You're still thinking about Li Changge?

223
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,619
Li Changge didn't die.

224
00:16:21,619 --> 00:16:24,699
 I saw her with my own eyes. 

225
00:16:24,699 --> 00:16:26,999
I don't know whether it's good or not.

226
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,819
She is living in Liuyun Temple now.

227
00:16:29,819 --> 00:16:34,799
If Master and Taoist Sun want to protect her,

228
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:37,258
we can't just take her away.

229
00:16:37,258 --> 00:16:43,019
But we don't know whether Li Changge took the crown prince away.

230
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,159
What if...

231
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:50,719
In my opinion, if Li Changge really took him away,

232
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:53,099
we don't need to worry about him now.

233
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:54,999
Even if we went through so many things,

234
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,380
Li Changge still remains in a good relationship with Princess.

235
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,159
She won't harm the crown prince

236
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:02,500
and let Princess experience the same pain she had before.

237
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,330
You're right.

238
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:11,318
But we can't let Li Changge use him as a hostage.

239
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:15,219
We can't block the news that the crown prince disappeared for long.

240
00:17:15,219 --> 00:17:20,320
We should catch Li Changge and find His Highness.

241
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,279
There're many people in Luoyang.

242
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:25,178
It's hard to catch Li Changge, and...

243
00:17:25,178 --> 00:17:31,240
And Princess Yongan is trying to stop you and protect her.

244
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,119
Right?

245
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,880
Princess.

246
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,278
Now His Highness is missing.

247
00:18:27,278 --> 00:18:29,360
There'll be chaos in Luoyang.

248
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,979
Please don't wander outside, Princess,

249
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:34,800
in case you disappear as well.

250
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,800
Don't worry.

251
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,539
Now my brother is missing.

252
00:18:38,539 --> 00:18:40,500
I won't cause you any trouble.

253
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,558
Now the rumors have turned into reality.

254
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:44,919
No one knows what will happen.

255
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:46,619
I'll deploy forces now.

256
00:18:46,619 --> 00:18:48,819
I can't take care of you.

257
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:51,819
Please don't seek trouble for yourself.

258
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:54,659
Didn't you ask all the guards to look for my brother?

259
00:18:54,659 --> 00:18:57,340
Why do you still deploy forces?

260
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:02,000
Are you looking for someone, or are you catching someone?

261
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:10,739
Hao Du, the most important thing is to find my brother.

262
00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:14,520
As for catching someone, I think you can put it off.

263
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,720
How do you know the disappearance of His Highness is none of her business?

264
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,359
Someone did this on purpose in Luoyang.

265
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,459
Who will benefit most from this?

266
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:26,620
It must be those who want to cause trouble in Great Tang.

267
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,680
Okay. Then let's be straightforward.

268
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,979
What are you doubting?

269
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:36,219
Li Changge is in Luoyang.

270
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:42,259
Yes.

271
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,320
Thank you for not lying to me.

272
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,598
My father saw her.

273
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,260
But I can prove she's innocent.

274
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,219
It is none of her business, because—

275
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:53,719
I don't care what she said and did in front of you.

276
00:19:53,719 --> 00:19:56,660
It may be part of her plan.

277
00:19:57,479 --> 00:20:01,360
So please stay here, Princess.

278
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,620
Don't get involved in it.

279
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,198
Young man, what are you thinking?

280
00:20:38,198 --> 00:20:41,859
I've made this move for a long time. It's your turn now.

281
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:44,189
I thought you got a message from that man

282
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:46,750
and wanted to investigate the fire in Ziwei Palace with me.

283
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,060
What are you thinking?

284
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,989
I don't even know where you come from.

285
00:20:50,989 --> 00:20:52,679
How could I investigate a serious matter with you?

286
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,260
Then, why do you take me to play chess here?

287
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,039
This place is good.

288
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,239
It's bustling.

289
00:20:59,239 --> 00:21:03,639
We need to be calm and focus when playing chess.

290
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:06,759
Only in busy places can we exercise ourselves.

291
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:08,380
I have something to do now.

292
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:10,260
Goodbye.

293
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,840
You've come home with me.

294
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,579
Now you want to leave?

295
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:18,219
I think it's not suitable.

296
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:20,359
Besides, by following me,

297
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:24,980
you just want to know my relationship with people in Ziwei Palace. Right?

298
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,800
You want to look for your old friend, right?

299
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,199
Come back. Have a game of chess.

300
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:33,099
As an old saying goes, watching chess is like watching people.

301
00:21:33,099 --> 00:21:35,118
After you've played chess with me,

302
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,480
I can nearly know your characteristics.

303
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,859
Maybe at that time, I can do serious business with you.

304
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:48,719
I don't know how to play chess.

305
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:52,438
You have a lot of calluses on your hands.

306
00:21:52,438 --> 00:21:55,419
It means you have fought in wars for many years.

307
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:57,360
Playing chess is like leading a troop.

308
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,500
I've told you the rules.

309
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,299
Since you know how to battle, you must know how to play chess.

310
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:05,458
Come on. This doesn't count.

311
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:07,660
Let's start again.

312
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:13,039
Okay.

313
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,860
Princess, I'm still afraid.

314
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,259
Don't be afraid.

315
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:18,138
Just do as I say.

316
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:20,019
They wouldn't dare to harm you.

317
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:23,439
If they want to break in, just scold them.

318
00:22:23,439 --> 00:22:27,059
You can say, you've been worried and caught a cold.

319
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:29,480
Now you're sweaty and only wearing underwear.

320
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,880
They won't come in.

321
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,680
But do remember, cover your face.

322
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:37,199
Just keep pretending until I'm back. Understand?

323
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,860
Princess!

324
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,660
 Miss Quan! 

325
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:55,420
I'm sorry. Liuyun Temple is closed and won't receive guests today.

326
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,580
Miss Quan.

327
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,620
Princess.

328
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,779
Chang... Where's A'Li?

329
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:01,620
Why are you looking for A'Li?

330
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,439
I have a serious matter to talk about with her.

331
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:05,160
Where's A'Li now?

332
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,860
A'Li... She's not in the temple now.

333
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:15,296
   

334
00:23:17,728 --> 00:23:19,540
   

335
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:24,139
Miss Quan, if A'Li comes back, please give this letter to her in person.

336
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:28,238
Tell her I'll wait for her until dawn. Please.

337
00:23:28,238 --> 00:23:30,019
Okay.

338
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:50,979
Leave.

339
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,199
Any news?

340
00:23:55,199 --> 00:24:00,540
Just as you predicted, Princess Yongan fell into a trap.

341
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,779
You don't need to look after me.

342
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:07,739
Just go. Find the crown prince.

343
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:10,719
Yes, Sir.

344
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:45,619
Playing chess is like leading a troop.

345
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:50,678
Among the generals I know, only one person who would deploy troops like this.

346
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:55,259
Governor of Shuo State, Gongsun Heng.

347
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:56,339
But it's a pity.

348
00:24:56,339 --> 00:25:01,860
I heard Gongsun Heng committed suicide to protect people in Shuo State.

349
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,839
He's a real hero.

350
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,218
But I heard there's an able man working for him.

351
00:25:09,218 --> 00:25:11,839
His surname is Qin. He's still living.

352
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,838
What's your relationship with him, Young Master Qin?

353
00:25:14,838 --> 00:25:18,239
You got involved in the chaos in Luoyang.

354
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:21,000
What do you want to do?

355
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,999
You've been dealing with me in the manner of Gongsun Heng.

356
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:32,479
But you won't expose the manner that you're familiar with.

357
00:25:32,479 --> 00:25:35,819
So you have already lost.

358
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:39,939
I invite you to the trap, but I won't unmask you so soon.

359
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:44,938
I just want to see to what extent you can deploy in Gongsun Heng's manner.

360
00:25:44,938 --> 00:25:49,760
If you use your familiar manner, maybe I can't defeat you.

361
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,539
However, you're not honest enough.

362
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:57,219
On record, I'm Elder Qin's nephew.

363
00:25:57,219 --> 00:26:00,598
- The truth is... 
 - His partner.

364
00:26:00,598 --> 00:26:04,319
At the seventh line outside, you're hesitating whether to put a chessman.

365
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:07,218
It's because you're afraid you'll expose your manner.

366
00:26:07,218 --> 00:26:09,999
But a general shouldn't hesitate.

367
00:26:09,999 --> 00:26:12,079
People will see through you.

368
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,460
Actually, you want to put it here.

369
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,799
But it's the manner of the people on the prairie.

370
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,860
No, I'm from the Central Plains.

371
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,040
Interesting.

372
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,620
   

373
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,199
A'Li, the princess came here just now.

374
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:40,738
I said you weren't here. So she left this.

375
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:44,319
Thank you, Miss Quan.

376
00:26:45,712 --> 00:26:48,432
   

377
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:52,438
Miss Quan, I need to meet the princess.

378
00:26:52,438 --> 00:26:55,298
Relax. I'll be careful.

379
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,360
It doesn't matter who I am.

380
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,580
I came to Luoyang to find my old friend.

381
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:26,719
So, now can you tell me

382
00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:29,779
the old friend from the noble family?

383
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:32,680
No, I can't. It's not important.

384
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,939
The reason why I look for her, it's not because of her identity.

385
00:27:36,939 --> 00:27:38,740
People say you're afraid of your wife.

386
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,978
Actually, you regard your wife as your partner.

387
00:27:40,978 --> 00:27:42,619
So you respect her.

388
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,899
If your wife were gone,

389
00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:47,858
I guess you'd look for her no matter how difficult it would be.

390
00:27:47,858 --> 00:27:50,840
Am I right?

391
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,180
I thought you were looking for a man.

392
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,218
But you're looking for a girl!

393
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:58,398
I like it.

394
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,178
Okay. I'm willing to find your beloved one.

395
00:28:02,178 --> 00:28:03,139
Beloved one?

396
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,040
Isn't she?

397
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,759
I guess she must be very pretty.

398
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:11,819
And she is very adorable.

399
00:28:11,819 --> 00:28:12,820
Yes.

400
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,419
See? I'm right.

401
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:17,219
You care about her very much,

402
00:28:17,219 --> 00:28:20,359
and you don't want to leave her behind. Right?

403
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:23,479
You don't like other girls.

404
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:26,598
If you were forced to stay with someone

405
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:28,498
and you can't leave each other until you're dead,

406
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:32,139
do you hope this girl to be her?

407
00:28:32,139 --> 00:28:35,660
Even if many beautiful girls in the world like you,

408
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:40,860
you still like this overbearing and bad-tempered girl.

409
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,739
She's not a girl.

410
00:28:43,739 --> 00:28:45,338
Is she an old lady?

411
00:28:45,338 --> 00:28:47,739
I really admire your taste.

412
00:28:47,739 --> 00:28:50,960
She's a capable woman.

413
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,559
No matter who she is, in all, she's your beloved one.

414
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,919
I won't play with you.

415
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,799
I've used up all my strategies for playing chess.

416
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,978
I won't play now.

417
00:29:24,978 --> 00:29:28,279
Brother Li, you want to betray your words?

418
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:31,058
Don't say so. It's not like that.

419
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,439
 It's him? 

420
00:29:42,479 --> 00:29:45,999
Young Master Qin. With your unclear identity,

421
00:29:45,999 --> 00:29:48,198
I suggest that you stay away from these.

422
00:29:48,199 --> 00:29:50,379
It's early now. Come on, have a seat.

423
00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:52,140
Let's have another game. Come on.

424
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,358
Brother Li, I have something urgent.

425
00:29:54,358 --> 00:29:57,100
I'll visit you on another day.

426
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,559
I still want to play!

427
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,980
You're leaving suddenly?

428
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,120
Brother Shuyu, did you get it?

429
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,659
It's in the bag.

430
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:31,719
But, Yueyan, it's strange.

431
00:30:31,719 --> 00:30:33,259
How could things go so well?

432
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:37,198
According to Hao Du's habit, he must have noticed it.

433
00:30:37,198 --> 00:30:39,860
Well, take it and wait for me at the gate.

434
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,120
I'll wait for Changge secretly and inform her to meet you.

435
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,640
But...

436
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,059
Young Master Wei, you underestimated me.

437
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,179
Hao Du, why are you here?

438
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:57,418
Now the crown prince is missing. The criminal is in Luoyang.

439
00:30:57,418 --> 00:30:59,358
You took Princess out secretly.

440
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,779
- If there's— 
 - How did you know I was here?

441
00:31:01,779 --> 00:31:04,919
If I don't know this, how would I protect you?

442
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,620
You...

443
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,256
   

444
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,518
Where did you get this token and who do you want to give it to?

445
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:35,159
I stole the token. Do you want to catch me?

446
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,760
Damn it!

447
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,480
Chase her!

448
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,520
Let him go.

449
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,580
I said, let him go.

450
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,500
Changge.

451
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,039
He is?

452
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,540
He...

453
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,819
 He saved Changge in You State. 

454
00:33:26,819 --> 00:33:28,458
He is Changge's friend.

455
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:29,838
He saved Changge?

456
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:30,679
Yes.

457
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,879
He kidnapped me and saved Changge from Hao Du.

458
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,218
No matter who he is,

459
00:33:35,218 --> 00:33:37,698
he saved Changge many times.

460
00:33:37,698 --> 00:33:39,779
He is trustworthy.

461
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:56,189
♫   The heart gradually responds, gradually revives   ♫

462
00:33:56,189 --> 00:33:59,179
♫  gradually swims towards you  ♫

463
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:06,788
♫  Before bidding farewell, we expect an encounter  ♫

464
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,479
 - Changge, it's a trap. 
 - Sun? 

465
00:34:10,479 --> 00:34:12,840
 Your friends were caught. 

466
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,100
 I followed the man that wanted to catch you. 

467
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,738
 I didn't imagine you were really here. 

468
00:34:16,738 --> 00:34:18,239
 Then, Yueyan... 

469
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,738
 There're imperial officers. 

470
00:34:19,738 --> 00:34:22,539
 Relax, she's safe. Just leave here. 

471
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:25,220
 You don't hate me? 

472
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,240
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

473
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,300
 I hate that you left without saying goodbye. 

474
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:39,100
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

475
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,449
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

476
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:46,160
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

477
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:48,879
This way.

478
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:54,759
♫  It turns into an eternity. The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

479
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,899
What's this place?

480
00:34:55,899 --> 00:34:57,438
The most famous tavern in Luoyang.

481
00:34:57,438 --> 00:35:01,059
They won't believe that we'd be hiding in the most crowded place.

482
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,058
How could you be so familiar with this place?

483
00:35:06,058 --> 00:35:08,300
I played chess here with a friend.

484
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,500
Played chess here?

485
00:35:24,339 --> 00:35:28,839
Changge, it was so difficult for me...

486
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,750
to find you.

487
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,159
You've been looking for me from the tribes until now?

488
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,680
I'm the one who let you down.

489
00:35:57,959 --> 00:35:59,899
I shouldn't have blamed you.

490
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:03,719
I owe you so much.

491
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:05,580
Then don't leave.

492
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,239
You can pay it back slowly.

493
00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:19,739
I just saved you.

494
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,439
Shouldn't you give me a toast?

495
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:26,320
Thank you so much for saving me.

496
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,618
I just want to thank you.

497
00:36:34,618 --> 00:36:36,680
I didn't say I would marry you.

498
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:39,120
Who'll benefit more,

499
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:41,979
we still don't know yet.

500
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:04,999
Sister?

501
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,958
I just heard your voice.

502
00:37:06,959 --> 00:37:10,460
I didn't believe it was you.

503
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,279
Ghost. You're a ghost!

504
00:37:13,279 --> 00:37:15,678
Shut up. Why are you here?

505
00:37:15,678 --> 00:37:18,400
Don't you know you've caused big trouble?

506
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:30,140
Sister, you're alive.

507
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,139
Congratulations.

508
00:37:33,139 --> 00:37:35,540
- Long time no— 
 - Answer my question!

509
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:38,638
I... I sneaked out.

510
00:37:38,638 --> 00:37:41,538
It's said this tavern is interesting.

511
00:37:41,538 --> 00:37:45,099
Western dancers with golden hair and blue eyes will dance here.

512
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:50,679
So I was thinking... I...

513
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:53,679
So, you sneaked out.

514
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,500
You weren't kidnapped.

515
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,820
Boy, think clearly.

516
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,740
Have you been staying here?

517
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:04,398
Do you know there was a fire at Ziwei Palace?

518
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:06,638
I... I heard about it.

519
00:38:06,638 --> 00:38:08,258
But why didn't you go back?

520
00:38:08,258 --> 00:38:09,538
I...

521
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:12,678
When the fire broke out, I'd fallen asleep.

522
00:38:12,678 --> 00:38:14,198
I heard about it later.

523
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:16,579
If I go back now,

524
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:18,438
Minister Du will punish me.

525
00:38:18,439 --> 00:38:19,839
You naughty boy.

526
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,419
Li Changge! I'm the crown prince now.

527
00:38:22,419 --> 00:38:23,718
How could you do this to me?

528
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,539
I'll hit you if you keep talking.

529
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,979
Li Changge, if you dare to touch me one more time...

530
00:38:28,979 --> 00:38:31,119
Sister! Sister!

531
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,379
I'm your brother. Just calm down.

532
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:35,500
I won't say that to you.

533
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,699
Li Chengqian, even a three-year-old can see through you.

534
00:38:37,699 --> 00:38:39,429
You really haven't gotten any better as you have gotten older.

535
00:38:39,429 --> 00:38:41,578
You're a crown prince, but you did such a ridiculous thing.

536
00:38:41,578 --> 00:38:43,119
I feel ashamed for Li Shimin.

537
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,958
How could he have a son like you?

538
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:46,499
You didn't learn a little from your father.

539
00:38:46,499 --> 00:38:47,818
You want to be a crown prince?

540
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:49,659
Why are you scolding me as well?

541
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:52,298
Everyone says I don't deserve to be my father's son.

542
00:38:52,298 --> 00:38:54,439
I thought...

543
00:38:54,439 --> 00:38:56,799
My father did such a thing to your family.

544
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,700
I thought at least you'd think I deserved to be his son.

545
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:12,060
At least your father can save the world.

546
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,659
But you...

547
00:39:16,339 --> 00:39:17,639
You...

548
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:19,718
Do you really want to kidnap me?

549
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:20,839
How dare you!

550
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,618
I'll tell Minister Du about it!

551
00:39:22,618 --> 00:39:24,759
How dare you come back to Luoyang?

552
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,099
Since you've found her,

553
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,939
we can't let you leave now.

554
00:39:30,939 --> 00:39:33,059
Sister, we're relatives.

555
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:35,678
Let's just sit down and talk.

556
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:37,338
You need to realize your fault.

557
00:39:37,338 --> 00:39:39,880
Don't do silly things, my friends.

558
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:48,339
Li Changge, what are you doing?

559
00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:49,918
You said you like to play.

560
00:39:49,918 --> 00:39:51,960
You can play here as you want.

561
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:56,019
Four warriors, please let my brother play here.

562
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:58,239
Please let him feel at home.

563
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,659
Okay.

564
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:02,078
If you do any harm to me,

565
00:40:02,078 --> 00:40:03,660
my father will punish you.

566
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,018
I'm the crown prince! The future emperor!

567
00:40:06,018 --> 00:40:07,219
How dare you do this!

568
00:40:07,219 --> 00:40:09,660
You want to die here?

569
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,499
My brother had a serious fever,

570
00:40:11,499 --> 00:40:12,818
so his brain is not functioning well.

571
00:40:12,818 --> 00:40:15,800
Don't believe what he says.

572
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,199
Sister! Sister, it's my bad.

573
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:24,659
Let me go.

574
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:27,979
We're relatives. We can sit down and talk.

575
00:40:27,979 --> 00:40:30,319
You know I'm your sister?

576
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:31,359
Okay.

577
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,099
Since you still call me sister,

578
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:36,559
I'll teach you a lesson for your father.

579
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,159
Warriors, please take care of my brother.

580
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:48,719
Don't harm him or his mother will blame me.

581
00:40:49,259 --> 00:40:50,138
Relax.

582
00:40:50,138 --> 00:40:51,738
We've taught many kids a lesson.

583
00:40:51,738 --> 00:40:53,339
We know it.

584
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,740
Have fun.

585
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:57,639
Stop! Don't leave!

586
00:40:57,639 --> 00:40:59,138
Sister. Sister! Sister!

587
00:40:59,138 --> 00:41:00,438
   

588
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:02,319
I've never lost once since I was young.

589
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,349
Naughty boy. He just received a small punishment.

590
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,700
Feeling happy?

591
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,179
Then go back with me.

592
00:41:10,179 --> 00:41:11,820
Go back to where?

593
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:14,239
Shiba and Elder Qin are in Luoyang.

594
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,080
They're looking for you.

595
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,198
Shiba and Elder Qin...

596
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:20,638
Where is Yuan?

597
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:21,878
Yuan is also here.

598
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:23,099
And Xu Feng?

599
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:24,839
The people of Yanxing Sect are all here.

600
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,119
Yanxing Sect?

601
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,440
It's the alias of Elder Qin's group.

602
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,519
I really miss them.

603
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:34,060
What's wrong?

604
00:41:34,919 --> 00:41:36,999
I don't know how to face them when I go back.

605
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,498
Don't think too much. Just go back.

606
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:41,960
Let's go.

607
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:49,360
   

608
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,020
Princess.

609
