<i>Governor, let me accompany you to see Shuo State again.</i>

168
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:51,640
<i>I think I understand the reason why you wanted to guard this place.</i>

169
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:57,599
<i>You chose the hardest way.</i>

170
00:14:57,599 --> 00:15:00,580
<i>After you died, you became god.</i>

171

<i>Even in hell, your soul will still be a hero.</i>

172
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,039
<i>Although I'm not as kind and brave as you are,</i>

173
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:10,939
<i>I'll guard this place and the people here for you!</i>

174
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:14,059
<i>Even if there are difficulties and enemies,</i>

175
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:16,619

00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:22,018
Why has no one come out?

179
00:16:22,018 --> 00:16:24,359
Did they pretend to surrender again?

180
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:28,440
We can't trust what they said.

181
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,700
Wait.

182
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,639
Why isn't Commandant Li here?

183
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,499
Has he left here?

184
00:16:43,499 --> 00:16:44,439
I'll find him.

185
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:45,739
Wait.

186
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,259
He'll surely come.

Gongsun Heng has died.

190
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,119
Shuo State will surrender.

191
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,480
It's useless to let you live now.

192
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,680
It's not settled yet.

193
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,000
As a Princess of Great Tang,

194
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,939
I'll fight for my people this time.

195
00:18:30,939 --> 00:18:35,039
If you try to stop me, you'll be the enemy of Great Tang.

196
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:58,799
My beloved ones were all killed like dogs.

197
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,760
I was expelled from where I was born.

198
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,620
I'd rather die every day.

199
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,240
After I settle this,

200
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:15,780
you can kill me.

<i>[Memorial Tablet of Shuo State Governor Gongsun Heng]</i>

202
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,819
As a princess,

203
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:57,839
you knelt down to the surrendered General of Sui.

204
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:00,000
He deserves it.

205
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,840
Because, in Shuo State, thanks to Gongsun Heng,

206
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,179
I've found I have my own belief now.

207
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:11,920
I don't want to give it up.

208
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,560
He sacrificed his life to defend this city.

209
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,699
He deserves it more than anyone else.

210
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,899
Did you remake the accounts of treasury and ordnance?

211
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,159
Yes.

212
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:06,839
We hid over 70 percent.

213
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:09,979
When Ashile Sun comes in with pleasure,

214
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:12,759
you'll send Yuan'er out of the city.

215
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:15,720
At the same time, we'll transport these things secretly.

216
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,780
Without my message, no one shall come back.

217
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:23,780
You don't have confidence in this surrender, Commandant Li?

218
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,619
The cities in the north have belonged to the Ashile Tribe.

219
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,939
Chang'an didn't come to the rescue.

220
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:35,738
It seems the war in the north is not important as Li Shimin's throne.

221
00:21:35,738 --> 00:21:39,000
No one knows what will happen after we surrender.

222
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,760
Governor left his daughter and this property with us.

223
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,660
I can feel relieved after I entrust you with that.

224
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,139
He sacrificed his life to protect Shuo State.

225
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,140
I'll protect this place for him.

226
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:04,368
I, Qin Gu, am just a normal person.

227
00:22:04,368 --> 00:22:06,368
I'm more than 60 years old.

228
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:10,049
I worked for five masters as their adviser.

229
00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:12,528
They're all great men.

230
00:22:12,528 --> 00:22:14,629
Some of them even can be emperors.

231
00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:18,350
But they didn't defeat the Li Family and died.

232
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:25,080
A person like me, do you really want me to work for you?

233
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,499
Although I still don't know what belief I have,

234
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:36,290
I know one thing clearly.

235
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:39,229
I've lost my home.

236
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,580
I don't want to lose Great Tang.

237

Okay. We need to try our best.

Okay.

242
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:08,949
You don't need to follow me.

243
00:23:08,949 --> 00:23:11,109
I'll go alone.

On behalf of troops and people in Shuo State,

I, Commandant Li Shisi, open the gate and surrender.

Shuo State Governor, Gongsun Heng has committed suicide due to his guilt.

268
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:52,029
He hoped to use his death to release the anger of the general.

269
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:54,869
His head is here.

270
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:57,369
Please have a look, General.

Go.

272
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:39,499
General, this is Gongsun Heng's head.

273
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:49,298
<i>You knew he was hurt?</i>

274
00:26:49,298 --> 00:26:51,798
<i>I bound it up for him. Of course, I knew.</i>

279
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,589
We fought against you.

280
00:27:46,589 --> 00:27:48,769
We knew we were sinful.

281
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:54,330
The criminal Gongsun Heng asked me to give you treasury and food.

282
00:27:55,129 --> 00:27:57,730
Now we've counted it.

283
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,869
Please go inside and check, General.

284
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:03,490
Now we'll open the gate.

285
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:11,469
General and the soldiers of Ashile Tribe can take treasures in the city.

286
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:17,670
As a criminal,

287
00:28:24,989 --> 00:28:31,029
I hope General can spare the lives of the people in Shuo State.

288
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:34,338
If you had known it, why hadn't you surrendered earlier?

289
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,239
Now many of our brothers have died.

290
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,859
Let you go? Nonsense!

<i>Revenge for our brothers!</i>

294
00:28:43,178 --> 00:28:44,598
<i>Kill him!</i>

295
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:47,039
<i>Kill them!</i>

296
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,098
<i>We can't let him go!</i>

297
00:28:48,098 --> 00:28:50,839
<i>Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!</i>

298
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:53,598
<i>- Kill him!
- We can't let him go!</i>

299
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,759
<i>- Kill him!
- We can't let him go!</i>

300
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:57,559
<i>Kill him!</i>

301
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,760
Why do you think I'll promise you?

302
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,939
If you want to kill me, I have nothing to say.

303
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:15,580
But if you want all people in this city to die,

304
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,440
it's impossible.

305
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,219
If so, I'd choose to die together.

306
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,038
You loser.

307
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,459
Why don't you surrender?

308
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:29,800
<i>Loser, just surrender!</i>

309
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,048
<i>I can kill you now!</i>

310
00:29:32,048 --> 00:29:33,630
<i>Surrender! Surrender!</i>

311
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:38,030
So, you think you can still fight with me now?

312
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,040
I'm not bragging.

313
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,819
But there're woods and potassium nitrate in the city.

314
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:47,799
If you promise not to kill us, we won't choose to die with you.

315
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,820
If you insist on killing all the people in the city,

316
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:59,200
we'll choose to die together with your troop.

317
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,380
I should have warned you,

318
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,700
I hate to be threatened.

319
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,680
It's not like that, General.

320
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,600
This is just a trade.

321
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,700
Okay. I promise you.

322
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:52,798
The snow has stopped.

323
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,680
Right. It's sunny again.

324
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
That's right.

325
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,960
Thank you for your mercy, General.

326
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,540
I hope you can fulfill your promise.

327
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,019
Don't kill the people here.

328
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:06,160
But I have a condition.

329
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,139
I want you to be my servant.

330
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:12,260
I'm your master and you should work for me.

331
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,279
Good! Such a good idea!

332
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:28,579
Now that Gongsun Heng died, he'll be the commandant of Shuo State.

333
00:31:28,579 --> 00:31:32,698
Let them see how their commandant became our slave now.

334
00:31:32,698 --> 00:31:38,559
<i>Good idea!</i>

335
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,650
If you agree, I won't kill the people in Shuo State.

336
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,880
You...

337
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:48,199
You want me to be your slave?

338
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:50,299
Right.

339
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:52,019
My slave.

340
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:54,760
Now everyone in Shuo State has known that

341
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,759
you betrayed your master and become a traitor.

342
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,319
You can't stay here now.

343
00:32:05,499 --> 00:32:07,660
Don't make me wait.

344
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,740
I don't have patience.

345
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,060
I can withdraw my promise at any time.

346
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:33,140
I'll be your servant.

347
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:12,460
Yuan'er, you're awake.

348
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,599
Where's Brother Li?

349
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,919
Brother Li said he wanted you to behave well.

350
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,100
After a while, he'll come to play with you.

351
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:29,018
I'll behave well.

352
00:33:29,018 --> 00:33:33,400
I want to see Brother Li soon.

353
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,319
Yuan'er is a good girl.

354
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:38,380
You're such a good girl.

355
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,899
<i>Move!</i>

356
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:08,780
<i>Step aside!</i>

357
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,779
<i>Step aside!</i>

358
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:15,560
<i>Step aside! Step aside!</i>

359
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,360
<i>Step aside!</i>

360
00:34:18,259 --> 00:34:20,359
<i>Just go! Be quick.</i>

361
00:34:21,439 --> 00:34:23,139
<i>Step aside!</i>

362
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,279
Look, what happened?

363
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:30,880
I don't know.

364
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,019
There're so many people.

365
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:01,478
<i>Traitor! Traitor!</i>

366
00:35:01,478 --> 00:35:03,298
<i>Traitor!</i>

367
00:35:03,298 --> 00:35:04,859
<i>Traitor! Traitor!</i>

368
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,240
<i>You betrayed your master!</i>

369
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,440
<i>Why are you still alive?</i>

370
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,039
<i>- Traitor!
- You traitor!</i>

371
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:15,099
<i>Governor and his wife died all because of you!</i>

372
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,240
<i>You traitor!</i>

373
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,439
<i>Why didn't you die?</i>

374
00:35:17,439 --> 00:35:18,298
<i>You villain!</i>

375
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:21,099
<i>Traitor! Traitor!</i>

376
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:23,450
<i>Why didn't you die?</i>

377
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,520
<i>Shameless!</i>

378
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,660
<i>Traitor!</i>

379
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,399
<i>Traitor!</i>

380
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:32,479
<i>It's all because of you!</i>

381
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:33,498
<i>Villain!</i>

382
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:36,079
<i>It's all because of you!</i>

383
00:35:37,879 --> 00:35:40,240
<i>Just go to hell!</i>

384
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,700
<i>Go to hell!</i>

385
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,438
He didn't even explain.

386
00:35:57,438 --> 00:35:59,520
Explain?

387
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,700
Will it work?

388
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,620
People will only believe what they want to believe.

389
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:09,970
<i>Evil traitor!</i>

390
00:36:15,939 --> 00:36:17,459
Step aside! Step aside!

391
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,739
- Shameless!
- Step aside!

392
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:20,519
Step aside!

393
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,039
The Governor of Shuo State has died.

394
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:33,859
Great Khan admires his courage,

395
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:36,739
so he'll pardon Shuo State.

396
00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:39,000
<i>Pardon us?</i>

397
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,498
<i>Great.</i>

398
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:42,158
<i>Right.</i>

399
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,540
<i>We won't be killed.</i>

400
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,819
<i>Great.</i>

401
00:36:44,819 --> 00:36:47,078
<i>- We're pardoned.
- We're pardoned.</i>

402
00:36:47,078 --> 00:36:49,699
<i>We don't need to die.</i>

403
00:36:57,879 --> 00:37:00,119
General Sun won't betray his promise.

404
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,400
Do you feel relieved now?

405
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:11,220
Look at them.

406
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,100
None of them understands your sacrifice.

407
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,159
They hate you.

408
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,239
Is it worth it?

409
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,619
<i>Who will thank him?</i>

410
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:40,480
<i>Is it worth it?</i>

411
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,800
<i>What he defends with his life is just caring about people.</i>

412
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,680
Yes, it is.

413
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,230
<i>[Governor's Manor]</i>

414
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,138
Sun, you really don't need to watch them packing?

415
00:38:48,138 --> 00:38:52,199
What if someone can't tolerate it and kills some of our brothers?

416
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:55,980
If you are worried, go to check yourself.

417
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,859
<i>Where is he?</i>

418
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:01,538
Tu Kashe, you're so shameless.

419
00:39:01,538 --> 00:39:03,298
This is not the area of Bear Division.

420
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,679
Did we ask you to come in?

421
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:07,520
I never had a defeat during these years.

422
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,978
But I have never won since I came here.

423
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:11,039
I have already been shameless!

424
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:15,359
Let me ask you! Why did you let the defenders go secretly?

425
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,039
It's none of your business.

426
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:22,158
I asked this for Great Khan.

427
00:39:22,158 --> 00:39:24,638
The young men in the city are either dead or injured.

428
00:39:24,638 --> 00:39:26,319
The rest are some elders and women.

429
00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:27,560
If we bring them back, who will take care of them?

430
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,338
We can kill them and bring their heads back.

431
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:32,139
Many soldiers in Bear Division died.

432
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,999
How could I explain to them?

433
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:37,030
Many brothers in Eagle Division died as well!

434
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,760
If you didn't plunge into action,

435
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,660
how could we fail in camouflage?

436
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:47,460
Tu Kashe, you ruined the plan Great Khan made.

437
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,439
Now you want to blame me on behalf of Great Khan?

438
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,220
Are you qualified?

439
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:56,119
I'm not!

440
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:58,040
But you can't let them go!

441
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:03,139
If I were you, I'd choose to shut up.

442
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:06,140
If so,

443
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:10,620
maybe I can share some profit with you.

444
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,539
Otherwise,

445
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:16,280
I don't know what I'll write on my battle report.

446
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,679
Let's wait and see.

447
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,519
Do you really want to report this to Great Khan?

448
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:40,159
In the past, we were merciful to people in Great Tang.

449
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,619
No other people would know of it.

450
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:44,249
But this time, the Bear Division saw what we did.

451
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,219
They'll surely take the chance to defame us in front of Great Khan.

452
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:50,120
Mu Jin, remember.

453
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:55,460
It's my decision. It's not related to Eagle Division.

454
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,759
- You...
- Also, do me a favor.

455
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,679
<i>Have a look.</i>

456
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:08,779
<i>What is this?</i>

457
00:41:08,779 --> 00:41:09,760
<i>Here.</i>

458
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,919
<i>Come on. What is it?</i>

459
00:41:10,919 --> 00:41:12,740
<i>Have a look.</i>

460
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,770
<i>[Notice: Commandant Li Shishi has been killed]</i>

461
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,179
If he knew this, why would he do that?

462
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:22,039
He must have felt guilty.

463
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:24,940
Since he's dead, it's all over now.

464
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,419
Commandant Li has made contributions to Shuo State.

465
00:41:29,419 --> 00:41:30,660
<i>That's right.</i>

466
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,139
He paid for it.

467
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:33,700
He has paid for it!

468
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,479
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

469
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:38,598
- Let's go.
- He paid for it.

470
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,140
If you die,

471
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,960
I won't let the people here go.

472
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,280
What do you want to do?

473
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,620
Don't forget.

474
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,079
I've made the Ashile Tribe suffer a great loss.

475
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,859
If you want me to work for you,

476
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,220
what will Tu Kashe do?

477
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:48,279
What will other tribes and Great Khan think of it?

478
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:50,680
What a pity!

479
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,100
Commandant Li has died.

480
00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:56,100
From now on,

481
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,200
you'll just be a slave in Eagle Division.
