00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:51,900
When is it her turn to send Zhixi breakfast?

25
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,380
Zhixi.

26
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,579
Why didn't you answer me?

27
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:00,639
Zhixi. Zhixi.

28
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,998
Someone help!

29
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,638
He's dead! Someone help!

30
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:08,918
Someone help!

31
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:11,438
Someone help me!

32
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:14,199
 Look. Zhixi died a terrible death. 

33
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,338
 He was fine yesterday. How could it be? 

34
00:02:16,338 --> 00:02:18,059
Wait.

35
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:26,239
He was poisoned.

36
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,140
Carry him away.

37
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,879
Princess of Mobei.

38
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,599
Even if Zhixi was not willing to ally with you,

39
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,478
you didn't have to kill him.

40
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,219
 What? It's Princess of Mobei. 

41
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:42,938
Princess of Mobei did it.

42
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:44,638
What are you talking about?

43
00:02:44,638 --> 00:02:48,419
What am I talking about? What am I talking about?

44
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,398
I'm talking about the truth!

45
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:56,159
I saw the maid of Princess of Mobei send Zhixi breakfast.

46
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,758
Then Zhixi died!

47
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,838
Out of all of them, Zhixi was the only one who didn't agree with the treaty of alliance.

48
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,558
So you killed him.

49
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,478
 How evil she is! 

50
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:08,920
What if all the tribes don't agree with you?

51
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,118
Will you kill them, one by one?

52
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:13,918
 If we don't sign, will you kill us? 

53
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,819
 He's right. 

54
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,599
All of you, back off.

55
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,398
This happened in Great Tang,

56
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:26,038
so I, an official of Tang, will be responsible for it.

57
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:31,639
Luckily, you're here. The murderer is the maid of the Princess of Mobei.

58
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,999
She sent Zhixi breakfast.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,359
After I entered his room, he was dead.

60
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,759
It must be her maid!

61
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:42,478
Envoy, please calm down.

62
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,678
Since I'm here, I'll find out the truth

63
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:48,320
and make it clear to all the envoys.

64
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:15,639
What did you find?

65
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:22,820
It's confidential, I can't tell you.

66
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,299
Goodbye.

67
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:58,279
Young Master Wei, why are you hesitating?

68
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,319
Since you've found the evidence, you can just report it.

69
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,838
Even if you're afraid the Princess of Mobei will be involved,

70
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:06,539
- you can't just hide it. 
 - He's right.

71
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:09,919
Princess of Mobei helped to bring about the alliance.

72
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,759
If she is a suspect, the alliance will definitely be influenced.

73
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,678
But we can't just hide it.

74
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:21,760
If Tang conceals the murderer, it'll influence the base of the alliance.

75
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:35,199
It's the officer's room. People with no duty shall not come in.

76
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,479
A maid dared to poison someone here?

77
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,378
Say it. Did she instigate you to do so?

78
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:53,398
You have no evidence. Don't slander us.

79
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:55,978
You killed him. Why can't I say?

80
00:05:55,978 --> 00:06:01,060
Since you want your maid to be your scapegoat, I'll help you with it!

81
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,240
Young Khan.

82
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,678
 - Young Khan. 
 - Young Khan. 

83
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:18,078
You pointed to a woman with your sword in public.

84
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,000
You are a shame to our tribe.

85
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,319
You're all heroes in all tribes.

86
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,278
You kill enemies on battlefields.

87
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,219
When did you become interested in bullying a woman?

88
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,558
Please, calm down.

89
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:44,440
We found a bottle of poison in this maid's room.

90
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,960
According to our research, Zhixi died of this poison.

91
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:53,539
Now that the evidence is here, how can you explain now, evil woman?

92
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:56,278
I said it. Don't bully a woman.

93
00:06:56,278 --> 00:07:00,139
Young Khan, are you going to protect the murderer?

94
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:01,599
I haven't finished yet.

95
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,699
Although I found this bottle from the maid's room,

96
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:07,139
it doesn't belong to her.

97
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:11,440
This bottle belongs to Young Khan of the Ashile Tribe.

98
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,900
- It's... 
 - That's right.

99
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:23,000
Houses in central plains are mostly made of wood, so there're mice and insects.

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,278
Therefore, I prepared this poison.

101
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,639
The poison is mine, and I gave it to Zhixi.

102
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,338
Young Khan, this... this poison is really yours?

103
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:37,159
But I saw this maid walk out of Zhixi's room.

104
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,039
And the poison was found in her room.

105
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,538
It's... How can you explain this?

106
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:49,039
Do you mean I instigated this Mobei maid to kill Zhixi and framed her?

107
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,900
I'm just stating the facts of what I saw.

108
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,459
This case still has many suspicious points.

109
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:59,778
We'll look into the case. We won't frame an innocent person.

110
00:07:59,778 --> 00:08:04,919
You're all esteemed guests of Great Tang. We'll treat you with due respect.

111
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,789
Before we find out the truth, Young Khan must stay in the room.

112
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,239
Soldiers of Tang will watch him.

113
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,239
He should be ready to cooperate with the trial.

114
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:15,379
This maid must stay in Sifang Pavilion.

115
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:19,440
If you try to escape, you'll be regarded as a murderer.

116
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,440
Young Khan, please.

117
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,459
This is becoming complicated.

118
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:34,120
Who did this?

119
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,070
 Go! 

120
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,760
Go. Go!

121
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:14,458
If only these peaceful days could last.

122
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:20,519
I hope every resident in Tang has food to eat and clothes to wear.

123
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,238
They will.

124
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:26,260
His Majesty governs the country well and loves the people here.

125
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,820
I'm sure Great Tang will be prosperous.

126
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:37,880
Elder, let me help you.

127
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,000
Are you okay?

128
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:46,079
I'm fine. My grandson is waiting for me to cook for him.

129
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,998
- Elder. let me help you. 
 - I can do it myself.

130
00:09:49,998 --> 00:09:52,580
You can just accompany your wife.

131
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,879
No, no.

132
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,659
Elder, I can't betray my wife's will.

133
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:00,559
Let me help you.

134
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,379
Thank you.

135
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:06,159
I met good people today.

136
00:10:26,546 --> 00:10:28,339
   

137
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:33,759
I thought he understood what I was doing.

138
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,699
But today, I knew it was not like that.

139
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,418
She'er had been away from me for too long.

140
00:10:45,418 --> 00:10:51,320
He didn't know what I was doing and what I meant.

141
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,619
He stood out today to be the scapegoat for Mimi Guli.

142
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:59,179
By doing so, he was betraying me.

143
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:04,959
Should I punish him, or should I punish myself?

144
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,738
Princess, be at ease.

145
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:10,399
I'll deal with it.

146
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,860
I'll make sure Young Khan is safe and sound.

147
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:18,618
Well, bring Sheng Xin here tomorrow.

148
00:11:18,618 --> 00:11:21,059
A long delay may cause trouble.

149
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:23,420
We need to hurry up.

150
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,520
I understand.

151
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:33,299
Changge, I want to meet She'er.

152
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:36,678
Please help me to beg Young Master Wei and let me meet She'er.

153
00:11:36,678 --> 00:11:39,080
Why do you want to meet with him?

154
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,980
I didn't imagine he would stand out to be the scapegoat for me.

155
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,698
I was his playmate and slave when we were young.

156
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:53,799
But he regarded me as his friend.

157
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:57,339
Actually, he is pathetic.

158
00:11:57,339 --> 00:11:59,870
Okay, I can help you.

159
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,799
But you need to hurry back after you meet him. You can't let anyone know it.

160
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:10,599
Stop.

161
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,959
Why are you here?

162
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,038
I was afraid you didn't like the food of Great Tang.

163
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,580
So I made mutton noodles for you.

164
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:47,719
Eat them while they're warm.

165
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:03,419
It's delicious.

166
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:14,459
Why did you stand out to be the scapegoat for me?

167
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,899
By doing so, Khatun will be angry.

168
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,859
Aren't you afraid this will ruin the reputation of the Ashile Tribe?

169
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:39,760
She'er!

170
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:43,819
Mimi.

171
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:46,499
It's been so long since I ate the food you made.

172
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:49,138
Are you listening to me?

173
00:13:49,138 --> 00:13:51,759
Why did you admit that poison was yours?

174
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,139
How do you know it's not mine?

175
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,740
Did you really poison him?

176
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:09,538
The Mimi I know is a woman who is kind, warmhearted, and willing to help others.

177
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:12,000
How could she kill someone?

178
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,879
Since I was young, everyone has been pretending to respect me.

179
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,619
It's all because I am Young Khan.

180
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,218
Only you, you're the only one who treats me like a friend.

181
00:14:28,218 --> 00:14:30,679
I miss those days very much.

182
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,840
Since you left, I've never given my heart to anyone else.

183
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:45,240
Today, I just wanted to protect the one I want to protect.

184
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:48,059
She'er.

185
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,619
Thank you.

186
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:55,039
But we can't be together.

187
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,320
It's my own business.

188
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,359
I shall leave now.

189
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:16,460
She'er.

190
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,478
Actually, in this world,

191
00:15:20,478 --> 00:15:23,780
many people are not as simple as you think of them,

192
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,480
like... like me.

193
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,599
Maybe...

194
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:34,079
Maybe I'm not as kind as you thought.

195
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,099
I hope no matter what you encounter in the future,

196
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:41,299
you can judge it with your heart.

197
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:46,320
Because you're different from other people in the tribes.

198
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,519
Why are you so rash? Clean it.

199
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,060
Okay, okay.

200
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,199
Khan. Khan.

201
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:15,079
Khan.

202
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,580
Khan.

203
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,999
I'm Mu Jin.

204
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,959
Khan, I'll ask you some questions.

205
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:54,359
If it's right, just blink.

206
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:58,920
Yicheng made you become like this?

207
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,740
Now the Ashile Tribe is controlled by Yicheng.

208
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:27,258
- Commander Lei. 
 - Is Great Khan awake?

209
00:18:27,258 --> 00:18:30,139
Commander, he is still sleeping.

210
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:34,199
Khan, we're in Dingxiang.

211
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:38,280
Is the Emperor of Sui also here?

212
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,099
Khan, I'm alone now. I can't save you.

213
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:50,199
But I'll find a way to inform Sun.

214
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,198
That's right. Sun is not dead.

215
00:18:55,198 --> 00:19:00,260
If he knows about your situation now, he'll come to save you.

216
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,020
   

217
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,880
I lent you the Fish Token and let Mimi Guli meet She'er.

218
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,150
This has violated the law.

219
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:00,898
This time, Bayegu Tribe admitted their crime. Just leave it alone.

220
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:03,118
Since you knew I came here for the poison case,

221
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,098
you must have known it's not that simple.

222
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:07,579
Changge,

223
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:12,079
the Bayegu Tribe has admitted he took the poison of Ashile Tribe's Young Khan.

224
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,339
Then he put it in your maid's room.

225
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:17,318
The thing has become like this now. He's the only one to be the murderer.

226
00:20:17,318 --> 00:20:20,198
I don't believe you'll punish Ashile She'er.

227
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:22,179
If you want to find the real murderer,

228
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,139
you can't just draw a conclusion easily.

229
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,960
But he has committed suicide.

230
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,638
Wei Shuyu. Sometimes, there're some things

231
00:20:29,638 --> 00:20:33,880
that what you see with your eyes, hear with your ears is not the truth.

232
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,920
The truth...

233
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,879
Changge.

234
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,879
Not all the truth has to be traced to the root.

235
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,499
Sometimes, the truth will bring more trouble.

236
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,739
What are you afraid of?

237
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,139
Nothing is more important than the alliance.

238
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:04,859
The case had better end like this.

239
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:11,319
And... your maid is not that simple.

240
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,818
She has sticky fingers. You should beware of her.

241
00:21:13,818 --> 00:21:15,379
You'd better let her stay away from you.

242
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:17,560
I know what I'm doing.

243
00:21:19,139 --> 00:21:21,198
I suggest you do not trust anyone easily.

244
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:25,519
What hurts people most is the betrayal of their intimate friends.

245
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,020
I'm just worried about you as a friend.

246
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,310
But now, those who accompany and protect you

247
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:37,700
are not friends of Great Tang.

248
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:40,158
I trust them,

249
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:42,480
and they trust me.

250
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,559
It doesn't matter whether they're from Great Tang or the grasslands.

251
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,338
Changge, I'm just worried about you.

252
00:21:49,338 --> 00:21:51,478
I have no other...

253
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:55,480
Save your worries.

254
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,698
If you were talking about Sun just now, I can tell you clearly.

255
00:21:59,698 --> 00:22:02,639
Whether it's him or the maid Mimi you're talking about,

256
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,538
they've gone through thick and thin with me.

257
00:22:04,538 --> 00:22:07,379
They are friends that are worth making in my life.

258
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:09,918
I've been through a lot recently.

259
00:22:09,918 --> 00:22:13,218
I know things are not just about right or wrong.

260
00:22:13,218 --> 00:22:15,418
Someone has his reasons to do something.

261
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:18,700
If there has to be a price for my trust,

262
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,680
I'm willing to pay for it.

263
00:22:27,326 --> 00:22:28,800
   

264
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:35,200
   

265
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:39,580
Your Highness.

266
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:45,620
How can you be so senseless?

267
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:52,231
Your Highness.

268
00:22:52,231 --> 00:22:55,638
If you're curious about what Sifang Pavilion looks like, just tell me.

269
00:22:55,638 --> 00:22:58,799
I can take you here. But you chose to walk.

270
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,218
My feet hurt now.

271
00:23:00,218 --> 00:23:02,799
Why did you follow me?

272
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,918
My relative is living here as well. I'm here to meet her.

273
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,960
Relative?

274
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,919
We'll be allies later.

275
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,180
So all tribes will be families with us in the future.

276
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,760
Let's go.

277
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,299
Your Highness, I want to go to the toilet.

278
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:21,859
Toilet? Go ahead.

279
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:45,299
Li Changge!

280
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,160
Boring. You're always like this.

281
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,019
If I scare my sister, she'll cry.

282
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:54,880
You should try to scare your father.

283
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,100
Then you'll be the one who cries.

284
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,300
You're so boring.

285
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,299
Why do you always mention my father to me?

286
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,319
I didn't tell him you were here.

287
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:05,019
I treat you so well.

288
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:06,519
But you're so serious.

289
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:10,480
Your father knows everything. You don't need to tell him.

290
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,478
Your sister will get married soon.

291
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:14,459
If you have nothing to do, go home and help with it.

292
00:24:14,459 --> 00:24:15,799
I have something to do.

293
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:17,499
Don't bother me.

294
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,358
My sister is going to marry the foster son of Minister Du.

295
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,879
I don't like him at all.

296
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,739
I hope the best man in the world can marry my sister.

297
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,419
Why do you look at me like this?

298
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:34,060
Now I understand why your father let you be the prince.

299
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,699
Of course, that's because I'm good at both martial arts and literature.

300
00:24:36,699 --> 00:24:40,650
I'm a talent and also a rare real man in the world.

301
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,238
Don't go.

302
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:45,529
Well... Tell me.

303
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:47,279
Why did my father let me be the prince?

304
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,718
Although you're not talented...

305
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:49,799
Shut up.

306
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,639
You're not smart and competent.

307
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,078
But you can always see the kindness of others.

308
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,958
The emperor should care for the people around him.

309
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,399
The one who cares for people around him

310
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,420
will care for people in the world.

311
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,379
I guess he didn't want something to happen again.

312
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,199
If you were in that situation,

313
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:11,838
I guess you would protect people around you.

314
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,279
Just tell me if you want to praise me.

315
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,138
I am worthy of the finest compliments in the world.

316
00:25:16,138 --> 00:25:17,899
Why did you scold me?

317
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:20,559
Let me tell you! I'm competent.

318
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,219
I used to think if you were a man, you could match my sister.

319
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:28,059
If I were a man, I couldn't marry your sister.

320
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,560
Because my surname is Li as well.

321
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:35,959
You're right.

322
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:48,160
So, Li Changge is from the royal family?

323
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:54,019
Yang Cheng, search about Li Jiancheng's genealogy.

324
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,939
I guess we found the right person this time.

325
00:25:56,939 --> 00:25:59,399
God helps us to revive Sui.

326
00:25:59,399 --> 00:26:03,200
Now she's in my hands.

327
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,839
Congratulations, Princess.

328
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,859
Sheng Xin, Yang Cheng will manage to send letters to East Palace.

329
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,099
You only need to act according to our plan.

330
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:15,398
If you help me revive Sui, you'll get the top prize.

331
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:16,639
I'll let you be a minister.

332
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,178
I can give everything that Great Tang can't give you.

333
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:22,439
Thank you, Princess.

334
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,199
Go ahead.

335
00:26:25,199 --> 00:26:26,980
Yes, Princess.

336
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,199
We failed to frame Princess of Mobei this time,

337
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:36,638
because I didn't imagine that Young Khan liked Mimi Guli.

338
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:40,378
Since this chess piece failed to function as it should

339
00:26:40,378 --> 00:26:46,580
and she may disturb Young Khan, how about abandoning her?

340
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:50,999
After all, I taught her with my heart.

341
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:54,559
It's a pity to abandon her.

342
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,319
Forget it.

343
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:59,179
As long as we still use Buzhen to threaten her,

344
00:26:59,179 --> 00:27:03,960
Mimi Guli will still work for us. 
    

345
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:11,838
A man who has desire and fear will be weak and will be led by others.

346
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,700
So is Li Changge.

347
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,679
So is Ashile Sun.

348
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,039
Unfortunately, so is She'er.

349
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:27,319
Princess, it's time to let Young Khan learn a lesson now.

350
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:32,959
Since She'er was released, he should show courtesy to me now.

351
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,539
Khatun.

352
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:38,860
Young Khan wants to meet you.

353
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,958
Your son really knows what you're thinking.

354
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,360
Then I shall leave now.

355
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,000
I'm sorry that I caused you trouble, Mother.

356
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:56,500
Please punish me.

357
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,246
Have a seat.

358
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:14,388
We are finally together.

359
00:28:14,388 --> 00:28:18,108
How could I see you be arrested?

360
00:28:18,108 --> 00:28:21,469
Don't say you cause me trouble anymore.

361
00:28:21,469 --> 00:28:23,670
I understand.

362
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:27,788
You must have tried hard to make Bayegu Tribe become the scapegoat.

363
00:28:27,788 --> 00:28:31,909
It's no big deal.

364
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,068
Here. Have a taste.

365
00:28:34,068 --> 00:28:36,519
These are the desserts you like.

366
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,719
Mother, do you know who poisoned him?

367
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:45,068
Is it important?

368
00:28:45,068 --> 00:28:47,909
If the truth is not important, then what is important?

369
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,369
Reviving Sui?

370
00:28:56,549 --> 00:28:58,388
I'm sorry.

371
00:28:58,388 --> 00:28:59,989
I shouldn't have asked.

372
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:01,628
No.

373
00:29:01,629 --> 00:29:03,850
It's not that you shouldn't have asked.

374
00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:07,729
But you should have understood.

375
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:11,138
Since your Uncle Khan separated us,

376
00:29:11,138 --> 00:29:15,199
you've been growing wildly outside.

377
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:17,278
You have your way of doing things.

378
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:19,258
I won't blame you.

379
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:24,838
But now the world is fickle and people are evil.

380
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:28,850
I didn't have a chance to teach you.

381
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:33,138
So you're walking further and further from me.

382
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:39,980
Mother, I just want to accompany you and be filial,

383
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,018
at the same time, I want to protect the one I want to protect.

384
00:29:44,018 --> 00:29:46,079
So I stood out at that time.

385
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:48,179
You have grown up.

386
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,039
I'm getting old.

387
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:56,118
More often, I'm unable to do what I want to do.

388
00:29:56,118 --> 00:29:58,638
I don't hope you can understand.

389
00:29:58,638 --> 00:30:02,419
But I hope you can understand one thing.

390
00:30:02,419 --> 00:30:06,219
That is no matter what I do, I do it all for you.

391
00:30:06,219 --> 00:30:08,399
My boy.

392
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,390
   

393
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,719
Buzhen.

394
00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:03,160
Buzhen.

395
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,940
Buzhen.

396
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,018
- You're awake. 
 - What are you doing?

397
00:31:09,018 --> 00:31:12,120
I'll sleep for a while before I play with you.

398
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,480
Buzhen.

399
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,100
You're Buzhen?

400
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,639
You know me?

401
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,059
I'm your sister's friend.

402
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:30,459
You're my sister's friend?

403
00:31:30,459 --> 00:31:32,219
 Commander Lei. 

404
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:03,396
Stand up.

405
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,980
As long as you take good care of His Highness,

406
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,639
nothing will happen to you.

407
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,460
Buzhen, I shall leave now.

408
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,779
Don't tell anyone you've seen me.

409
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,360
Is my sister all right?

410
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,700
She's fine.

411
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:43,309
 Crying wolf and sneaking into Dingxiang, 

412
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:47,570
 I'll see how Ashile Sun will save you this time. 

413
00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:54,399
Changge... What are you doing?

414
00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:01,359
Why are you so careless?

415
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:03,420
You can buy one if you can't embroider.

416
00:34:04,389 --> 00:34:07,028
Yueyan is going to get married soon.

417
00:34:07,028 --> 00:34:10,849
I can't show up in front of everyone as the Princess of Mobei.

418
00:34:10,849 --> 00:34:13,409
Since I can't attend her wedding,

419
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:16,989
I want to make a moon-shaped fan for her.

420
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:21,369
But look at it. It's too ugly.

421
00:34:27,410 --> 00:34:29,649
What are you laughing at?

422
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:32,728
It's beautiful. I think it's very beautiful.

423
00:34:32,728 --> 00:34:34,989
I'll find the best embroiderer in Chang'an.

424
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,750
I don't believe I can't make a beautiful one.

425
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:46,529
When can I have a wedding with you?

426
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,529
Who said I'll marry you?

427
00:34:57,529 --> 00:35:02,468
In Great Tang, you need to obey traditional marriage rituals and ask for parents'...

428
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,129
But my parents have already died.

429
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:16,409
I don't know if my mother would like you.

430
00:35:18,689 --> 00:35:20,270
I believe she will.

431
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:25,209
All parents in the world will like the son-in-law that treats their daughter well.

432
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:31,650
I swear to Sirius, I'll treat you well forever.

433
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,409
Forever.

434
00:35:33,409 --> 00:35:35,330
Stop.

435
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,190
It's not that I don't believe you.

436
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,370
I just feel it's a pity

437
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:43,389
that my mother won't be able to meet you.

438
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,889
Enough about it. I'll go to Hongxiu Embroidery

439
00:35:48,889 --> 00:35:52,150
to find the best embroiderer that Sanniang told me about.

440
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,810
I'll tell your mother that I want to marry you.

441
00:36:11,209 --> 00:36:13,049
The countryside is so beautiful.

442
00:36:13,049 --> 00:36:15,710
I'll go again next time.

443
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,668
We've been hanging around and didn't go back.

444
00:36:17,668 --> 00:36:19,629
Will Father be angry at us?

445
00:36:19,629 --> 00:36:22,509
Be at ease, I report to His Majesty every day.

446
00:36:22,509 --> 00:36:26,328
Really? When? Why didn't I know?

447
00:36:28,529 --> 00:36:32,889
Then tell me, in the future,

448
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:37,169
will you listen to me or my father?

449
00:36:37,169 --> 00:36:39,629
- I... 
  - Sugar Figurine Candy. 

450
00:36:40,629 --> 00:36:42,849
Look. Someone is selling Sugar Figurine Candy.

451
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:46,569
I remember the last time when I ate it, we were in Luoyang. Do you remember?

452
00:36:46,569 --> 00:36:50,928
Of course. The Sugar Figurine Candy. You gave me the last time is still in my room.

453
00:36:50,928 --> 00:36:53,349
You haven't eaten it yet?

454
00:36:56,629 --> 00:36:58,770
Stop.

455
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,389
Wait for me here. I'll buy one for you.

456
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,108
How much is it?

457
00:37:10,109 --> 00:37:12,150
Two coins for one.

458
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,610
Thank you.

459
00:37:33,189 --> 00:37:34,989
 Yueyan. 

460
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:38,989
 Yueyan. 

461
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,610
Yueyan!

462
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,709
I thought I had lost you again.

463
00:38:04,709 --> 00:38:05,909
That's impossible.

464
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,569
I know you can always find me.

465
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:11,050
Why are you sitting here?

466
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,329
I was careless and twisted my foot.

467
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:15,869
- You twisted your foot? 
 - Wait.

468
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,789
I saw someone selling accessories.

469
00:38:21,789 --> 00:38:24,950
I thought this sword matches you well.

470
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,850
Do you like it?

471
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,009
I... I like it.

472
00:38:32,389 --> 00:38:37,728
Yueyan, from now on, I won't let you leave me.

473
00:38:37,728 --> 00:38:40,269
I'm not worried at all.

474
00:38:40,269 --> 00:38:42,709
Because I have you now.

475
00:38:46,789 --> 00:38:48,929
Is your foot okay?

476
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:50,529
Come on.

477
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,150
   

478
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:30,109
Madam, I'm Ashile Sun.

479
00:39:30,109 --> 00:39:32,049
We've met before.

480
00:39:32,049 --> 00:39:36,588
Today, I want to ask you for Changge's hand in marriage.

481
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:40,690
I hope you can allow me to marry Changge.

482
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:48,068
There're three reasons why I want to marry Changge.

483
00:39:48,068 --> 00:39:51,449
First of all, since you left Changge,

484
00:39:51,449 --> 00:39:54,360
she has cared about nobody in the world.

485
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:58,588
If one person cares about nobody, one will be free.

486
00:39:58,588 --> 00:40:01,309
However, at the same time, one will be lonely.

487
00:40:01,309 --> 00:40:03,849
I want to be the one Changge cares about.

488
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:08,170
I want to accompany her for the rest of my life.

489
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,370
Secondly, I learned martial arts when I was young.

490
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,810
I think I have some achievements.

491
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,548
Although I'm not the General of Eagle Division anymore,

492
00:40:16,549 --> 00:40:19,189
I'm confident that I can protect Changge.

493
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,969
I won't let her starve.

494
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:24,469
And I won't let anyone hurt her.

495
00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:29,029
In my heart, Changge is more important than my life.

496
00:40:30,029 --> 00:40:35,570
Thirdly, if you ask me what I'm pursuing, I thought much about it,

497
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:40,530
I went through a lot, and I suffered a lot; but in the end,

498
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:45,149
all I want is just peace.

499
00:40:45,669 --> 00:40:48,150
This is Changge's wish.

500
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:52,370
I think... this is also your wish.

501
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:57,208
After the alliance talk ends, I'll take Changge to the countryside.

502
00:40:57,208 --> 00:41:02,030
We'll stay away from conflicts and enjoy the rest of our lives.

503
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:07,070
Now, I don't have money to buy betrothal presents.

504
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,988
But rest assured, Madam.

505
00:41:08,988 --> 00:41:14,029
I swear to Sirius, whether it's money or my love for Changge,

506
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:18,143
I'll give her all I have.

507
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:19,404
   

508
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,930
   

509
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,430
   

510
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,588
   

511
00:42:17,589 --> 00:42:20,449
 Sugar Figurine Candy! Come buy some Sugar Figurine Candy.! 

512
00:42:20,449 --> 00:42:22,810
I finally found you.

513
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,089
Who are you?

514
00:42:26,089 --> 00:42:28,609
I'm His Highness's servant, Sheng Xin.

515
00:42:28,609 --> 00:42:30,889
His Highness let me deliver a message for you.

516
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:33,070
He wanted to meet you.

517
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,329
Don't be nervous, Princess.

518
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:39,869
Since His Highness can tell me such a private thing,

519
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:41,588
it means he trusts me.

520
00:42:41,588 --> 00:42:43,369
I won't tell anyone about it.

521
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:47,569
Otherwise, His Highness and you can kill me at any time.

522
00:42:47,569 --> 00:42:49,789
Make a long story short.

523
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,028
His Highness is busy now.

524
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,089
So he asked me to look for you

525
00:42:56,089 --> 00:42:58,728
and tell you that he found something important.

526
00:42:58,728 --> 00:43:00,788
He wanted to give it to you in person.

527
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:03,548
I'm afraid you wouldn't believe me.

528
00:43:03,549 --> 00:43:05,108
His Highness thought about it.

529
00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:07,769
But he still asked me to say he is looking for you,

530
00:43:07,769 --> 00:43:10,450
so you'll believe me.

531
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:14,048
If you doubt it, you can bring someone you trust.

532
00:43:14,048 --> 00:43:16,910
Then you can go with me.

533
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,069
It's not like that.

534
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:20,108
His Highness said this is an emergency.

535
00:43:20,108 --> 00:43:23,430
He wanted you to meet him immediately.

536
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:40,520
