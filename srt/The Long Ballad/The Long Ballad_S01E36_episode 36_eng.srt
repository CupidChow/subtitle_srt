22

23
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,554
Excuse me.

24
00:01:39,554 --> 00:01:43,300
Are you from the Central Plains?

25
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,244
Could you help me check

26
00:01:46,244 --> 00:01:49,180
whether this is from the Royal Family there?

27
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,059
If you don't know, don't talk nonsense!

28
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:00,988
Have you ever seen anything from the royal family of Central Plains?

29
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,920
Let me see!

30
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,643
Such a cheap handkerchief.

31
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:11,944
Not only the royal family but also I would refuse to use it! It's so rough!

32
00:02:11,944 --> 00:02:13,621
You...

33
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:16,820
How dare you! You did deceive me!

34
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,321
Let the head judge it! Follow me!

35
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:19,799
- Go! 
 - Help me!

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,620
How dare you ask us to do so?

37
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,500
Young Master, shall we help her?

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,044
According to her behavior and apparel, she must be rich or noble.

39
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:32,900
Someone will go to help her, even if we don't.

40
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:39,340
   

41
00:02:41,055 --> 00:02:44,440
Young Master. It feels wrong.

42
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,132
They've even taken the gromwells from the black markets.

43
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:50,154
They're the most covert!

44
00:02:50,154 --> 00:02:53,880
Seems that Khan's tent wants to destroy us all.

45
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:57,120
What should we do now?

46
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,976
Where can we find the gromwell?

47
00:02:58,977 --> 00:03:01,100
Let's lodge in the inn and keep on searching it.

48
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:03,521
We must find and bring it back!

49
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:05,200
Okay.

50
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,249
- Follow up! 
 - Let me off!

51
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:10,965
- Go! 
 - I'm not repudiating payment!

52
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:12,379
- I just need to pay later! 
 - Go!

53
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:13,939
Why are you so unreasonable?

54
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:15,459
- Go! 
 - I didn't trick you!

55
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:16,999
You know to trick at such a tender age!

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,420
Full of tricks! I won't trust you!

57
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,880
- I'm not! 
 - Go!

58
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:25,340
Ask him to pay! He's rich!

59
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,440
No! If you don't pay up, you can't leave!

60
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:37,580
Take it!

61
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:42,000
Thank you...

62
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:50,040
I got a stomache...

63
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,254
Stand up.

64
00:03:51,254 --> 00:03:54,654
Uncle, are you going to leave me in the lurch?

65
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:58,160
You tricked me and escaped last time.

66
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:01,276
I have a headache. Ouch, it hurts!

67
00:04:01,276 --> 00:04:04,760
The same old trick.

68
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,270
Well, you didn't mention stomachache last time.

69
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:11,854
Uncle, your joke isn't funny.

70
00:04:11,854 --> 00:04:14,240
Enough? Can we leave now?

71
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,060
I can go with you,

72
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,600
but I'm hungry and I want to eat noodles.

73
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,687
Haven't you just finished your meal?

74
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:23,600
Does it matter?

75
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,855
Here you are. Please enjoy it.

76
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:37,819
Well, how can I eat...

77
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,260
while you're all staring at me?

78
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,720
Yummy! It's so delicious!

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,954
I've got a stomachache!

80
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:05,944
What's wrong?

81
00:05:05,944 --> 00:05:08,609
Something wrong with the noodles!

82
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:09,469
Boss!

83
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:10,776
Yes, Sir?

84
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:12,265
I'm here.

85
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:13,599
There's omething wrong with the noodles!

86
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,349
It's impossible... Wait!

87
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,580
- What's going on? 
 - We've operated for decades!

88
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,079
- We've never met it before! 
 - I...

89
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,599
- Any mistake? 
 - Namtso.

90
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,799
Go check the kitchen!

91
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,354
In case I'm poisoned, you may find the toxin!

92
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:25,989
Do it! At once!

93
00:05:25,989 --> 00:05:27,700
- You guys, go to check the kitchen! 
 - Yes.

94
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,900
This way, please.

95
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,120
Uncle, go with them!

96
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,710
I've got a stomachache...

97
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,860
I have to go to the toilet!

98
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,120
It aches...

99
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,355
She escaped again!

100
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:18,080
Let's chase!

101
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,080
It's you...

102
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,900
Enemies!

103
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,687
You played a trick but why did you blame it on us?

104
00:06:47,688 --> 00:06:49,054
It's enough. Leave her alone.

105
00:06:49,054 --> 00:06:51,640
- Wait! She's... 
 - Let's leave.

106
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,940
 Step aside! 

107
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,600
 Get out of the way! 

108
00:06:59,144 --> 00:07:00,199
How can they find me so quickly?

109
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,640
- Step aside! 
 - There are soldiers...

110
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,411
Are they the soldiers of Mobei?

111
00:07:04,411 --> 00:07:05,521
You fear those soldiers?

112
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:07,522
Don't move!

113
00:07:08,655 --> 00:07:10,880
Help me!

114
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,435
- What to do? 
 - Knock her out!

115
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:14,750
Stop it!

116
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,760
Let's leave!

117
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:25,621
- Find them! 
  - Yes! 

118
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:26,900
Take care.

119
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,565
Shall we have a meal?

120
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:31,180
- This way, please. 
 - Fine.

121
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,943
Who are you? Why did you tie me up?

122
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:55,000
So who are you?

123
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,340
Why did you make trouble with us?

124
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,480
Why do I have to answer you?

125
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,609
By the way, you're quite weird and fear soldiers.

126
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:08,620
I think you're not normal peddlers!

127
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,500
Since you've found out, then it's time to silence you.

128
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:19,720
Do you know the result of bringing us trouble?

129
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,640
Do you want to kill me?

130
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,319
Here's the inn, right?

131
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,754
There are many people here.

132
00:08:29,754 --> 00:08:32,680
It's not a good place to murder.

133
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:39,400
Clever girl. Tell me.

134
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,790
Who are they? Why did they chase you?

135
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,454
My enemies.

136
00:08:43,454 --> 00:08:46,420
I think it's good for me to be tied.

137
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,920
It's better than to be arrested by them!

138
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,820
Little girl! Pack of lies!

139
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,500
I dare not let you leave and bring us trouble.

140
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,260
Stay here quietly.

141
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,099
If you refuse,

142
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:05,680
I'll leave you in the field to serve as the food of wolves!

143
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:22,640
Changge, what's going on? Who is she?

144
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,620
Still not talking.

145
00:09:26,077 --> 00:09:28,080
Then, what should we do with her?

146
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,800
Though her background is unknown,

147
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,821
I don't think she's a hoodlum.

148
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,469
As she's smart,

149
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:36,277
she's found out that we don't want to cope with soldiers.

150
00:09:36,277 --> 00:09:40,632
If we let her off so easily, she might bring us more trouble.

151
00:09:40,632 --> 00:09:42,099
Guard her first.

152
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:44,760
Then we'll try to find a solution.

153
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,566
Sounds reasonable.

154
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:49,040
Then let's do it.

155
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,620
 Want to trap me? 

156
00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:35,960
 Come on... She's here for me? 

157
00:10:51,044 --> 00:10:52,640
Mimi, what's wrong?

158
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,739
What are you thinking about here?

159
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,360
I'm thinking of my father, mother, and young brother.

160
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:05,910
My whole family lived in Mobei when I was young.

161
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,560
Though we were not rich,

162
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,920
we were very happy.

163
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:15,820
Until the Ashile Tribe came.

164
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,680
They brought us battles and ruined my family.

165
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,000
Many clansmen were homeless.

166
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:28,520
Fortunately, King of Mobei appeared.

167
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:31,680
Though Mobei wasn't conquered,

168
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,820
it was still pinned by the Ashile Tribe.

169
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,120
Whoever brings others wars will be punished.

170
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:44,200
My father said so too.

171
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,720
In my childhood, he taught me to tell right from wrong.

172
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,180
Well, Changge,

173
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,680
I really cannot distinguish

174
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,980
between right and wrong now.

175
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,320
It seems that I should hate the Ashile Tribe

176
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,122
but Eagle Division is also a part of it.

177
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:07,080
I love the guys there.

178
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:10,140
Am I wrong?

179
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,260
They're not the same.

180
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,880
Shouldn't you be tied up?

181
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,154
- I... 
 - Why didn't you escape?

182
00:12:28,155 --> 00:12:30,620
I didn't want to leave.

183
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,129
I think you're quite right.

184
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:37,310
The Ashile Tribe and its Great Khan must be punished in the future.

185
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,065
So, who are you?

186
00:12:41,065 --> 00:12:43,280
My name is Zhenzhu. I'm from Monan.

187
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,788
But we're in Mobei.

188
00:12:44,788 --> 00:12:46,344
I'm here for the Qihan Festival.

189
00:12:46,344 --> 00:12:49,620
Mobei has the liveliest celebration.

190
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,580
So you come here yourself?

191
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,710
The men that were chasing you...

192
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,040
Fine... It's because my father made me angry.

193
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,779
He asked them to catch me and bring me back.

194
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,739
Well, I don't want to go back now.

195
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:06,943
Oh, come on. You are just a kid who ran away from home.

196
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,829
I'm not a kid!

197
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,379
I'm now 14 years old and can get married.

198
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:14,340
I think you only enjoy larks.

199
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,398
I can let you leave, but you need to remember it.

200
00:13:17,398 --> 00:13:19,640
If you dare come to bring us trouble,

201
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,443
I'll capture and kill you.

202
00:13:22,444 --> 00:13:23,954
You won't kill me!

203
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:24,910
Why?

204
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:26,680
My intuition.

205
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,755
By the way, anything to eat? I'm hungry.

206
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,040
Don't eat too much...

207
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,820
I'm full!

208
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,900
Then answer my question.

209
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,655
How far is Monan from here?

210
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,160
Are there any gromwells there?

211
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,780
Gromwell?

212
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,130
It's not a rarity.

213
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,960
As there are many in Mobei, why do you ask Monan?

214
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,360
Because we can buy none of them in Mobei.

215
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,620
Though its trade has been banned,

216
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,300
we still can banish the God of Plague.

217
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,122
Every Qihan Festival,

218
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:24,840
everyone will take out gromwells to banish the God of Plague.

219
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,780
Banish the God of Plague?

220
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:33,820
Mimi, is it the same as what you told me today?

221
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,238
Its main part is to banish the God of Plague...

222
00:14:37,238 --> 00:14:39,740
People will build up a stage in the town

223
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,877
and someone will take the stage and perform.

224
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:47,140
Then people will throw all their gromwells

225
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,280
to the God of Plague.

226
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:56,620
How couldn't I find such an idea?

227
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,510
Which part of the performance should be fastidious?

228
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,640
Fastidious?

229
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:07,920
Anyone here?

230
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,800
Soldiers!

231
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,320
Are you all dead?

232
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,055
Where's Shixin Sili?

233
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,399
He isn't in Khan's tent now.

234
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,854
Then where's She'er?

235
00:15:34,854 --> 00:15:36,588
Ask him to come!

236
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:39,438
Young Khan led the Wolf Division for an inspection.

237
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,620
No one is here...

238
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,880
They're all out!

239
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,940
Why are they not here?

240
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:51,020
You're sick and should stay in bed.

241
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,900
I'll report to you when they're back.

242
00:16:03,222 --> 00:16:05,340
Sun...

243
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,600
Sun...

244
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:19,220
Princess, Khan is still concerned about Eagle Division.

245
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,580
Can he dispatch them?

246
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,499
Please be at ease. We have soldiers guarding there

247
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:27,917
and they cannot fetch any gromwell.

248
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,680
Thanks, Taoist Sun.

249
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,976
He's out of danger temporarily

250
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:55,600
but the change of his condition

251
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,555
is faster than my imagination.

252
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:02,080
You mean... he cannot wait for another ten days?

253
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,420
Since I've told you ten days,

254
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,260
I will let him hold out until that time.

255
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,220
But if they cannot get the gromwell on time,

256
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,900
I'm afraid he'll be in danger.

257
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,759
Are you ready?

258
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,287
Yes. Please be at ease, Elder Qin.

259
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:34,380
Let's wait and see.

260
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:08,120
 Nice! 

261
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:11,450
 Banish God of Plague! 

262
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,759
 - Banish God of Plague! 
 - Good job! 

263
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,919
 - Nice! 
 - Banish God of Plague! 

264
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,420
 Good! 

265
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:22,320
Look at that!

266
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,680
Let's go to have a look.

267
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,200
Nice dance!

268
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:07,965
Awesome!

269
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:10,218
 Small tricks. 

270
00:20:10,218 --> 00:20:12,480
 It's our turn! 

271
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,480
Hit below the belt...

272
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,999
 Nice! 

273
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,865
 Good job! 

274
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:26,132
 Awesome! 

275
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:27,376
 Perfect! 

276
00:20:27,377 --> 00:20:30,455
 Amazing! 

277
00:20:30,455 --> 00:20:31,588
 So nice! 

278
00:20:31,588 --> 00:20:33,460
Banish the God of Plague!

279
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,010
 Good! 

280
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,620
 Banish the God of Plague! 

281
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,988
 Throw the gromwells! 

282
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:42,455
 Banish the God of Plague! 

283
00:20:42,455 --> 00:20:44,120
 Awesome! 

284
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:52,840
 Banish the God of Plague! 

285
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,340
 Nice! 

286
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,299
Go and investigate their background.

287
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:06,080
Yes!

288
00:21:08,055 --> 00:21:09,720
Put it here. Be cautious.

289
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,722
- Be careful! 
 - Elder Qin, is it enough?

290
00:21:11,722 --> 00:21:14,820
I've counted. It's enough for the Eagle Division.

291
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,262
Leave some here and wait for their check.

292
00:21:17,262 --> 00:21:19,280
I see.

293
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,132
Wait! Are you going to leave?

294
00:21:22,132 --> 00:21:25,700
What about me? What should I do?

295
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,265
As you've had enough fun, go back to your home.

296
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:29,900
Don't let your father worry about you.

297
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,080
Sir, what's going on?

298
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,766
Our leader wants to see you.

299
00:21:42,766 --> 00:21:44,860
Your leader?

300
00:21:45,966 --> 00:21:47,860
King of Mobei?

301
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,999
Sir, we're just commoners with no crimes.

302
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,243
Can you tell me why he wants to see us?

303
00:21:54,244 --> 00:21:58,140
Does it need a reason?

304
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,454
Fine.

305
00:21:59,454 --> 00:22:02,455
Well... I'll go with you.

306
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,740
Please let them set out.

307
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,340
Who are you?

308
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,400
Our leader wants to see you all!

309
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,600
Sir, please take it easy

310
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,160
and let us have a discussion first.

311
00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:19,279
Changge, what should we do now?

312
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,887
It's a crucial juncture for us.

313
00:22:20,888 --> 00:22:22,450
We cannot make any mistakes.

314
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,287
If we have a conflict with them,

315
00:22:24,288 --> 00:22:27,320
neither gromwell nor we can leave here.

316
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,880
That's it.

317
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,687
But if we follow them, won't we waste time?

318
00:22:31,688 --> 00:22:35,100
Just play it by ear. If things go wrong...

319
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,909
Please be at ease.

320
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:39,677
I know the map of Mobei well.

321
00:22:39,677 --> 00:22:40,954
If we want to break out of here,

322
00:22:40,955 --> 00:22:44,160
Yanxing Sect can come to our aid at any time.

323
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,110
All right. Sir, we'll follow you.

324
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,640
This way.

325
00:23:03,044 --> 00:23:04,943
It won't be easy.  Retreat first.

326
00:23:04,943 --> 00:23:07,240
Report to the leader at once.

327
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:53,640
Is Your Highness the King of Mobei, Yaoluoge Pusa?

328
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,799
I lead my trade caravan, passing your territory.

329
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:00,200
Please forgive our offense.

330
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,640
We do beg your pardon.

331
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,380
Forego formalities.

332
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,443
I've never thought that you were a pretty lady

333
00:24:23,444 --> 00:24:26,260
after you removed the God of Plague attire.

334
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,540
King of Mobei lost to a young lady.

335
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,944
Well, you're the other God of Plague.

336
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,700
Shut up.

337
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,000
Who allows you to see my face?

338
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,969
Oh, come on!

339
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,988
It's only because you lost to us.

340
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:50,620
You're as old as my uncle

341
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,277
and why are you still aggressive?

342
00:24:52,277 --> 00:24:54,988
You not only hate to face your failure but also want to play tricks.

343
00:24:54,988 --> 00:24:56,065
Shame on you!

344
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:57,522
Who is old?

345
00:24:57,522 --> 00:24:59,078
You!

346
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:02,100
You're at least 20 years older than me!

347
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,660
I won't argue with you.

348
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,080
My soldiers found plenty of gromwell in your carriages.

349
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,120
Tell me.

350
00:25:17,011 --> 00:25:18,555
Who are you?

351
00:25:18,555 --> 00:25:22,020
And why are you embezzling gromwell at all costs?

352
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,099
Please calm down.

353
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:28,455
We're non-native businessmen,

354
00:25:28,455 --> 00:25:30,540
knowing nothing about rules here.

355
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,176
As we cannot purchase gromwell,

356
00:25:33,177 --> 00:25:34,887
there's no other way for us.

357
00:25:34,887 --> 00:25:36,900
Why do you want gromwell?

358
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,200
Because trades of gromwell are banned in all tribes here.

359
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,943
Sounds interesting. Go ahead.

360
00:25:42,943 --> 00:25:46,010
We want profit so we care nothing about the risk.

361
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:50,199
Since the Ashile Tribe bans the trades, there must be guys who need it.

362
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:52,587
As you're subject to the Ashile Tribe,

363
00:25:52,587 --> 00:25:55,380
you dare not allow people to sell.

364
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,909
As long as we can get it,

365
00:25:56,909 --> 00:26:00,187
we can find buyers and double to send it.

366
00:26:00,187 --> 00:26:02,160
Huge profits.

367
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,799
By the way, I'm curious about one thing.

368
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,055
Go ahead.

369
00:26:10,055 --> 00:26:12,310
As you've noticed very early,

370
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,999
why didn't you inquire us when we won?

371
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:17,320
Why do you ask us now?

372
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,440
What are you waiting for?

373
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,920
You're smart

374
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,940
but you will have no chance to know it.

375
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,365
Soldiers, put these reckless guys in jail.

376
00:26:29,365 --> 00:26:31,480
- Yes! 
 - Hold on!

377
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,922
Do it at once!

378
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:34,720
Don't waste my time!

379
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,279
- Put them in jail! 
 - Go!

380
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,043
- We can't leave now. 
 - Let us go!

381
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:39,011
- Wait a second! 
 - Yaoluoge Pusa!

382
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:40,254
King!

383
00:26:40,254 --> 00:26:41,465
- You. 
 - King!

384
00:26:41,465 --> 00:26:42,980
Come here.

385
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,520
Have you let the soldiers of Monan leave?

386
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,543
Seeing their mistress be arrested, they hurried to leave and report.

387
00:26:53,543 --> 00:26:56,800
It's a smart young lady.

388
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,900
I see. You can leave.

389
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,187
Report to me as King of Monan comes.

390
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:02,840
Yes.

391
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,554
Is anyone here?

392
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:22,000
We want to leave!

393
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,021
Is anyone here?

394
00:27:23,022 --> 00:27:24,722
We want to see the King of Mobei!

395
00:27:24,722 --> 00:27:26,459
We need to see your king!

396
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,660
Come on!

397
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,479
Changge, what should we do?

398
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:35,454
We've stayed in Mobei for a few days

399
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:38,600
and we need eight or nine days to rush back without rest.

400
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,659
But we're now detained here,

401
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,010
knowing nothing about the time to leave.

402
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,450
Let's try to find a way to leave!

403
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,676
What my father has told me is right.

404
00:27:47,676 --> 00:27:49,960
This is a bad place!

405
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,840
Why do you say so?

406
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,070
Mobei and Monan were good neighbors.

407
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,019
A hundred years ago,

408
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,749
Mobei conquered Monan's ancestral territory.

409
00:28:01,749 --> 00:28:04,454
After that, they've had battles for a long time because of it.

410
00:28:04,454 --> 00:28:06,900
Afterward, the Ashile Tribe came.

411
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,243
Though they had no fights, both of them led a hard life

412
00:28:10,243 --> 00:28:12,339
and my father forbade me from going out to play.

413
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:15,400
So they're bitter enemies.

414
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,759
Though King of Mobei is the leader,

415
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:20,980
he's controlled by the Ashile Tribe.

416
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,129
According to his expressions,

417
00:28:23,129 --> 00:28:25,649
it seems that he's ashamed of it.

418
00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:27,643
All the people here are ashamed of it!

419
00:28:27,643 --> 00:28:29,165
No one wants to be a slave.

420
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,687
And no one wants to be controlled.

421
00:28:30,688 --> 00:28:33,888
Our trades of herbs even need to obey their rules!

422
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,349
Is anyone here?

423
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,920
- Why are you crying? 
 - Come over here!

424
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,999
Go to tell your king that I want to make a deal with him!

425
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,710
- Come back! 
 - You'll regret!

426
00:28:50,711 --> 00:28:52,188
Come back!

427
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,270
Take it easy.

428
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,929
My father will come to save us.

429
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,877
He's the bravest man in the world.

430
00:28:56,877 --> 00:28:58,110
How can I take it easy?

431
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,920
We need the herbs to save people's lives!

432
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,320
Hang in there, Mu Jin!

433
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,799
Mu Jin...

434
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,732
I need to get out... Come back! Let us leave!

435
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:14,080
I want to see your king!

436
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,140
Release us!

437
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,240
Hurry!

438
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,300
Is anyone here?

439
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,559
 Come on! 

440
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,440
 Let us go to see your king! 

441
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:32,299
Thanks to you, there have been no new patients recently.

442
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:35,820
All the patients we have are in stable condition.

443
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,100
General! Mu Jin seems to be in bad condition.

444
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,160
Taoist, how is he?

445
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,700
The plague is always changing.

446
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:02,960
A mutation will suddenly come during treatment.

447
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,420
I'm afraid... he's unlucky.

448
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:12,560
He's suddenly in the most dangerous condition.

449
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,019
Can you help him?

450
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:15,776
It's all up to his fate.

451
00:30:15,776 --> 00:30:16,980
What do you mean?

452
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,400
Cold and heat struggle in his body.

453
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,100
We must cool down his heat first.

454
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:29,360
But all my ways are in vain.

455
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,209
I'm afraid... he cannot hold out until the appointed time.

456
00:30:39,644 --> 00:30:41,510
Mimi...

457
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,120
Mimi...

458
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,140
Princess.

459
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:13,280
Do you think I'm old?

460
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,920
No.

461
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:20,140
You're still as brilliant as my first glimpse of you.

462
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:26,620
Only you and A Yi'er are sincere to me.

463
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,822
As for A Yi'er...

464
00:31:28,822 --> 00:31:33,100
No one can serve me better than her.

465
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:38,100
Unfortunately... she was Ashile Sun's mother.

466
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,280
She had to be killed by me in the end.

467
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,700
Being served by her for years,

468
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,840
I really didn't want to do so.

469
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,000
Forget it...

470
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,599
I don't need to make feints before her anymore.

471
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:00,140
What about finding you some new female slaves?

472
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:03,120
No, thank you.

473
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,132
Do you want to report anything to me?

474
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,680
Report to Your Highness.

475
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,359
I have some news from the desert.

476
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:11,832
Ashile Sun didn't go there himself.

477
00:32:11,832 --> 00:32:14,460
He appointed his female slave to go there.

478
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,410
Mimi Guli went with her as well.

479
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:20,310
And someone from the Central Plains accompanied them.

480
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,220
Female Slave...

481
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,500
Central Plains...

482
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,177
She's Li Changge.

483
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:27,600
I think so.

484
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,420
I've never thought he would let Li Changge

485
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,420
go to complete such a crucial task.

486
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,780
It seems their relationship is unusual.

487
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:39,554
Li Changge is not a common lady.

488
00:32:39,555 --> 00:32:40,944
Keep a close eye on her.

489
00:32:40,944 --> 00:32:42,840
Please be at ease.

490
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,119
They have been arrested by the King of Mobei.

491
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,699
Because of the prohibition of gromwell?

492
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:51,440
Yes. Mobei fears Khan's tent and dares not to violate it.

493
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,720
Sensible boys.

494
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,309
But don't let down our guard.

495
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:59,209
Ask someone to warn Mimi Guli secretly

496
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:01,076
not to forget her task.

497
00:33:01,076 --> 00:33:02,421
At your command.

498
00:33:02,421 --> 00:33:05,910
Besides, call up ten thousand infantrymen, each from Mobei and Monan.

499
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:08,065
Step up the practice.

500
00:33:08,065 --> 00:33:09,299
I will.

501
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:15,540
By the way, you've told me to find me some new female slaves?

502
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,940
Then bring me their wives and daughters.

503
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,165
I see.

504
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:23,165
In addition, ask a new emissary to go to Mobei,

505
00:33:23,165 --> 00:33:25,520
showing him Li Changge's image.

506
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,543
I want to know all the Eagle Division's movements in Mobei.

507
00:33:28,543 --> 00:33:30,240
Yes.

508
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,109
King, they're clamoring to see you again.

509
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:41,188
Who?

510
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,388
The one who dressed up as the God of Plague.

511
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:46,290
They call her "Changge."

512
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,879
Can she come to see me as she wants?

513
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,320
- Let them alone. 
 - Yes.

514
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,880
King, the King of Monan comes.

515
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,100
He came quickly this time.

516
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,700
- Bring him in. 
 - Yes.

517
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:04,621
You. Go to the jail and bring his daughter here.

518
00:34:04,621 --> 00:34:06,355
Yes!

519
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,500
We must protect our Young Master.

520
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,276
Play it by ear.

521
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,600
Come on! We wasted an entire night!

522
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,180
How is Eagle Division?

523
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,189
Why hasn't no one come yet?

524
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:39,740
If we can't make a deal with them, then let's break out.

525
00:34:40,544 --> 00:34:42,340
What's the probability of success?

526
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,232
About 60%.

527
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:46,080
We can have a try.

528
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,390
Fine.

529
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,800
Let's prepare for it first and then take action in thirty minutes.

530
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,444
All right.

531
00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:00,065
Is he willing to see me?

532
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:01,466
You?

533
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:02,799
Impossible.

534
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:05,680
Our king wants to see Princess Tujia.

535
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,110
Princess Tujia?

536
00:35:07,111 --> 00:35:09,900
Is there anyone called that?

537
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,540
Princess Tujia. Princess Tujia.

538
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,143
Don't bother me!

539
00:35:23,143 --> 00:35:26,140
Tell my father I'll get up later.

540
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,040
Time to get up, Princess Tujia.

541
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:32,720
You're Princess Tujia?

542
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,543
Our king asked Princess Tujia to come see him.

543
00:35:37,543 --> 00:35:39,509
Where is she?

544
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,543
Father... My father must have come to save me!

545
00:35:41,543 --> 00:35:43,780
I am!

546
00:35:44,788 --> 00:35:46,690
This way, please.

547
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,387
Don't worry!

548
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:52,020
When I see my father, I'll beg him to get you out!

549
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,640
I thought you would come in the afternoon.

550
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,380
But you came early in the morning.

551
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,360
You're really impatient.

552
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,432
Pusa, I don't want to argue with you.

553
00:36:18,432 --> 00:36:20,121
Tell me where my daughter is!

554
00:36:20,121 --> 00:36:23,732
Yinan, can you be polite?

555
00:36:23,732 --> 00:36:25,877
Your words are ugly.

556
00:36:25,877 --> 00:36:29,522
Your daughter carried soldiers of Monan, crossing my territory,

557
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:32,943
and stole gromwell with unidentified spies, trying to carry them away.

558
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:35,199
I haven't blamed you for all these things,

559
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,633
yet you're now quarreling with me?

560
00:36:36,633 --> 00:36:40,121
Spies? What spies?

561
00:36:40,121 --> 00:36:44,220
I thought you ordered them to do that.

562
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,760
After thinking for a while,

563
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,960
you might have known Ashile Tribe's order

564
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,040
about banning trades of gromwell.

565
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,154
I think you dare not violate its order.

566
00:36:55,155 --> 00:36:58,287
Pusa! How dare you!

567
00:36:58,287 --> 00:37:02,577
I can fight with you but let my daughter off first!

568
00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:08,360
- Tujia! 
 - Father!

569
00:37:09,577 --> 00:37:10,822
Pusa!

570
00:37:10,822 --> 00:37:12,329
If you hurt her,

571
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:16,700
then my troops will be ready to fight!

572
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,320
Yinan.

573
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,000
Haven't we got enough battles already?

574
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,788
If Ashile Tribe knows she carried gromwell away secretly,

575
00:37:25,788 --> 00:37:28,479
- I'm afraid... 
 - What do you want?

576
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:32,887
Do you know that they called up soldiers from us quite often?

577
00:37:32,888 --> 00:37:34,566
Get to the point!

578
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:38,310
The day before yesterday, they came to call up again.

579
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,299
I've promised them that I'll give them in ten days.

580
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,876
I've heard you carried a battalion of cavalry elites

581
00:37:43,876 --> 00:37:46,488
to find your daughter.

582
00:37:46,488 --> 00:37:50,433
What about leaving them here and carrying her back?

583
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:51,700
What do you think?

584
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,322
You've gone too far.

585
00:37:53,322 --> 00:37:55,300
Think of it.

586
00:37:57,533 --> 00:37:59,660
Father...

587
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,760
Fine. I agree.

588
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,254
Let her go.

589
00:38:05,254 --> 00:38:07,280
Let her go.

590
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,543
- Tujia! 
 - Father!

591
00:38:09,543 --> 00:38:10,887
Tujia!

592
00:38:10,887 --> 00:38:13,199
My daughter! Did you get hurt?

593
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:15,809
Did I make trouble for you again?

594
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:18,299
My daughter, don't be willful later on.

595
00:38:18,299 --> 00:38:20,343
- Let's go back home. 
 - Father!

596
00:38:20,343 --> 00:38:21,910
I wish you could do me a favor.

597
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:25,019
I have some new friends and they've been arrested, too.

598
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:27,960
Can you help them?

599
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,600
What friends?

600
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,665
I know you're not interested in gromwell.

601
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:32,859
Did they encourage you to do so?

602
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:35,119
No! They're good people.

603
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,366
Your daughter is really simple.

604
00:38:37,366 --> 00:38:39,600
She believes in all others' words.

605
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,180
Beware of deceptions.

606
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,800
Father, don't listen to him!

607
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,754
If you only know them by chance, then don't raise new issues.

608
00:38:46,754 --> 00:38:48,399
Father, please meet them.

609
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,776
Then you'll know they're all good!

610
00:38:50,777 --> 00:38:53,900
Changge told me they needed gromwell to save people!

611
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,880
Save people?

612
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,687
Pusa, bring her here.

613
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,732
More people, more cost.

614
00:39:04,732 --> 00:39:06,600
Can you afford it?

615
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,360
It's my business.

616
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,640
Just bring her here.

617
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,149
You. Go and bring her here.

618
00:39:15,149 --> 00:39:16,700
Yes.

619
00:39:49,933 --> 00:39:53,279
The noble emissary from Khan's Tent is here.

620
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,200
How dare you not go out to welcome me?

621
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,980
Well, can pigs fly now?

622
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,420
You guys stay together?

623
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:07,876
Fine. Then I don't need to go to Monan in the hot sun.

624
00:40:07,876 --> 00:40:10,180
 The emissary from Khan's tent? 

625
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,443
What's the matter again?

626
00:40:11,444 --> 00:40:12,987
Two things.

627
00:40:12,987 --> 00:40:16,920
First, Great Khan orders Mobei and Monan

628
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,533
to deliver ten thousand infantrymen separately.

629
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:21,600
Set out in ten days.

630
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,911
Where to go?

631
00:40:25,911 --> 00:40:29,620
Go to enlist in the troop of Dingxiang.

632
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:35,480
 Khan's tent is forcing them to deliver. Dingxiang... 

633
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,899
Second, thanks to all your tribes for serving King's Tent.

634
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:44,599
Khan asked Khatun to invite all your female families

635
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,520
to Khan's Tent and stay for a few days.

636
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,943
What female families?

637
00:40:48,943 --> 00:40:51,740
Wife and daughter.

638
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,810
I have no wife and daughter.

639
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,743
I'm afraid you've made a futile run.

640
00:40:57,743 --> 00:41:01,140
I hear your mother is still alive...

641
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:09,122
I hear there's a cute young princess in Monan.

642
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:11,640
I won't go!

643
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,160
Well, here you are.

644
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,221
That's all. I've told you all.

645
00:41:20,221 --> 00:41:22,760
No one can violate Khan's orders.

646
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,120
Behave yourselves.

647
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,743
 Do you remember? 

648
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:52,510
 Yes. 

649
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:54,280
 Don't alert them. 

650
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,360
 Report to me about her things at any time! 

651
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,280
 I've never seen him before... 

652
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,560
 but it seems he knows me? 

653
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,810
That man! We can't let him leave!

654
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,876
Who are you?

655
00:42:17,876 --> 00:42:19,740
Changge!

656
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:22,720
She's the one you want.

657
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,400
I won't hold back.

658
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,899
I'm the military counselor of the Eagle Division, Ashile Sun's trusted follower.

659
00:42:28,899 --> 00:42:30,177
Capture that man at once.

660
00:42:30,177 --> 00:42:32,957
I'll be solely responsible for the consequences!

661
00:42:33,955 --> 00:42:35,269
How to be responsible for it?

662
00:42:35,269 --> 00:42:37,521
If you offend Khan's tent, no one here can be free!

663
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:39,476
You cannot be free now!

664
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:42,776

I came to Mobei to find gromwell. Because the plague has hit Eagle Division.

666
00:42:50,365 --> 00:42:53,133
But meanwhile, Khan's tent has blocked all the access to the gromwell.

667
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:55,540
What does it mean?

668
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,310
It means they have abandoned Eagle Division.

669
00:42:57,311 --> 00:43:00,520
Now, we have to form an alliance!
