How about... How about letting me stay here?

00:02:59,118 --> 00:03:00,800
I can do any work.

Embroidery?

53
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,079
Like the pouch that you embroidered?

54
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,479
That's the ugliest pouch I've ever seen.

55
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,199
With such a level of embroidery,

Can't I keep her?

76
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,498
Surely you can.

77
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:52,799
But she can't know how to work, according to her appearance.

78
00:04:52,799 --> 00:04:55,360
You can employ anyone but her.

79
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,819
I want to employ her because her salary is low.

80
00:04:57,819 --> 00:04:59,739
I'd love to.

81
00:05:03,899 --> 00:05:07,158
All right. She hasn't done any work before.

82
00:05:07,158 --> 00:05:10,059
Please help her a little bit.

83

That's it.

Please teach her well.

89
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:24,218
You learn it well.

90
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:26,700
All right. I'll teach her.

91
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,009
This is shuttle.

00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:30,108

00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,108
General, the list of spoils in Shuo State has been sorted.

98
00:05:54,109 --> 00:05:56,428
Should I send it to Khan's Tent?

99
00:05:56,429 --> 00:05:58,310
Let several reliable men send it.

100
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,710
Yes.

101
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:05,909
You're not going to send it on your own?

102
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,029
It's such an achievement.

103
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:09,909
And you don't show your loyalty in front of Great Khan.

104
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:13,069
Since he's very suspicious, he might think you want to betray him.

105
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,708
I used to let others send it.

106
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:18,009
If I go there myself this time, he will get suspicious.

107
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:22,970
What are you doing here?

108
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,010
I have something to tell you.

109
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,869
You've seen it. Sun doesn't want to talk to you.

110
00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:31,410
- Just go.
- I can be your military counselor.

111
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,789
Now you're bragging.

112
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,428
I mean. Who are you?

113
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:38,189
Are you the one making decisions in Eagle Division?

114
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,090
Stop driving a wedge between Sun and me.

115
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:45,009
You—

116
00:06:45,829 --> 00:06:47,668
Your reason?

117
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:50,409
Since I work for you and mainly assist you,

118
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,870
I have to do something useful.

119
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,988
I'm good at strategies.

120
00:06:54,989 --> 00:06:58,490
That General brought me here must be out of that reason.

121
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,710
Please allow me to be your assistant.

122
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,069
My defeated opponent.

123
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,890
You can really brag.

124
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:11,828
Tell me. Why should I use a stranger like you as my assistant.

125
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:15,690
Actually, I've been thinking about a question.

126
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,828
Great Khan let Eagle Division be the pioneer to attack Shuo State.

127
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:22,690
However, the army that you led was not for attacking a city.

128
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,029
Besides, you haven't fought against Great Tang before.

129
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:30,268
Therefore, Great Khan seemed not to care about the result.

130
00:07:30,269 --> 00:07:33,690
What's worse, he might want you to lose.

131
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,690
Nonsense!

132
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:41,949
- Go on.
- It reminds me of what it was like in Shuo State that day.

133
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:44,569
Eagle Division and Bear Division hindered each other.

134
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:46,828
And you were even competing in public.

135
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:49,388
If Bear Division wasn't supported by someone,

136
00:07:49,389 --> 00:07:51,668
it would have been hard for him to do that.

137
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:54,699
After all, you're the adopted son of Great Khan.

138
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,029
What exactly are you trying to say?

139
00:07:56,029 --> 00:07:57,488
So I guessed it correctly.

140
00:07:57,488 --> 00:07:59,268
General's position in Ashile Tribe

141
00:07:59,269 --> 00:08:02,250
is way less solid than what others think.

142
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,410
But you're the adopted son of Great Khan.

143
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,250
And you have an army.

144
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,309
I don't believe you want to do nothing.

145
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,329
I'm loyal to Great Khan.

146
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:12,360
Great Khan also trusts me.

147
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,470
You don't need to incite between us two.

148
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:17,970
About your words, does Great Khan believe it?

149
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,750
Do Great Khan's nephews believe that?

150
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,710
How did you know these things?

151
00:08:25,429 --> 00:08:29,950
So, do you think I'm qualified to be your assistant?

152
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,909
What's your requirement?

153
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,828
I'll be your military counselor and can realize three wishes for you.

154
00:08:39,829 --> 00:08:42,989
However, you can't do harm to Great Tang.

155
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,770
And you can't do ruthless things.

156
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:48,790
When I finish the three tasks, please let me leave here.

157
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,290
Okay.

158
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,068
- Sun!
- From now on, you're no longer a slave.

159
00:08:55,069 --> 00:08:56,989
But I won't help you, either.

160
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,989
You need to depend on your ability to survive here in Eagle Division.

161
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,589
When you have finished those three wishes, I will set you free.

162
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,690
After that,

163
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:10,070
if you still want to take revenge on me,

164
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:12,470
I'll wait for you.

165
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,890
Have you decided on your three wishes?

166
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,469
Not yet.

167
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,708
But it's like making wishes.

168
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:23,388
The time when I decide it, you should realize it for me.

169
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:25,989
Okay. I accept that.

170
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,268
But just as I said, you can't do harm to Great Tang.

171
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,230
And you can't do ruthless things.

172
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:34,790
These days, I'll depend on my own ability

173
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,868
to get a firm foothold here in Eagle Division.

174
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,828
Please wait for my performance, General.

175
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,629
You have a deal.

176
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:43,930
Unlock her iron chain.

177
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,010
<i>[Weaving Workshop of Western Suburb]</i>

178
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:04,989
Let's pause and have a rest.

179
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,000
You must feel tired..

180
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,900
I bought some pastries. Everyone can eat.

181
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,029
Pastries?

182
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,109
- Pastries!
- Pastries.

183
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,268
Come here.

184
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:12,268
- Come.
- Thank you.

185
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:13,308
You all can enjoy them.

186
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:14,250
<i>- Thanks.
- Thank you.</i>

187
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,308
<i>- Thank you.
- Ms. Chai.</i>

188
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:16,769
Why are you so generous today?

189
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:17,769
<i>- Right.
- Right.</i>

190
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:19,628
You don't even buy sesame cakes on normal days.

191
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:20,589
Did you get an order?

192
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,188
Right.

193
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:25,449
A businessman, Mr. Hu, ordered a batch of goods.

194
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:27,729
It's enough for us to spend for several months!

195
00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:28,909
<i>Really?</i>

196
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,789
<i>- Great!
- That's great.</i>

197
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,268
So you have to work hard.

198
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:34,188
After finishing the pastries, continue working.

199
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:35,308
<i>Okay. Let's go.</i>

200
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:36,828
<i>Continue working.</i>

201
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:38,429
<i>That's tasty.</i>

202
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,709
Miss Li, have some pastries also.

203
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:45,068
You can do it later.

204
00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:48,469
You're new here. I don't have any expectations for you.

205
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:51,490
Whether you do it well or badly, it doesn't matter.

206
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,810
Ms. Chai, if I do it badly, I can start over.

207
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,780
It doesn't matter...

208
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,720
Eat some pastries first. You can do it later.

209
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,348
Li Yueyan! What have you done?

210
00:11:06,348 --> 00:11:08,129
Look! Look at it! Did you see?

211
00:11:08,129 --> 00:11:09,808
I'll do it again. I'll start over.

212
00:11:09,808 --> 00:11:11,309
No. No. Don't do it.

213
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:13,589
Please stop. Please.

214
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:16,369
Look at the thread on your head.

215
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:18,509
- I...
- That's...

216
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,390
I...

217
00:11:21,529 --> 00:11:22,449
Sun!

218
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:25,208
Great Khan is suddenly coming. And he's with She'er.

219
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,569
Great Khan has never come here on his own initiative.

220
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:29,848
I suppose something big might happened.

221
00:11:29,848 --> 00:11:31,728
Could it be about Shuo State?

222
00:11:31,728 --> 00:11:33,729
About Shuo State,

223
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:36,989
it was me who made agreements secretly with Gongsun Heng.

224
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:38,859
You knew nothing.

225
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,470
It also has nothing to do with the men in Eagle Division.

226
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,409
Understand?

227
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:44,200
What are you going to do?

228
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,110
Since I accepted Gongsun Heng's offer,

229
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,470
I'd thought about things that would happen today.

230
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,569
I made the decision myself.

231
00:11:51,569 --> 00:11:54,450
If Great Khan wants to blame us,

232
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,329
you only need to protect yourself.

233
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:59,890
Have you thought of a way to get yourself out of this?

234
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,789
No one can be totally sure about anything.

235
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,590
I'll do my best.

236
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:08,629
Prepare the list of spoils to welcome Great Khan.

237
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,270
Come.

238
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,549
You...

239
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,789
Li Shisi, let me go.

240
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,269
Tell me what happened exactly.

241
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:25,169
I don't know.

242
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:27,168
Stop playing dumb.

243
00:12:27,168 --> 00:12:28,430
What exactly do you want?

244
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,909
I want to know the truth.

245
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:33,790
Pardoning Shuo State was Sun's own decision.

246
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,429
Great Khan didn't know that.

247
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:40,130
If Great Khan were there, almost everyone in Shuo State would have died.

248
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,690
Though Sun looks indifferent and cold,

249
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,088
he's actually the most humane one.

250
00:12:47,088 --> 00:12:49,748
He already knew it was you that led the army in Shuo State.

251
00:12:49,749 --> 00:12:52,748
About that arrow to you, he missed the target on purpose.

252
00:12:52,748 --> 00:12:54,909
He even worried if he was too good at shooting.

253
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,168
And he kept asking me if you were fine.

254
00:12:58,168 --> 00:13:00,968
Also, before taking you away from Shuo State,

255
00:13:00,968 --> 00:13:05,129
he posted that you tried to kill the leader of the Ashile Tribe but failed

256
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:07,729
and have been executed and died for the people.

257
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:10,308
That was for your reputation as the Commandant of Shuo State.

258
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:13,249
And you? How did you treat him?

259
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,628
I don't want to talk too much with you.

260
00:13:16,628 --> 00:13:18,409
Great Khan comes here this time.

261
00:13:18,409 --> 00:13:20,489
Sun did disobey Great Khan's order.

262
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:22,129
As for She'er,

263
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:24,049
he's Sun's sworn enemy.

264
00:13:24,049 --> 00:13:28,330
If his plot works, Sun will be in danger.

265
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,650
I have to think of a way to save him.

266
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,909
Did Ashile Sun tell you how he would deal with that?

267
00:13:33,909 --> 00:13:36,010
I don't know.

268
00:13:47,729 --> 00:13:51,289
Greetings to Great Khan from Ashile Sun.

269
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,230
Stand up.

270
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:12,429
Father comes here on your own this time.

271
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:14,490
I wonder what your instructions are.

272
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:17,750
No need to be so serious.

273
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,769
Take a seat.

274
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:20,369
Yes.

275
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:30,528
Sun, we two haven't seen each other for long.

276
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,890
I wanted to visit here on a whim.

277
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,268
Now, Eagle Division is well trained and equipped.

278
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:37,409
Your people all look energetic.

279
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:38,809
That's good.

280
00:14:38,809 --> 00:14:40,469
I feel relieved.

281
00:14:40,469 --> 00:14:44,168
The prosperity in Ashile Tribe owes it all to Father.

282
00:14:44,168 --> 00:14:48,409
What Eagle Division depends on is also Father's grace.

283
00:14:48,409 --> 00:14:52,689
Sun, that's too modest for you to say that.

284
00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:54,748
I dare not lie to you, Father.

285
00:14:54,749 --> 00:15:00,490
I've been hearing that Sun's the God of War here.

286
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:03,129
I thought that was boasting.

287
00:15:03,129 --> 00:15:07,399
I didn't expect at the first battle between Eagle Division and Great Tang,

288
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,930
you successfully conquered Shuo State within only ten days.

289
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:18,089
My Sun'er, you're indeed the God of War.

290
00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:21,050
Ashile Tribe is well known for its battle-wise soldiers.

291
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:25,290
It's natural that Eagle Division to conquer Shuo State successfully.

292
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:29,929
Ashile Sun, you're indeed good at the art of language.

293
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:33,010
But you seemed not to have told the truth.

294
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,250
What do you mean?

295
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,270
Shuo State has been hard to conquer.

296
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,868
Uncle Khan has been attacking for years, but still couldn't conquer it.

297
00:15:41,868 --> 00:15:45,208
Why did they open the city gate for you once you were there?

298
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:48,930
Uncle Khan, don't you think that's too strange?

299
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:54,729
She'er, tell me why it's strange.

300
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,370
Just be straightforward.

301
00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:00,309
Great Khan has ordered that after conquering the city,

302
00:16:00,309 --> 00:16:02,909
you have to eliminate all of the soldiers and supplies.

303
00:16:02,909 --> 00:16:05,508
Shuo State is the key place to the northern pass.

304
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:08,789
Only by doing so, can we not give Great Tang any chance to take a breath.

305
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:11,589
But I heard that after you conquered the city,

306
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,849
you not only held an elaborate funeral for Gongsun Heng,

307
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:16,610
but also pardoned everyone in the city.

308
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,330
Ashile Sun, is it because you're afraid of death

309
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:22,820
so that you want to betray us?

310
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:28,990
Sun, is that true?

311
00:16:31,169 --> 00:16:35,189
Right. I did give the order.

312
00:16:36,109 --> 00:16:37,968
Uncle Khan, have you heard that?

313
00:16:37,968 --> 00:16:42,189
He admitted that he betrayed you and Ashile Tribe.

314
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:46,289
Are you doubting my loyalty, Father?

315
00:16:56,189 --> 00:16:58,449
<i>He already knew it was you that led the army in Shuo State.</i>

316
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:01,029
<i>About that arrow to you, he missed the target on purpose.</i>

317
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,628
<i>He even worried if he was too good at shooting.</i>

318
00:17:02,628 --> 00:17:06,449
<i>And he kept asking me if you were fine.</i>

319
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:09,268
<i>As for She'er, he's Sun's sworn enemy.</i>

320
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:13,229
<i>If his plot works, Sun will be in danger.</i>

321
00:17:13,229 --> 00:17:16,850
<i>Though Ashile Sun didn't do exactly as what Great Khan ordered,</i>

322
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:20,870
<i>he won the battle at such a low price after all.</i>

323
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:24,348
<i>Anyway, that can't be a fault.</i>

324
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:27,240
<i>Great Khan came here on his own to inquire Sun.</i>

325
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,160
<i>There should be something more complicated.</i>

326
00:17:31,409 --> 00:17:34,169
What's exactly going on?

327
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:39,810
Go get some water.

328
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,410
Yes.

329
00:17:42,169 --> 00:17:44,368
If it weren't for Young Khan wanting to make use of you,

330
00:17:44,368 --> 00:17:46,868
I'd definitely beat you to death. Bastard Tang man.

331
00:17:46,868 --> 00:17:49,489
You kept making the request.

332
00:17:49,489 --> 00:17:51,489
Do you really think you're a big figure?

333
00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:53,549
I'll kill you someday.

334
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:55,449
<i>Tang man?</i>

335
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:58,449
<i>Why did Young Khan bring a Tang man here?</i>

336
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,060
<i>Something's wrong.</i>

337
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,770
If I didn't trust you,

338
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:21,849
I wouldn't have given you any chance to explain.

339
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:23,850
Thank you, Father.

340
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,549
This is the letter that Gongsun Heng, governor of Shuo State, wrote to me.

341
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:38,769
Please have a check, Father.

342
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:46,168
Gongsun Heng's been guarding the frontier for years.

343
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:48,489
Our tribe launched many attacks but was defeated by him.

344
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:50,528
We lost a lot.
<i>[General Sun...]</i>

345
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:55,529
If I attacked Shuo State by force, many of our men would have died.

346
00:18:55,529 --> 00:18:57,748
Gongsun Heng pursued it for peace this time.

347
00:18:57,748 --> 00:19:00,189
He wanted to kill himself for the people's lives in that city.

348
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:03,369
When he died, big harm to our tribe would disappear,

349
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:07,990
and we could also win at the lowest price.

350
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,070
That's why I accepted his offer.

351
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,909
You even pardoned Tang's soldiers. How can you explain that?

352
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:16,950
Most of the soldiers in Shuo State died. There were only old and disabled soldiers left.

353
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,369
They can't attack at all.

354
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:23,209
If not so, Gongsun Heng wouldn't have made the request.

355
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:28,969
He killed himself as promised and opened the city gate for us.

356
00:19:28,969 --> 00:19:34,169
As the son of Great Khan, how could I break my promise?

357
00:19:34,169 --> 00:19:37,529
Father, please pass judgment.

358
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,690
These are Gong Sunheng's head and the list of all spoils.

359
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,190
Please have a look, Great Khan.

360
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:25,070
Enough. No need to check it.

361
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,188
Sun, you were right.

362
00:20:29,188 --> 00:20:30,809
The descendants born in the grasslands

363
00:20:30,809 --> 00:20:34,690
have always been upright and magnanimous.

364
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:38,809
Gongsun Heng is a respectable opponent.

365
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:43,288
Just hold the funeral on my behalf according to our etiquette.

366
00:20:43,288 --> 00:20:46,010
Yes, Father.

367
00:20:54,409 --> 00:21:00,608
Sun, I have another thing to ask you this time.

368
00:21:12,589 --> 00:21:14,259
Nu Er.

369
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:16,150
What are you doing? Though you're not a slave now,

370
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,729
you still can't order me to do anything.

371
00:21:17,729 --> 00:21:20,259
Nu Er, you have to help me this time.

372
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,109
You're indeed not taking yourself as a stranger.

373
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,489
Listen. If you don't help me this time,

374
00:21:24,489 --> 00:21:29,550
your general and the whole Eagle Division will face disaster.

375
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,789
Ashile Sun, if you admit it yourself,

376
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:38,129
I can still plead for you to Uncle Khan.

377
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:39,908
I don't know what you're talking about.

378
00:21:39,908 --> 00:21:43,410
So you refuse to admit it until you face the reality.

379
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:50,310
Uncle Khan, Ashile Sun colluded with Great Tang and harmed our tribe.

380
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,929
That's venomous slander!

381
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:54,229
When I was in You State, I could have almost succeeded.

382
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:58,559
But, Ashile Sun, you colluded with the envoy of Great Tang and let him take the army to assist.

383
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:01,329
Then Great Tang won back You State again.

384
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:04,450
And my Wolf Division's effort was in vain.

385
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,430
You betrayed Great Khan and colluded with Great Tang.

386
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,388
Stop pretending to be loyal.

387
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:14,509
Sun, is that true?

388
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:20,329
I swear to God of Sirius that this never happened.

389
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:24,330
Uncle Khan, there's a general betraying Great Tang.

390
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:27,569
He escaped on his way being sent to Chang'an.

391
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:29,309
And he's finally under my control.

392
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:33,169
He used to work for the Prince of Lujiang, called Wang Junkuo.

393
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:37,148
Young Khan, you ruined things in You State yourself.

394
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:39,868
And now you want to slander General Sun. What do you mean?

395
00:22:39,868 --> 00:22:42,289
Mu Jin, go outside.

396
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:47,789
Ashile Sun, you must be familiar with him.

397
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:51,810
If you haven't done anything, dare you to talk with him in person?

398
00:22:52,989 --> 00:22:55,760
Uncle Khan, my men of Wolf Division all died for nothing.

399
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,040
That's unfair.

400
00:23:00,409 --> 00:23:04,309
Guards, bring the traitor here.

401
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:05,910
Yes.

402
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:16,168
I might be insane that I'd follow you here.

403
00:23:16,168 --> 00:23:19,190
You want to do it in front of Great Khan. That's impossible.

404
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,869
Even General Sun can't protect you.

405
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:22,549
I didn't say I'd do anything.

406
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,789
You won't do anything? You want to win by just talking?

407
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:27,250
I indeed plan to win by talking.

408
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,429
Later, I'll yell that Young Khan's horse is lost.

409
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:32,149
I'll keep away the guards. You should finish the rest part.

410
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:33,829
What do you mean?

411
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,108
I'm just here to help you.

412
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:39,009
The man that Young Khan brought here was the General of You State. He met me before.

413
00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:41,768
I can't go inside. Only you can do this.

414
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:44,449
You... Are you serious?

415
00:23:44,449 --> 00:23:47,209
I'll teach you how to do it. Come here.

416
00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:49,530
When you get in...

417
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:51,930
Will it work?

418
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,830
It's on you now.

419
00:24:02,389 --> 00:24:03,829
Young Khan's horse's running away!

420
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:06,710
Young Khan's horse's running away! Get it!

421
00:24:13,429 --> 00:24:17,429
Ashile Sun, have you well considered it?

422
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:21,309
If you admit your mistake now, maybe Uncle Khan would spare your life

423
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,829
considering your previous achievements.

424
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,970
When Wang Junkuo gets here and explains everything,

425
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,229
you won't feel easy by that time.

426
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,468
Even if you don't care about yourself,

427
00:24:32,469 --> 00:24:35,310
you should think about Eagle Division.

428
00:24:36,629 --> 00:24:44,029
Sun, as long as you can admit your mistake and explain yourself,

429
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:46,589
I'll forgive you.

430
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,370
I feel no shame.

431
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,450
I haven't done anything harmful to Father.

432
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,750
<i>Great Khan. The man is here.</i>

433
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,849
Bring him in.

434
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:20,869
Greetings to Great Khan from Wang Junkuo.

435
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:24,389
Explain to me what happened in You State.

436
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:32,188
Wang Junkuo, have you seen Ashile Sun in You State?

437
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:44,469
Great Khan, I don't have those things.

438
00:25:44,469 --> 00:25:46,649
I gave the key to Young Khan.

439
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:50,779
Everything was done by Young Khan himself.

440
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:52,149
As for the loss of treasury,

441
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:55,988
I think only Young Khan knows what happened.

442
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:59,529
Wang Junkuo, what are you talking about?

443
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:04,829
Explain first what you have seen about Ashile Sun in You State.

444
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,289
Please. Great Khan, it's true.

445
00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:08,388
I want to work for you sincerely.

446
00:26:08,389 --> 00:26:10,829
How would I dare occupy the treasury myself?

447
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,849
About those things... Young Khan must have them.

448
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:15,449
He has been following General Sun.

449
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:18,230
I think he must want something from Sun.

450
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:31,580
- Uncle Khan.
- Ashile Sun,

451
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:34,580
you conquered Shuo State within ten days.

452
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:35,949
That was a great achievement.

453
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,829
You deserve a big award.

454
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,288
You can take half of the spoils of the war in Shuo State.

455
00:26:41,288 --> 00:26:43,289
Thank you, Father.

456
00:26:44,289 --> 00:26:49,489
Sun, you seem not to have enough people in your tent.

457
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:54,189
When I'm back, I'll carefully select several bondwomen for you

458
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,108
and send them to your tent.

459
00:26:56,109 --> 00:26:58,469
Thanks a lot, Father.

460
00:27:01,529 --> 00:27:03,468
She'er.

461
00:27:03,468 --> 00:27:04,530
Uncle Khan.

462
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,789
That's quite a "good job" this time.

463
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,189
Uncle Khan.

464
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,890
Uncle Khan, please allow me to explain.

465
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:42,169
I was so scared.

466
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,230
Well done.

467
00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:48,499
How did you know about the treasury in You State?

468
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:49,988
When Wang Junkuo heard that Young Khan

469
00:27:49,989 --> 00:27:52,388
would say he secretly occupied the treasury in You State,

470
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:53,709
he panicked instantly.

471
00:27:53,710 --> 00:27:55,829
Then he didn't remember to slander General Sun.

472
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:58,089
Actually, She'er didn't occupy the treasury.

473
00:27:58,089 --> 00:28:00,268
But Wang Junkuo knew nothing.

474
00:28:00,268 --> 00:28:03,569
He had nothing, so he cherished his life very much.

475
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:06,388
He was afraid that Great Khan would think he stole the treasury,

476
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:08,210
that's why he said She'er did that.

477
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:11,588
Actually, I just wanted to gamble.

478
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,169
I didn't expect that would be quite a success.

479
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:18,379
It must be because General is lucky, so we could win the bet.

480
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,050
Thanks to God of Sirius.

481
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,210
Military Counselor, you're marvelous.

482
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:25,168
You saved not only General but also the whole Eagle Division.

483
00:28:25,168 --> 00:28:27,930
I really admire you.

484
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:31,870
From now on, we're friends.

485
00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:56,049
I knew you were here.

486
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:00,368
Every time Great Khan did something to you due to She'er,

487
00:29:00,368 --> 00:29:03,630
you'd stay here and say nothing.

488
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:08,050
What happened today, wasn't solved by you, right?

489
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,870
What? You don't think I can do that?

490
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:15,188
Fine.

491
00:29:15,188 --> 00:29:17,869
It was Li Shisi. He solved it.

492
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:20,929
He can think of different ideas and is good at using people's minds.

493
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:22,730
I don't know where he got the information

494
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,929
that the taboo here is secretly holding spoils.

495
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:28,349
That's why he could entrap She'er.

496
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:31,208
Thanks to my wisdom.

497
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:34,770
I told him everything about what you did in Shuo State.

498
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,208
Otherwise, he might not have helped you.

499
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:38,909
You...

500
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:45,209
Wait. Where are you going?

501
00:29:45,209 --> 00:29:47,050
Sun.

502
00:29:48,229 --> 00:29:50,329
Roast lamb leg!

503
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,509
You asked Nu Er to keep an eye on Li Shisi.

504
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:56,870
I think it's not going to work.

505
00:29:57,789 --> 00:29:59,589
What do you mean?

506
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,169
They live in the same tent.

507
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:03,889
And today they uncovered She'er's plot together.

508
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:06,369
Naturally, their relationship would be better.

509
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:07,908
Look at Nu Er.

510
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:11,669
He treats Li Shisi with food and wine.

511
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:13,489
<i>Good wine.</i>

512
00:30:13,489 --> 00:30:14,668
<i>You can really drink.</i>

513
00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:18,528
Mu Jin, arrange a single tent for Li Shisi.

514
00:30:18,528 --> 00:30:20,568
All right. I'll do it tomorrow.

515
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,390
Do it now.

516
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,829
Look at your eyes.

517
00:30:25,829 --> 00:30:28,830
I want to arrange it tomorrow.

518
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:34,029
Never mind. I don't care about your pettiness.

519
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,530
One more cup.

520
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,030
Cheers.

521
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,128
- Really tasty.
- Not bad, right?

522
00:30:46,128 --> 00:30:47,509
Why are you here?

523
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,308
Newly roasted lamb leg. Want to taste?

524
00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:50,469
No, always thinking about eating.

525
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,590
Within only one day, you're already bribed by him.

526
00:30:55,709 --> 00:30:58,409
Bribe?

527
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:00,149
Don't talk nonsense.

528
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:03,630
Well. So you can't bear seeing me in harmony with your people?

529
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:07,830
It's not me that can't bear it, but someone else.

530
00:31:08,949 --> 00:31:10,769
Pack up your things and follow me.

531
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:12,108
Where to?

532
00:31:12,108 --> 00:31:16,449
Since you're the military counselor now, how can you live with Nu Er?

533
00:31:16,449 --> 00:31:20,168
Come. I prepared a wide and good tent.

534
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,068
You must forget who you are.

535
00:31:48,069 --> 00:31:51,110
Getting drunk in such a little county government,

536
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,048
isn't it humiliating?

537
00:31:53,048 --> 00:31:57,009
I know. You despise me.

538
00:31:57,009 --> 00:32:01,048
You think I'm just an indecisive exalted man.

539
00:32:01,048 --> 00:32:03,549
Without my father,

540
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:09,389
in your eyes, I might be even less than a magistrate.

541
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:11,229
Right?

542
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:16,570
I'm asking you. Yes or no?

543
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,470
You're drunk.

544
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:23,048
Let me tell you one more thing.

545
00:32:23,048 --> 00:32:25,989
Actually, Changge despises me as well.

546
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,929
Otherwise, in all these years,

547
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:33,549
couldn't she understand my feelings for her?

548
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,969
You're still thinking about Li Changge.

549
00:32:36,969 --> 00:32:38,890
I thought you were worried about the princess.

550
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,689
I am worried.

551
00:32:41,689 --> 00:32:44,169
I'm worried. I'm afraid.

552
00:32:44,169 --> 00:32:47,189
I feel guilty for that.

553
00:32:47,189 --> 00:32:49,509
Yueyan is lost.

554
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:52,409
We haven't found her until now.

555
00:32:52,409 --> 00:32:54,510
Changge is dead.

556
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:57,809
I didn't see her before she died.

557
00:32:58,689 --> 00:33:01,730
I even despise myself.

558
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,188
Come. Sit here.

559
00:33:06,188 --> 00:33:08,309
Drink with me.

560
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:15,070
So you don't want to drink.

561
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,388
You always look so indifferent about everything.

562
00:33:17,389 --> 00:33:19,148
Isn't it tiring?

563
00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:21,650
Have you been drunk before?

564
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:24,149
Have you felt heartbroken before?

565
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:30,309
Hao Du, I feel sorry for you.

566
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:33,240
You're like a doll,

567
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:38,130
a doll of... your adoptive father.

568
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:48,208
Wei Shuyu, if you dare talk any rubbish again, I won't be polite.

569
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:50,209
Hit me.

570
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:54,149
I wish you could beat me to death.

571
00:33:55,850 --> 00:33:58,970
If I can't find Yueyan,

572
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,230
I feel ashamed to return to Chang'an,

573
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:07,590
and even more ashamed to meet my father.

574
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:42,730
<i>[County Government in Yun State]</i>

575
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:52,528
Young Master Wei, good morning.

576
00:34:52,528 --> 00:34:54,709
Have you found the princess?

577
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:59,809
Not yet. But... Commander Hao has left.

578
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:02,029
What? He left?

579
00:35:02,029 --> 00:35:05,689
Right. He said it's a waste of time to search together. Better separately.

580
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:07,428
He left early in the morning.

581
00:35:07,429 --> 00:35:09,148
Where did he go?

582
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:13,449
About that... I don't know.

583
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:17,930
Young Master Wei. Young Master Wei!

584
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,929
Where are you going?

585
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:24,429
To look for the princess, of course.

586
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:27,310
That's...

587
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:48,380
<i>[To Revere People of Virtue and Honor Scholarship]</i>

588
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,690
<i>[Substantial]</i>

589
00:36:02,610 --> 00:36:05,990
Greetings to Your Majesty.

590
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,729
Counselor Wei, get up.

591
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,690
We've known each other for a long time.

592
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,049
No need for that.

593
00:36:15,049 --> 00:36:19,209
I dare not accept that kindness.

594
00:36:19,209 --> 00:36:23,288
I need your assistance.

595
00:36:23,288 --> 00:36:29,270
Your Majesty, I'll do whatever I can.

596
00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:32,049
Come.

597
00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:53,269
Your Majesty, I've already known what happened in Jing State.

598
00:36:53,269 --> 00:36:55,788
Luo Yi has been good friends with Jiancheng.

599
00:36:55,788 --> 00:36:57,628
The Tianjie Army he leads

600
00:36:57,628 --> 00:37:02,650
has indeed contributed a lot to Great Tang all these years.

601
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:05,689
I knew that.

602
00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:09,469
Counselor Wei, you don't want the royal court

603
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:12,849
to punish these meritorious officials, but now...

604
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:14,768
Your Majesty misunderstood me.

605
00:37:14,768 --> 00:37:17,588
I'm not a stupid man caring only about personal feelings

606
00:37:17,588 --> 00:37:19,889
but unaware of loyalty.

607
00:37:19,889 --> 00:37:23,609
No. I just think

608
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:26,270
that you wouldn't want to see me

609
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:28,308
being ruthless to Luo Yi.

610
00:37:28,308 --> 00:37:29,489
Quite the contrary.

611
00:37:29,489 --> 00:37:32,388
After Your Majesty was enthroned, everyone has been pardoned.

612
00:37:32,388 --> 00:37:36,209
But Luo Yi ignored Your Majesty's kindness and wanted to revolt.

613
00:37:36,209 --> 00:37:40,628
Jing State is a key place to defend the Ashile Tribe.

614
00:37:40,629 --> 00:37:43,709
If Your Majesty doesn't make a quick move

615
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:48,348
and eliminate Luo Yi and his Tianjie Army,

616
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:51,009
I'm afraid the turmoil that happened in the late Sui Dynasty

617
00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:54,330
would start again.

618
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:57,449
Besides, I've got some news

619
00:37:57,449 --> 00:38:00,888
that the traitor Wang Junkuo flew to the Ashile Tribe.

620
00:38:00,888 --> 00:38:05,689
But he was killed by the Ashile people for some reason.

621
00:38:05,689 --> 00:38:10,509
Your Majesty can't hesitate now.

622
00:38:12,069 --> 00:38:14,430
Wang Junkuo.

623
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,429
He was asking for an insult.

624
00:38:16,429 --> 00:38:18,028
No one would feel sorry for his death.

625
00:38:18,028 --> 00:38:23,810
After talking with you, I feel relieved now.

626
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:27,029
But... if Tianjie Army were defeated,

627
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:30,769
Ashile Tribe would definitely swoop in.

628
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:34,868
Could Great Tang be safe if Your Majesty didn't deal with Jing State?

629
00:38:34,868 --> 00:38:36,940
Would Ashile Tribe stop attacking Great Tang

630
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:41,470
if it were fine with Jing State?

631
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:45,990
Your Majesty, whether showing weakness or toughness

632
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,670
wouldn't let Ashile

633
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:52,370
give up coveting Great Tang's territory.

634
00:38:53,449 --> 00:38:56,189
I understand.

635
00:38:56,189 --> 00:38:58,720
I'll ask General Yuchi to meet me now.

636
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,130
Please be assured, Your Majesty.

637
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:07,249
Whatever it is, we'll stand behind Your Majesty.

638
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:14,689
By the way, Young Master Wei has been looking for Yan'er for days.

639
00:39:14,689 --> 00:39:17,330
I think he must have suffered a lot.

640
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:20,089
I'll arrange for more people to search for her.

641
00:39:20,089 --> 00:39:21,449
Let him come back now.

642
00:39:21,449 --> 00:39:23,488
I have another arrangement for him.

643
00:39:23,488 --> 00:39:27,049
I also haven't heard from him for days.

644
00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:32,520
I think he must feel embarrassed for not having found Princess.

645
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:38,188
You were too strict with Shuyu.

646
00:39:38,189 --> 00:39:41,488
Shuyu focuses only on searching for Yan'er,

647
00:39:41,488 --> 00:39:44,809
which must be harmful to his health both mentally and physically.

648
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:48,589
Fang still needs a Supervisory Censor.

649
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:52,050
I've thought about it. Shuyu is perfect for that.

650
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,609
Your Majesty, it's not proper to do it.

651
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:55,330
Shuyu often makes big mistakes.

652
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,370
It's already decided.

653
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:05,449
Your Majesty, thanks to Your Majesty on behalf of Shuyu.

654
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:20,649
Li Yueyan, do you have too much free time?

655
00:40:20,649 --> 00:40:22,729
What are you doing?

656
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,529
I'm just doing it for fun.

657
00:40:25,529 --> 00:40:27,130
You even have the time to do that?

658
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:30,910
Why didn't you put more strength into working?

659
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,868
I'll learn how to do it soon.

660
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:34,949
Just give me some more time.

661
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:39,148
When I was in the palace, I didn't take charge of such things.

662
00:40:39,149 --> 00:40:40,989
Palace? Really? Palace?

663
00:40:40,989 --> 00:40:43,810
She dreams of being a princess again.

664
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:49,409
Dear "Princess," in the palace, are they using gold shuttles to weave?

665
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:54,709
Miss, did your head get hit?

666
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,629
Or were you seriously ill?

667
00:40:56,629 --> 00:40:58,229
Why do you keep talking nonsense?

668
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,108
Does she need to see a doctor?

669
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:03,130
We should ask Miss Chai not to beat her head.

670
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,549
She's already so dumb.

671
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,828
I'll hand these bondwomen to you now.

672
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:18,589
As for the rest part, you should take care of it.

673
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:22,108
What's going on?

674
00:41:22,109 --> 00:41:23,868
Bondwomen from Khan's Tent.

675
00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:26,650
It's said to be the award for General.

676
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:30,668
General never keeps bondwoman in his tent.

677
00:41:30,669 --> 00:41:32,469
Take them away.

678
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:38,209
How Great Khan treats General is like giving sweets after slapping you.

679
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:39,569
That's a pity.

680
00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:41,569
You can't tell if those are poisonous or not.

681
00:41:41,569 --> 00:41:45,489
Things from Khan have always been difficult to deal with.

682
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:47,549
Keep an eye on them. Don't let them wander.

683
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:49,070
Okay.

684
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:12,030
Mother.

685
00:42:13,109 --> 00:42:15,890
Please turn back and look at me.

686
00:42:16,729 --> 00:42:20,829
Mother, please turn back...

687
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:25,210
Please... turn back and look at me.

688
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:27,908
<i>Let me go!</i>

689
00:42:27,909 --> 00:42:29,188
<i>Come.</i>

690
00:42:29,189 --> 00:42:31,449
<i>Let go!</i>

691
00:42:32,289 --> 00:42:33,849
<i>Let go of me!</i>

692
00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:35,208
<i>Don't hide from us, beauty.</i>

693
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:36,928
Drink with us two.

694
00:42:36,928 --> 00:42:39,229
- Come.
- Let me go!

695
00:42:39,229 --> 00:42:40,989
Good.

696
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:42,690
Stop.
