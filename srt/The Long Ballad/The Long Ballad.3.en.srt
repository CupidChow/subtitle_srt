Yesterday you were still fine.

And today you're injured.

24
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,190
Did you meet your enemy?

25
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,120
Eat something at least, brave man.

And I've met all kinds of people.

29

I can conclude that you recently are having some tough days

or you having a blood feud.

you can't be an ordinary person.

Even if I die someday, I'm afraid that no one will realize it.

44

Was that you?

46

has the best pastries in Chang'an.

My wife wants to taste them,

so I'm here on my own to see how good they are.

58
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,669
When I was downstairs, I got stopped by soldiers.

59

During the meeting this morning, Your Majesty has conferred Prince Qin as Crown Prince.

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,139
Why did Your Highness want to meet me?

166
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,289
Mr. Fang, I want to ask for your help.

167
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,900
Changge?

168
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,210
I know that Mr. Fang cherishes Changge most.

169
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,910
I also know that you won't catch Changge.

170
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,639
Today, I'm here because I want to know the truth from you.

171
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,760
How is Changge?

172
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,700
Please don't worry, Princess.

173
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,700
Princess Yongning hasn't been caught.

174
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,990
I knew it.

175
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,219
I knew Changge would be fine.

176
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,660
Please be assured, Princess.

177
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,180
She was taught by Your Highness and Wei Zheng.

178
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,429
I also spent a lot of time on her.

179
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,590
How can she be caught easily?

180
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:19,120
Just... it will be tough on her.

181
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,110
<i>[Elegant Heavenly Devotion]</i>

182
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,189
About Your Highness's intention to pardon them, I can understand that.

183
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:30,000
But I think Your Highness can't pardon everyone.

184
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,950
What do you mean?

185
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,489
The leader of Tianjie Army, Luo Yi, has been good friends with Li Jiancheng.

186
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:38,029
If he wants to revolt, it will be huge trouble.

187
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:42,819
Also, Li Changge, the daughter of Li Jiancheng, will do harm to...

188
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,520
Keming, the essence to make the country in harmony is to win people's hearts.

189
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,469
If officers keep suspecting each other,

190
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:52,370
and I get strict and abuse punishment,

191
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,250
I'm afraid that I'll be like Emperor Yang of Sui.

192
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,560
Have you heard the saying?

193
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,099
Civilizing people after the turmoil will be much more effective.

194
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm too ignorant.

195
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,900
Not surprising.

196
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,380
This saying is from Wei Zheng.

197
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,990
Xuanling just recommended him to me.

198
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,829
Your Highness, Wei Zheng has always been stubborn.

199
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:23,489
And now Your Highness wants to recruit him.

200
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:25,610
I'm afraid that it won't be easy.

201
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,810
Stubborn?

202
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,460
Wouldn't that just match your flavor?

203
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,140
Mr. Du.

204
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,189
<i>[Crown Prince and Prince Qi were killed. All their subordinates were annihilated.]</i>

205
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,760
It's about the safety of Chang'an City.

206
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,909
Be careful. Don't leave any trace.

207
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:48,339
Besides, it's a period of trouble now.

208
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,730
Send more people to guard every city gate.

209
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,360
Don't let any related person sneak out.

210
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,899
Please be assured.

211
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,050
I'll try my best to do it for His Highness.

212
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,080
<i>[Tonghua Gate]</i>

213
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,979
Does the officer from East Palace also need to hide in Chang'an City?

214
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,460
Move away.

215
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,760
You can even criticize soldiers on the street in public.

216
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,360
What are you afraid of?

217
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,670
So it's you.

218
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,139
Why are you following me?

219
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,840
Following you?

220
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,219
It's you that ran into me.

221
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,389
What do you want?

222
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,120
You're from East Palace and you haven't pledged allegiance.

223
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,609
Why can you go in and out at your will?

224
00:13:52,609 --> 00:13:54,610
None of your business.

225
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,460
What are you doing?

226
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,060
Someone's coming.

227
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:17,090
Why do you look like this? As if I'm bullying you.

228
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,069
<i>From now on, soldiers will guard the city gate and check those in and out.</i>

229
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:32,670
Yes.

230
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,749
If it weren't for that guy, we would have been out of this city now.

231
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,309
Let's figure out another way.

232
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,110
Let's go back first.

233
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,200
Let's go.

234
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,400
<i>[Quite Calm to Move Forward]</i>

235
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:01,680
It seems that Advisor Wei is determined to keep sleeping today until it's dark.

236
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,970
I'm sorry, Mr. Du.

237
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,410
My father hasn't been feeling well recently.

238
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,290
It's not convenient for him to meet guests.

239
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:17,299
Your father doesn't feel bad physically, but psychologically.

240
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:21,070
My father won't listen to anyone.

241
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,560
I apologize on behalf of my father.

242
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,309
Shuyu, do you have siblings?

243
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,930
I have three brothers and one sister in my hometown.

244
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,240
They're with my mother now.

245
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,429
Your father is so stubborn.

246
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:42,299
Just like a tall tree, it'll get broken if it's too tough.

247
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:47,069
If your father has a bad ending, can your family survive?

248
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:50,640
It's just a shame for your Wei family.

249
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:56,390
Don't you understand the gains and losses of it?

250
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,890
I understand.

251
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,770
Good.

252
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:03,730
You're at a similar age with my foster son Hao Du.

253
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,570
He acts very properly.

254
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,970
You should learn more from him.

255
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,210
Seeing him is like seeing me.

256
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,900
Can you understand my words?

From now on, you're with us, working for the crown prince.

You can use it to get in and out of the palace,

[Official Notice]</i>

273
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,340
About the case of Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji's rebellion,

274
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,629
since the principal culprits were killed,

275
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,629
the crown prince asked His Majesty to pardon the others.

276
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,909
As long as they pledge allegiance on their own,

277
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,930
they'll be pardoned.

278
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,459
That's really a kind crown prince.

279
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,610
<i>Right.</i>

280
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,540
With such a crown prince, it's our fortune.

281
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,030
Changge, that was really you.

282
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,120
You caught me.

283
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,130
And you can get promoted with that, right?

284
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,870
Why would you think of me like that?

285
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,029
I won't do it no matter what.

286
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,400
Then, why did you surrender to Du Ruhui?

287

Answer me.

288
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,770
My father was the advisor to the former crown prince.

289
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,070
Given what happened in East Palace,

290
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,419
the Wei family is in danger and it's going to be ruined anytime.

But, Changge, it won't last long. Please trust me.

His Highness has ordered that anyone pledging allegiance will be pardoned.

296

Am I guilty? I don't need to be pardoned.

You can hide from others,

328
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,650
but not from me.

329
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,960
I've let them record

330
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,840
that Princess Yongning has died.

331
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,350
You killed so many people in the East Palace.

332
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,760
Why would you like to let me go now?

333
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,780
Is it that you finally find your humanity?

334
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,150
So you can do me a favor

335
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:32,930
and comfort yourself because you suffered from a sense of guilt.

336
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,570
Or is it because...

337
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,250
I'm just a woman without the status of a princess?

338
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,910
So I can't be a threat to you.

339
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,790
Changge.

340
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,400
Changge, stop.

341
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,450
Even if I might die,

342
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,930
I'll get revenge for my mother.

343
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,970
Changge, just leave!

344
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,770
Your Highness.

345
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,509
Your Highness's safety matters to society.

346
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,970
How can you be in such danger?

347
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:49,080
Traitor, you can't escape now.

348
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,870
Take Li Changge away.

349
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

350
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:59,770
Stop. That dagger belongs to her.

351
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:05,710
I'll use this dagger that took my mother's life to kill

352
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,570
the murderer.

353
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,110
How dare you! Guards!

354
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,200
Put her into the death prison.

355
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,800
Wait!

356
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,170
Take Princess Yongning to the wing room,

357
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,840
and take good care of her.

358
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,029
Your Highness, you're breeding evil.

359
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,440
Keming, I'm tired.

360
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,010
About what happened today,

361
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,690
you can't tell anyone else.

362
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,700
Yes.

363
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,960
Take her away.

364
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,790
- Move!
- Go.

365
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,570
Father, it's already well arranged.

366
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,480
I've set lookouts everywhere in Hongyi Palace.

367
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,280
Please be assured.

368
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:03,640
Father, how is His Highness going to deal with Li Changge?

369
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,470
Breeding evil will cause lots of trouble.

370
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,900
Father, don't get too tired.

371
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,780
What should I do next?

372
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,040
Double the soldiers.

373
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,629
And let them secretly guard the wing room at every corner of it.

374
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,230
Give her the illusion that she's not well guarded.

375
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,720
If she wants to run away,

376
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,600
kill her on the spot.

377
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,000
Yes.

378
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,740
<i>Why are they guarding me with so few soldiers?</i>

379
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,360
<i>Mother, what should I do?</i>

380
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,260
Your Highness.

381
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,030
Advisor Fang, I can't fall asleep.

382
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,010
Play chess with me.

383
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,660
Yes.

384
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,350
How dare you!

385
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,669
I haven't started. How dare you make your move?

386
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:28,590
Isn't Your Highness waiting for others to make a move first?

387
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,410
You can't know me better than myself.

388
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:37,509
Changge isn't a girl easy to deal with.

389
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,290
Your Highness is busy with official duties.

390
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,970
No need to bother with that.

391
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:45,120
Your Highness urgently summoned me here for that.

392
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,180
Your Highness, I'll deal with that.

393
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,150
She's your student.

394
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:54,220
You have to be responsible for her.

395
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,510
Yes.

396
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:59,950
<i>[Assassination at Prince Qin Manor. The assassin failed and is locked in the wing room]</i>

397
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,490
Assassination at Prince Qin Manor?

398
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:08,500
I didn't expect him to be so dauntless.

399
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,960
General, who are you talking about?

400
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,720
The guy that won against us in the cuju arena.

401
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,920
So he's not an ordinary man.

402
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,270
Needless to say.

403
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,350
He's more than uncommon.

404
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:23,210
He also has an uncommon relationship with Prince Qin.

405
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:25,620
Prince Qin didn't put him into prison,

406
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,800
but let him live in the wing room.

407
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,509
So we'll be friends with him.

408
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,910
Friends?

409
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,670
The enemy of our enemy is our friend.

410
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,839
What? Changge was caught by my father.

411
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,179
And she got locked?

412
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,749
I heard servants talking about it this morning.

413
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,629
And they were seriously scolded by Commander Hao Du.

414
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:47,900
As for where she is now, I didn't hear that.

415
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,269
Changge.

416
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,550
What should we do?

417
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,350
Changge.

418
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,029
Mr. Fang.

419
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,760
Mr. Fang must know where they locked Changge.

420
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,409
Mr. Fang.

421
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:06,219
Princess.

422
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,450
I was going to visit you.

423
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,869
Princess.

424
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:35,520
Mr. Fang is really like a prophet.

425
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,220
The rain tonight is our biggest helper.

426
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:45,030
Are you really prepared, Princess?

427
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,200
I'm afraid.

428
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,609
Don't be afraid, Princess.

429
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:53,179
Think of every step that Mr. Fang has taught you.

430
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,799
And just do as he said.

431
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,390
Things will be okay.

432
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,500
I believe Mr. Fang.

433
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:03,020
Since little, it was Changge that protected me.

434
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:07,600
Now it's time for me to save her.

435
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,869
<i>As stubborn as she is, Changge won't eat anything these days.</i>

436
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,179
<i>But Your Highness ordered that</i>

437
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,939
<i>they should take good care of her.</i>

438
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,620
<i>Those guards are also worrying about that,</i>

439
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,249
<i>because no one can afford to neglect the princess.</i>

440
00:32:21,249 --> 00:32:24,460
<i>Only your appearance will let Changge eat something.</i>

441
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,029
<i>The guards will pretend to stop you.</i>

442
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,579
<i>Actually they wish that you can show up.</i>

443
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,790
<i>Only by this can they avoid responsibility.</i>

444
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,629
<i>Remember. Don't be afraid.</i>

445
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:35,740
<i>The guards will definitely let you get in.</i>

446
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,770
How dare you! This is the princess.

447
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:43,370
Advisor Du said that no one can get close to the wing room.

448
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:46,120
Please don't make things difficult for us.

449
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:52,749
I heard that Princess Yongning hasn't been eating for 24 hours.

450
00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:55,290
My father said that you should take good care of her.

451
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,849
If something bad happens to her,

452
00:32:57,849 --> 00:32:59,389
can you afford that?

453
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,179
That's...

454
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,509
Princess just wants to send her some food.

455
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,819
She won't stay long.

456
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,260
Or are you doubting the princess?

457
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,630
Please, Princess.

458
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,430
Wait for me here.

459
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,730
Changge.

460
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,250
Chang... Changge.

461
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,880
I'm Yueyan.

462
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,520
Why are you here?

463
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,450
Who sent you here?

464
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,470
<i>Don't let Changge know that I sent you there.</i>

465
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,419
<i>She won't accept this favor.</i>

466
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,659
<i>What you should do is to show flaws deliberately.</i>

467
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:05,649
<i>Give her the information to run away.</i>

468
00:34:05,649 --> 00:34:09,409
<i>Let Changge run away by herself instead of being rescued.</i>

469
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:12,600
<i>That's what Changge will accept.</i>

470
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,120
It's raining tonight and suddenly became cold.

471
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,139
The guards in the backyard went home due to the chill.

472
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,350
So I brought you hot soup and pastries.

473
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,310
Eat it when it's still hot.

474
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,310
How did you get in?

475
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,349
I'm a princess now.

476
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,320
They dare not stop me.

477
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,080
Your father killed my father.

478
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,830
You became a princess.

479
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,110
Princess Yongan.

480
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,829
Changge, it's not like what you think.

481
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,069
I don't care about being a princess or whatever.

482
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:56,809
From your room to this wing room, you won't pass the backyard.

483
00:34:56,809 --> 00:34:59,740
How did you know that there were no guards in the backyard?

484
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,760
Who taught you that?

485
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,810
<i>Changge is extremely smart.</i>

486
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,589
<i>If she finds out you're lying,</i>

487
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:09,990
<i>you don't need to hide anything from her.</i>

488
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:14,740
Changge, leave here now.

489
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,999
The door of the backyard is open.

490
00:35:15,999 --> 00:35:17,799
The guards were also kept away.

491
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:19,269
Go as far as you can.

492
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,609
Don't ever come back.

493
00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:22,620
How can I believe you?

494
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,149
Is it your father's trap, or Du Ruhui's?

495
00:35:26,169 --> 00:35:30,309
Then you'll declare that Princess Yongning died from arrows when she was running away.

496
00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:32,170
Yes or no?

497
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,390
Yes or no?

498
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,530
Changge,

499
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,050
do you really think that I'll hurt you?

500
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,710
It's Mr. Fang.

501
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,690
Mr. Fang taught me that.

502
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,840
He said that you're stubborn.

503
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,330
Only by this can you run away.

504
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,730
Fang Xuanling.

505
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,550
Tell Fang Xuanling,

506
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,899
it's my business. I'll try to think of a way it on my own.

507
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,280
He doesn't need to have pity on me.

508
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,650
I don't want to owe him anything.

509
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,989
<i>The only thing that can dispel her misgivings</i>

510
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:23,290
<i>is your sisterhood since little.</i>

511
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:28,460
<i>The only one who can save Changge is actually you.</i>

512
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,750
Changge, this is the amulet that I had prayed for you recently.

513
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,230
Wear it on you.

514
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,490
Then you'll definitely be safe.

515
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,070
Amulet?

516
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:52,049
The people of Prince Qin Manor killed everyone in our East Palace.

517
00:36:52,049 --> 00:36:54,920
Your father killed my mother and father.

518
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,520
Now you want me to be safe?

519
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,369
I'm sorry, Changge. I didn't know that.

520
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:11,699
I...

521
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,859
I'm sorry.

522
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,630
Princess Yongan,

523
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:21,070
from now on, we two are foes and absolutely irreconcilable.

524
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,640
Changge...

525
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:38,360
We have been best sisters since childhood.

526
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,360
Changge.

527
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,920
Sisters?

528
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:51,839
How can I be sisters with the daughter of the man that murdered my father?

529
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,490
I'll count down from three.

530
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,120
Leave here now.

531
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,600
Otherwise, don't blame me for being cold-blooded.

532
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,780
Three.

533
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,430
Two.

534
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,910
One.

535
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:25,250
Changge, I don't believe you really want me to leave.

536
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:30,160
If my death can relieve your hatred for my father,

537
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,699
I won't regret it.

538
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,710
Changge.

539
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,160
Yueyan.

540
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,920
Sorry.

541
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,119
Princess, why don't you say anything?

542
00:39:30,129 --> 00:39:33,410
Is it because Mr. Fang's strategy didn't work?

543
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,400
<i>His Majesty asked me to send the seal of the crown prince here,</i>

544
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,590
<i>Your Highness.</i>

545
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,589
Anything abnormal?

546
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:41,459
Princess Yongan was here with some food.

547
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,179
I have checked. Nothing abnormal.

548
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:44,109
Princess Yongan?

549
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,510
Right.

550
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,789
Princess?

551
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,349
- Guards.
- Yes.

552
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,449
Lockdown Hongyi Palace.

553
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:02,649
The rest go after her with me.

554
00:41:02,649 --> 00:41:04,050
<i>Yes!</i>

555
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,280
Princess. Princess!

556
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,140
Princess!

557
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,790
Call the imperial doctor.

558
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:21,359
Your Highness, Li Changge is serious trouble of Great Tang.

559
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,269
Your Highness,

560
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:26,099
we found the princess' maidservant knocked unconscious outside of the study.

561
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:27,970
The study?

562
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:30,189
Hurry. Back to the study.

563
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,280
Keming, it's gone.

564
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:47,449
Guards, you have to catch Li Changge.

565
00:41:47,449 --> 00:41:48,860
Yes.

566
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,290
Go!
