00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,480
(The Long Ballad)

00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:32,040
(This is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,239
(Episode 33)

4
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,280
Can you move?

5
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,560
Yes.

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,799
(The celestial worthy of the primordial beginning)

7
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,759
(Liuyun Abbey)

8
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,810
Minister Du.

9
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,960
The archers are here waiting for your orders.

10
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,000
Leave this matter to me.

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,560
(Liuyun Abbey)

12
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,039
Pharmacist Li.

13
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:28,199
Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.

14
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,090
Mr. Du, if something isn't your strength,

15
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,599
I think you should step aside.

16
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,280
Mr. Du, why are you looking at me?

17
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,370
I visited you so many times,

18
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,280
and I didn't even get to see you.

19
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:45,080
I can't believe that Liuyun Abbey...

20
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,719
can make you come here.

21
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,400
I've found a good disciple,

22
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,919
and I haven't taught him yet.

23
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,960
If he dies in there, that would be too bad.

24
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,719
(Command Token)

25
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,960
Today,

26
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,120
having you two die with me...

27
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,360
is worth it.

28
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,759
Ashina Sun!

29
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,039
How dare you betray us?

30
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,719
The stronger one can kill the weaker one!

31
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,240
It's him.

32
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,560
Who is it?

33
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,199
Soldiers, listen up!

34
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,879
Row 3, 3rd, 6th, and 7th positions, step forward.

35
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,280
Row 4, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th positions, step back.

36
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:36,439
Get your bow and arrow ready.

37
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,759
Chang Ge, I'll take care of everything.

38
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:42,840
Don't worry.

39
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,520
Kill!

40
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,000
Soldiers, return to positions.

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,639
Row 1, 3rd and 4th positions, step forward.

42
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,800
Rows four and five, fourth and fifth positions, step back.

43
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,479
The turtle's head is hidden!

44
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,639
Kill!

45
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:27,079
Don't let her escape.

46
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
Ashina Sun.

47
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,959
Is this how you repay Great Khan, who raised you all these years?

48
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,319
Yes.

49
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,879
He's helping Ashina Tribe.

50
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:56,279
The relationship between Tang and Ashina Tribe...

51
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,519
has finally eased.

52
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,920
Yet you're creating more problems.

53
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,360
Do you really think that the lives of warriors on both sides...

54
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,399
don't matter?

55
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:06,120
A general's achievement cost thousands of lives.

56
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,279
One who wants to accomplish something great...

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,920
can't be concerned about such details.

58
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,800
If you step aside now,

59
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,639
I won't tell Great Khan about this.

60
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,240
Otherwise,

61
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,170
you and the Eagle Army...

62
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,079
- will be greatly punished. - Shut up!

63
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
Ashina Sun.

64
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,120
You really want to help Du Ru Hui and the others?

65
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,240
You really want to betray the Ashina Tribe?

66
00:05:36,759 --> 00:05:38,360
Stop making malicious remarks.

67
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,879
I'm just saving the person I care about.

68
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,120
I'm not betraying the Ashina Tribe.

69
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,680
But what you're doing...

70
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,600
is provoking a war between the Ashina Tribe...

71
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,800
and Tang.

72
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
That is...

73
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,600
what would cause big trouble for the grassland.

74
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,800
Do you think...

75
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:59,040
Great Khan won't know what you're doing?

76
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,040
Ashina Sun.

77
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,920
Tang's soldiers...

78
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,839
won't spare you!

79
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,079
Guards!

80
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:03,079
- Take her away. - Yes.

81
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,360
We haven't counted the people yet.

82
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,040
Your Highness, don't scare yourself.

83
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,480
Where is he?

84
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
Who?

85
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:27,319
The one who coordinated with me, of course.

86
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:29,439
I was the one who coordinated with you just now.

87
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
What's the matter?

88
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
You don't think so?

89
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:36,279
You two know each other?

90
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,560
We've known each other for a long time.

91
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,920
Am I right, Mr. Li?

92
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,839
That's right. We've known each other for a long time.

93
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,959
You won't understand...

94
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:46,759
this kind of fate.

95
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,360
Mr. Hao, we didn't find her.

96
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,879
Godfather.

97
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,519
No one is in the backyard.

98
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,120
All this time,

99
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:16,879
only Abbess and I are here.

100
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,279
Mr. Du, I wonder...

101
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,079
who you're looking for.

102
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,800
Forget it.

103
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,560
I've offended you.

104
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,279
I hope you can forgive me, Abbess.

105
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
In order to save you,

106
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,240
she almost died.

107
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,240
Minister Du, take care of yourself too.

108
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,360
Stop being so obsessed.

109
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,639
You're injured.

110
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:46,000
You must rest well.

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,210
I'll ask people...

112
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,960
to take care of matters in the abbey.

113
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,279
Thank you for understanding, Minister Du.

114
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,039
Wait, Mr. Du.

115
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,519
What you did today...

116
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,559
is harder and harder to understand.

117
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,279
Who exactly are you looking for?

118
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:34,679
I can't believe you're just giving up.

119
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,519
I'm performing work for the imperial court.

120
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,759
It's none of your business.

121
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:41,360
As for your strange behavior,

122
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,240
I don't quite understand it.

123
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Nice.

124
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,210
I just helped you wipe out the bandits,

125
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,090
and you're acting so cold to me now.

126
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,639
You're only a civilian.

127
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,279
You have no right to interfere.

128
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,159
(Command Token)

129
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,639
Unless you're willing to wear the purple robe again...

130
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,240
and return to the imperial court.

131
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:06,240
Are you challenging me again?

132
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,120
Fine, you don't have to tell me.

133
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,450
I don't really care.

134
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,120
Matters of the imperial court...

135
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,559
aren't black and white.

136
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,799
You came here to capture someone,

137
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:17,120
and you're also the one sparing her.

138
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,559
You can't figure out what you want to do.

139
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,720
Stop talking nonsense.

140
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,360
You speak with such authority.

141
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,759
What's more important now...

142
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,000
is to find Crown Prince...

143
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,120
and the remaining accomplices of the bandits in the city.

144
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,000
They should know...

145
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,450
Crown Prince's whereabouts.

146
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,639
Then Godfather,

147
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,240
I'll tell them to seal the city gates...

148
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,360
and search the whole city.

149
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:40,399
Wait.

150
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,720
Even if I'm just a civilian,

151
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,919
I can't help but say something.

152
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,720
You're causing such a big commotion.

153
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,840
Are you really not afraid of alerting the enemy?

154
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:51,450
What do you mean?

155
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,600
One would take desperate measures when cornered.

156
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,000
If Crown Prince...

157
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,279
is really in their hands,

158
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
what do you think will happen?

159
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,399
Things have gotten out of hand.

160
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,120
I don't think they'll stay for long.

161
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,080
You can't go wrong with guarding the city gate.

162
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,720
There are many commoners there.

163
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,200
I can't go through them all.

164
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,559
Besides, you saw them earlier.

165
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,519
They're all posing as civilians...

166
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:16,000
and hungry refugees.

167
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,080
How can you investigate?

168
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,000
Mr. Du.

169
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,000
I have an idea on how we won't alert them.

170
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:26,360
Please tell us, Your Highness.

171
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,960
I can find the spy disguised as a refugee.

172
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,519
However,

173
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,480
let me borrow your command token.

174
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:41,519
(Command Token)

175
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,440
- Get in line. - Thank you.

176
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,559
- You'll all get one. - Thank you.

177
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:45,559
Thank you.

178
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,240
Here.

179
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,720
- Thank you. - Thank you.

180
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,120
This is from your local official.

181
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,759
Those going out of town, get your porridge before you go.

182
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,039
Next.

183
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,200
- Thank you. - Next.

184
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,639
Thank you.

185
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,120
Thank you.

186
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,240
Next.

187
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,559
- Thank you. - Thank you.

188
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,559
Wait.

189
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,759
I'm sorry.

190
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
Next.

191
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,039
Even if Chang Ge is fine,

192
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,879
I won't forgive you.

193
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
Come, line up.

194
00:12:48,919 --> 00:12:50,759
- Next. - Follow that man.

195
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:52,639
Yes.

196
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,039
Stop eating.

197
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:11,320
Since we've already left the city,

198
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:12,799
I don't need you anymore.

199
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Stay still.

200
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:27,879
- Take him back. - Yes.

201
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:30,879
Come on.

202
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,159
How did it go?

203
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:39,279
We've already arrested him.

204
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
Your Highness is wise.

205
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,960
You came up with such a brilliant idea.

206
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,480
To those who are really starving,

207
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,240
a little dirt in the porridge isn't a big deal.

208
00:14:00,919 --> 00:14:02,159
Are you hurt?

209
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,120
I'm hungry.

210
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,879
I'll bring you something delicious later, all right?

211
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:11,159
I've already asked men to watch this area.

212
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,799
We're going according to your plan.

213
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,559
It's not safe outside.

214
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,240
Let me take you back first.

215
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,240
Since we're done with official business,

216
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21,320
I won't trouble you anymore, Commander Hao.

217
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,919
Go. He'll get you something delicious.

218
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,000
- Mr. Wei. - What happened?

219
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:46,679
While we check the bodies,

220
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:47,919
there seems to be a problem.

221
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:49,639
But I don't think she's there.

222
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:51,279
Is she or is she not there?

223
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,759
I heard that a soldier...

224
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,480
saw a dead body moving.

225
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,480
Then Commander Hao went to check himself.

226
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,679
When he came back, he scolded that soldier so badly.

227
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,279
He said that he's seeing things.

228
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,039
However, that doesn't seem like Commander Hao's style.

229
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,399
Before, he'd rather kill people by mistake...

230
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,879
than possibly let anyone get away.

231
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,840
Commander Hao is very meticulous.

232
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,840
Don't talk nonsense.

233
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,159
I wouldn't dare.

234
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,120
Get up.

235
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,440
This matter is over.

236
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,159
Watch your mouth. Don't mention it again.

237
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:18,200
Yes.

238
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,279
You may go.

239
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,159
Chang Ge.

240
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,639
I'm glad you got away safely.

241
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,000
Your companion...

242
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,799
is capable indeed.

243
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,440
Open the door.

244
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,159
Minister Du.

245
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:21,799
That evil woman...

246
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,960
It's fine.

247
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:25,919
Yes.

248
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,440
You seem to be in a good mood.

249
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,759
I don't know if you'll be willing...

250
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,600
to talk to me.

251
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:47,519
You know what?

252
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,840
When I was a kid,

253
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,879
I came to Luoyang with my grandfather.

254
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:55,360
I love Luoyang's peonies the most.

255
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,200
Among all the flowers,

256
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,120
I can see it right away.

257
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,079
Back then, I thought,

258
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,480
I'm going to be like a peony too.

259
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,410
Among everyone,

260
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,200
I want to be the most eye-catching.

261
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,240
You got your wish.

262
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:24,359
The whole Luoyang knows...

263
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,759
that an evil woman...

264
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:27,480
caused chaos in Liuyun Abbey...

265
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,170
and harmed people.

266
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,319
Tell me.

267
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,839
Who exactly are you?

268
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,039
What exactly is your motive?

269
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,440
I forgot to introduce myself, Minister Du.

270
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,359
I'm from the Yang family in Hongnong.

271
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:55,319
Duke Jingwu, Yang Su,

272
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:58,279
was my grandfather.

273
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,319
So you're from the Sui Dynasty.

274
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,839
You won't give up your treacherous intentions.

275
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,119
Sui...

276
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:10,200
will rule the Central Plains sooner or later.

277
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,759
The Sui Dynasty was foolish and tyrannical.

278
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:16,039
Its days are over.

279
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,559
Madam.

280
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,119
Don't waste your energy.

281
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,410
Wait and see...

282
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:25,559
if its days are over or not.

283
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:27,319
You have more accomplices?

284
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:28,799
Or...

285
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:33,170
you're just following orders?

286
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,440
Since it's a game,

287
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:41,000
it would be no fun if I told you.

288
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:43,680
Now, your accomplices in the city...

289
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,119
have all been wiped out.

290
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,200
You better be sensible.

291
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,799
If you tell me everything...

292
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,240
to redeem yourself,

293
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:53,079
I can let you live.

294
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,920
If I was afraid of dying,

295
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,599
I wouldn't have come here.

296
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:03,410
All right.

297
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,680
I'll lock you up...

298
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,720
until you wish you were dead.

299
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:30,839
(Dapu Inn)

300
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,759
Don't move around.

301
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:02,119
You're finally awake.

302
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,079
How do you feel?

303
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:11,650
Much better.

304
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,519
Where am I?

305
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:16,839
You're at our inn.

306
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,440
Don't worry.

307
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,440
It's very safe.

308
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,720
The one chasing us...

309
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,079
let us go on purpose.

310
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,410
If Hao Du intends on chasing after me,

311
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,799
there's no way we could have gotten out.

312
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,680
So from now on, will he still come after you?

313
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:38,410
It doesn't matter anymore.

314
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:40,960
Here's the medicine.

315
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,170
Master Sun prescribed this.

316
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,170
Here. Drink it while it's hot.

317
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,480
Chang Ge is hurt.

318
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,599
I don't think she can do it herself.

319
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:50,319
Allow me.

320
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,890
This medicine was just...

321
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:57,119
It was just prepared.

322
00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:00,799
I'll do it myself.

323
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,079
Are you all right?

324
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,680
Are you all right?

325
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,680
I'm fine.

326
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,279
I'll do it.

327
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:12,319
Leave it to me.

328
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,000
Shi Ba.

329
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,079
You unintentionally hurt people.

330
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:16,410
Let's go first. Leave it to him.

331
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:27,240
- I think I'll... - Don't move.

332
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,680
What's so funny?

333
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,440
Drink the medicine.

334
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,079
It tastes awful.

335
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,119
When will I finish it if I drink it one sip at a time?

336
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,839
Slow down.

337
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:09,559
It's so bitter.

338
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:11,119
Based on how you look,

339
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:12,480
it doesn't seem to be bitter enough.

340
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,279
Is this how you comfort people?

341
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:16,160
How do you want to be comforted?

342
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,240
Ashina Sun.

343
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,720
Are we forgetting something?

344
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,079
What's the matter?

345
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:30,599
- Li Cheng Qian. - Li Cheng Qian.

346
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,640
Where exactly did my brother go?

347
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,559
I'm so worried.

348
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,359
Crown Prince is blessed by the heavens.

349
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,079
He'll be all right.

350
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:46,039
Your Highness. Mr. Wei.

351
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,640
Someone sent us a letter.

352
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,640
Bring it to us.

353
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:53,000
(Urgent)

354
00:22:57,759 --> 00:22:59,240
Inform Minister Du...

355
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,440
- that I took the letter. - Yes.

356
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,200
It's Chang Ge's handwriting.

357
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,559
(Crown Prince is at Sumo Hall, east of the city.)

358
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,759
Sumo Hall east of the city?

359
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:14,960
Let's find my brother.

360
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,680
Wait.

361
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:19,359
Luoyang is now in turmoil.

362
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:20,960
This could be a setup.

363
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:22,599
I can't risk your safety.

364
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:23,720
But...

365
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,160
Let's ask Hao Du to come along.

366
00:23:27,559 --> 00:23:29,519
When did you start trusting Hao Du so much?

367
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,960
This way,

368
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:32,480
at least you'll be safer.

369
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,599
I can give in,

370
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,839
but I can't put you in danger.

371
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
You'll always be my protector.

372
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,720
Hao Du.

373
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,279
We have news about Crown Prince.

374
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,039
(Sumo Hall)

375
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,480
I can't believe Li Chang Ge...

376
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,319
locked me up in a place like this.

377
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:57,400
Cheng Qian.

378
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,240
Let me take a look at you.

379
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,720
What happened?

380
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,880
Hao Du.

381
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,599
Bring men and seal this place immediately!

382
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:05,880
Arrest them all!

383
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,319
Don't let any of them go!

384
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,960
Cheng Qian.

385
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,160
Are you deaf?

386
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:14,799
Your Highness.

387
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,480
Since you're fine, let's not make this into a big deal.

388
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,039
No. I must take revenge.

389
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:21,279
Right at this moment,

390
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,880
seal this place!

391
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:27,720
How dare you disobey me?

392
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,720
Le Yan.

393
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,240
They're riding roughshod over me,

394
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,720
- and you're not doing anything. - That's enough, Cheng Qian.

395
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,960
You are the crown prince.

396
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,720
How can you make a scene here like a child in the market?

397
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,960
Come home with me.

398
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:43,039
And I must catch Li Chang Ge...

399
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,799
and make her life worse than hell!

400
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,160
You saw Chang Ge?

401
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,119
She was the one who locked me up here!

402
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,240
Where is Du Ru Hui?

403
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,079
Minister Du is at the Luoyang Office waiting for you.

404
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,640
His Highness should go back with Her Highness first.

405
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
All right.

406
00:24:56,519 --> 00:24:58,039
She ruined my fun...

407
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,920
and even left me at a place like this.

408
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,799
I'll tell Minister Du...

409
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:07,359
to catch that witch Li Chang Ge!

410
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,160
Chang Ge did the right thing.

411
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,160
If it were me,

412
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,920
I'd throw you in the pigpen.

413
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,759
You still want to have fun at a time like this?

414
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,240
No.

415
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:19,400
I was just bored at night,

416
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,720
and I came out to have some fun.

417
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:25,799
Li Cheng Qian.

418
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:26,880
You're the crown prince, but you...

419
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,559
You don't do anything but have fun.

420
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,000
You caused so much trouble in Luoyang.

421
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,200
You're just running wild.

422
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
Also,

423
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,240
who did you just call a witch?

424
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,680
She's your cousin!

425
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
Le Yan.

426
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,000
You hit me?

427
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:42,200
I can't believe you hit me because of Li Chang Ge!

428
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,240
How can you not love your very own younger brother?

429
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,240
Did it hurt?

430
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,279
I think you deserve a good beating.

431
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,279
I...

432
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,960
- Le Yan. - Li Cheng Qian.

433
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,079
- Le Yan. - Come here.

434
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,079
Why are you hiding?

435
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:55,279
Li Chang Qian, come out!

436
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,279
- Le Yan. - Forget it.

437
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:58,079
- Li Chang Ge badly influenced you. - Come here.

438
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,599
I'm going back to tell Father.

439
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,839
You, come here.

440
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:02,480
Don't stop me, Shu Yu.

441
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,400
Today, I must make him realize what he did.

442
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,440
- Come here. - Li Chang Ge badly influenced you.

443
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,200
- Come here. - Le Yan, stop it.

444
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,440
I'm sorry.

445
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,200
Shu Yu, save me.

446
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,319
Le Yan, forget it.

447
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:13,359
People are watching.

448
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,839
Li Cheng Qian.

449
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:24,920
I'm warning you.

450
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,319
When you get back, you better behave yourself.

451
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,799
If you tell anyone about Li Chang Ge,

452
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:31,559
I'll break your legs.

453
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,319
I won't mention her. I've never seen her at all.

454
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,839
Shu Yu.

455
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:38,880
Let's go.

456
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,119
But His Highness...

457
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,400
Hao Du, take Crown Prince back.

458
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,440
Remember.

459
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:47,880
If he dares to say more than he should,

460
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,000
beat him up badly.

461
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:16,880
Help...

462
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,680
A group of merchants has arrived.

463
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,480
The merchants have arrived.

464
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,559
You can't catch me.

465
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:39,559
You can't catch me.

466
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,279
Stop running.

467
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,279
Mimi.

468
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,680
Mimi.

469
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,920
The merchants are here.

470
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,279
They brought so much stuff.

471
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,759
I'll take you there.

472
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,799
Mimi, it'll be too late if you don't go now.

473
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:15,400
Where is she?

474
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:17,599
Forget it.

475
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,319
I'll pick out some rare items for you first.

476
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,000
Little sheep. Come on, time to eat.

477
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,799
Come out and eat.

478
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,799
Come on. Come here.

479
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,720
Come here. Everybody out, go.

480
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:34,559
Come on.

481
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,079
Come on.

482
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:38,680
Come on, let's go.

483
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,519
Little boy.

484
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:45,519
Little boy.

485
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:47,079
Wake up, little boy.

486
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,559
Miss.

487
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:57,440
Help me.

488
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,559
Who are you? Why are you here?

489
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,880
Wake up. Where did you come from?

490
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,480
He's burning up.

491
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,880
This won't do.

492
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,359
I need to find the Great Shaman to check on you.

493
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
You're awake?

494
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:38,440
Master asked me to remind you...

495
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,119
What did you say?

496
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,720
She's telling you...

497
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,079
not to forget your mission.

498
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,400
Who are you?

499
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,440
Who sent you here?

500
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,759
Why are you here?

501
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,039
Master is ordering you...

502
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,000
to let me stay here.

503
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
No.

504
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,039
I have to send you away.

505
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,440
- Get out. - Help me, Miss.

506
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,640
Miss.

507
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,519
Please save me.

508
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,759
Miss.

509
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,559
Otherwise, Master will kill me.

510
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:30,839
You...

511
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,599
Master said...

512
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:34,720
that if you don't obey orders,

513
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:37,440
you should know the consequences.

514
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,240
Mimi, are you in there?

515
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:44,880
Mimi.

516
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,319
I'm coming in.

517
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,359
It's so early in the morning. Why are you yelling?

518
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:00,519
Some merchants came earlier.

519
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:02,400
I wanted to bring you there to pick out some good stuff,

520
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,599
but you weren't here, so I went there alone.

521
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,319
Every morning,

522
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:07,839
I herd the sheep.

523
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,440
You herded the sheep?

524
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:10,920
I have something nice for you.

525
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Come, I'll show you inside.

526
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,839
Can't we talk...

527
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:15,319
outside the tent?

528
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,240
Mimi.

529
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,519
Are you blaming me for going there alone,

530
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,799
and not bringing you?

531
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240
No.

532
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,720
I was afraid that if I go there late,

533
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,519
Su Yi She and the others would get all the stuff.

534
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,720
I said that's not it.

535
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,200
Mimi. why don't I take you out for a walk?

536
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,680
Flowers outside the camp have bloomed already.

537
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,559
They're multi-colored. They're especially beautiful.

538
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:39,640
Come on.

539
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:43,119
They're really nice.

540
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:44,160
You'll see when we get there.

541
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,400
Go.

542
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:21,799
This is it.

543
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,279
Why did you bring me here?

544
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:27,039
What's the matter? You don't like it here?

545
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,759
No.

546
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,519
I love it.

547
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,240
Right.

548
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:38,319
Didn't you come to see me...

549
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,519
to give me something?

550
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,200
What's this?

551
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,559
Open it.

552
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,799
Candy?

553
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,279
Where did you get that?

554
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:07,519
You swapped it with the merchants?

555
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Do you like it?

556
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:11,319
Try it.

557
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:17,799
It's so sweet.

558
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:19,599
Why aren't you eating it anymore?

559
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:21,920
How can I eat something so nice?

560
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,319
I must keep it.

561
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,720
I'll just taste it.

562
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:28,839
Mu Jin.

563
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,759
Thank you.

564
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:32,839
Why are you thanking me?

565
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:34,400
As long as you like them,

566
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,119
I'll buy them for you from now on.

567
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,880
Mimi.

568
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:03,279
I like you.

569
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,640
Do you know why I brought you here?

570
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:11,289
Because I once heard...

571
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,079
that if you bring the person you like...

572
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,199
to this bridge,

573
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,329
you'll be together forever.

574
00:34:17,809 --> 00:34:19,360
I want to be with you forever.

575
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

576
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,519
I mean it.

577
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,480
I really, really like you.

578
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,159
Mu Jin.

579
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,960
You're great.

580
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,920
I don't deserve you.

581
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,329
Don't belittle yourself.

582
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:58,719
I'm the one who doesn't deserve you.

583
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,239
I'm sorry.

584
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,039
Miss, it hurts.

585
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:57,519
I'm sorry.

586
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,329
I hurt you.

587
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,199
Master is ordering you...

588
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:15,880
to let me stay here.

589
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:21,289
Mu Jin.

590
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:25,079
I really don't deserve your affection.

591
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,809
- Hurry up. - Come on.

592
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
Hurry up.

593
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,960
Come on.

594
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,360
Hurry!

595
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,159
Wait for me!

596
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:10,719
I feel like...

597
00:37:12,329 --> 00:37:14,769
Ashina Sun has been gone for a long time.

598
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:18,880
Back then, when Ashina Sun was little,

599
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:22,199
even though he was afraid of me,

600
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:23,769
he'd always...

601
00:37:23,769 --> 00:37:25,480
insist on letting me...

602
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,809
teach martial arts.

603
00:37:29,809 --> 00:37:31,039
But now...

604
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,809
You haven't been feeling well lately, Great Khan.

605
00:37:43,769 --> 00:37:45,440
Stop drinking so much.

606
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,880
Who told you to come here?

607
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:48,159
Leave!

608
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:54,000
Great Khan,

609
00:37:54,769 --> 00:37:55,960
remember to take your medicine then.

610
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,159
I haven't been to the Eagle Army in a long time.

611
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,880
I haven't seen Ashina Sun...

612
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,960
for a while either.

613
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:14,559
If I had known this would happen,

614
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,079
back then,

615
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:19,719
we shouldn't have doubted each other.

616
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,360
If he comes back now,

617
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:30,039
I will surely reward him handsomely.

618
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:48,360
In parting ways

619
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:53,199
The willow tree's catkins are all over the place

620
00:38:55,679 --> 00:39:03,679
When will you be back?

621
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,960
When will you be back?

622
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:47,159
Jinse.

623
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:01,400
Your Highness.

624
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,769
You did very well.

625
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,289
That's exactly what I want you to do.

626
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,960
Torture me endlessly in front of Great Khan.

627
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:20,239
The more you insult me,

628
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:22,119
the more people in the grasslands...

629
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:24,559
would feel sorry for me.

630
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:27,000
When everybody's guard against me...

631
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,480
is down,

632
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,519
it's the perfect time to strike.

633
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:35,079
Do you understand?

634
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:36,329
Yes.

635
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:38,679
Get up.

636
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:44,199
Your Highness.

637
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,199
You were aggrieved.

638
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:48,199
This grievance...

639
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:50,079
is nothing.

640
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:55,239
You are my right hand.

641
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:58,000
Don't disappoint me.

642
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:05,239
Your Highness.

643
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:09,599
I will do whatever it takes.

644
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,000
I'm willing to die for you.

645
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:26,119
I...

646
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:30,239
am incompetent.

647
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:36,769
I'm incompetent.

648
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,719
Your Highness.

649
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:02,960
Has that kid...

650
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:04,329
reached the Eagle Army yet?

651
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:11,719
Your Highness.

652
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:13,159
He's already there.

653
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:16,079
However, I've underestimated Yan Li's affection...

654
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,920
for Ashina Sun.

655
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:19,769
I didn't expect that deep down,

656
00:42:19,769 --> 00:42:21,329
he'd still care about that son of his.

657
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:23,239
Back then,

658
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:25,039
I incited Li Chang Ge to save Luo Yi...

659
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:27,000
and even asked A Yi Er to help...

660
00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:28,920
in order to find an opportunity...

661
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,329
to kill Ashina Sun.

662
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,840
Unfortunately, She Er is too softhearted.

663
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:35,880
I can't believe he let him live.

664
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,119
Your Highness took a big risk.

665
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,360
Good thing A Yi Er died, and she can't testify against you.

666
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,360
Otherwise...

667
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,599
Otherwise?

668
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,809
Luo Yi is a traitor from the Sui Dynasty.

669
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:46,159
I have my defense ready...

670
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:47,769
to prove my innocence.

671
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:50,809
By the way, any news from Luoyang?

672
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:52,199
No.

673
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,960
No news...

674
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,920
might mean the worst news.

675
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:58,719
I think Jinse failed.

676
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,360
We need to move even quicker.

677
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:02,239
Before Ashina Sun comes back,

678
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:04,000
let's start with what we should be doing.

679
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:05,329
Don't worry, Your Highness.

680
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:07,480
According to your instructions,

681
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,840
for the past two months,

682
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,400
I've placed our people around Yan Li.

683
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:13,440
He won't be the Great Khan...

684
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,480
for long.

685
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:53,400
(The Long Ballad)
