<i>[Episode 21]</i>

22
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,919
I don't like war,

23
00:01:38,919 --> 00:01:40,760
but I don't fear it.

24
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,319
Hundreds of thousands of soldiers gather on the Weishui River shore.

25
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:50,119
I don't want the blood of soldiers to flow into the river.

26
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:53,279
I'm much less willing to see the warriors from the grasslands to die here.

27
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,380
We're the warriors from the grasslands.

28
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,958
We fight for faith and are not afraid of death.

29
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,999
If you insist to fight, along the Weishui River tonight,

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,119
we won't withdraw from the battle.

31
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:12,478
If you'd like a backup plan, tomorrow at noon,

32
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:18,179
I'll give you a second chance at this bridge,

33
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:23,180
so that you may make up with Great Tang.

34
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,680
Go.

35
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:06,459
Li Changge.

36
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,340
Why are you wearing Tang attire?

37
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,220
Where did you go?

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,258
- What are you doing?
- Come with me.

39
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,960
You may leave.

40
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,060
Your Majesty, good night.

41
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,840
Your Majesty.

42
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,038
Where's Changge?

43
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:40,379
Please forgive me.

44
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:43,559
I'm so useless that I lost the princess.

45
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:44,860
Where did she go?

46
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,939
To the north bank.

47
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,179
As long as she's alive, it is great.

48
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:58,039
If she wants to leave,

49
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:00,719
nobody can stop her.

50
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,399
You may leave.

51
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:04,099
Yes.

52
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:07,079
Your Majesty!

53
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,980
Are you all right?

54
00:04:13,279 --> 00:04:14,880
I'm fine.

55
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:18,079
Your Majesty, please don't do it again.

56
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,518
Your Majesty, it's a pity that you didn't see

57
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,420
how agitated Minister Du was.

58
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,599
He was either looking around outside the tent,

59
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,958
or walking in circles inside the tent nonstop.

60
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:29,820
Like a loach trapped in a pot.

61
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,540
Got me so dizzy.

62
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,019
Xuancheng, say something.

63
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,999
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,959
Your wish finally came true.

65
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:49,759
But we won't know it for sure until tomorrow.

66
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,439
Go and have a rest, all of you.

67
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,278
I'll rest for a while, too.

68
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,540
We're counting on tomorrow.

69
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,699
Good night, Your Majesty.

70
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,019
Do you know that, if it weren't for me, you would be dead now?

71
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,118
Just hide here for now.

72
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,119
Be good and stay within the campsite. Without my order, you may go nowhere.

73
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,279
- You...
- I'm the boss here.

74
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:31,759
You're trying to force me again.

75
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,800
Yes, so what?

76
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,440
I didn't plan to ruin my Eagle Division here.

77
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,359
No one wants a battle.

78
00:05:48,359 --> 00:05:49,959
You mean it?

79
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,799
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

80
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,590
<i>Is Ashile Sun here?</i>

81
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,090
<i>Yes.</i>

82
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:00,869
Father.

83
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,069
Li Shimin wants to ally with me.

84
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,070
And has made a peace treaty,

85
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:16,509
which I've agreed to.

86
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:19,370
Tomorrow on the make-shift bridge,

87
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:23,070
I'll sign the treaty with him, face to face.

88
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,449
How can I really be in alliance with him?

89
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:36,069
Listen up, both of you.

90
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,190
When I'm signing the treaty tomorrow,

91
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,490
dispatch the best archers of your divisions.

92
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,668
Bring bows and arrows, and lurk at the north bank.

93
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:49,009
After I drink the wine,

94
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,810
shoot Li Shimin on the spot.

95
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:57,009
<i>They want to shoot Li Shimin on the spot.</i>

96
00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:02,349
To defeat the Tang army on the battleground this time

97
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,770
is rather unlikely.

98
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:10,069
I have no choice but to murder Li Shimin.

99
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,829
To win or to lose depends on tomorrow.

100
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,590
Yes, Uncle.

101
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,210
Sun, any problem?

102
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:33,549
No, sir.

103
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,049
The alliance is tomorrow.

104
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:06,289
And you're breaking the treaty.

105
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:08,629
How do you win others' trust with such caprice?

106
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:12,170
Even if you kill Li Shimin, with the numerous armed Tang soldiers,

107
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,329
do you really think you can take charge of the Tang State?

108
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:18,810
Say something.

109
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,210
I have to do it.

110
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,930
Ashile Sun, you said you wouldn't ruin the Eagle Division here.

111
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,109
Then, what is this?

112
00:08:25,109 --> 00:08:27,730
I can't disobey the order of the Great Khan.

113
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,000
Even if I don't do it, She'er will.

114
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,910
If She'er doesn't do it, Tu Kashe and Qibi Duo will.

115
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:35,950
We have numerous archers,

116
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:40,250
this assassination is going to happen.

117
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:47,570
Such being the case, we shall part ways here.

118
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,509
Where are you going?

119
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:54,490
I'm warning you! You're not going anywhere for now.

120
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,090
Guards!

121
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:58,069
General.

122
00:08:58,069 --> 00:09:02,168
Take her away and lock her in a camp. Don't let her out of it.

123
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,068
Ashile Sun, you have no right to do this to me.

124
00:09:06,069 --> 00:09:07,669
I'll say this again.

125
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:10,289
You owe your life to me.

126
00:09:10,289 --> 00:09:11,989
Take her away.

127
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:33,490
<i>You didn't change at all.</i>

128
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,769
<i>Still so arrogant just like before.</i>

129
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:41,529
<i>Changge, I'm not being arrogant.</i>

130
00:09:41,529 --> 00:09:43,490
<i>It's you who are too stubborn.</i>

131
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,189
<i>You don't understand me at all.</i>

132
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:47,490
<i>But that's okay.</i>

133
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,330
<i>The alliance will be after dawn.</i>

134
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,789
<i>No one knows what will happen.</i>

135
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,450
<i>So it's good that you've gone.</i>

136
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:57,309
<i>As for Yueyan, if I'm lucky enough to get through tomorrow,</i>

137
00:09:57,309 --> 00:09:59,849
<i>I will find her.</i>

138
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,109
You're so noisy. Get out of my way.

139
00:10:39,109 --> 00:10:40,569
It's a wide road.

140
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:42,930
I'm not in your way.

141
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,289
What are you looking at?

142
00:10:47,289 --> 00:10:50,568
It took me a lot of effort to get these. I won't share them with you.

143
00:10:57,629 --> 00:11:00,969
You're coughing. You sure you don't have a cold?

144
00:11:00,969 --> 00:11:03,648
No, I'm not. Stop cursing me.

145
00:11:24,409 --> 00:11:25,789
What are you doing?

146
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:28,089
Making fire with a stick. You don't know it?

147
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:30,629
How have you survived till today?

148
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,868
So many mushrooms. Can you eat them all?

149
00:12:00,868 --> 00:12:04,669
I'll wrap up the rest if I can't. Save them for tomorrow.

150
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,268
How about I buy some from you?

151
00:12:11,268 --> 00:12:14,029
Or I can trade some with my cakes.

152
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:15,830
No.

153
00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:18,769
That's fine.

154
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:21,889
They don't look good anyway.

155
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,850
What a nasty brat!

156
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,428
I've changed my mind. Come and eat with me.

157
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:44,290
Thank you.

158
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:54,929
My name is Li Yueyan, and you?

159
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:58,029
I don't have a name. Just call me Mr. Wu.

160
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:00,610
Why would somebody be nameless?

161
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:04,148
There are many people who don't have a name. It's not uncommon.

162
00:13:04,148 --> 00:13:08,089
I grew up with no parents. Nobody has ever named me.

163
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:10,810
You're so young.

164
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,189
Nobody is taking care of you?

165
00:13:13,189 --> 00:13:16,269
I've been living here for as long as I can remember.

166
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:19,769
Growing up alone. Hanging out with a bunch of guys who beg and steal.

167
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:23,350
As long as they get some food, I won't starve.

168
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:31,188
Don't look so sad. We are very happy together every single day.

169
00:13:31,188 --> 00:13:36,108
I used to rank fifth. I had several little brothers.

170
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,730
Thanks.

171
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:44,408
So where are your friends?

172
00:13:44,408 --> 00:13:47,729
They are... dead.

173
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:52,329
- Because of the war?
- No.

174
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:55,088
We are beggars. They died of hunger, coldness, illness

175
00:13:55,088 --> 00:13:57,369
or being caught and beaten to death while stealing.

176
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,509
It's quite common.

177
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:03,709
You are so talkative. Are you going to eat it?

178
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,629
Stealing is not decent,

179
00:14:06,629 --> 00:14:08,988
but those thieves shouldn't be beaten to death.

180
00:14:08,988 --> 00:14:11,568
What are you crying for? I'm not bullying you.

181
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:14,928
I'm not crying. I just feel...

182
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,330
I just feel there's nothing I can do to help.

183
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:23,130
Here.

184
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,710
<i>I finally found you.</i>

185
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,270
<i>Dared to trick me?</i>

186
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,710
Run!

187
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,850
Hurry.

188
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,889
You little brat! Don't you run away from me!

189
00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:55,069
Brat!

190
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:01,128
- Xiao Wu. Save yourself.
- Stop!

191
00:15:01,128 --> 00:15:05,068
You ate a lot just now. Now don't waste it.

192
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:18,209
I'm so sorry. Please forgive us.

193
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,789
I shouldn't have messed with you.

194
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,929
My sister and I are both sorry.

195
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:23,929
Please forgive us.

196
00:15:23,929 --> 00:15:25,589
Little brat.

197
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:28,130
Don't expect me to buy it.

198
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,729
Didn't you throw a stone at me?

199
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,710
Xiao Wu.

200
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:39,269
Threw stones at me?

201
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:45,048
Please forgive us. We're so sorry.

202
00:15:45,048 --> 00:15:48,029
We've learned our lesson.

203
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:51,229
Okay. I'll let you go today.

204
00:15:51,229 --> 00:15:54,969
Do keep in mind. Stay away from me as far as possible.

205
00:15:54,969 --> 00:15:58,450
Should I ever see you again, I'll kill you two.

206
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:01,030
Brat.

207
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,450
Don't let me see you ever again.

208
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:15,249
Xiao Wu, are you all right? Let me have a look.

209
00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:16,770
I'm fine.

210
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,690
I've been beaten up more than you could imagine.

211
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,229
You...

212
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:27,508
Are you really okay? You're spitting blood.

213
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:30,489
I'm good. That was like a massage to me.

214
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,129
Don't make a fuss.

215
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:34,790
I just bit my tongue by accident.

216
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,968
Let's go back. The fire is about to go out.

217
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:15,508
Xiao Wu, wake up.

218
00:17:15,508 --> 00:17:19,309
They've already left. We need to hurry. Come on.

219
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:21,440
Don't wake me up. I just want to sleep for a bit longer.

220
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:25,220
Xiao Wu, wake up. Xiao Wu...

221
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:32,730
You have a fever.

222
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,369
Xiao Wu...

223
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:52,070
Your Majesty, I've asked Wei Shuyu to get the guards ready.

224
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:54,089
General Yuchi will be there, too.

225
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:57,329
But the Ashile Tribe is known for sudden caprices,

226
00:17:57,329 --> 00:18:00,629
taking such a risk by yourself, what if...

227
00:18:00,629 --> 00:18:03,609
So you know it's an "if". Don't meet trouble halfway.

228
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:06,000
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty...

229
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,920
Your Majesty, it's time for the alliance.

230
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,009
We may set out.

231
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,210
Should anything happen to me,

232
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:40,150
please assist the crown prince to govern.

233
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,789
Yes, Your Majesty.

234
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:04,510
I've dispatched the best archers of the Wolf Division.

235
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:07,389
The honor of killing Li Shimin is mine.

236
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:09,089
Don't you bother to try.

237
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:12,510
It's too soon to say it.

238
00:19:13,249 --> 00:19:15,590
We shall see.

239
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:36,528
<i>Time is running out.</i>

240
00:19:36,528 --> 00:19:41,648
<i>It is not a military fortress that I'm guarding, but the welfare of the people.</i>

241
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:46,889
<i>Their safety and happiness are really important.</i>

242
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:43,389
Since you're looking forward to peace, and have agreed to retreat today,

243
00:22:43,389 --> 00:22:47,030
Great Tang will let the past rest.

244
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:52,509
Now we'll give your man back.

245
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,210
Khan.

246
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,890
General.

247
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,190
It can wait.

248
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,009
But... the military counselor is gone.

249
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:55,930
What?

250
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:58,308
I found it just now. I've searched the campsite.

251
00:23:58,308 --> 00:24:00,948
She's not there. There's no sign of a fight in the tent.

252
00:24:00,948 --> 00:24:02,348
But I found a small opening.

253
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:04,830
I think the counselor has run away.

254
00:24:05,969 --> 00:24:07,929
Li Changge.

255
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,229
- Keep an eye on it.
- Yes, sir.

256
00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:20,550
The emperor of Great Tang is truly generous and tolerant.

257
00:24:57,269 --> 00:25:00,168
- Protect His Majesty.
- Protect His Majesty!

258
00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:03,230
Hold on!

259
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:09,330
How dare you try to assassinate His Majesty?

260
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:12,049
It's a misunderstanding.

261
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:22,230
- What was that?
- It was him.

262
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:25,009
He fired the arrow in advance and missed.

263
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,088
Take him away. In a quiet manner.

264
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,289
Yes, sir. Take him away.

265
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:40,210
Considering the alliance with the Ashile Tribe before,

266
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,650
we've met you halfway again and again.

267
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:47,149
We did it for our people, as well as for your warriors.

268
00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:51,669
But it seems you don't want to take the opportunity.

269
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:55,649
Your Majesty, it must be a misunderstanding.

270
00:25:55,649 --> 00:25:59,148
Misunderstanding? How do you explain this arrow?

271
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:01,929
We have treated the Ashile Tribe with sincerity,

272
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:04,629
yet you did this to us.

273
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:08,809
Instead of being grateful, you tried to assassinate His Majesty in our territory.

274
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:10,630
Even death cannot atone for your guilt.

275
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,850
If I really intended to assassinate you,

276
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:14,669
I wouldn't have waited until now.

277
00:26:14,669 --> 00:26:19,210
Yesterday at the Wei River, I could have fought to the death against you.

278
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,350
We need to investigate this accident.

279
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:25,189
It's likely that someone wanted to set me up

280
00:26:25,189 --> 00:26:27,070
and take advantage of our rivalry.

281
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,270
Your Majesty is valorous and wise.

282
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,549
But I'm no fool, either.

283
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:36,270
In my tribe, there are tens of thousands of excellent archers.

284
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:40,950
It's unlikely that we couldn't find even one crack shot,

285
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,570
that would get me in this situation.

286
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:44,729
If it's really the case,

287
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:49,569
then I don't deserve being the king of the prairie.

288
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,969
As for this accident,

289
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,429
please trust and understand me.

290
00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:00,849
The minute I find out about the truth,

291
00:27:00,849 --> 00:27:03,770
I'll give you a satisfactory explanation.

292
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,309
It sounds beautiful.

293
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:06,809
But you break your words again and again.

294
00:27:06,809 --> 00:27:09,110
It's hard for us to believe you again.

295
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,600
If you really mean it,

296
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,640
tell your men to retreat 90 miles.

297
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,350
Then we will let you go.

298
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:19,150
Otherwise...

299
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:25,950
General Yuchi.

300
00:27:33,229 --> 00:27:37,850
Tell them. Move the campsite north and retreat 90 miles.

301
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:39,250
Yes, sir.

302
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:54,309
Didn't you hear the Great Khan's order?

303
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,310
Retreat! Now!

304
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,470
I said now!

305
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:07,169
Retreat.

306
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:08,789
Hurry.

307
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:10,489
<i>Let's go.</i>

308
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:49,949
Stop. Nobody move.

309
00:28:49,949 --> 00:28:51,870
Stop right here.

310
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,189
We haven't gone that far, which doesn't meet their requirement.

311
00:28:58,189 --> 00:29:00,029
Qibi Duo, what are you doing?

312
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,830
Keep going.

313
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:03,590
What do you know?

314
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,309
Now is a perfect time for a surprise attack.

315
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:07,490
They think we're retreating.

316
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,889
So if we turn back now, we can destroy them.

317
00:29:10,889 --> 00:29:12,149
Surprise attack?

318
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:14,710
Don't you forget that Great Khan is in their hand?

319
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:17,270
Do you want to commit treason?

320
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,869
My Qibi Tribe has trekked this far with no reward.

321
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:25,389
We deserve more than this.

322
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:28,670
If the surprise attack works,

323
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,730
we will not only get properties,

324
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,110
but also the whole central plain.

325
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,289
<i>True.</i>

326
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:35,729
<i>He's right.</i>

327
00:29:35,729 --> 00:29:37,050
Who dares?

328
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:39,149
What's Qibi Duo doing?

329
00:29:39,149 --> 00:29:42,129
Warriors, let's return to the Wei River.

330
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:43,750
Get Great Khan out.

331
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,569
It's a perfect opportunity.

332
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,030
Hold on.

333
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,149
Stop!

334
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:52,830
You're going to get Great Khan killed. Nobody move!

335
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,849
- Somebody take him down.
- Yes, sir.

336
00:29:54,849 --> 00:29:55,930
Don't you touch me!

337
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:59,050
Anyone who tries to stop me shall be punished with him!

338
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:00,210
But Great Khan...

339
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,570
Even if Great Khan dies, so what?

340
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:08,390
- Then things will—
- His life is not your responsibility.

341
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,089
See, Ashile Sun didn't say anything, either.

342
00:30:15,229 --> 00:30:17,769
<i>Ashile Sun, what are you thinking?</i>

343
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:20,249
Warriors, follow me back to the Wei River.

344
00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:23,489
Get Great Khan out. Go!

345
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,889
Eagle Division!

346
00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:41,389
Yes, sir.

347
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:44,569
Great Khan has ordered us to retreat.

348
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:47,149
Anyone who disobeys shall be killed on the spot.

349
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:48,949
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

350
00:30:51,189 --> 00:30:52,230
General Sun.

351
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:54,129
- Shixin Sili.
- Yes, sir.

352
00:30:54,129 --> 00:30:57,069
Keep retreating, make a campsite 90 miles away,

353
00:30:57,069 --> 00:30:59,309
and wait for Khan's return.

354
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:01,789
Wait for Khan's return!

355
00:31:01,789 --> 00:31:06,330
<i>Wait for Khan's return! Wait for Khan's return!</i>

356
00:31:19,129 --> 00:31:22,149
Thanks to Heaven's blessing, Your Majesty didn't get hurt.

357
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:26,469
I really broke out in a cold sweat.

358
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:28,770
Heaven's blessing?

359
00:31:33,649 --> 00:31:35,049
Your Majesty.

360
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:55,050
Hitting the glass in my hand from ten feet away.

361
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,669
If Heaven is not behind this,

362
00:31:56,669 --> 00:31:59,429
it must be somebody with excellent skills.

363
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:04,870
Send the scout to the Ashile Tribe to look into this.

364
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:08,230
Find out who fired this arrow.

365
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:10,469
Your Majesty, you mean...

366
00:32:10,469 --> 00:32:14,909
If it's someone whose loyalty belongs to us, do get him out.

367
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,350
Yes, sir.

368
00:32:21,069 --> 00:32:24,049
<i>Please, prove me wrong.</i>

369
00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:29,149
Bring the guy who fired the arrow and missed.

370
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:32,110
Ask Sun and She'er to come here.

371
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:36,510
I want to see which division this idiot comes from.

372
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,010
<i>Yes, Sir!</i>

373
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:57,180
Idiot, even if you're cut into pieces,

374
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,710
it won't atone for the trouble you caused today.

375
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:07,750
- Father.
- Uncle.

376
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:15,670
She'er, so this is what you've trained?

377
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:16,970
I'm sorry, Great Khan.

378
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,129
I was so eager to earn honor for the Wolf Division and you

379
00:33:20,129 --> 00:33:22,110
that I missed the target.

380
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:25,550
Bullshit!

381
00:33:28,289 --> 00:33:30,490
Why are you dressed like this?

382
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,550
I've never seen you.

383
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:34,710
There are so many warriors in the Wolf Division.

384
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:37,669
It's natural that you don't know me.

385
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:41,850
I made the mistake of being impatient.

386
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:46,729
But I'm a hundred percent loyal to you.

387
00:33:46,729 --> 00:33:50,029
Great Khan, I swear to Sirius,

388
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:52,689
my whole family was killed by Li Shimin.

389
00:33:52,689 --> 00:33:55,969
If he hadn't raised the glass so suddenly,

390
00:33:55,969 --> 00:33:59,130
I would have already avenged their death.

391
00:34:00,649 --> 00:34:03,709
Great Khan, please give me a second chance.

392
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:07,410
Not killing Li Shimin will make me turn in the grave.

393
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:11,009
I don't care about your history with Li Shimin.

394
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:14,150
Now tell me. Why are you wearing this outfit?

395
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,950
I'll kill you if you don't tell the truth.

396
00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:19,750
If I had succeeded in killing Li Shimin,

397
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:23,170
would you still doubt that I was one of the Wolf Division?

398
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:33,650
So this is one of the best warriors of your division?

399
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,950
Uncle, he... he's trying to fool us.

400
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:38,609
One outfit of my division.

401
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:42,789
It's easy to get if someone intends to set me up.

402
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,569
Why are you looking at me?

403
00:34:44,569 --> 00:34:47,650
Well? You think I set you up?

404
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:49,750
It's not unlikely.

405
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,310
Great Khan, it's Shixin Sili.

406
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,010
Come in.

407
00:34:59,189 --> 00:35:00,990
Great Khan.

408
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,288
What is it?

409
00:35:02,288 --> 00:35:03,889
Qi...

410
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,449
Don't waste time.

411
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,590
Qibi Duo really did this?

412
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:27,828
That was too easy for him to die like that.

413
00:35:27,828 --> 00:35:28,869
It was.

414
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:34,029
Were it not for General Sun, things would have gotten terribly wrong.

415
00:35:34,029 --> 00:35:36,509
She'er, answer me.

416
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:41,529
What were you doing when Qibi Duo betrayed me?

417
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:46,150
If Sun hadn't shot him,

418
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,330
would you have turned on me?

419
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:49,289
No, I would never.

420
00:35:49,289 --> 00:35:51,528
Uncle, please allow me to explain.

421
00:35:51,528 --> 00:35:53,449
I've never meant to hurt you. Ever.

422
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:55,688
I... I was just in shock then.

423
00:35:55,688 --> 00:35:58,050
Please believe me, Uncle.

424
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:00,190
Good-for-nothing!

425
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,449
You've trained an idiot.

426
00:36:01,449 --> 00:36:03,850
You're an idiot, too!

427
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:11,489
Sun, you did a good job.

428
00:36:13,149 --> 00:36:18,510
No matter what, I'd never let you in danger.

429
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:23,749
Son, you've saved my life.

430
00:36:23,749 --> 00:36:27,410
A son doesn't have to beat about the bush with his father.

431
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:30,089
Now tell me what you want.

432
00:36:30,089 --> 00:36:34,270
Father, please don't kill him.

433
00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:39,828
Why?

434
00:36:39,828 --> 00:36:41,750
No particular reason.

435
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:43,490
It's just that he said

436
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:46,970
to kill Li Shimin and earn you honor was his lifelong dream.

437
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:51,088
If everyone is like him, it won't be long before we defeat the Great Tang Army.

438
00:36:51,088 --> 00:36:54,590
He only missed the target because of bad luck.

439
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,670
Death is too harsh a penalty.

440
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,528
Besides, this long trek has produced no fruit.

441
00:37:00,528 --> 00:37:02,909
The morale is low. Soldiers are on edge.

442
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:04,949
If we kill a loyal warrior,

443
00:37:04,949 --> 00:37:07,710
I'm afraid it'll chill their hearts.

444
00:37:09,289 --> 00:37:12,989
Why not spare him since he's loyal?

445
00:37:12,989 --> 00:37:16,910
The soldiers will not forget it.

446
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:22,309
In the future, they will fight for us with more determination.

447
00:37:26,009 --> 00:37:27,810
Did you hear it?

448
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:32,710
You always see the big picture, and always think long-term.

449
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:37,349
Okay, I'll allow it.

450
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:43,949
You useless idiot.

451
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:45,709
Take your guy away.

452
00:37:45,709 --> 00:37:47,930
Do not let me see him again.

453
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:51,310
It's best that you stay out of my sight for a while.

454
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,010
Yes, Sir.

455
00:37:55,869 --> 00:37:57,569
Take him away.

456
00:38:12,569 --> 00:38:18,170
♪ Crossing the river to pick hibiscus ♪

457
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:23,110
♪ The brilliant orchid and many fragrant herbs ♪

458
00:38:24,289 --> 00:38:29,089
♪ I pick it and desire to give it to someone ♪

459
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:35,650
So cold... is it snowing?

460
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:42,049
Xiao Wu, are you feeling better?

461
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,889
You were just singing?

462
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,749
It was beautiful.

463
00:38:46,749 --> 00:38:49,390
I know you suck at many things.

464
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:52,089
Didn't know you were good at singing.

465
00:38:52,089 --> 00:38:56,649
When you get better, I'll sing to you every day.

466
00:38:59,529 --> 00:39:01,229
Where are the others?

467
00:39:01,229 --> 00:39:03,889
Why are we here alone?

468
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:07,709
The others... they've left.

469
00:39:07,709 --> 00:39:09,309
But that's all right.

470
00:39:09,309 --> 00:39:11,868
When you get better, we can catch up with them.

471
00:39:11,868 --> 00:39:17,369
I thought you were just a little silly, but you're actually an idiot.

472
00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:19,069
You think we're in the city?

473
00:39:19,069 --> 00:39:20,410
You have nothing with you.

474
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,830
How do you have the nerve to be left alone?

475
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:30,329
Let alone reaching Luoyang, you'll get eaten by the wolves soon.

476
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:35,890
Xiao Wu...

477
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,828
Why are you still sitting here?

478
00:39:48,828 --> 00:39:51,789
Go catch up with them.

479
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,449
I'm not going anywhere.

480
00:39:53,449 --> 00:39:56,029
You've already called me your sister.

481
00:39:56,029 --> 00:40:00,449
No sister will leave her little brother alone.

482
00:40:00,449 --> 00:40:02,609
So you got yourself a little brother.

483
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:04,909
Took advantage of me.

484
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:18,650
Xiao Wu, let's make the best of our lives.

485
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,690
So girlish.

486
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:26,110
Careful.

487
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,269
I'm young and strong.

488
00:40:28,269 --> 00:40:30,269
It will take more than a fever to kill me.

489
00:40:30,269 --> 00:40:32,890
Let's hit the road.

490
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,628
Come on, or we'll never catch up with them.

491
00:40:39,628 --> 00:40:41,329
Come on.

492
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:48,468
Careful. Slowly.

493
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:54,370
Here he comes.

494
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,210
General.

495
00:40:58,229 --> 00:40:59,749
Where's the counselor?

496
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:02,190
She claimed to be from the Wolf Division.

497
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,130
She'er took her.

498
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:08,329
She's sacrificing herself for us, Eagle Division.

499
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:09,950
No, I'll go to save her.

500
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:11,229
You can't go.

501
00:41:11,229 --> 00:41:13,728
You going there now won't save the counselor.

502
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,388
It will only prove she's connected to us, Eagle Division.

503
00:41:16,388 --> 00:41:19,929
Then her effort will go to waste.

504
00:41:21,149 --> 00:41:23,049
That's right.

505
00:41:23,049 --> 00:41:24,609
We can't do anything now.

506
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:27,650
But the troops are going to leave, and we need to return to our domain.

507
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:30,629
Then the counselor will be at the capital all alone. We need to do something.

508
00:41:30,629 --> 00:41:33,609
- Young Khan won't spare her.
- I will save her.

509
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:38,810
There's no way I'll stand by and watch her die.

510
00:41:39,909 --> 00:41:41,830
Save?

511
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:44,230
Who are you going to save?

512
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:50,309
The guy who couldn't even hit his target?

513
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:52,488
He claimed to be one of my men.

514
00:41:52,488 --> 00:41:55,150
Why do you care so much?

515
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:58,469
I wasn't sure if he was one of your men back there.

516
00:41:58,469 --> 00:42:00,969
Now watching you like this,

517
00:42:02,009 --> 00:42:04,669
I am sure of it.

518
00:42:06,049 --> 00:42:07,808
It's fine that you don't admit it.

519
00:42:07,808 --> 00:42:10,048
There are plenty of ways to get him to talk.

520
00:42:10,048 --> 00:42:14,070
She'er. Don't you dare.

521
00:42:14,070 --> 00:42:16,589
Let's see.

522
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:36,030
I took a nap and dreamed about this arrow.

523
00:42:37,249 --> 00:42:41,429
But I just couldn't see who fired it.

524
00:42:41,429 --> 00:42:46,710
I was wondering whether he did it to save me

525
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,329
or it was just a failed assassination.

526
00:42:49,329 --> 00:42:51,669
Your Majesty, you've narrowly escaped death.

527
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:53,030
You're thinking too much.

528
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:56,589
Please take care of your health.

529
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:01,109
I'd like to hear what you really think about this.

530
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:08,069
Your Majesty, I never believe in coincidence

531
00:43:08,069 --> 00:43:10,929
when it comes to life or death.

532
00:43:10,929 --> 00:43:14,830
I believe coincidences are careful plannings.

533
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:17,628
Whether the man who fired this arrow is loyal to us,

534
00:43:17,628 --> 00:43:19,810
there's one thing that's for sure.

535
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:24,600
He definitely disapproves Yanli Khan's act of aggression.

536
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,299
Your Majesty, I heard it from my son.

537
00:43:27,299 --> 00:43:29,819
The night before the negotiation,

538
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:32,339
Princess Yongning went to the Ashile Tribe.

539
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,460
So you think it was Changge?
