23
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,140
This is so ridiculous! How could my father accept your proposal?

24
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,699
What are you worried about?

25
00:01:43,699 --> 00:01:48,080
I told you that every hero can compete on the stage.

26
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,670
Does it mean people from Great Tang can take up the challenge as well?

27
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,750
What's wrong? Are you afraid that your Brother Shuyu dares not to challenge?

28
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,629
Yueyan?

29
00:01:59,629 --> 00:02:04,330
Well... The Young Khan of Ashile must be brilliant, right?

30
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,070
What if nobody else can defeat him?

31
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:11,269
Tian Ji could win horse racing with the "best" horse against an "average" horse of Emperor Wei of Qi.

32
00:02:11,269 --> 00:02:13,230
I can win him as well.

33
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,230
I refuse.

34
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,229
Why?

35
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:19,930
Not interested.

36
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:24,109
Changge, it's okay. Let's forget it.

37
00:02:24,109 --> 00:02:25,749
Just fight for Yueyan.

38
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,309
You can defeat She'er and lose to Wei Shuyu.

39
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,609
It's done!

40
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,270
That Wei can defeat me?

41
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,294
How could it be possible?

42
00:02:34,294 --> 00:02:36,029
So you should lose to him with initiative.

43
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,230
Why?

44
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,989
Why not?

45
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:41,389
You won't marry Li Yueyan, so you certainly should surrender to him.

46
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:45,570
Changge, it's unnecessary for you to quarrel about my business.

47
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:49,090
Anyway, I won't lose to that guy in front of you.

48
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,160
Fine, I won't talk to him.

49
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:00,520
Changge.

50
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,340
Changge. Changge.

51
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,879
Don't push your friend.

52
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:10,260
No need to push Brother Shuyu, either.

53
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,219
If he loves me, he will manage to win the race.

54
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:16,680
If he doesn't,

55
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,669
just let it be.

56
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:21,409
There are so many excellent men in Great Tang.

57
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,970
It's impossible that I won't be able to get married.

58
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,289
Yueyan, you've really changed a lot.

59
00:03:28,289 --> 00:03:29,269
Fine.

60
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:30,829
Although She'er can't be defeated easily,

61
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,330
depleting his energy is also a good method.

62
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,169
<i>Stop. You're not allowed to enter.</i>

63
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:57,629
Go on.

64
00:03:57,629 --> 00:03:59,630
Come on.

65
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,750
Li Chengqian.

66
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:05,170
It's you!

67
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,350
Li Changge.

68
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,909
You haven't gotten away with what you did in Luoyang yet.

69
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:15,129
Fine. Anyone?

70
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,190
Li Chengqian.

71
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,590
Sister.

72
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,410
Everyone, get out.

73
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:34,550
You, come here.

74
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,849
Sister, calm down.

75
00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:37,269
You can't beat me anymore.

76
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,169
I'll ask for punishment from our father later.

77
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:40,749
- But now, come here.
- No, no.

78
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:42,109
- Don't...
- I...
- Let me go.

79
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:45,029
It's their fault! They brought me here.

80
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:47,730
<i>No, no, no!</i>

81
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:58,810
Unfortunately, you know that I'm still alive today.

82
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:02,870
Considering our acquaintance before, I don't mind it.

83
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,209
But if there is any rumor later in Chang'an

84
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:08,690
saying that Princess Yongning is still alive,

85
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,830
you should know the consequence.

86
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,550
Why are you all afraid of her so much?

87
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,649
Li Chengqian, you're too young to know anything.

88
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:22,509
What they're doing is something I've done long before.

89
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:25,670
Tell him. What I did in those years.

90
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,389
Assistant Minister Wang is the son of the Wangs from Eastern Jin.

91
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:32,089
Three bones of his were broken by Yongning for robbing a lady.

92
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:33,849
After that, Wang runs away once he sees any woman.

93
00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:35,309
Until now, he's still unmarried.

94
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:36,989
The youngest son of Ministry Councillor Chen

95
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,869
defecated in the release pool of East Market.

96
00:05:38,869 --> 00:05:41,669
Yongning made him soak in it for two days.

97
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:44,609
From then on, Young Master Chen has concentrated on Buddhism

98
00:05:44,609 --> 00:05:46,800
and released captive animals.

99
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,170
Because I offended Princess Yongan when I was a kid,

100
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,109
Yongning beat me every time we met.

101
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:53,530
In order to run away from her,

102
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:56,150
I kept practicing and got my current shape.

103
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,210
Are you Erpang?

104
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,250
The one who kept bullying me when we were kids?

105
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:10,130
Li Chengqian, come here.

106
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,529
Do you always have fun together with him?

107
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:15,669
Why should I tell you?

108
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:18,150
Come, I have a word in your ear.

109
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,490
I want him to help your sister in the contest for her marriage.

110
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,829
Zhangsui Jing is different from us,

111
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:30,909
he was called for making up the absence today.

112
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,310
As you can see, he sat aside and watched without playing anything.

113
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,509
Sister, you made an excellent choice.

114
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,810
I can prove that he's a good man.

115
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,710
Okay.

116
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,830
You're selected.

117
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,869
There will be a contest for Princess Yongan's hand in marriage tomorrow.

118
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:48,609
You should defeat the people from Ashile Tribe.

119
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:51,370
Our princess is not allowed to be snatched by others.

120
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,410
Father.

121
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:26,510
It seems that your father

122
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,410
is not able to teach you anymore in the future.

123
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:33,230
Don't say such discouraging words.

124
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,609
We'll find the best doctors to treat you.

125
00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:40,860
I know my health condition very well.

126
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:48,810
You must be loyal to His Majesty.

127
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,590
Father, please be assured.

128
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,329
I will definitely be loyal to Great Tang.

129
00:07:52,329 --> 00:07:55,889
There are many different ways to pledge loyalty.

130
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:03,610
We can't lose the contest against Ashile Tribe tomorrow.

131
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,850
I know what you're thinking.

132
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:14,090
You should consider carefully first.

133
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,950
If you think you don't deserve it,

134
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:21,420
you can win against the Young Khan

135
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:26,230
and lose to other noblemen later.

136
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,030
However,

137
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:34,050
you can also win the ultimate victory.

138
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:46,350
I would have been just a wandering kid if you hadn't raised me.

139
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,949
How dare I go beyond my identity to marry the princess?

140
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:53,869
I abandoned my family for our nation my whole life

141
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:57,190
and never considered anything for myself.

142
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,670
But you don't need to follow my steps.

143
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:03,469
Just comply with your true wishes.

144
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:07,310
Do whatever you want and don't overstep the rules.

145
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:11,970
That might be a way of living for you as well.

146
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,330
Welcome.

147
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,370
Masters.

148
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,210
You're here, too.

149
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,089
- Let's see who will win.
- Right.

150
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,489
How could Sun not come as he said?

151
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:47,569
Of course, Brother Sun can't come.

152
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:50,409
If he joins, he must win.

153
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:54,210
But he must marry the princess from Great Tang if he wins.

154
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,410
This is not good.

155
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,909
I feel even reluctant to see him marry you.

156
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:01,910
It's impossible

157
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,110
to allow him to marry a princess from Great Tang.

158
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:09,549
Changge, why isn't the Emperor of Great Tang present?

159
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:12,410
It's enough for him to know the result.

160
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,250
Result?

161
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:31,290
Welcome the defending warrior, Young Khan from Ashile.

162
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,530
Envoys, does anyone wants to compete against him?

163
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,329
If nobody competes with him, I'll...

164
00:11:14,329 --> 00:11:16,610
I want to compete against him.

165
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,450
It's Zhixi.

166
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,450
Why does Zhixi stand out?

167
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,869
The Tiele Tribe always flatters the Ashile Tribe.

168
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:32,390
They're against the alliance the most.

169
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:36,490
Could it be possible that he wants to join the Great Tang camp?

170
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,549
Young Khan is brave and fierce,

171
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,749
no doubt you're the bravest warrior of the grassland.

172
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,890
You deserve to marry the princess of Great Tang.

173
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,950
Zhixi wants to congratulate you on marrying the new Khatun in advance.

174
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,190
Look at Zhixi.

175
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,950
Young Khan won.

176
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,129
The guy from Tiele Tribe.

177
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:20,769
Are you so spineless?

178
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:22,689
If you don't want to form an alliance with Tang,

179
00:12:22,689 --> 00:12:24,269
just go back to the desert.

180
00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:26,129
Don't embarrass our people.

181
00:12:26,129 --> 00:12:28,829
Your Highness, we are no match for Young Khan indeed.

182
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,109
If your people from Monan can defeat the Young Khan of Ashile,

183
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,170
just challenge him.

184
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:40,130
Nobody from Mobei or Monan dares to fight?

185
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:44,109
Don't you want to ally with Great Tang because nobody can win?

186
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:45,949
You have no other choice but to rely on Great Tang.

187
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,130
However, the Princess of Great Tang will get married to Young Khan.

188
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,469
Why can't you see the current situation

189
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,229
instead of playing to the gallery with the princess from Mobei?

190
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,730
You...

191
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,789
I must beat you up today!

192
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,629
Don't take offense at him.

193
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,230
Sit down.

194
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,150
Why do you come so late?

195
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,429
What's this on your head?

196
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,090
Don't touch my plume crown.

197
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:37,490
We're facing a challenge,

198
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,370
so I certainly should wear it in an aggressive style.

199
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,529
Why are you laughing? Who are you?

200
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:45,010
Are you laughing at me?

201
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,509
She's Princess Tujia from Monan.

202
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,350
She's on our side.

203
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,890
Zhenzhu, this is the Crown Prince of Great Tang.

204
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:59,770
Your Highness is such a brave hero, I just felt very excited.

205
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,090
What are you wearing?

206
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:08,130
How can Princess Yongan come here?

207
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,350
But I want to see the result as well.

208
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,849
It's okay, Changge. Nobody will find it out.

209
00:14:14,849 --> 00:14:17,070
You two are truly sister and brother.

210
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:20,369
Fine, time is out. Come in quickly.

211
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,590
Nobody from the desert can defeat me, right?

212
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:31,369
- So the marriage with Great Tang would be...
- It's still too early to say that.

213
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,170
Welcome, Your Highness the Crown Prince.

214
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,410
Are you the Young Khan of Ashile Tribe who wants to marry my sister?

215
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,450
Your Highness.

216
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:08,470
The man on the stage is my son.

217
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,130
Khatun of Ashile, thank you.

218
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,170
I'll keep the etiquette

219
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:15,970
since we won't become a family anyway.

220
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,070
So we'd better be polite.

221
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,889
Does Your Highness bring someone to challenge?

222
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:25,970
We'll know whether we can become a family later.

223
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:29,849
Brother Zhangsun, please help my sister.

224
00:15:29,849 --> 00:15:31,669
I'll try my best. Hope you won't be disappointed.

225
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,069
I feel close to the two princesses,

226
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,609
you are allowed to watch the competition on the tower with me.

227
00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:39,730
Thanks, Your Highness.

228
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:54,870
Chegnqian, is it going to work?

229
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,149
Trust me, Sister.

230
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,650
Brother Zhangsun is the most brilliant fighter among the nephews of our mom.

231
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:03,690
If he can't win, nobody else can.

232
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:27,270
It's too fast.

233
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,569
- He lost without fighting.
- Right.

234
00:16:30,569 --> 00:16:35,230
Young Khan of Ashile won again.

235
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,309
What? Is it over already?

236
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:42,210
Does anyone else want to challenge the Young Khan?

237
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,410
Don't we really have anyone capable?

238
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:52,070
Seems nobody dares challenge.

239
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:53,630
Don't be in a rush.

240
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,869
Marriage is one of the most important things in one's life.

241
00:16:55,869 --> 00:16:58,009
Shouldn't it be considered carefully?

242
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:03,469
Since Your Highness said so, I'll leave some time for you all to think

243
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:06,450
if you want to challenge me.

244
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:11,190
Can't believe Zhangsun Jing is such a weak fighter.

245
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:13,510
What to do now?

246
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:17,470
I don't want my sister to marry in a poor and barren place.

247
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:20,830
Plus, I dislike this She'er even by sight.

248
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:22,869
I don't want him to be my brother-in-law.

249
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,810
Yueyan, don't worry.

250
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,290
Shuyu must come.

251
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:31,830
Young Master Wei arrives.

252
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,809
What happened?

253
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,150
Young Master Wei is here.

254
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,790
That's great.

255
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:58,090
Brother Shuyu.

256
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:06,670
Yueyan, before I get on the stage, I have something to tell you.

257
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:11,410
After thinking about it carefully, I've decided to tell you.

258
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,750
I will definitely issue a challenge.

259
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:18,029
You are my sister, I will never allow you to get married in the grassland.

260
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:21,069
But it's just a kind of protection. I can't lie to you.

261
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:26,690
It doesn't mean we'll get married after I win.

262
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:37,530
Yueyan, I feel very gratified to see you become so brave.

263
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,810
So I can't be indecisive and stay in the past.

264
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:45,650
I hope you can understand my feeling as a brother.

265
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,170
I'm sorry.

266
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,990
I see.

267
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,830
Brother Shuyu, since you don't aim to marry me,

268
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:00,190
there is no need for you to take the challenge.

269
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:07,270
What I want is not the victory of this race,

270
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,270
but a true lover of mine.

271
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:12,770
I know it the best in my mind.

272
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,110
It's not the feeling between sister and brother,

273
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:20,370
but the forever love between a couple.

274
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:25,169
The man on the stage fights for me because of love

275
00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:27,210
instead of the protectiveness.

276
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:30,030
If you just want to protect me,

277
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,290
I don't need that.

278
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,750
Even if you win,

279
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,569
that will be only a kind of contempt and shame to me.

280
00:19:38,569 --> 00:19:41,489
But the contest today...

281
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:46,150
No need to bother you about this.

282
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:50,390
I am not like before.

283
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:56,250
I can handle my own business well.

284
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:00,830
Thank you, Brother Shuyu.

285
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,230
Yueyan.

286
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,490
What's wrong?

287
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:45,090
Where is Shuyu? Why doesn't he come with you?

288
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,030
Did he bully you?

289
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,310
- I'll go and find him.
- No.

290
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,950
I don't want to force him.

291
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,810
And I don't want to compromise, either.

292
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:04,390
Have you made it all clear?

293
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,530
Absolutely clear.

294
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,809
I will ask Sun for help.

295
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,029
No need.

296
00:21:10,029 --> 00:21:12,170
- Why?
- I don't want to impose anyone.

297
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,490
This is not.

298
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,410
It's about the most crucial moment in your life.

299
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,890
We'd better solve the current problem first. Wait for me.

300
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,050
Changge.

301
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,970
Brother Sun.

302
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,810
You're here.

303
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,110
Get on the stage quickly.

304
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,309
I just came to watch.

305
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,789
What? Watch?

306
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:36,109
Since you're here, you must want to help. Why don't you admit it?

307
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:37,109
I won't help others.

308
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,550
Yueyan is not "others."

309
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,889
Brother Sun, don't talk more.

310
00:21:41,889 --> 00:21:43,589
Although I don't want you to go on the stage,

311
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,309
now we don't have another choice.

312
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:46,990
Take the challenge now.

313
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:50,569
What's going on? Still nobody dares challenge?

314
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,319
If nobody challenges my son,

315
00:21:55,319 --> 00:22:00,640
the marriage between Great Tang and my son will be settled.

316
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,660
- Go now!
- Brother Sun!

317
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,139
Fight with him first, and let's deal with the aftermath later.

318
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:09,419
That's right, even though Changge agrees, I will not then.

319
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,859
What's going on?

320
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,619
You've got enough time for consideration.

321
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,900
I'll count down from three now.

322
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,340
If nobody else comes, this marriage will be decided.

323
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,120
- Three.
- Sun.

324
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,839
Brother Sun!

325
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,559
Look at his complacent face!

326
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,740
Don't you want to beat him?

327
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,940
Two.

328
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,640
Quickly, jump from here.

329
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,140
I...

330
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,100
One.

331
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,700
Sun!

There's still me!

333
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,160
Hao Du.

334
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,420
Who are you?

335
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,590
A soldier of Great Tang who can defeat you.

336
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,790

He's an admirable hero.

375
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,450
Hao Du.

376
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,269
Thank you!

377
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:16,610
I'm going back to report to His Majesty.

378
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,350
Goodbye.

379
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,530
<i>Perfect victory.</i>

380
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,769
<i>Good job! Great.</i>

381
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:31,070
I... I won.

382
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,390
You don't need to marry him.

383
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:37,390
No need to marry him.

384
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:56,210
I know that you met

385
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,830
Yueyan and talked with her clearly.

386
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:03,150
Yes. I didn't mean to hurt her.

387
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,680
You are right.

388
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,360
No lie should be acceptable.

389
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,700
But if Hao Du hadn't come today, the result wouldn't have been positive.

390
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,359
If Hao Du hadn't come,

391
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,080
I was well prepared to challenge the Young Khan.

392
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,890
I would never allow the people of the Ashile Tribe to take Yueyan away.

393
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,470
But after that, I would apologize to His Majesty by myself.

394
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,679
Give Yueyan some time.

395
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,680
I believe she can think it through.

396
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,380
I don't expect that we three can go back to the same as before.

397
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,100
But at least, you and Yueyan should live a good life.

398
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:41,340
I will be your brother at any time.

399
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,940
Thank you, Shuyu.

400
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,599
Shuyu, there is something you have to pay more attention to.

401
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,820
The Khatun from Ashile Tribe should be watched out by Great Tang.

402
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,500
Why did you go on stage?

403
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,020
I...

404
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,340
I didn't want the Ashile Tribe to bully our Kingdom of Great Tang for its lack of heroes.

405
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,190
So you are...

406
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,220
the same as Brother Shuyu.

407
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,450
You fought for the reputation of Tang,

408
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,680
instead of me.

409
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,500
Hao Du,

410
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,760
I have my own method to keep Great Tang's reputation.

411
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,740
I don't need your help.

412
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,880
No, actually, I...

413
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,940
I just don't want to see

414
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,380
you being forced to marry someone you don't love.

415
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,100
This is a contest for my marriage.

416
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,580
I will marry whoever wins.

417
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,720
Now you are the winner.

418
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,220
According to the rules, I should marry you.

419
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:58,480
So do you think you are the one I love?

420
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:08,020
I know who the one you love is.

421
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,380
Your Highness, don't worry,

422
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,420
this result doesn't count.

423
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,640
I will report the truth to His Majesty.

424
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:18,870
So you didn't plan

425
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,990
to marry me in the very beginning?

426
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,350
I'm just a warrior.

427
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,970
It was just my wild wish.

428
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:32,870
Why are you always so respectful and humble in front of me?

429
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:35,210
You could have achieved way greater merit.

430
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:38,849
- Why did you fight with your life on the ring for me?
- Because you are worth it.

431
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,790
But...

432
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,800
But I don't qualify.

433
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,460
Do you want to know what you are like in my mind?

434
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,690
I thought you looked like the ice

435
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,780
when we first met.

436
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,700
Your expression was always cool.

437
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,720
Your heart was cold too.

438
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,900
So I was afraid of you very much.

439
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,840
I didn't want or dare to get close to you.

440
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:31,900
After that, you fought with Changge and even wanted to kill her.

441
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,360
So I hated you even more.

442
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,740
I realized I was wrong.

443
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,020
You were not cold-blooded.

444
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,160
You were heartless.

445
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,050
But...

446
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:57,120
when I escaped from the north to Luoyang, you saved me.

447
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:00,740
When you held me and told me you would take me home,

448
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,980
I didn't fear you anymore.

449
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,040
On the contrary,

450
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,660
I've relied on you more and more since then.

451
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:18,220
I gradually realized that you were warm.

452
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,520
I felt at ease...

453
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,560
and relieved to stay with you.

454
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,820
And gradually I knew that most of what you'd done

455
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,180
was against your will, but you had no choice.

456
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:38,620
What you said was not what you really meant.

457
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:43,060
Hao Du, actually, you are a good man.

458
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:46,530
But you like hiding your feelings.

459
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,950
You always bring pressure to yourself but satisfy others.

460
00:34:54,760 --> 00:35:00,480
When I saw you get beaten up again and again on the stage,

461
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,960
I was really scared.

462
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,280
I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to see you anymore.

463
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,220
Once I thought about it, I...

464
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,880
I'm asking you for the last time.

465
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,520
Why did you take the challenge?

466
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,380
Because I didn't want you to feel sad.

467
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,299
And I also wanted an opportunity for myself this time.

468
00:35:36,299 --> 00:35:38,180
What opportunity?

469
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:42,839
Your Highness, you said that you are a royal lady, so I should protect you.

470
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:46,300
In the past, I protected you as a guard.

471
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,500
But in the future...

472
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,450
What?

473
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,920
In the future,

474
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,019
I will protect you as your husband.

00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,560
You...

501
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,879
Are you injured badly?

502
00:37:55,879 --> 00:38:00,400
Why can you still hug me so hard? I couldn't breathe.

503
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,300
I don't know what's wrong with me.

504
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,240
I think I've recovered after hearing what you said.

505
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:17,080
If so, how about going to the farm with me tomorrow?

506
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,860
I haven't gone in a long time.

507
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:21,299
I don't know how the people there are doing.

508
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,000
Okay.

509
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,300
From now on, I will go with you wherever you want to go.

510
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,460
<i>[Sifang Pavilion]</i>

511
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,860
Look at your feet!

512
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:08,200
I can't imagine the little rabbit is getting married.

513
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,680
Yueyan, can you forget Shuyu for sure?

514
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,880
Marriage is a serious matter.

515
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,600
If you don't like Hao Du, nobody can force you.

516
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:30,440
Changge, I'm not the lachrymose rabbit anymore.

517
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,680
In fact, I was taking Brother Shuyu as my hero

518
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,299
to rely on him and adore him.

519
00:39:38,299 --> 00:39:41,300
I was used to it.

520
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:46,220
What happened at the contest made me finally realize

521
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:50,700
that I've ignored Hao Du who's around me.

522
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:57,240
Brother Shuyu should always be my brother.

523
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,880
Are you sure you like Hao Du?

524
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,800
So... what about Sun to you?

525
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,360
What are your feelings about loving him?

526
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,539
You become more and more tricky now!

527
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,620
It's me that started asking you.

528
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:15,720
Do you feel at ease the most when you're with Sun?

529
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,920
You can express all your happiness, anger, or sorrow to him.

530
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,140
<i>Besides, you don't need to worry that he'd dislike your shortcomings.</i>

531
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,560
<i>You may want to show him the truest part of yourself.</i>

532
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:38,120
When I met him, it was at my most embarrassing and worst period.

533
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,360
That's right.

534
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:45,100
I feel at ease and relaxed when I'm with him.

535
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,060
On the contrary, when I meet Brother Shuyu, I always act clumsily.

536
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,479
Actually, I should have let it be

537
00:40:51,479 --> 00:40:53,659
and make him let go of his guilt earlier.

538
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:58,780
Everyone should enjoy their most relaxing moment.

539
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:02,620
Facing your true feelings, so that one can get happiness.

540
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:07,459
By the way, I have to sleep early today.

541
00:41:07,459 --> 00:41:10,140
I need to go to the farm with Hao Du tomorrow.

542
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,320
You start dating so quickly.

543
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:14,900
Come on, this is...

544
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,160
my concern for our country.

545
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,500
<i>You want us to sign the letter of alliance now?</i>

546
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,000
<i>How could it be possible?</i>

547
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,839
Why is it so noisy so late at night?

548
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,400
<i>There must be some consequences if the Ashile Tribe is offended.</i>

549
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,480
Letter of alliance?

550
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,559
<i>- So that means we came for nothing?
- That's right.</i>

551
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,539
<i>We can't sign. It's quite a dilemma.</i>

552
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:37,399
<i>Right, we can't sign it.</i>

553
00:41:37,399 --> 00:41:40,799
The guys from Tiele Tribe, why do you fear the Ashile Tribe so much?

554
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,659
Monan and Mobei proposed to unite because you need more courage from us.

555
00:41:45,659 --> 00:41:47,439
Great Tang has just won the race,

556
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:49,999
now its emperor is forcing us to sign a letter of alliance?

557
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:53,339
Obviously, they want us to make a choice in front of the people from the Ashile Tribe.

558
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:56,679
Doing it like this, won't Great Tang become the next Ashile Tribe to us?

559
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:58,180
You...

560
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,439
He's misinterpreting.

561
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,540
Enough, stop.

562
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,700
Don't stop me.

563
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,500
Changge.

564
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:12,359
Everybody, the Emperor of Tang means that once Tang is by your side,

565
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:14,580
you don't need to be afraid of the Ashile Tribe.

566
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:17,439
Certainly, the alliance was proposed by Mobei.

567
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,639
If Great Tang really becomes the same as the Ashile Tribe,

568
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,860
our people from Mobei will be the first to protest.

569
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,219
Right. It's your people from Mobei who proposed the alliance,

570
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:26,019
so the Tiele Tribe wouldn't deny it.

571
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:30,679
What's more, listen! We'll never put the signature and stamp of our Teile Tribe on the letter.

572
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:34,600
Gentlemen, think about it. If we stamp on the letter of alliance,

573
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,860
that means we become the public enemy of the Ashile Tribe.

574
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:42,560
We can't offend the Ashile Tribe.

575
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,419
<i>That's right.</i>

576
00:42:44,419 --> 00:42:46,419
What's the matter of becoming their enemy openly?

577
00:42:46,419 --> 00:42:48,719
Our Great Tang will try its best to protect each tribe of our ally.

578
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:50,979
Even though Ashile Tribe wants to do harm to anyone,

579
00:42:50,979 --> 00:42:54,180
they have to think twice, don't they?

580
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:56,780
<i>- Yes.
- That's right.</i>

581
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,280
<i>But...</i>

582
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,339
But the Ashile Tribe is so powerful.

583
00:43:00,339 --> 00:43:03,319
If the princess from Mobei wants to ally with Great Tang, I can't stop you.

584
00:43:03,319 --> 00:43:06,960
However, don't push our people from Tiele Tribe.

585
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,320
Let's go!

586
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,940
Well...

587
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,060
<i>They just left like this?</i>

588
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,200
