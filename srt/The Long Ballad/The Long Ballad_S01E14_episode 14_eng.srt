1
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,949
♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:06,949 --> 00:00:09,909
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:14,580
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,819
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:24,400
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,769
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

7
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,739
♫   Tears and regrets go hand in hand   ♫

8
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:34,739
♫  But my heart is still fiery-hot  ♫

9
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:37,689
♫  To the distance  ♫

10
00:00:37,689 --> 00:00:40,759
♫  The miserable past is like a dagger  ♫

11
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:43,569
♫  Though my wings are broken  ♫

12
00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:50,090
♫  I will keep flying  ♫

13
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:56,249
♫  Following the direction of the light  ♫

14
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,309
♫  I'll forget you  ♫

15
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:04,209
♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

16
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,309
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

17
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:10,359
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

18
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,319
♫  The river of life is under my feet  ♫

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,210
♫  I don't regret my craziness  ♫

20
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:32,650
   

21
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:36,210
   

22
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,569
Assemble Bear Division now!

23
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:40,769
Quickly!

24
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,089
But Mu Jin found me.

25
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,890
This is from him.

26
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:48,469
- You can leave. 
 - Yes.

27
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,390
   

28
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:59,228
How dare he commands me by the order of Great Khan!

29
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:02,670
But, General, if it was really from Great Khan,

30
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:05,889
our dispatch would mess up Great Khan's plan.

31
00:02:05,889 --> 00:02:08,588
- I'm afraid of... 
 - Of what?

32
00:02:08,588 --> 00:02:12,488
If you don't march now, we will be despised by the Eagle Division forever!

33
00:02:12,488 --> 00:02:15,650
Dispatch now! Assemble Bear Division!

34
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:31,608
General.

35
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,049
What are you laughing at?

36
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,628
Are you done with your life?

37
00:02:34,628 --> 00:02:39,570
I'm laughing that the famous general of the Bear Division is actually a coward!

38
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,809
- Really? 
 - General! You are strangling him to death!

39
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:44,829
Yes, I am!

40
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:47,490
Calm down, General!

41
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,528
If you kill me,

42
00:02:53,529 --> 00:02:56,289
then you will lose the last chance to defeat the Eagle Division.

43
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,808
You'd better understand the situation.

44
00:02:57,809 --> 00:02:59,608
If you want to say anything, say it now.

45
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:01,228
Don't waste the general's time!

46
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:04,449
Commandant Li, the defender, is my brother.

47
00:03:04,449 --> 00:03:07,750
I'm the best chip for you to negotiate with him.

48
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,289
How much are you worth?

49
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,030
At least I am worth half of Shuo State in my brother's eyes.

50
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:22,469
Are you telling me the truth?

51
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:26,570
If I'm not, you can kill me at any time you want.

52
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,088
Didn't we arrange to meet under the city?

53
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:39,269
I just received the message.

54
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:42,508
Tu Kashe and Ibukan were heading to Shuo State with a man from the central plains.

55
00:03:42,508 --> 00:03:43,708
We have to be quick.

56
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:45,408
We have to arrive before they take reckless moves.

57
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:47,248
Or all our plans would be destroyed.

58
00:03:47,249 --> 00:03:49,009
Get the general gear!

59
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,410
 Yes! 

60
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:59,529
Commandant Li, the Bear Division has arrived.

61
00:03:59,529 --> 00:04:01,049
How dare they come again?

62
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,968
Just a few of them.

63
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:04,630
But strangely, a man from central plains is with them.

64
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,550
   

65
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,520
   

66
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,400
   

67
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,750
Li!

68
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:57,610
Look who he is.

69
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,469
- A'Dou! 
 - A'Dou...

70
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:36,229
Speak!  Ask them to open the gate!

71
00:05:42,849 --> 00:05:44,730
Speak!

72
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,129
Ask them to open the gate!

73
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:54,608
Speak!

74
00:05:54,609 --> 00:05:56,970
Ask them to open the gate!

75
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:03,209
If you beat him once again, I'll smash your bones!

76
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:06,029
Commandant Li!

77
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:09,348
As long as you open your gate and come to negotiate with us,

78
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:11,150
I will let go of him.

79
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,809
Or else, I will beat him to death in front of you.

80
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:39,069
- Commandant Li! Commandant Li! 
 - Let go of me! Let go!

81
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:40,728
They are too close to our gate!

82
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:42,869
Even if we just open a little, they can rush in immediately!

83
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:44,369
The consequence is horrible!

84
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,349
Yes! Commandant Li!

85
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:10,969
You are such a beast!

86
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,229
You even beat a child!

87
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,010
   

88
00:07:36,869 --> 00:07:42,170
I will be a general!

89
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,610
A'Dou! No!

90
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,448
Wait! I'm saving you now!

91
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:51,249
Commandant Li!

92
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:52,469
- No! 
 - Get your hands off me!

93
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:54,008
- You can't! 
 - Commandant!

94
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:55,149
- Commandant Li! 
 - Let go!

95
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:58,810
You can't put the whole Shuo State in danger just for him!

96
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,440
   

97
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,710
   

98
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:20,489
I will be a general!

99
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:23,429
A'Dou is saying something?

100
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,680
I will be...

101
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,240
will be a general!

102
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:40,789
A'Dou knelt down not to ask us to save him,

103
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,610
he is saying...

104
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,600
♫   Gone away, scatter away   ♫

105
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,350
♫   Like the sand falling between fingers   ♫

106
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:16,910
♫   Holding on tight to this split second   ♫

107
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:20,625
♫   Already lost   ♫

108
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,610
Don't be silly! A'Dou!

109
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,199
♫   Forget it, forget it   ♫

110
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:36,550
♫   I'm the only one left   ♫

111
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,309
Don't be silly, A'Dou!

112
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:42,649
Stand up! You stand up!

113
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:45,070
Stand up, A'Dou!

114
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,909
Master.

115
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:50,728
Finally, I... I can be a general!

116
00:10:50,729 --> 00:10:53,969
I finally became your subordinate!

117
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:57,049
A'Dou! You will be a general when you grow up.

118
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:58,689
I will take you away from here.

119
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:01,249
You can't die here, A'Dou!

120
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,069
I will take you away from here!

121
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,170
Master...

122
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:11,229
I can do it.

123
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:13,088
I can!

124
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:13,909
No, you can't!

125
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:15,589
A'Dou! No!

126
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:19,990
A'Dou! Stand up!

127
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:26,610
Dai State is lost! No reinforcements!

128
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,270
Liar!

129
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,750
I will kill you!

130
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,269
A'Dou! 
    

131
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,129
He said no reinforcements!

132
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,509
Who are they?

133
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:17,129
They are from the Ashile Tribe who are in the disguise of reinforcements.

134
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,969
Use semaphore, 10,000 soldiers.

135
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:27,149
These people from the Ashile Tribe cannot approach Shuo State!

136
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:28,929
- Commandant Li! 
 -  Commandant Li!

137
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:32,929
Use semaphore! Quickly! Be quick!

138
00:12:32,929 --> 00:12:35,169
Reinforce Commandant Li!

139
00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:36,930
Hurry up!

140
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,028
General! Ashile Sun's plan has been ruined by that boy.

141
00:12:41,028 --> 00:12:42,009
What can we do?

142
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:43,929
Why not take the lead?

143
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:46,329
The best hostage was killed by you.

144
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,129
What a good plan!

145
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,548
Take the lead? With such a few soldiers?

146
00:12:50,548 --> 00:12:51,728
Retreat first.

147
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,969
Wait until they arrive.

148
00:12:53,969 --> 00:12:54,968
Yes.

149
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:56,369
Retreat!

150
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,850
Stop!

151
00:13:20,869 --> 00:13:24,050
 Kill them! 

152
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,529
Bear Division! Retreat!

153
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:51,009
 Retreat! Retreat! 

154
00:14:55,209 --> 00:14:56,768
Tu Kashe is such a bastard!

155
00:14:56,768 --> 00:14:58,989
He escaped!

156
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:32,889
Sun, they are giving no thought to death now!

157
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,370
This is bad for us.

158
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,868
This is for A'Dou.

159
00:15:48,868 --> 00:15:51,230
Don't... Don't kill me.

160
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:56,869
This is for the people of Shuo State.

161
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,208
The oppressed will rise to win.

162
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:11,790
Tu Kashe made us lose our chance.

163
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,449
Let's go.

164
00:16:31,969 --> 00:16:33,569
Go!

165
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:47,229
The last strike is for my dead men!

166
00:16:47,229 --> 00:16:49,030
None of my business.

167
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,429
No, don't kill me.

168
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,310
   

169
00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,290
   

170
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:35,289
 Although I have no idea who you are, you are not an ordinary man. 

171
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:36,908
 I live a poor life and no one cares about me. 

172
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:40,109
 I'm afraid that no one will care when I die. 

173
00:18:40,109 --> 00:18:45,069
 If I can fight with Master, it's worth even if I die. 

174
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:50,949
 Master, you are my future. 

175
00:18:50,949 --> 00:18:53,710
 I will be with you no matter life or death. 

176
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:59,369
 Since you take me as your master, we have to obey the ritual. 

177
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:02,029
 From now on, you are my apprentice. 

178
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:05,510
 We will never betray each other. 

179
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:17,189
 After I make contributions, you will call me General Dou! 

180
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:27,210
 I will be a general! 

181
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,290
   

182
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,690
Congratulations on General Dou's triumph!

183
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,010
 - Congratulations on General Dou's triumph! 
 - Congratulations on General Dou's triumph! 

184
00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:11,890
 Congratulations on General Dou's triumph! 

185
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,250
   

186
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,910
   

187
00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:00,209
Hand this letter to Ashile Sun.

188
00:21:00,209 --> 00:21:01,169
   

189
00:21:01,169 --> 00:21:03,328
Master, we are fighting with each other now.

190
00:21:03,328 --> 00:21:05,648
Ashile Sun is their general.

191
00:21:05,649 --> 00:21:08,129
Why would you write this?

192
00:21:08,129 --> 00:21:09,710
What?

193
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:13,149
Are you afraid of me colluding with the enemy?

194
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:15,069
I don't dare.

195
00:21:16,249 --> 00:21:18,530
Just kidding.

196
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,768
You have been with me for so many years.

197
00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:23,349
Have I ever done anything with no assurance?

198
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:25,368
I have thought about all the possible consequences.

199
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:27,510
Everything is under control.

200
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:33,730
Just hand him this letter.

201
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,169
Yes.

202
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,470
Governor.

203
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:43,830
Governor, I have a plan.

204
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,769
Go ahead.

205
00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:47,488
Governor, it becomes cooler and windy in September.

206
00:21:47,489 --> 00:21:49,008
We can pretend to retreat,

207
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:51,089
and let Eagle Division take charge of Shuo State.

208
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,148
And set dried firewood in town.

209
00:21:53,148 --> 00:21:55,929
As soon as Ashile Sun's division comes, we set it on fire.

210
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:59,110
Take advantage of the north wind, they would be burned to nothing.

211
00:22:04,369 --> 00:22:07,128
If their division keeps encircling the town,

212
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:11,009
the food left in town can only supply for three days.

213
00:22:11,009 --> 00:22:14,849
According to your plan, jade and stone will be burned together.

214
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:18,770
All the people in Shuo State would become refugees.

215
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:27,270
Commandant Li, you think the latter is worthy in this dilemma?

216
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:29,350
I...

217
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:43,120
So, in your opinion,

218
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:48,080
why do I want to defend Shuo State?

219
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,929
What I'm defending is not just a fortress,

220
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:56,689
but the people here and their good life.

221
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:03,110
If not, I wouldn't have surrendered to Tang

222
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,630
right after Li Yuan's revolt.

223
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,329
Now I think,

224
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:13,089
battle or surrender, just strategies.

225
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:15,809
People live a stable life without suffering from battles.

226
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:18,149
That's the most important.

227
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:25,030
This is what I have stuck to.

228
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:31,850
Governor, are you thinking of surrendering to the Ashile Tribe?

229
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,250
Did A'Dou and those dead soldiers die in vain?

230
00:23:42,609 --> 00:23:46,350
Commandant Li, calm down.

231
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:50,289
It's just an analogy.

232
00:23:52,009 --> 00:23:54,130
It's my fault.

233
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,089
Fine, Commandant Li.

234
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,769
It's late now.

235
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:01,669
As for the strategy, I already have made a plan.

236
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:04,829
We can discuss it tomorrow.

237
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,090
Yes.

238
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:56,269
You dare to come yourself.

239
00:24:56,269 --> 00:24:58,490
I admire your courage.

240
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:01,809
I'm very pleased to meet you, governor of Shuo State, Gongsun Heng.

241
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:03,590
Since you invited me here,

242
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,689
you wouldn't set any traps.

243
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:11,229
Besides, you are the same.

244
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:15,609
What are you going to discuss with me?

245
00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:17,510
Just go ahead.

246
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:20,169
If you take charge of Shuo State,

247
00:25:20,169 --> 00:25:25,129
would you guarantee never harming the people here?

248
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:37,170
If I take advantage of the north wind to burn the city,

249
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:42,249
though I won't expect Eagle Division to die with me,

250
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:46,768
all you get would be ashes of Shuo State at that time.

251
00:25:46,769 --> 00:25:51,669
I think General won't be satisfied with this result, right?

252
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:56,790
If you wanted to do that, you wouldn't have waited till today.

253
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:59,369
Nor would you threaten me like this.

254
00:25:59,369 --> 00:26:01,369
This is not a threat.

255
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:05,650
It's just a request.

256
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:10,750
I'm really curious as to why you would ask me this.

257
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:13,648
We have been in battles for so long,

258
00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:15,809
the casualties of Shou State army are heavy.

259
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:20,730
Am I a softhearted man in your eyes?

260
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:25,309
When you Eagle Division burned the granary,

261
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:28,630
you could have burned the surrounding houses together.

262
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,230
I could only save people first.

263
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,989
But you didn't do that.

264
00:26:34,989 --> 00:26:36,889
You spared their lives,

265
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:40,569
and informed me so that I could come in time.

266
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:44,650
That meant you didn't want to kill innocent people.

267
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:49,469
These years, you led the Eagle Division fighting on many battlefields.

268
00:26:49,469 --> 00:26:53,670
I have already heard about some of your styles.

269
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:58,830
I believe that you have the ability

270
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:02,309
and the aspiration to save their lives.

271
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,410
But...

272
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:12,969
these years I have fought with the Ashile Tribe so many times.

273
00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:17,850
The Ashile Tribe hates me and Shuo State so much.

274
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:21,890
Now, since I am going to give Shuo State to you,

275
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,229
then I have to be sincere.

276
00:27:27,069 --> 00:27:31,650
I will give you a gift which will satisfy

277
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:36,010
all the soldiers of the Ashile Tribe.

278
00:27:38,409 --> 00:27:41,869
I won't make you embarrassed, General.

279
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,109
Are you sure?

280
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,748
You burned yourself out. Is it worthy?

281
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:51,690
You can't go back on your promise.

282
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,129
Just a gift.

283
00:27:56,129 --> 00:27:59,410
Comparing to the safety of people in Shuo State,

284
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,010
it's nothing.

285
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:07,669
I... have no regrets.

286
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:19,829
I finally know how you got the name Tribune Gongsun Heng.

287
00:28:20,489 --> 00:28:22,450
No worries, Governor.

288
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,769
I promise what you asked for.

289
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:28,409
I won't go back on my words.

290
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:29,888
Okay.

291
00:28:29,889 --> 00:28:35,989
Then I will say thank you for all my people in Shuo State here.

292
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:51,500
   

293
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:58,009
These days we are in so many battles, we have defended for so many days.

294
00:28:58,009 --> 00:28:59,729
It's been hard for everyone.

295
00:28:59,729 --> 00:29:01,248
It's not that serious, Governor.

296
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:04,470
You've done your best for the people here, It's much harder for you.

297
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,630
Yes. Master is like our backbone.

298
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,989
As long as Master is here,

299
00:29:08,989 --> 00:29:11,409
people of Shuo State won't be afraid of the enemy.

300
00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:13,270
They will unite together to defend the city.

301
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:17,368
This time we lost too much.

302
00:29:17,369 --> 00:29:19,008
For all the casualties,

303
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:21,008
we have to do well in comfort and compensation.

304
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,828
As soon as we get our chance, we have to send someone to Chang'an

305
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:27,409
to report our situation and ask for support.

306
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:30,849
These years, Shuo State's harvest hasn't been good enough.

307
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:34,889
Now our granary has been burned and the fields have been damaged,

308
00:29:34,889 --> 00:29:37,168
one disaster after another.

309
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:39,769
How can we get through this spring festival?

310
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:42,589
What about the livelihood next year?

311
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:47,449
You have to consider these things carefully.

312
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:56,529
There is still a long way for us to go.

313
00:29:56,529 --> 00:30:02,270
Here, I would like to say thank you on behalf of the army and the people in Shuo State.

314
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,449
It's not that serious, Governor.

315
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:06,868
These are our duties. No need to say thanks.

316
00:30:06,868 --> 00:30:11,389
This is on behalf of the army and the people,

317
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:14,189
to express their gratitude for your deep affection.

318
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:16,849
Commandant Li,

319
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:20,248
it's hard to turn down the warm-hearted offer of the governor.

320
00:30:20,249 --> 00:30:24,229
Drink it.

321
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:31,469
Cheers.

322
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:40,729
It's Millet Wine made by Madam.

323
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:42,408
It's so sweet and mellow!

324
00:30:42,409 --> 00:30:43,528
It's hard for you to have rest.

325
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:45,669
Drink more if you like.

326
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:49,150
Today is our family feast. Make yourself at home.

327
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,769
Yuan'er, be good.

328
00:30:51,889 --> 00:30:53,248
Put that wooden sword down.

329
00:30:53,249 --> 00:30:55,068
You can play after lunch.

330
00:30:55,068 --> 00:30:56,609
Okay.

331
00:30:57,409 --> 00:30:59,648
Yuan'er just got this wooden sword today.

332
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,089
She refuses to put it down.

333
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:02,488
I asked her why.

334
00:31:02,489 --> 00:31:06,368
She said that she wants to be like Brother Li, Brother Dou, and her father,

335
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:08,849
to defend people and help the weak.

336
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,248
Then Yuan'er has to grow up faster.

337
00:31:11,249 --> 00:31:15,309
As soon as you grow up, you can punish the evils with your Brother Li.

338
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,308
That would be so good!

339
00:31:18,308 --> 00:31:21,630
Yuan'er, say thanks to Brother Li.

340
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:26,830
If Yuan'er really likes this, practice some martial arts.

341
00:31:27,369 --> 00:31:31,230
If one day Father cannot be with you,

342
00:31:31,909 --> 00:31:35,629
you can protect yourself, and won't be bullied by bad people.

343
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:38,449
Why can't Father be with me?

344
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,429
Silly girl.

345
00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:49,288
You won't get married in this life?

346
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:53,029
Do you want to stay with me, and be an old maid?

347
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:58,350
Madam, a toast to you too.

348
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:04,169
These years, I've focused on my job.

349
00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:09,969
Thanks for your hard work at home, taking care of the wounded,

350
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,409
and all the rear services,

351
00:32:12,409 --> 00:32:15,008
as well as comforting bereaved families.

352
00:32:15,009 --> 00:32:17,470
You've been working hard.

353
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:21,320
Even our Yuan'er,

354
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,860
has been looked after and educated by you.

355
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:30,070
I really don't know

356
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,950
how to pay back for all this you have done for me.

357
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:44,630
We have the same goal, we share the same feeling.

358
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:47,630
No need to say thanks.

359
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,849
You have your way

360
00:32:50,849 --> 00:32:53,229
and that would be my choice, too.

361
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:58,888
I said you could do anything you wanted.

362
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:02,089
Although I am just a woman at home,

363
00:33:02,089 --> 00:33:05,309
but I will keep my pace with you

364
00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:09,410
and walk on the same road with you.

365
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:31,029
Madam, you have to take care of yourself.

366
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:34,450
Now autumn comes,

367
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,970
take good care of yourself.

368
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,370
Or when it comes to winter,

369
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:43,669
your hands and feet will be cold again,

370
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,229
and you will also suffer from insomnia.

371
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,770
Don't worry about me.

372
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:13,729
Winter is hard, but spring will come.

373
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:37,890
The spring will come.

374
00:34:43,689 --> 00:34:45,389
Come on.

375
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,310
Let's drink.

376
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:50,530
This one is for Shuo State.

377
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:53,069
Wish our Shuo State good weather and harvest

378
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:58,130
just like before after this war.

379
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,890
We have you, so we will.

380
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,050
Come on.

381
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:24,630
   

382
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:29,129
Governor, you asked me to stay behind.

383
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,450
Anything else for me?

384
00:35:35,629 --> 00:35:38,970
Commandant Li, please sit down.

385
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,250
Please.

386
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:55,750
This is the defense map of Shuo State.

387
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,600
All the inventory material,

388
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,550
grain depots, and treasury are indicated here.

389
00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:07,510
And this token...

390
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:11,950
You can deploy all the defenders of Shuo State with this,

391
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:14,950
as well as all the people in my mansion.

392
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,250
Why are you handing me these?

393
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,489
Defenders of Shuo State can only be deployed by you.

394
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:23,370
Why are you handing me this token?

395
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:26,690
Defenders of Shuo State only listen to the governor,

396
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:31,610
that is because I am here.

397
00:36:32,389 --> 00:36:36,089
Governor, what do you mean?

398
00:36:36,969 --> 00:36:41,669
I have determined to surrender tomorrow.

399
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:46,900
Ashile Sun also promised me

400
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,770
that he would keep my people safe.

401
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,470
The cost...

402
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:55,229
What's the cost?

403
00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:58,030
Cost...

404
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:02,529
The cost is my head.

405
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:09,710
Governor!

406
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,310
Please give me some more time.

407
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,830
I can come up with a perfect plan!

408
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:16,568
- This is already a perfect plan. 
 - Governor!

409
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:21,150
For these years, Ashile Tribe never occupied Shuo State once.

410
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:25,610
So to the defenders of Shuo State, as long as I am here,

411
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,729
they will never surrender even if they have only one left.

412
00:37:30,349 --> 00:37:34,730
But to Ashile Tribe, I have defended the border for so many years,

413
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:37,470
their Great Khan has been defeated by me many times.

414
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:40,189
He has hated my guts.

415
00:37:40,189 --> 00:37:42,930
Now only by giving him my head,

416
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,489
can I eliminate his doubt and piled-up grievances.

417
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:51,130
And only in this way,

418
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:55,070
can I get the people's lives back.

419
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,510
No! I don't agree.

420
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,769
We must have other choices.

421
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:09,530
If I can hand over the people's lives

422
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:13,220
to the princess of Great Tang,

423
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,420
that will be my best end.

424
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,829
Princess Yongning is clever and smart,

425
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:22,790
you have many things to do next,

426
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:25,229
and still have a long way to go.

427
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,109
You can't die now.

428
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:31,089
You know who I am, Governor?

429
00:38:32,249 --> 00:38:36,089
The guy who chased you called you Princess Yongning.

430
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:40,009
 Princess Yongning, any last words? 

431
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:44,149
I fought with him before.

432
00:38:44,149 --> 00:38:46,570
From his martial arts skill,

433
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:50,560
I knew he must be a guard from the court.

434
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,248
He traveled so far to Shuo State just to kill you.

435
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:58,249
But he had no official document for arrest.

436
00:38:58,249 --> 00:39:02,048
Apart from the former crown prince's subordinate, who else would you be?

437
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:06,380
Actually, to me,

438
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:10,850
it's not important who you are.

439
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,850
For the first time when we met,

440
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,510
you saved my wife and Yuan'er with a trick,

441
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:21,910
I knew that you were not an ordinary person.

442
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:26,049
No matter what you wanted from me in the beginning,

443
00:39:26,049 --> 00:39:29,470
I was sure that you meant no harm

444
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,700
to me and Shuo State.

445
00:39:33,429 --> 00:39:37,629
So I would like to keep you beside me.

446
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:42,009
But...

447
00:39:42,689 --> 00:39:48,610
I can't wait till the day you achieve your goal.

448
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:55,589
Governor, my name is Li Changge.

449
00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:57,790
I'm the daughter of Crown Prince Li Jiancheng.

450
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:00,730
I have not been Princess Yongning since a long time ago.

451
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:04,890
Now I just want to fight by your side.

452
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,569
Please recall your order!

453
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,190
Changge will spare no effort to defend Shuo State!

454
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:14,688
Princess! Princess! No.

455
00:40:14,688 --> 00:40:16,610
Princess!

456
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,529
I've been loyal for my whole life.

457
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:20,410
At this moment,

458
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,889
I can't arrogate.

459
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:27,049
It's me who should kneel down now.

460
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:31,380
Princess, you have such a deep affection

461
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,990
towards the people in Shuo State,

462
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,930
please receive my bow.

463
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:39,089
Governor! Please stand up, Governor.

464
00:40:39,089 --> 00:40:41,070
How can I receive this?

465
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:43,009
Stand up please.

466
00:40:43,009 --> 00:40:44,609
Please.

467
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,809
Princess,

468
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:51,250
I still have something to ask for your help with.

469
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:56,229
Till now, only this issue worries me.

470
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:02,669
My Yuan'er is still a little girl.

471
00:41:04,189 --> 00:41:05,789
I know...

472
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:08,310
After I die,

473
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:11,709
my wife will not marry others.

474
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:18,768
So, Princess, please,

475
00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:21,400
try your best

476
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,270
to take care of them.

477
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:34,569
I will say thanks for them here.

478
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:41,609
Governor, you should watch Yuan'er growing up.

479
00:41:41,609 --> 00:41:43,370
Governor!

480
00:41:44,349 --> 00:41:46,729
Recall your order!

481
00:41:46,729 --> 00:41:49,590
Recall your order! Governor!

482
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:55,110
I will bless them to be safe and sound from Heaven.

483
00:41:56,610 --> 00:42:00,689
Elder Qi, take Princess down to get some rest.

484
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,069
Governor! Governor!

485
00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:05,990
Governor!

486
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:16,930

♫  the yearning flowing through thoughts  ♫

497
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:57,919
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

498
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,719
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

499
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:07,159
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

500
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:13,780
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

501
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:16,070
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

502
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,450
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

503
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:23,020
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

504
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,879
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

505
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,720
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

506
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:34,190
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

507
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,100
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

508
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:47,829
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

509
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:51,340
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

510
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:57,850
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

511
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:00,210
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

512
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:02,580
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

513
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:07,159
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

514
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,930
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

515
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:11,930
♫  It turns into eternity  ♫

516
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:18,440
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

517
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,710
♫  It is sleepless  ♫

518
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:40,740
