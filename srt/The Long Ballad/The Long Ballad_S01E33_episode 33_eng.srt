00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,899
♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,859
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:15,030
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,769
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:24,950
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,819
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

7
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:31,589
♫   Tears and regrets go hand in hand   ♫

8
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:34,689
♫  But my heart is still fiery-hot  ♫

00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:37,639
♫  To the distance  ♫

10
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:40,609
♫  The miserable past is like a dagger  ♫

11
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:43,619
♫  Though my wings are broken  ♫

12
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:51,040
♫  I will keep flying  ♫

♫  Following the direction of the light  ♫

14

♫  I'll forget you  ♫

15

♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,259
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

17
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:10,209
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

18
00:01:10,209 --> 00:01:12,269
♫  The river of life is under my feet  ♫

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,010
♫  I don't regret my craziness  ♫

20
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:25,930


21
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:32,590
    

22
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:36,260
    

23
00:01:37,179 --> 00:01:38,679
Can you still move?

24
00:01:38,679 --> 00:01:40,400
Yes.

25
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,200
   

26
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,999
   

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,118
Minister Du, the archers are all here waiting for your order.

28
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,899
As for that, I can do it.

29
00:02:20,899 --> 00:02:22,576
   

30
00:02:24,939 --> 00:02:26,159
Li Yaoshi?

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,579
We're specialized in different aspects.

32
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:32,498
Minister Du, about what you're not good at, please let me do it.

33
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,499
Why are you staring at me, Minister Du?

34
00:02:38,499 --> 00:02:40,379
I've been at your place many times asking for your help,

35
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:42,979
but even I couldn't meet you.

36
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:47,019
However, what happened in Liuyun Taoist Temple could bring you here.

37
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:50,219
I found a good apprentice, but I haven't got a chance to teach him.

38
00:02:50,219 --> 00:02:53,379
If he dies there, that would be a huge loss to me.

39
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,980
Today, you two can die together with me.

40
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,758
That's worthwhile to me.

41
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,970
Ashile Sun, how dare you betray Khan and secretly help her?

42
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,820
Big circle defeats the small one.

43
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,720
It's him.

44
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,320
Who?

45
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,180
Everyone listen!

46
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,999
The 3rd, 6th and 7th soldiers in row 3 step forward!

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,703
The 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th soldiers in row 4 step backward!

48
00:03:35,704 --> 00:03:37,404
Draw the bow!

49
00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:41,799
Changge, let me take care of everything.

50
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:43,700
Trust me.

51
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,539
Drop!

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,260
Everyone returns to place!

53
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,899
The 3rd and 4th in row 1 step forward!

54
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:06,900
The 4th and 5th in row 4 and 5 step backward!

55
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,479
The tortoise doesn't show its head!

56
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,559
Drop!

57
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Don't let her get away.

58
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:50,299
Ashile Sun, don't you think you let down Great Khan who brought you up for so many years?

59
00:04:50,299 --> 00:04:52,240
No, he didn't let Khan down.

60
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,820
He's also helping the Ashile Tribe.

61
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:58,271
It's not easy to ease the tension between Tang and the Ashile Tribe.

62
00:04:58,271 --> 00:05:00,659
But you're stirring it up again.

63
00:05:00,659 --> 00:05:04,240
Do you really think the lives of soldiers on both sides are nothing?

64
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,160
The achievement of a general cost many lives.

65
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,420
I'm doing a great thing. I can't care about all the minor details.

66
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,739
If you move aside now,

67
00:05:14,739 --> 00:05:18,379
I can still hide it from Great Khan for you.

68
00:05:18,379 --> 00:05:23,459
Otherwise, your Eagle Division and you will definitely get punished by Heaven.

69
00:05:23,464 --> 00:05:25,264
Shut up!

70
00:05:26,739 --> 00:05:28,839
Ashile Sun,

71
00:05:30,179 --> 00:05:33,560
are you really gonna help Du Ruhui's side?

72
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,779
Are you really going to betray the Ashile Tribe?

73
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:39,499
Stop talking nonsense.

74
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:42,920
I'm only saving the person I care about.

75
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:46,160
I didn't betray the Ashile Tribe.

76
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,520
Contrarily, looking at what you did,

77
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,199
you're trying to get the Ashile Tribe and Great Tang in a war.

78
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,719
And that is putting our tribe in misery.

79
00:05:55,719 --> 00:06:00,479
Do you think you can hide what you did from Great Khan?

80
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:13,879
Ashile Sun, Great Tang's soldiers won't let you go.

81
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,600
Guards! Take her away.

82
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,240
 Yes, Sir! 

83
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,540
We haven't done a head count.

84
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:20,339
No need to be scared now, Princess.

85
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:24,519
Where's he?

86
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,698
Who?

87
00:07:25,698 --> 00:07:27,899
The one who cooperated with me, of course.

88
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:31,059
It was me that cooperated with you just now.

89
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:34,559
Well. Do you not believe it?

90
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:37,320
Do you two know each other?

91
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,798
We've mentally known each other for a long time.

92
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:40,959
Right, Brother Li?

93
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:43,999
Yes. We've mentally known each other for a long time.

94
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,778
About such a kind of fate, you wouldn't understand, Minister Du.

95
00:07:51,239 --> 00:07:53,439
Commander Hao, we didn't find them.

96
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,459
Father, there's no one in the backyard.

97
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,199
It's always been only Master and me here.

98
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,119
Who are you looking for, Minister Du?

99
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,580
Never mind.

100
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:27,659
I'm sorry for what I did before.

101
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:30,620
Please forgive me, Master.

102
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,879
To save you, she almost died.

103
00:08:33,879 --> 00:08:37,380
You should also take care.

104
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,300
Don't get too obsessed.

105
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,079
Master, you should have a good rest since you're injured.

106
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,558
As for the chores here, I'll send people to handle them.

107
00:08:49,558 --> 00:08:52,500
Thanks for your kindness, Minister Du.

108
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:23,299
Please wait for a second, Minister Du.

109
00:09:24,719 --> 00:09:29,598
Your behavior now is getting more and more confusing.

110
00:09:29,598 --> 00:09:32,320
Who are you exactly looking for?

111
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:35,499
And you just let that person go like that.

112
00:09:35,499 --> 00:09:38,889
I'm working for the imperial court. It has nothing to do with you.

113
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:43,639
However, about your odd behaviors, I can't understand.

114
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:46,339
Fine. I just helped you eliminate the enemies.

115
00:09:46,339 --> 00:09:48,378
And now you're so mean.

116
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:50,798
You're only an ordinary person now.

117
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,470
Surely you're not qualified to question that.

118
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,220
   

119
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,918
Unless you can become an officer again

120
00:09:59,918 --> 00:10:02,380
and work for the imperial court.

121
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,520
You're prodding me again.

122
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,839
Well. It's fine that you don't tell me. I don't really care about it.

123
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:12,259
Anyway, the things about the imperial court

124
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:14,779
are too ambiguous and it's hard to make them clear.

125
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:17,447
You're the one who wanted to catch. And now you just let that person go.

126
00:10:17,447 --> 00:10:18,660
You can't even decide it yourself.

127
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,799
Stop talking nonsense.

128
00:10:21,479 --> 00:10:23,840
How officious you are.

129
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,199
Now what matters more is to find Crown Prince,

130
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,399
and the rest of our enemies here in the city.

131
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,780
They should know where Crown Prince is.

132
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,298
Father, I'll let them lock the city gate and search in the whole city.

133
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:41,399
Wait.

134
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:45,459
Though I'm only an ordinary person, I can't help saying something.

135
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:47,158
You make it so obvious.

136
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:49,759
Don't you worry that you'll wake the sleeping enemies?

137
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,120
What do you mean?

138
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,938
Despair gives courage to a coward.

139
00:10:53,938 --> 00:10:59,159
If they kidnapped Crown Prince, what do you think will happen?

140
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,119
You've created such a disturbance.

141
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:04,200
I think they won't stay here for long.

142
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,358
It won't be wrong that you guard the city gate.

143
00:11:07,359 --> 00:11:08,999
There are so many people.

144
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,980
We can't check them one by one.

145
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,780
What's more, you've seen it.

146
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,158
They are all disguised as ordinary people and refugees.

147
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:18,259
How can you check them?

148
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:25,039
Duke Du, I have an idea free from waking the enemies.

149
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:26,558
Please tell us, Princess.

150
00:11:26,558 --> 00:11:29,539
I can find the spies disguised as refugees.

151
00:11:29,539 --> 00:11:33,699
But... I need your token.

152
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,000
   

153
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,858
 Line up! You all can have it. 

154
00:11:43,858 --> 00:11:46,239
 - Thanks. 
 - Thank you. 

155
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47,358
 Here. 

156
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:49,999
 Thank you. 

157
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:54,079
It's provided by the officials. Those who want to go out, get the porridge before leaving.

158
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,980
 Next one. 

159
00:11:57,819 --> 00:11:59,780
 - Thanks. 
 - Next one. 

160
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,599
 Thanks a lot. 

161
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:05,519
 - Thank you. 
 - Next one. 

162
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,799
 - Thank you. 
 - Thanks. 

163
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:22,359
Wait.

164
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,680
I'm sorry.

165
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,739
 Next. 

166
00:12:35,739 --> 00:12:39,919
Even if Changge is fine, I won't forgive you.

167
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,620
 Line up, please. 

168
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,718
 - Next.  
 - Follow that father.

169
00:12:51,718 --> 00:12:53,260
Yes.

170
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,000
Stop eating.

171
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,859
Since we're out of the city, you're useless.

172
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:23,619
Don't move!

173
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,158
- Take him back. 
 - Yes, Sir!

174
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,580
Move!

175
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,938
- How is it going? 
 - I've arrested him.

176
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:43,218
You're wise, Princess. You figured out such a brilliant idea.

177
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,259
For the people who're really starving,

178
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:57,379
such little dirt means nothing.

179
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,919
Did you get hurt?

180
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:05,680
I'm hungry.

181
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,560
I'll get you some food, all right?

182
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,358
I've sent people guarding around here.

183
00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:13,780
Everything is going well as you planned.

184
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:16,140
It's not safe outside now.

185
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,220
Let me send you home.

186
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:22,539
Since the business has been settled, Commander Hao doesn't need to do so.

187
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:26,319
Go. Let this big brother get some food for you.

188
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,758
- Young Master Wei. 
 - How is it going?

189
00:14:45,758 --> 00:14:48,359
When we counted the dead bodies, it seemed that something went wrong.

190
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:49,959
But it also seemed... nothing went wrong.

191
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,319
Did anything go wrong or not exactly?

192
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,798
I heard that a soldier found a corpse moving.

193
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,558
Then Commander Hao checked on his own.

194
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:59,179
When he went back, he seriously criticized that soldier,

195
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:00,718
saying that he had giddiness.

196
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:03,389
But... it doesn't seem to be something that Commander Hao would do.

197
00:15:03,389 --> 00:15:07,239
In the past, he would have rather wronged a thousand suspects than let one go.

198
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:10,118
Commander Hao did everything carefully. Stop your gossip.

199
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,239
I dare not do that.

200
00:15:12,239 --> 00:15:14,480
Get up.

201
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,658
It's over now. Keep your mouth shut.

202
00:15:16,658 --> 00:15:18,398
- Don't ever mention it again. 
 - Yes.

203
00:15:18,398 --> 00:15:20,300
You can leave now.

204
00:15:26,239 --> 00:15:28,139
 Changge. 

205
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:30,719
 It's good that you can escape safely. 

206
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:34,880
 Your companion is indeed capable. 

207
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,340
Open the door.

208
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,780
Minister Du.

209
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,980
This evil woman...

210
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,000
It's all right.

211
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,760
 Yes. 

212
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,120
It seems that you're in a sentimental mood, Madam.

213
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,479
I wonder if you'd like to talk with me.

214
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:48,299
You know,

215
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:52,919
I was in Luoyang once with my grandfather when I was little.

216
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:56,840
And the peonies here were my favorite.

217
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,400
You can found them easily among various kinds of flowers.

218
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:09,660
At that time, I was thinking that I also wanted to be like a peony.

219
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:15,179
I wanted to be the outstanding one among a group of people.

220
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,019
Your wish has come true.

221
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:27,738
Now everyone in Luoyang knows that an evil woman ruined Liuyun Taoist Temple

222
00:17:27,738 --> 00:17:30,339
and cruelly killed people.

223
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:35,020
Tell me. Who are you?

224
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:38,259
What do you want?

225
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:50,320
I forgot to introduce myself.

226
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,339
I'm from Yang family in Hongnong.

227
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:58,759
Lord Jingwu, Yang Su, is my grandfather.

228
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:01,419
So you're the leftover from the villains of Sui.

229
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:04,020
And you still have evil intentions.

230
00:18:05,979 --> 00:18:11,280
Sui will control the Central Plains again one day.

231
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,358
You Sui are fatuous and cruel. It's already gone.

232
00:18:16,358 --> 00:18:20,559
You can stop working in vain.

233
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,179
Whether it's gone already,

234
00:18:23,179 --> 00:18:25,838
you can wait and see, Minister Du.

235
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,580
You still have other companions?

236
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:34,339
Or... you're just following someone's order?

237
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:39,120
Since it's a game,

238
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,399
it won't be interesting if I tell you.

239
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,159
Your companions in this city have all been eliminated.

240
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,399
You'd better give in.

241
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,579
If you tell us everything, you can make amends for your faults.

242
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:53,560
Then I can still keep you alive.

243
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,000
If I was afraid of death,

244
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,680
I wouldn't have come here.

245
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,620
Good.

246
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,878
Then I'll lock you here and you'll wish you were dead.

247
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,860
   

248
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,680
Don't move.

249
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:03,099
You finally woke up.

250
00:20:03,099 --> 00:20:05,099
How do you feel?

251
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,719
Much better.

252
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:15,699
Where are we?

253
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:17,699
You're in the inn we live in.

254
00:20:17,699 --> 00:20:20,539
Don't worry. It's very safe here.

255
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:24,800
The man who ran after us...

256
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,860
let us go deliberately.

257
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,079
If Commander Hao insisted on arresting me,

258
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:31,980
we couldn't have run away no matter what we did.

259
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,660
Will he continue chasing after you?

260
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:39,379
It doesn't matter.

261
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,179
The medicine is ready.

262
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:45,479
- Taoist Sun gave the prescription. 
 - Take it before it gets cold.

263
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:49,439
Changge is injured, so it might not be convenient.

264
00:20:49,439 --> 00:20:51,100
I can do it.

265
00:20:51,719 --> 00:20:53,839
The medicine was just...

266
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,399
just boiled.

267
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,980
I can take it myself.

268
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,980
Are you all right?

269
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,779
- Are you all right? 
 - Yes, I'm fine.

270
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,198
Let me do it. Just leave us here.

271
00:21:13,198 --> 00:21:15,139
Shiba, you often hurt people unintentionally.

272
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:17,479
Let's leave here. Let him deal with it.

273
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,319
- I can do it myself. 
 - Don't move.

274
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,560
Anything funny?

275
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,290
Drink the medicine.

276
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,460
That's horrible.

277
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:52,399
Little by little, when can I finish it?

278
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:07,920
Slowly. Easy.

279
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,960
So bitter.

280
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,799
Looking at you, it's still not bitter enough.

281
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,059
Your words are not a comfort at all.

282
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,160
What kind of comfort do you want?

283
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,198
Sun, have we forgotten anything?

284
00:22:26,199 --> 00:22:27,999
What's wrong?

285
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,720
- Li Chengqian. 
 - Li Chengqian.

286
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,219
Where my little brother is exactly...

287
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:37,140
That's worrisome.

288
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,139
God bless the good man.

289
00:22:39,139 --> 00:22:41,260
His Highness will be fine.

290
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,719
Princess. Young Master Wei. Someone sent a letter.

291
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:49,619
Give it to me.

292
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,100
   

293
00:22:57,739 --> 00:23:00,980
Tell Minister Du that I took the letter.

294
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:02,580
Yes.

295
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,280
That's Changge's handwriting.

296
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,700
   

297
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,939
Sumo Hall of Eastern Market.

298
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,850
Let's go to find my brother.

299
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,519
Wait.

300
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:21,338
Luoyang is in turmoil now. It might be a trap.

301
00:23:21,338 --> 00:23:23,900
- I can't ignore your safety. 
 - But...

302
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,339
Ask Hao Du to come with us.

303
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,099
When did you begin trusting Hao Du so much?

304
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:33,760
At least you'll be safer.

305
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:39,380
I can yield, but I can't put you in danger.

306
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,020
Brother Shuyu will always protect me.

307
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,720
Hao Du.

308
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,360
There's some news about Crown Prince.

309
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,238
   

310
00:23:53,239 --> 00:23:56,459
Li Changge, how dare she lock me in this kind of place?

311
00:23:56,459 --> 00:23:58,300
Chengqian.

312
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:01,879
Let me check. What happened?

313
00:24:01,879 --> 00:24:04,858
Hao Du! Take people to shut down this place!

314
00:24:04,858 --> 00:24:08,203
And arrest all of them! No one can escape.

315
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:11,079
Chengqian.

316
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:13,839
Are you deaf?

317
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:18,259
Your Highness, since you're fine, let's not attract attention.

318
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:20,259
No way! I have to take revenge.

319
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:23,978
Now! Immediately! Shut it down!

320
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,900
How dare you violate my orders?

321
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:34,699
Sister! They don't listen to my orders. Say something!

322
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:37,059
It's fine, little brother. You're the crown prince.

323
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:39,099
How can you be so unreasonable like a naughty kid?

324
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:40,840
Go home with me.

325
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,978
And that Li Changge. I have to catch her and make her suffer!

326
00:24:44,978 --> 00:24:46,440
You saw Changge?

327
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,719
It was her that locked me here. Where's Du Ruhui?

328
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:52,640
Minister Du is waiting for Your Highness at the state office.

329
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,139
Please go back with Princess at first, Your Highness.

330
00:24:55,139 --> 00:25:00,298
Good. She stopped me from having fun and kept me in such a place.

331
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:04,080
I'll tell Minister Du

332
00:25:05,199 --> 00:25:08,299
and let him arrest the wench Li Changge!

333
00:25:08,959 --> 00:25:10,399
Changge was right.

334
00:25:10,399 --> 00:25:14,100
If it were me, I'd let you stay in a pigsty.

335
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,379
You're still thinking about having fun at a time like this?

336
00:25:16,379 --> 00:25:17,780
No.

337
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,499
It was too boring at night. I wanted to relax outside.

338
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,999
Li Chengqian, you're the crown prince, but you only care about having fun.

339
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:31,479
You put the whole Luoyang in a mess. You...

340
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:33,478
You're completely outrageous.

341
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:36,359
What's more, the one you called a wench?

342
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:37,838
That's your cousin.

343
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:40,258
Sister, you slapped me.

344
00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:42,159
You slapped me for Li Changge!

345
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,338
How can you not cherish your dearest brother?

346
00:25:44,338 --> 00:25:46,019
That hurts, right?

347
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:49,178
You deserve it. I...

348
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,138
- Yueyan. 
 - Li Chengqian

349
00:25:52,138 --> 00:25:53,219
- Yueyan. 
 - Come here.

350
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,419
Why are you hiding? Li Chengqian, come here.

351
00:25:55,419 --> 00:25:56,799
- Li Yueyan! 
 - Come here! 
 - Let him go.

352
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,698
You're been taught bad by Li Changge. I'll tell father about that.

353
00:25:59,698 --> 00:26:02,660
You... come here. Brother Shuyu, don't stop me.

354
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,258
I'll give him a lesson. Come here!

355
00:26:05,258 --> 00:26:07,319
- You've been misled by Li Changge. 
 - Come here.

356
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:09,538
Sister, stop. I'm sorry.

357
00:26:09,538 --> 00:26:11,379
Brother Shuyu, help me.

358
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:14,499
Yueyan, forget about it. Someone is watching.

359
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,419
Li Chengqian, I'm warning you.

360
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:27,539
When you get back, you'd better restrain yourself.

361
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:30,280
If you dare mention Li Changge to anyone,

362
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,500
I'll break your leg.

363
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,759
I won't mention her. I won't. I haven't seen her at all.

364
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:39,078
Brother Shuyu, let's go.

365
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:41,399
But Crown Prince...

366
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:44,698
Hao Du, take Crown Prince home.

367
00:26:44,698 --> 00:26:50,299
Remember this: If he dares say anything, you can beat him to death.

368
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:54,580
   

369
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,159
Help...

370
00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:33,260
Here comes the trade caravan!

371
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,639
Trade caravan.

372
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:36,740
You can't catch me.

373
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,799
You can't catch.

374
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:43,539
Stop running.

375
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:49,359
Mimi.

376
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:56,619
Mimi.

377
00:27:56,619 --> 00:27:58,099
Traveling merchants are here.

378
00:27:58,099 --> 00:28:01,779
They brought lots of goods. Let me take you to have a look.

379
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:07,080
Mimi, it will be late if you don't go there now.

380
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:16,679
Where is she?

381
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:20,379
Never mind. I'll get some unique things for you.

382
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:27,779
Lambs. Hurry. Have your meal.

383
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:29,779
Come out to have your meal. Come here.

384
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:31,599
Come. Come here.

385
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:33,680
Go out. Move.

386
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,599
Let's go.

387
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,279
Come. Move.

388
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,740
Hurry. Let's go.

389
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,618
Little brother. Little brother.

390
00:28:45,618 --> 00:28:48,260
Wake up, little brother.

391
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,340
Sister, help me.

392
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,298
Who are you? Why are you here?

393
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:04,119
Wake up. Where are you from?

394
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,560
It's so hot.

395
00:29:24,219 --> 00:29:25,719
No.

396
00:29:25,719 --> 00:29:28,439
I have to find the doctor to check you.

397
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,500
You're finally awake.

398
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,620
Master asked me to remind you.

399
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,520
What are you saying?

400
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:49,000
She told you not to forget your task.

401
00:29:57,719 --> 00:30:01,419
Who are you? Who sent you here?

402
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:03,019
Why are you here?

403
00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:10,479
Master ordered you to keep me here.

404
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:11,939
No way.

405
00:30:11,939 --> 00:30:13,618
I have to send you out. Let's get out.

406
00:30:13,618 --> 00:30:16,520
Sister, please help me.

407
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,019
 Sister. 

408
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:23,599
 Please help me. 

409
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:25,939
Sister.

410
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,140
Otherwise, Master will kill me.

411
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:31,560
You...

412
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:35,300
Master said that if you don't behave well,

413
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:38,780
you should know the consequence.

414
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:44,019
 Mimi, are you there? 

415
00:30:44,019 --> 00:30:45,940
Mimi.

416
00:30:51,459 --> 00:30:53,700
I'll come in.

417
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,479
It's early in the morning. Why are you yelling?

418
00:30:58,479 --> 00:31:00,618
Traveling merchants were here.

419
00:31:00,618 --> 00:31:03,478
I wanted to take you to pick some good things, but you were not here.

420
00:31:03,478 --> 00:31:05,280
So I went there myself.

421
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,180
Every morning, I feed the lambs.

422
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,839
So you went feeding the lambs.

423
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:12,899
I have some good stuff for you. Go, let's check it inside.

424
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:16,359
Can't we just talk outside of the tent?

425
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:21,380
Mimi, are you blaming me for going there alone without you?

426
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,598
No.

427
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:25,699
I was afraid if I went there late, Su Yishe and the others would snatch them all.

428
00:31:25,699 --> 00:31:27,940
I said that I don't blame you.

429
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,578
Mimi, how about having a walk?

430
00:31:31,578 --> 00:31:33,779
The flowers outside our division are blooming.

431
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:36,698
They're colorful. Very beautiful.

432
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,098
Let's go. Come.

433
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:45,489
It's really very pretty. You'll know it when you get there.

434
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,500
Go.

435
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,980
That's it.

436
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,859
Why did you bring me here?

437
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:27,999
Well. Don't you like it here?

438
00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:31,699
Yes, I do like it very much.

439
00:32:34,439 --> 00:32:36,239
By the way,

440
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:41,799
you said that you had something for me.

441
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:49,579
- What's this? 
 - Open it and have a look.

442
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:06,599
It's candy. Where did you get it?

443
00:33:06,599 --> 00:33:08,179
Did you trade for it with traveling merchants?

444
00:33:08,179 --> 00:33:10,040
Do you like it?

445
00:33:10,579 --> 00:33:12,600
Have a taste.

446
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,680
- That's so sweet. 
 - Why did you stop eating?

447
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,078
It's quite good stuff. How can I eat it?

448
00:33:22,078 --> 00:33:23,718
I should keep it as a treasure.

449
00:33:23,719 --> 00:33:25,659
It's enough only licking it.

450
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,220
Mu Jin, thank you.

451
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,158
No need to say thanks.

452
00:33:33,158 --> 00:33:37,299
As long as you like it, I'll always buy it for you from now on.

453
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,940
Mimi.

454
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,280
I love you.

455
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:08,640
Do you know why I brought you here?

456
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,780
Because I heard that,

457
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,799
as long as I come here with the one I love,

458
00:34:14,799 --> 00:34:17,820
we'll be together forever.

459
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,360
I want to be with you forever.

460
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,658
- What are you talking about? 
 - I mean it.

461
00:34:25,658 --> 00:34:29,579
I really like you very much.

462
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,060
Mu Jin...

463
00:34:35,759 --> 00:34:37,759
You're a good man.

464
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:40,600
I don't deserve you.

465
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:57,340
You don't need to belittle yourself.

466
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,819
It's me that doesn't deserve you.

467
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,160
I'm sorry.

468
00:35:51,819 --> 00:35:54,840
Sister, it hurts.

469
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,358
I'm sorry. I made you hurt.

470
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:17,179
 Master ordered you to keep me here. 

471
00:36:20,399 --> 00:36:22,699
 Mu Jin. 

472
00:36:22,699 --> 00:36:26,080
 I really don't deserve your love. 

473
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,420
 Hurry! 

474
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,420
 Come! 

475
00:36:57,399 --> 00:37:00,099
 Follow us! 

476
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:02,120
 Come! 

477
00:37:02,919 --> 00:37:05,460
 Quickly. Come! 

478
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:08,259
Wait for me.

479
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,300
I always have the feeling

480
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,860
that Sun has been away for long.

481
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:20,179
When Sun was still little,

482
00:37:20,179 --> 00:37:22,699
though he was afraid of me,

483
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:28,900
he always begged me to teach him martial arts.

484
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,400
But now...

485
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:43,700
Great Khan, you don't feel well these days.

486
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,369
Please don't drink too much wine.

487
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:47,350
Who asked you to come here?

488
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,359
Leave here.

489
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,959
Please remember to have your medicine, Great Khan.

490
00:38:05,379 --> 00:38:08,638
I haven't been able to go to the Eagle Division for so long.

491
00:38:08,638 --> 00:38:13,159
And I also haven't seen Sun for a long time.

492
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,860
If I knew what it would be like today,

493
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:20,890
we two wouldn't have doubted each other.

494
00:38:21,419 --> 00:38:24,560
If he'd like to come back now,

495
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:31,040
I'll definitely award him greatly.

496
00:38:45,919 --> 00:38:55,500
♪ The wicker is broken and the flowers fly away ♪

497
00:38:55,500 --> 00:39:04,979
♪ I ask the passengers whether he'll come home ♪

498
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:38,199
♪ I ask the passengers whether he'll come home ♪

499
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,359
 Jinse. 

500
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:02,499
Princess.

501
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,060
 Well done. 

502
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:18,680
 I want you to torture me in front of Yanli. 

503
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,298
 When you humiliate me more, 

504
00:40:20,298 --> 00:40:25,250
 people here will all feel more sorry for me. 

505
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,179
 When everyone here doesn't think I'm dangerous, 

506
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:32,579
 it will be the best time for me to take action. 

507
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,599
 Do you understand? 

508
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,599
 Yes. 

509
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,879
 Stand up. 

510
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,020
 Princess, I'm sorry for your suffering. 

511
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,199
 That's not a big deal. 

512
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,139
 You're my capable assistant. 

513
00:40:56,139 --> 00:40:59,000
 Don't let me down. 

514
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:10,620
 Princess, I'll do whatever I can, 

515
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,100
 even if I die for that. 

516
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,880
It's...

517
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:31,339
me that's not capable.

518
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:37,860
I'm so incapable.

519
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,519
Princess.

520
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:05,439
Has that child arrived at Eagle Division?

521
00:42:10,979 --> 00:42:13,879
Yes, Princess. He's arrived.

522
00:42:13,879 --> 00:42:18,819
But... I underestimated Yanli's feelings towards Ashile Sun.

523
00:42:18,819 --> 00:42:22,320
I didn't expect that he still cared about his son.

524
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,298
When I encouraged Li Changge to save Luo Yi,

525
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:27,500
and asked A Yi'er to help her,

526
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,220
I was trying to find a chance to kill Ashile Sun.

527
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,179
But She'er was too softhearted.

528
00:42:34,179 --> 00:42:35,999
He kept this bane alive.

529
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,538
You took a risky move, Princess.

530
00:42:38,538 --> 00:42:40,578
Thankfully, A Yi'er is dead and can't prove anything.

531
00:42:40,578 --> 00:42:41,660
Otherwise...

532
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,100
Otherwise what?

533
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,118
Luo Yi betrayed Sui.

534
00:42:45,118 --> 00:42:48,780
Of course, I'd have an excuse to get myself free from being doubted.

535
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,500
By the way, is there any news from Luoyang?

536
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,939
No.

537
00:42:52,939 --> 00:42:56,679
No news. I'm afraid that will be the worst news.

538
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:59,219
Jinse probably didn't finish her task.

539
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:00,739
We should move faster.

540
00:43:00,739 --> 00:43:04,438
While Ashile Sun isn't back, begin whatever we can.

541
00:43:04,438 --> 00:43:06,340
Please be assured, Princess.

542
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:12,259
For these two months, I have been arranging our men around Yanli according to your orders.

543
00:43:12,259 --> 00:43:16,199
He won't be Great Khan for long.

544
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:30,200


545
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,910
♫  The heart gradually responds,  ♫

546
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:36,189
♫  gradually revives,  ♫

547
00:43:36,189 --> 00:43:39,700
♫  gradually swims towards you  ♫

548
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,960
♫  Before bidding farewell,  ♫

549
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,990
♫  we expect an encounter  ♫

550
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,469
♫  As your silhouette weaves  ♫

551
00:43:52,469 --> 00:43:57,800
♫  and locks in my nostalgic dream  ♫

552
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,600
♫  Before the daybreak,  ♫

553
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,989
♫  through the obsession of love,  ♫

554
00:44:02,989 --> 00:44:06,819
♫  the yearning flowing through thoughts  ♫

555
00:44:06,819 --> 00:44:10,289
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

556
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:16,180
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

557
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,629
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

558
00:44:19,629 --> 00:44:26,249
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

559
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:28,540
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

560
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,819
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

561
00:44:30,819 --> 00:44:35,489
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

562
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:38,250
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

563
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,189
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

564
00:44:40,189 --> 00:44:47,360
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

565
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:54,469
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

566
00:44:54,469 --> 00:45:00,299
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫
