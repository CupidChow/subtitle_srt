Excuse me.

23

Are you from the Central Plains?

24
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,244
Could you help me check

25
00:01:46,244 --> 00:01:49,180
whether this is from the Royal Family there?

26
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,059
If you don't know, don't talk nonsense!

27
00:01:58,059 --> 00:02:00,988
Have you ever seen anything from the royal family of Central Plains?

28
00:02:00,988 --> 00:02:02,920
Let me see!

29
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,643
Such a cheap handkerchief.

30
00:02:08,644 --> 00:02:11,944
Not only the royal family but also I would refuse to use it! It's so rough!

00:02:11,944 --> 00:02:13,621
You...

00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:16,820
How dare you! You did deceive me!

- Go!
- Help me!

How dare you ask us to do so?

36
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,500
Young Master, shall we help her?

37
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,044
According to her behavior and apparel, she must be rich or noble.

38
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:32,900
Someone will go to help her, even if we don't.

Young Master. It feels wrong.

41
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,132
They've even taken the gromwells from the black markets.

42
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:50,154
They're the most covert!

43

Seems that Khan's tent wants to destroy us all.

Where can we find the gromwell?

Let's lodge in the inn and keep on searching it.

47

We must find and bring it back!

Okay.

49
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,249
- Follow up!
- Let me off!

00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:10,965
- Go!
- I'm not repudiating payment!

51
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:12,379
- I just need to pay later!
- Go!

52
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:13,939
Why are you so unreasonable?

53
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:15,459
- Go!
- I didn't trick you!

54
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:16,999
You know to trick at such a tender age!

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,420
Full of tricks! I won't trust you!

56
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,880
- I'm not!
- Go!

57
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:25,340
Ask him to pay! He's rich!

58
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,440
No! If you don't pay up, you can't leave!

59
00:03:35,288 --> 00:03:37,580
Take it!

60
00:03:39,477 --> 00:03:42,000

61
00:03:48,066 --> 00:03:50,040

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,254
Stand up.

63
00:03:51,254 --> 00:03:54,654
Uncle, are you going to leave me in the lurch?

64
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:58,160
You tricked me and escaped last time.

65

I have a headache. Ouch, it hurts!

66
00:04:01,276 --> 00:04:04,760
The same old trick.

67
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,270
Well, you didn't mention stomachache last time.

68
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:11,854
Uncle, your joke isn't funny.

69
00:04:11,854 --> 00:04:14,240
Enough? Can we leave now?

70
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,060
I can go with you,

71
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,600
but I'm hungry and I want to eat noodles.

72
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,687
Haven't you just finished your meal?

73
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:23,600
Does it matter?

74
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:29,855
Here you are. Please enjoy it.

76
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,260
while you're all staring at me?

77
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,720
Yummy! It's so delicious!

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,954
I've got a stomachache!

79
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:05,944
What's wrong?

80
00:05:05,944 --> 00:05:08,609
Something wrong with the noodles!

84
00:05:12,266 --> 00:05:13,599
There's omething wrong with the noodles!

85
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,349
It's impossible... Wait!

86
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,580
- What's going on?
- We've operated for decades!

87
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,079
- We've never met it before!
- I...

88
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,599
- Any mistake?
- Namtso.

89
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,799
Go check the kitchen!

90
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,354
In case I'm poisoned, you may find the toxin!

91
00:05:24,355 --> 00:05:25,989
Do it! At once!

92
00:05:25,989 --> 00:05:27,700
- You guys, go to check the kitchen!
- Yes.

93
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,900
This way, please.

94
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,120
Uncle, go with them!

95
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,710
I've got a stomachache...

96
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,860
I have to go to the toilet!

97
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,120
It aches...

98
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,355
She escaped again!

99
00:06:16,355 --> 00:06:18,080
Let's chase!

100
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,080
It's you...

101
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,900
Enemies!

102
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,687
You played a trick but why did you blame it on us?

103
00:06:47,688 --> 00:06:49,054
It's enough. Leave her alone.

104
00:06:49,054 --> 00:06:51,640
- Wait! She's...
- Let's leave.

105
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:55,940

106
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,600
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

107
00:06:59,144 --> 00:07:00,199
How can they find me so quickly?

108
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,640
- Step aside!
- There are soldiers...

109
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,411
Are they the soldiers of Mobei?

110
00:07:04,411 --> 00:07:05,521
You fear those soldiers?

111
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:07,522
Don't move!

112
00:07:08,655 --> 00:07:10,880
Help me!

113
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,435
- What to do?
- Knock her out!

114
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:14,750
Stop it!

115
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:16,760
Let's leave!

116
00:07:23,566 --> 00:07:25,621
- Find them!
<i>- Yes!</i>

117
00:07:25,621 --> 00:07:26,900
Take care.

118
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,565
Shall we have a meal?

119
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:31,180
- This way, please.
- Fine.

120
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,943
Who are you? Why did you tie me up?

121
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:55,000
So who are you?

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,340
Why did you make trouble with us?

123
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,480
Why do I have to answer you?

124
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:04,609
By the way, you're quite weird and fear soldiers.

125
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:08,620
I think you're not normal peddlers!

126
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,500
Since you've found out, then it's time to silence you.

127
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:19,720
Do you know the result of bringing us trouble?

128
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,640
Do you want to kill me?

129
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,319
Here's the inn, right?

130
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,754
There are many people here.

131
00:08:29,754 --> 00:08:32,680
It's not a good place to murder.

132
00:08:36,699 --> 00:08:39,400
Clever girl. Tell me.

133
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,790
Who are they? Why did they chase you?

134
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,454
My enemies.

135
00:08:43,454 --> 00:08:46,420
I think it's good for me to be tied.

136
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,920
It's better than to be arrested by them!

137
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,820
Little girl! Pack of lies!

138
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,500
I dare not let you leave and bring us trouble.

139
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,260
Stay here quietly.

140
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,099
If you refuse,

141
00:09:02,099 --> 00:09:05,680
I'll leave you in the field to serve as the food of wolves!

142
00:09:19,511 --> 00:09:22,640
Changge, what's going on? Who is she?

143
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,620
Still not talking.

144
00:09:26,077 --> 00:09:28,080
Then, what should we do with her?

145
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,800
Though her background is unknown,

146
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,821
I don't think she's a hoodlum.

147
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,469
As she's smart,

148
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:36,277
she's found out that we don't want to cope with soldiers.

149
00:09:36,277 --> 00:09:40,632
If we let her off so easily, she might bring us more trouble.

150
00:09:40,632 --> 00:09:42,099
Guard her first.

151
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:44,760
Then we'll try to find a solution.

152
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,566
Sounds reasonable.

153
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:49,040
Then let's do it.

154
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,620
<i>Want to trap me?</i>

155
00:10:32,322 --> 00:10:35,960
<i>Come on... She's here for me?</i>

156
00:10:51,044 --> 00:10:52,640
Mimi, what's wrong?

157
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,739
What are you thinking about here?

158
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,360
I'm thinking of my father, mother, and young brother.

159
00:11:01,822 --> 00:11:05,910
My whole family lived in Mobei when I was young.

160
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,560
Though we were not rich,

161
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,920
we were very happy.

162
00:11:13,177 --> 00:11:15,820
Until the Ashile Tribe came.

163
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:20,680
They brought us battles and ruined my family.

164
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,000
Many clansmen were homeless.

165
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:28,520
Fortunately, King of Mobei appeared.

166
00:11:29,159 --> 00:11:31,680
Though Mobei wasn't conquered,

167
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,820
it was still pinned by the Ashile Tribe.

168
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:40,120
Whoever brings others wars will be punished.

169
00:11:41,819 --> 00:11:44,200
My father said so too.

170
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,720
In my childhood, he taught me to tell right from wrong.

171
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,180
Well, Changge,

172
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,680
I really cannot distinguish

173
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,980
between right and wrong now.

174
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:02,320
It seems that I should hate the Ashile Tribe

175
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,122
but Eagle Division is also a part of it.

176
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:07,080
I love the guys there.

177
00:12:07,688 --> 00:12:10,140
Am I wrong?

178
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,260
They're not the same.

179
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,880
Shouldn't you be tied up?

180
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,154
- I...
- Why didn't you escape?

181
00:12:28,155 --> 00:12:30,620
I didn't want to leave.

182
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,129
I think you're quite right.

183
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:37,310
The Ashile Tribe and its Great Khan must be punished in the future.

184
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,065
So, who are you?

185
00:12:41,065 --> 00:12:43,280
My name is Zhenzhu. I'm from Monan.

186
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,788
But we're in Mobei.

187
00:12:44,788 --> 00:12:46,344
I'm here for the Qihan Festival.

188
00:12:46,344 --> 00:12:49,620
Mobei has the liveliest celebration.

189
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,580
So you come here yourself?

190
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,710
The men that were chasing you...

191
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:59,040
Fine... It's because my father made me angry.

192
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,779
He asked them to catch me and bring me back.

193
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,739
Well, I don't want to go back now.

194
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:06,943
Oh, come on. You are just a kid who ran away from home.

195
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,829
I'm not a kid!

196
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,379
I'm now 14 years old and can get married.

197
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:14,340
I think you only enjoy larks.

198
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,398
I can let you leave, but you need to remember it.

199
00:13:17,398 --> 00:13:19,640
If you dare come to bring us trouble,

200
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,443
I'll capture and kill you.

201
00:13:22,444 --> 00:13:23,954
You won't kill me!

202
00:13:23,954 --> 00:13:24,910
Why?

203
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:26,680
My intuition.

204
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,755
By the way, anything to eat? I'm hungry.

205
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,040
Don't eat too much...

206
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,820
I'm full!

207
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,900
Then answer my question.

208
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,655
How far is Monan from here?

209
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,160
Are there any gromwells there?

210
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,780
Gromwell?

211
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:06,130
It's not a rarity.

212
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:08,960
As there are many in Mobei, why do you ask Monan?

213
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,360
Because we can buy none of them in Mobei.

214
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:16,620
Though its trade has been banned,

215
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,300
we still can banish the God of Plague.

216
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,122
Every Qihan Festival,

217
00:14:22,122 --> 00:14:24,840
everyone will take out gromwells to banish the God of Plague.

218
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,780
Banish the God of Plague?

219
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:33,820
Mimi, is it the same as what you told me today?

220
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,238
Its main part is to banish the God of Plague...

221
00:14:37,238 --> 00:14:39,740
People will build up a stage in the town

222
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,877
and someone will take the stage and perform.

223
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:47,140
Then people will throw all their gromwells

224
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,280
to the God of Plague.

225
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:56,620
How couldn't I find such an idea?

226
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,510
Which part of the performance should be fastidious?

227
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,640
Fastidious?

228
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:07,920
Anyone here?

229
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,800
Soldiers!

230
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,320
Are you all dead?

231
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,055
Where's Shixin Sili?

232
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,399
He isn't in Khan's tent now.

233
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,854
Then where's She'er?

234
00:15:34,854 --> 00:15:36,588
Ask him to come!

235
00:15:36,588 --> 00:15:39,438
Young Khan led the Wolf Division for an inspection.

236
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,620
No one is here...

237
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,880
They're all out!

238
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,940
Why are they not here?

239
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:51,020
You're sick and should stay in bed.

240
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:54,900
I'll report to you when they're back.

241
00:16:03,222 --> 00:16:05,340
Sun...

242
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,600
Sun...

243
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:19,220
Princess, Khan is still concerned about Eagle Division.

244
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,580
Can he dispatch them?

245
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,499
Please be at ease. We have soldiers guarding there

246
00:16:25,499 --> 00:16:27,917
and they cannot fetch any gromwell.

247
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,680
Thanks, Taoist Sun.

248
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,976
He's out of danger temporarily

249
00:16:51,976 --> 00:16:55,600
but the change of his condition

250
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,555
is faster than my imagination.

251
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:02,080
You mean... he cannot wait for another ten days?

252
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,420
Since I've told you ten days,

253
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:08,260
I will let him hold out until that time.

254
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,220
But if they cannot get the gromwell on time,

255
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,900
I'm afraid he'll be in danger.

256
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,759
Are you ready?

257
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,287
Yes. Please be at ease, Elder Qin.

258
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:34,380
Let's wait and see.

259
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:08,120
<i>Nice!</i>

260
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:11,450
<i>Banish God of Plague!</i>

261
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,759
<i>- Banish God of Plague!
- Good job!</i>

262
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,919
<i>- Nice!
- Banish God of Plague!</i>

263
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,420
<i>Good!</i>

264
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:22,320
Look at that!

265
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,680
Let's go to have a look.

266
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,200
Nice dance!

267
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:07,965
Awesome!

268
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:10,218
<i>Small tricks.</i>

269
00:20:10,218 --> 00:20:12,480
<i>It's our turn!</i>

270
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,480
Hit below the belt...

271
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,999
<i>Nice!</i>

272
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,865
<i>Good job!</i>

273
00:20:24,866 --> 00:20:26,132
<i>Awesome!</i>

274
00:20:26,133 --> 00:20:27,376
<i>Perfect!</i>

275
00:20:27,377 --> 00:20:30,455
<i>Amazing!</i>

276
00:20:30,455 --> 00:20:31,588
<i>So nice!</i>

277
00:20:31,588 --> 00:20:33,460
Banish the God of Plague!

278
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,010
<i>Good!</i>

279
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,620
<i>Banish the God of Plague!</i>

280
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,988
<i>Throw the gromwells!</i>

281
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:42,455
<i>Banish the God of Plague!</i>

282
00:20:42,455 --> 00:20:44,120
<i>Awesome!</i>

283
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:52,840
<i>Banish the God of Plague!</i>

284
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,340
<i>Nice!</i>

285
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,299
Go and investigate their background.

286
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:06,080
Yes!

287
00:21:08,055 --> 00:21:09,720
Put it here. Be cautious.

288
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,722
- Be careful!
- Elder Qin, is it enough?

289
00:21:11,722 --> 00:21:14,820
I've counted. It's enough for the Eagle Division.

290
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,262
Leave some here and wait for their check.

291
00:21:17,262 --> 00:21:19,280
I see.

292
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,132
Wait! Are you going to leave?

293
00:21:22,132 --> 00:21:25,700
What about me? What should I do?

294
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,265
As you've had enough fun, go back to your home.

295
00:21:27,266 --> 00:21:29,900
Don't let your father worry about you.

296
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,080
Sir, what's going on?

297
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,766
Our leader wants to see you.

298
00:21:42,766 --> 00:21:44,860
Your leader?

299
00:21:45,966 --> 00:21:47,860
King of Mobei?

300
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,999
Sir, we're just commoners with no crimes.

301
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,243
Can you tell me why he wants to see us?

302
00:21:54,244 --> 00:21:58,140
Does it need a reason?

303
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:59,454
Fine.

304
00:21:59,454 --> 00:22:02,455
Well... I'll go with you.

305
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,740
Please let them set out.

306
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,340
Who are you?

307
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,400
Our leader wants to see you all!

308
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,600
Sir, please take it easy

309
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,160
and let us have a discussion first.

310
00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:19,279
Changge, what should we do now?

311
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,887
It's a crucial juncture for us.

312
00:22:20,888 --> 00:22:22,450
We cannot make any mistakes.

313
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,287
If we have a conflict with them,

314
00:22:24,288 --> 00:22:27,320
neither gromwell nor we can leave here.

315
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,880
That's it.

316
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,687
But if we follow them, won't we waste time?

317
00:22:31,688 --> 00:22:35,100
Just play it by ear. If things go wrong...

318
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,909
Please be at ease.

319
00:22:36,909 --> 00:22:39,677
I know the map of Mobei well.

320
00:22:39,677 --> 00:22:40,954
If we want to break out of here,

321
00:22:40,955 --> 00:22:44,160
Yanxing Sect can come to our aid at any time.

322
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,110
All right. Sir, we'll follow you.

323
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,640
This way.

324
00:23:03,044 --> 00:23:04,943
It won't be easy. Retreat first.

325
00:23:04,943 --> 00:23:07,240
Report to the leader at once.

326
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:53,640
Is Your Highness the King of Mobei, Yaoluoge Pusa?

327
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,799
I lead my trade caravan, passing your territory.

328
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:00,200
Please forgive our offense.

329
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,640
We do beg your pardon.

330
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,380
Forego formalities.

331
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,443
I've never thought that you were a pretty lady

332
00:24:23,444 --> 00:24:26,260
after you removed the God of Plague attire.

333
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,540
King of Mobei lost to a young lady.

334
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,944
Well, you're the other God of Plague.

335
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,700
Shut up.

336
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:44,000
Who allows you to see my face?

337
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,969
Oh, come on!

338
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,988
It's only because you lost to us.

339
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:50,620
You're as old as my uncle

340
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,277
and why are you still aggressive?

341
00:24:52,277 --> 00:24:54,988
You not only hate to face your failure but also want to play tricks.

342
00:24:54,988 --> 00:24:56,065
Shame on you!

343
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:57,522
Who is old?

344
00:24:57,522 --> 00:24:59,078
You!

345
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:02,100
You're at least 20 years older than me!

346
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,660
I won't argue with you.

347
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,080
My soldiers found plenty of gromwell in your carriages.

348
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,120
Tell me.

349
00:25:17,011 --> 00:25:18,555
Who are you?

350
00:25:18,555 --> 00:25:22,020
And why are you embezzling gromwell at all costs?

351
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,099
Please calm down.

352
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:28,455
We're non-native businessmen,

353
00:25:28,455 --> 00:25:30,540
knowing nothing about rules here.

354
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:33,176
As we cannot purchase gromwell,

355
00:25:33,177 --> 00:25:34,887
there's no other way for us.

356
00:25:34,887 --> 00:25:36,900
Why do you want gromwell?

357
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:40,200
Because trades of gromwell are banned in all tribes here.

358
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,943
Sounds interesting. Go ahead.

359
00:25:42,943 --> 00:25:46,010
We want profit so we care nothing about the risk.

360
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:50,199
Since the Ashile Tribe bans the trades, there must be guys who need it.

361
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:52,587
As you're subject to the Ashile Tribe,

362
00:25:52,587 --> 00:25:55,380
you dare not allow people to sell.

363
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,909
As long as we can get it,

364
00:25:56,909 --> 00:26:00,187
we can find buyers and double to send it.

365
00:26:00,187 --> 00:26:02,160
Huge profits.

366
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,799
By the way, I'm curious about one thing.

367
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,055
Go ahead.

368
00:26:10,055 --> 00:26:12,310
As you've noticed very early,

369
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,999
why didn't you inquire us when we won?

370
00:26:14,999 --> 00:26:17,320
Why do you ask us now?

371
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,440
What are you waiting for?

372
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,920
You're smart

373
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,940
but you will have no chance to know it.

374
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:29,365
Soldiers, put these reckless guys in jail.

375
00:26:29,365 --> 00:26:31,480
- Yes!
- Hold on!

376
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,922
Do it at once!

377
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:34,720
Don't waste my time!

378
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,279
- Put them in jail!
- Go!

379
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,043
- We can't leave now.
- Let us go!

380
00:26:38,043 --> 00:26:39,011
- Wait a second!
- Yaoluoge Pusa!

381
00:26:39,011 --> 00:26:40,254
King!

382
00:26:40,254 --> 00:26:41,465
- You.
- King!

383
00:26:41,465 --> 00:26:42,980
Come here.

384
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,520
Have you let the soldiers of Monan leave?

385
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,543
Seeing their mistress be arrested, they hurried to leave and report.

386
00:26:53,543 --> 00:26:56,800
It's a smart young lady.

387
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,900
I see. You can leave.

388
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,187
Report to me as King of Monan comes.

389
00:27:01,187 --> 00:27:02,840
Yes.

390
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,554
Is anyone here?

391
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:22,000
We want to leave!

392
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,021
Is anyone here?

393
00:27:23,022 --> 00:27:24,722
We want to see the King of Mobei!

394
00:27:24,722 --> 00:27:26,459
We need to see your king!

395
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,660
Come on!

396
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,479
Changge, what should we do?

397
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:35,454
We've stayed in Mobei for a few days

398
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:38,600
and we need eight or nine days to rush back without rest.

399
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,659
But we're now detained here,

400
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,010
knowing nothing about the time to leave.

401
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:45,450
Let's try to find a way to leave!

402
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,676
What my father has told me is right.

403
00:27:47,676 --> 00:27:49,960
This is a bad place!

404
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,840
Why do you say so?

405
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,070
Mobei and Monan were good neighbors.

406
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,019
A hundred years ago,

407
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,749
Mobei conquered Monan's ancestral territory.

408
00:28:01,749 --> 00:28:04,454
After that, they've had battles for a long time because of it.

409
00:28:04,454 --> 00:28:06,900
Afterward, the Ashile Tribe came.

410
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,243
Though they had no fights, both of them led a hard life

411
00:28:10,243 --> 00:28:12,339
and my father forbade me from going out to play.

412
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:15,400
So they're bitter enemies.

413
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,759
Though King of Mobei is the leader,

414
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:20,980
he's controlled by the Ashile Tribe.

415
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,129
According to his expressions,

416
00:28:23,129 --> 00:28:25,649
it seems that he's ashamed of it.

417
00:28:25,649 --> 00:28:27,643
All the people here are ashamed of it!

418
00:28:27,643 --> 00:28:29,165
No one wants to be a slave.

419
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,687
And no one wants to be controlled.

420
00:28:30,688 --> 00:28:33,888
Our trades of herbs even need to obey their rules!

421
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:40,349
Is anyone here?

422
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,920
- Why are you crying?
- Come over here!

423
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,999
Go to tell your king that I want to make a deal with him!

424
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:50,710
- Come back!
- You'll regret!

425
00:28:50,711 --> 00:28:52,188
Come back!

426
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,270
Take it easy.

427
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,929
My father will come to save us.

428
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,877
He's the bravest man in the world.

429
00:28:56,877 --> 00:28:58,110
How can I take it easy?

430
00:28:58,111 --> 00:29:00,920
We need the herbs to save people's lives!

431
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,320
Hang in there, Mu Jin!

432
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,799
Mu Jin...

433
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,732
I need to get out... Come back! Let us leave!

434
00:29:11,733 --> 00:29:14,080
I want to see your king!

435
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,140
Release us!

436
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,240
Hurry!

437
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,300
Is anyone here?

438
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,559
<i>Come on!</i>

439
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,440
<i>Let us go to see your king!</i>

440
00:29:29,733 --> 00:29:32,299
Thanks to you, there have been no new patients recently.

441
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:35,820
All the patients we have are in stable condition.

442
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:39,100
General! Mu Jin seems to be in bad condition.

443
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,160
Taoist, how is he?

444
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,700
The plague is always changing.

445
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:02,960
A mutation will suddenly come during treatment.

446
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,420
I'm afraid... he's unlucky.

447
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:12,560
He's suddenly in the most dangerous condition.

448
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,019
Can you help him?

449
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:15,776
It's all up to his fate.

450
00:30:15,776 --> 00:30:16,980
What do you mean?

451
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:20,400
Cold and heat struggle in his body.

452
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,100
We must cool down his heat first.

453
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:29,360
But all my ways are in vain.

454
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,209
I'm afraid... he cannot hold out until the appointed time.

455
00:30:39,644 --> 00:30:41,510
Mimi...

456
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,120
Mimi...

457
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,140
Princess.

458
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:13,280
Do you think I'm old?

459
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,920
No.

460
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:20,140
You're still as brilliant as my first glimpse of you.

461
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:26,620
Only you and A Yi'er are sincere to me.

462
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,822
As for A Yi'er...

463
00:31:28,822 --> 00:31:33,100
No one can serve me better than her.

464
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:38,100
Unfortunately... she was Ashile Sun's mother.

465
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,280
She had to be killed by me in the end.

466
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,700
Being served by her for years,

467
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,840
I really didn't want to do so.

468
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,000
Forget it...

469
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,599
I don't need to make feints before her anymore.

470
00:31:55,599 --> 00:32:00,140
What about finding you some new female slaves?

471
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:03,120
No, thank you.

472
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,132
Do you want to report anything to me?

473
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,680
Report to Your Highness.

474
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,359
I have some news from the desert.

475
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:11,832
Ashile Sun didn't go there himself.

476
00:32:11,832 --> 00:32:14,460
He appointed his female slave to go there.

477
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:16,410
Mimi Guli went with her as well.

478
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:20,310
And someone from the Central Plains accompanied them.

479
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:22,220
Female Slave...

480
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,500
Central Plains...

481
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,177
She's Li Changge.

482
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:27,600
I think so.

483
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,420
I've never thought he would let Li Changge

484
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,420
go to complete such a crucial task.

485
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,780
It seems their relationship is unusual.

486
00:32:37,511 --> 00:32:39,554
Li Changge is not a common lady.

487
00:32:39,555 --> 00:32:40,944
Keep a close eye on her.

488
00:32:40,944 --> 00:32:42,840
Please be at ease.

489
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,119
They have been arrested by the King of Mobei.

490
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,699
Because of the prohibition of gromwell?

491
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:51,440
Yes. Mobei fears Khan's tent and dares not to violate it.

492
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,720
Sensible boys.

493
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,309
But don't let down our guard.

494
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:59,209
Ask someone to warn Mimi Guli secretly

495
00:32:59,209 --> 00:33:01,076
not to forget her task.

496
00:33:01,076 --> 00:33:02,421
At your command.

497
00:33:02,421 --> 00:33:05,910
Besides, call up ten thousand infantrymen, each from Mobei and Monan.

498
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:08,065
Step up the practice.

499
00:33:08,065 --> 00:33:09,299
I will.

500
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:15,540
By the way, you've told me to find me some new female slaves?

501
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,940
Then bring me their wives and daughters.

502
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,165
I see.

503
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:23,165
In addition, ask a new emissary to go to Mobei,

504
00:33:23,165 --> 00:33:25,520
showing him Li Changge's image.

505
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,543
I want to know all the Eagle Division's movements in Mobei.

506
00:33:28,543 --> 00:33:30,240
Yes.

507
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,109
King, they're clamoring to see you again.

508
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:41,188
Who?

509
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,388
The one who dressed up as the God of Plague.

510
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:46,290
They call her "Changge."

511
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,879
Can she come to see me as she wants?

512
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,320
- Let them alone.
- Yes.

513
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,880
King, the King of Monan comes.

514
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,100
He came quickly this time.

515
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,700
- Bring him in.
- Yes.

516
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:04,621
You. Go to the jail and bring his daughter here.

517
00:34:04,621 --> 00:34:06,355
Yes!

518
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,500
We must protect our Young Master.

519
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,276
Play it by ear.

520
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,600
Come on! We wasted an entire night!

521
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,180
How is Eagle Division?

522
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,189
Why hasn't no one come yet?

523
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:39,740
If we can't make a deal with them, then let's break out.

524
00:34:40,544 --> 00:34:42,340
What's the probability of success?

525
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,232
About 60%.

526
00:34:44,232 --> 00:34:46,080
We can have a try.

527
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,390
Fine.

528
00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:49,800
Let's prepare for it first and then take action in thirty minutes.

529
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,444
All right.

530
00:34:57,833 --> 00:35:00,065
Is he willing to see me?

531
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:01,466
You?

532
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:02,799
Impossible.

533
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:05,680
Our king wants to see Princess Tujia.

534
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,110
Princess Tujia?

535
00:35:07,111 --> 00:35:09,900
Is there anyone called that?

536
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:21,540
Princess Tujia. Princess Tujia.

537
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,143
Don't bother me!

538
00:35:23,143 --> 00:35:26,140
Tell my father I'll get up later.

539
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:29,040
Time to get up, Princess Tujia.

540
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:32,720
You're Princess Tujia?

541
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,543
Our king asked Princess Tujia to come see him.

542
00:35:37,543 --> 00:35:39,509
Where is she?

543
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,543
Father... My father must have come to save me!

544
00:35:41,543 --> 00:35:43,780
I am!

545
00:35:44,788 --> 00:35:46,690
This way, please.

546
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,387
Don't worry!

547
00:35:48,387 --> 00:35:52,020
When I see my father, I'll beg him to get you out!

548
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,640
I thought you would come in the afternoon.

549
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,380
But you came early in the morning.

550
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,360
You're really impatient.

551
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:18,432
Pusa, I don't want to argue with you.

552
00:36:18,432 --> 00:36:20,121
Tell me where my daughter is!

553
00:36:20,121 --> 00:36:23,732
Yinan, can you be polite?

554
00:36:23,732 --> 00:36:25,877
Your words are ugly.

555
00:36:25,877 --> 00:36:29,522
Your daughter carried soldiers of Monan, crossing my territory,

556
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:32,943
and stole gromwell with unidentified spies, trying to carry them away.

557
00:36:32,943 --> 00:36:35,199
I haven't blamed you for all these things,

558
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,633
yet you're now quarreling with me?

559
00:36:36,633 --> 00:36:40,121
Spies? What spies?

560
00:36:40,121 --> 00:36:44,220
I thought you ordered them to do that.

561
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,760
After thinking for a while,

562
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,960
you might have known Ashile Tribe's order

563
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,040
about banning trades of gromwell.

564
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,154
I think you dare not violate its order.

565
00:36:55,155 --> 00:36:58,287
Pusa! How dare you!

566
00:36:58,287 --> 00:37:02,577
I can fight with you but let my daughter off first!

567
00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:08,360
- Tujia!
- Father!

568
00:37:09,577 --> 00:37:10,822
Pusa!

569
00:37:10,822 --> 00:37:12,329
If you hurt her,

570
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:16,700
then my troops will be ready to fight!

571
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,320
Yinan.

572
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,000
Haven't we got enough battles already?

573
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,788
If Ashile Tribe knows she carried gromwell away secretly,

574
00:37:25,788 --> 00:37:28,479
- I'm afraid...
- What do you want?

575
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:32,887
Do you know that they called up soldiers from us quite often?

576
00:37:32,888 --> 00:37:34,566
Get to the point!

577
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:38,310
The day before yesterday, they came to call up again.

578
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:40,299
I've promised them that I'll give them in ten days.

579
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:43,876
I've heard you carried a battalion of cavalry elites

580
00:37:43,876 --> 00:37:46,488
to find your daughter.

581
00:37:46,488 --> 00:37:50,433
What about leaving them here and carrying her back?

582
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:51,700
What do you think?

583
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,322
You've gone too far.

584
00:37:53,322 --> 00:37:55,300
Think of it.

585
00:37:57,533 --> 00:37:59,660
Father...

586
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,760
Fine. I agree.

587
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,254
Let her go.

588
00:38:05,254 --> 00:38:07,280
Let her go.

589
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,543
- Tujia!
- Father!

590
00:38:09,543 --> 00:38:10,887
Tujia!

591
00:38:10,887 --> 00:38:13,199
My daughter! Did you get hurt?

592
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:15,809
Did I make trouble for you again?

593
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:18,299
My daughter, don't be willful later on.

594
00:38:18,299 --> 00:38:20,343
- Let's go back home.
- Father!

595
00:38:20,343 --> 00:38:21,910
I wish you could do me a favor.

596
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:25,019
I have some new friends and they've been arrested, too.

597
00:38:25,019 --> 00:38:27,960
Can you help them?

598
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,600
What friends?

599
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,665
I know you're not interested in gromwell.

600
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:32,859
Did they encourage you to do so?

601
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:35,119
No! They're good people.

602
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,366
Your daughter is really simple.

603
00:38:37,366 --> 00:38:39,600
She believes in all others' words.

604
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,180
Beware of deceptions.

605
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,800
Father, don't listen to him!

606
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,754
If you only know them by chance, then don't raise new issues.

607
00:38:46,754 --> 00:38:48,399
Father, please meet them.

608
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,776
Then you'll know they're all good!

609
00:38:50,777 --> 00:38:53,900
Changge told me they needed gromwell to save people!

610
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,880
Save people?

611
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,687
Pusa, bring her here.

612
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,732
More people, more cost.

613
00:39:04,732 --> 00:39:06,600
Can you afford it?

614
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,360
It's my business.

615
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,640
Just bring her here.

616
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,149
You. Go and bring her here.

617
00:39:15,149 --> 00:39:16,700
Yes.

618
00:39:49,933 --> 00:39:53,279
The noble emissary from Khan's Tent is here.

619
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,200
How dare you not go out to welcome me?

620
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,980
Well, can pigs fly now?

621
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,420
You guys stay together?

622
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:07,876
Fine. Then I don't need to go to Monan in the hot sun.

623
00:40:07,876 --> 00:40:10,180
<i>The emissary from Khan's tent?</i>

624
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:11,443
What's the matter again?

625
00:40:11,444 --> 00:40:12,987
Two things.

626
00:40:12,987 --> 00:40:16,920
First, Great Khan orders Mobei and Monan

627
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,533
to deliver ten thousand infantrymen separately.

628
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:21,600
Set out in ten days.

629
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,911
Where to go?

630
00:40:25,911 --> 00:40:29,620
Go to enlist in the troop of Dingxiang.

631
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:35,480
<i>Khan's tent is forcing them to deliver. Dingxiang...</i>

632
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:40,899
Second, thanks to all your tribes for serving King's Tent.

633
00:40:40,899 --> 00:40:44,599
Khan asked Khatun to invite all your female families

634
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,520
to Khan's Tent and stay for a few days.

635
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,943
What female families?

636
00:40:48,943 --> 00:40:51,740
Wife and daughter.

637
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,810
I have no wife and daughter.

638
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,743
I'm afraid you've made a futile run.

639
00:40:57,743 --> 00:41:01,140
I hear your mother is still alive...

640
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:09,122
I hear there's a cute young princess in Monan.

641
00:41:09,122 --> 00:41:11,640
I won't go!

642
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,160
Well, here you are.

643
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,221
That's all. I've told you all.

644
00:41:20,221 --> 00:41:22,760
No one can violate Khan's orders.

645
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,120
Behave yourselves.

646
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,743
<i>Do you remember?</i>

647
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:52,510
<i>Yes.</i>

648
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:54,280
<i>Don't alert them.</i>

649
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,360
<i>Report to me about her things at any time!</i>

650
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,280
<i>I've never seen him before...</i>

651
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:06,560
<i>but it seems he knows me?</i>

652
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,810
That man! We can't let him leave!

653
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:17,876
Who are you?

654
00:42:17,876 --> 00:42:19,740
Changge!

655
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:22,720
She's the one you want.

656
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,400
I won't hold back.

657
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,899
I'm the military counselor of the Eagle Division, Ashile Sun's trusted follower.

658
00:42:28,899 --> 00:42:30,177
Capture that man at once.

659
00:42:30,177 --> 00:42:32,957
I'll be solely responsible for the consequences!

660
00:42:33,955 --> 00:42:35,269
How to be responsible for it?

661
00:42:35,269 --> 00:42:37,521
If you offend Khan's tent, no one here can be free!

662
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:39,476
You cannot be free now!

663
00:42:39,476 --> 00:42:42,776
Stop him at once! We have no time!

664
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:50,365
I came to Mobei to find gromwell. Because the plague has hit Eagle Division.

665
00:42:50,365 --> 00:42:53,133
But meanwhile, Khan's tent has blocked all the access to the gromwell.

666
00:42:53,133 --> 00:42:55,540
What does it mean?

667
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:57,310
It means they have abandoned Eagle Division.

668
00:42:57,311 --> 00:43:00,520
Now, we have to form an alliance!

♫ <i>The heart gradually responds,</i> ♫

670
00:43:14,879 --> 00:43:17,260
