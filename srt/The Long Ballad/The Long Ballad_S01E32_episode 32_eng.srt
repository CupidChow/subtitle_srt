Princess.

00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,140
- Everyone, leave. 
  - Yes. 

25
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,200
You tailed me.

26
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,040
Did you lie to me and take advantage of me

27
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,690
from the beginning?

28
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,040
- I was under orders— 
 - Under orders to deceive me.

29
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,389
Take me as a lure for my best friend

30
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:25,330
and capture her as a prize to satisfy Minister Du,

31
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,040
so as to get a promotion.

32
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,100
Am I right?

33
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,740
- If there's nothing else— 
 - Answer me!

34
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,239
Crown Prince's disappearance is very serious.

35
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:46,690
It was I who took Changge to Ziwei Palace.

36
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,039
If Changge is involved in Crown Prince's disappearance,

37
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,510
am I an accomplice?

38
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,960
I used to fear you for your cold-bloodedness,

39
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:08,269
but, later, I thought there was a good nature under your indifference.

40
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,940
But now,

41
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,760
I think you're a puppet

42
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,590
without emotions, thoughts, nor heart.

Hao Du,

44
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,849
can't you see with your eyes?

45
00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:29,690
Since Changge ran away from Chang'an,

46
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,100
did she do any harm to our people or Tang Dynasty?

47
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,219
In You State, to capture Li Yuan and Wang Junkuo,

48
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:41,150
Changge risked her life and narrowly escaped death.

49
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:44,479
In Shuo State, she was even captured by the people there.

50
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,710
Isn't it enough for her to have escaped death once?

nor for credits,

56
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,580
but for what it's worth.

57
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:36,010
I understood it too late, so I lost Changge.

Yuan, what's up?

63
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,469
Are you unhappy?

64
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:07,530
Didn't you play happily with Sun?

65
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,460
Look who's here.

66
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,740
Young Master!

67
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,179
Sister, it's Brother Li.

68
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:20,850
Yuan, come here.

69
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,299
You're this tall now. I can't even hold you.

70
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:27,730
- Where's Elder Qin? 
 - I'll look for him.

71
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,410
Okay.

72
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,569
Take care. Go ahead.

73
00:05:32,569 --> 00:05:35,900
Elder Qin. Elder Qin.

74
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,370
Young Master, you're finally back.

75
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,809
When you were not here, we were rather anxious. So was Elder Qin.

76
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:43,629
We were all looking for you.

77
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:46,370
I'm sorry to have let you worry.

78
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,620
Shiba.

79
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,970
Shiba.

80
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,360
Thank you for helping me take Sun away.

81
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,800
It's my duty,

82
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,180
but I hope there's not a next time.

83
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,750
There won't be.

84
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,810
Young Master.

85
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,209
Elder Qin.

86
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,110
Well. You're back safely.

87
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,500
I can finally rest assured.

88
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,300
Sorry to make you worried.

89
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,699
Never mind.

90
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:26,270
I'm quite excited to know you're safe.

91
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:31,349
Young Master, what's your next plan?

92
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,950
I don't know.

93
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,160
I don't know if I can survive this time.

94
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,340
The officials in Chang'an have arrived in Luoyang.

95
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,350
I'm afraid you can't stay here for long.

96
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,220
Come back to the grasslands with me.

97
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,000
They've found you.

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,099
The best way is to leave for someplace they don't know.

99
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,990
Let me think over it.

100
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,329
Changge, there are three things you promised me left.

101
00:07:03,329 --> 00:07:04,969
Do you want to break your promise?

102
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:08,910
I thought when I was dying, we were even.

103
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,530
Even?

104
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,930
You want us to be even?

105
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,780
Let's discuss about us later.

106
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,149
Leaving Luoyang is the most urgent thing now.

107
00:07:31,149 --> 00:07:33,400
As for where to go,

108
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,850
you can decide when we get out of here.

109
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:42,239
Please let us know when you decide.

110
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:47,400
Yanxing Sect is at your service.

111
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,220
Did you forget your mission

112
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,580
after being slapped by Princess?

113
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,449
- I dare not. 
 - Dare not?

114
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,430
The longer Li Changge remains on the loose,

115
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,780
the more dangerous Crown Prince will be.

116
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,430
I just don't understand

117
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,960
why you conclude it's Li Changge who caused Crown Prince's disappearance?

118
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,630
Are you questioning me?

119
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,790
I dare not.

120
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,829
I just saw in person in Shuo State,

121
00:08:31,829 --> 00:08:34,079
Li Changge's sufferings for the people there.

122
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:36,249
If she wants to harm our country, she utterly—

123
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,810
Shut up!

124
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,630
It's the first time you've questioned me.

125
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,380
I didn't mean it.

126
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,259
I'm bound to capture Li Changge again for you.

127
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,060
Don't bother.

128
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,549
Now that you've been swayed,

129
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:57,170
seizing Li Changge is not your business anymore.

130
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,110
Father, you haven't fully recovered.

131
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,040
It's not your business.

132
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:05,660
Just stay at home and reflect on your mistakes.

133
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,510
Think about your identity.

134
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,320
I will.

135
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:42,220
 Did you lie to me and take advantage of me 

136
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,980
 from the beginning? 

137
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,980
 I used to fear you for your cold-bloodedness, 

138
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,369
 but later, I thought there was good nature under your indifference. 

139
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:56,360
 But now, 

140
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,180
 I think you're a puppet 

141
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,180
 without emotions, thoughts, nor heart. 

142
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,530
- Are you ready? 
 - Yes.

143
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:34,519
If Li Changge's there,

144
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:36,839
don't kill her, for the sake of Crown Prince.

145
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:37,980
 Yes. 

146
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,960
   

147
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,670
Thanks.

148
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,950
   

149
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,670
 - Have some water. 
 - Thanks. 

150
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:34,930
   

151
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,090
You must be the master.

152
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,599
Yes, I am.

153
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:04,020
I'm from the Central Plains,

154
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,760
but moved out after marriage.

155
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,389
Upon learning that my hometown suffered a disaster,

156
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:09,900
I felt very concerned.

157
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,699
On the way to visiting my relatives,

158
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:16,159
I heard Liuyun Taoist Temple had been helping refugees for charity.

159
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,500
I came especially to offer incense

160
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,440
as a pathetic contribution.

161
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,760
You're so kind-hearted.

162
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,960
Please.

163
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,030
Please.

164
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,430
Why are you standing here?

165
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,040
Yesterday you told me to leave the issue for later.

166
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,790
A night passed.

167
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,420
Can we talk about it?

168
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,270
Well...

169
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:58,200
You first.

170
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,820
Li Changge, I don't want us to be even.

171
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,640
Take back what you said.

172
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,100
Now, both of us are alive.

173
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,360
We can't just let it be.

174
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:20,220
How can I take back what I said?

175
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,039
It's a deal between the two of us.

176
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:24,100
I've never agreed to be even,

177
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:27,380
so what you said doesn't count.

178
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,939
Why're you so shameless?

179
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,110
You're unreasonable.

180
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:32,860
Whatever.

181
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,920
All in all, I remember what you owe me

182
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,340
and will never forget it.

183
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,990
So... we can't just be even.

184
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,120
Okay, I promise you.

185
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,620
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

186
00:15:14,430 --> 00:15:16,830
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

187
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,230
Then, can you let go of me?

188
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,399
Where are you going?

189
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,919
Liuyun Taoist Temple. To say goodbye to Master.

190
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:45,419
With plenty of things to do,

191
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,769
I can't leave until I finish what should be done

192
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,670
and the handover.

193
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,749
I'll accompany you.

194
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:55,149
It's inconvenient for you to go to a Taoist temple for nuns.

195
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:57,480
I just want to say goodbye, and come back soon.

196
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:00,109
Let me accompany you to the gate.

197
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:01,610
I won't go in.

198
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,620
Since when have you become a hanger-on?

199
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,779
♫  Who can say that one has never been shy  ♫

200
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:15,060
♫  or missed anything for a while on the way?  ♫

201
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:18,899
♫  Looking at the color of the blue sky  ♫

202
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:24,659
♫  Dyeing your eyebrows corner, I'm dazzled  ♫

203
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:26,625
I don't want to lose you again.

204
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,230
That feeling.

205
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,024
♫  A twinkle in your eyes  ♫

206
00:16:36,025 --> 00:16:38,430
♫  That's the warmness  ♫

207
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,710
At dusk, I'll pick you up at the gate.

208
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,680
I'm not a three-year-old kid.

209
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,269
♫  I wish you were a lasting song for me  ♫

210
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:51,100
Remember, I'll pick you up.

211
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:53,930
Okay.

212
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,019
♫  So I'll hold your hands  ♫

213
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,079
♫  All unknown lights  ♫

214
00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:05,680
♫  Light up the boundless blue sky  ♫

215
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,219
Master!

216
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:27,240
- I saw at the gate... 
 - Take your time.

217
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,409
I saw a group of people.

218
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,789
I don't know what they are coming for.

219
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:31,169
It seems they didn't come for a doctor.

220
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,120
It's Minister Du...

221
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,870
Is A'Li back?

222
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:42,830
It seems A'Li will not have a chance to be here at our temple again.

223
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:48,149
Anyway. I hope she has gone away long ago

224
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:51,039
and won't bite the hook here.

225
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,300
What does it have to do with A'Li?

226
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,970
Excuse me.

227
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,910
Taoist Master blesses you.

228
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,279
Minister Du, have you fully recovered?

229
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:20,689
Thank you for your concern.

230
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:23,929
It's not easy for me to recover.

231
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:29,299
Today, I come to bother Taoist Sun with a check of my body.

232
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:32,239
Unfortunately, he went out

233
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:35,019
with Situ Langlang to see patients at dawn.

234
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,870
I don't know when they'll come back.

235
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:44,240
So, Taoist Jingdan, can you give me a check?

236
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:50,530
It's my duty as a doctor.

237
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,980
Minister Du, please.

238
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,270
Please.

239
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,490
Await for me outside.

240
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,870
 Yes. 

241
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,310
- Minister Du, please. 
 - Please.

242
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:03,160
- Your pulse condition... 
 - What?

243
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,510
It seems hard and tight with Qi depression.

244
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,400
You might have been furious and worried a lot these days.

245
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,049
How can I not be worried about natural and man-made

246
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,549
calamities in Luoyang?

247
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,269
There're natural calamities indeed,

248
00:20:19,269 --> 00:20:20,689
but man-made ones...

249
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,739
Have you heard of the fire accident at Ziwei Palace?

250
00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:26,970
Yes, I have.

251
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:31,839
The palace caught fire and the crown prince went missing.

252
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,610
Do you know how serious that is?

253
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:40,259
You mean it's related to our Liuyun Taoist Temple?

254
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:45,270
You know it clearly.

255
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:49,539
Liuyun Taoist Temple's alienated from the secular world and royal court,

256
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,479
only engaging in helping others.

257
00:20:51,479 --> 00:20:55,600
Minister Du, you'd better have evidence.

258
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:00,429
Don't move.

259
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:01,730
Stop.

260
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,479
Behave yourself.

261
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:05,749
- Don't move. 
 - Evidence?

262
00:21:05,749 --> 00:21:08,399
Minister Du's right.

263
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:12,300
The arsonist is here indeed.

264
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,240
Behave yourself.

265
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,810
You're...

266
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:23,950
Aren't you looking for me?

267
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:54,830
   

268
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,440
 Why is it so quiet today? 

269
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,240
Brother Li, did you get it right?

270
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,280
I don't remember

271
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,360
you placing these two pieces.

272
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,440
You really leave no loopholes for me.

273
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,900
You're so cunning.

274
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,329
If we don't play fair,

275
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,270
I don't know when we can finish the game.

276
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,980
I'm playing chess.

277
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,650
Don't distract me.

278
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:56,660
Then... be careful.

279
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,789
You're like a spent arrow.

280
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:02,420
Don't struggle anymore.

281
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:06,900
You seem upright

282
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,320
but crafty indeed.

283
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,270
But it's too early for you to be so excited.

284
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:16,270
It's unknown who'll win at last.

285
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,679
 Don't move. 

286
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,180
 Behave yourself. 

287
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:32,870
 Don't move! 

288
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,680
You'd better not fight with us,

289
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:50,550
or these pathetic beggars will meet their end.

290
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,000
Did you set the fire at Ziwei Palace?

291
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,739
Who are you?

292
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,010
You don't have to know.

293
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:01,339
In short, I'm here to kill you.

294
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:04,619
Did you kidnap the crown prince?

295
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,780
He's dead.

296
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,659
 She's lying. 

297
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,560
 What does she want? 

298
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,340
How dare you murder the crown prince?

299
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,909
I'm the enemy of your master.

300
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:22,190
If it's not him, who shall I kill?

301
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,540
Do you work for the Ashile Tribe?

302
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,230
Now the crown prince is dead.

303
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,980
You failed to protect him.

304
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,380
How can you report it to Li Shimin?

305
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,879
You'd better kill yourself

306
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:39,540
with dignity than being thrown into prison.

307
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:43,410
Full of nonsense,

308
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,460
not enough to sway your mind.

309
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,510
Thank you.

310
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:56,290
If you succeeded at killing him,

311
00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:00,959
you'd have spread the news

312
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,160
and caused chaos all over Luoyang.

313
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,040
How can you wait till today?

314
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:10,870
How can you, a Taoist, be such a meddler?

315
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,379
 Miss Quan! 

316
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,169
 - Miss Quan!  
 - Miss Quan!  

317
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,649
- Miss Quan, are you okay? 
  - Miss Quan! 

318
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,480
Mind your own business,

319
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,250
or I'll stab her heart.

320
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,010
I'm the one you want to kill.

321
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,050
Don't hurt innocent people.

322
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,739
Of course.

323
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,670
You can't leave alive today.

324
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,499
It's known by all that

325
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,959
quick-witted Minister Fang and Minister Du

326
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:42,710
are Li Shimin's capable assistants.

327
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:47,890
It's not fruitless for me to kill one of them today.

328
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:56,950
You're brave enough,

329
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,560
but how do you feel now?

330
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,010
What about this?

331
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,449
You look handsome,

332
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,610
but can't move now.

333
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,569
What a pity!

334
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:13,100
Make your move, cut the crap.

335
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,759
If you ask for death,

336
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:19,490
I'll show my mercy and satisfy you.

337
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,880
Wait!

338
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:41,139
 This female slave looks quite familiar to me. 

339
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,210
You're... She'er's slave?

340
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,259
Madam Jinse, you have a good memory.

341
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,669
Why are you here?

342
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:50,480
I'm here to take revenge.

343
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:52,760
What revenge?

344
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,440
I've to take revenge on Du Ruhui.

345
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,660
Madam Jinse, what about leaving him to me?

346
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,490
Don't let his blood stain your clothes.

347
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:06,780
Unexpectedly, I'm not the only one who is eager to kill Minister Du.

348
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:12,659
Did he make you be exiled to the grasslands?

349
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:16,149
Madam Jinse, can you do me a favor?

350
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:21,590
Du Ruhui, you can't die so easily.

351
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,340
Interesting.

352
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,739
Take aim.

353
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:33,150
Don't ruin my plan.

354
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:38,870
You cornered me in a dilemma as an evildoer.

355
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,789
Have you thought about today?

356
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:44,260
I have a clear conscience.

357
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,990
What a blood debt!

358
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,659
How dare you say so?

359
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:54,139
I don't know your relationship,

360
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,089
but I advise you not to assist another evildoer.

361
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,840
You're doomed. Cut the crap.

362
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,159
- You deserve this! 
 - A'Li, think twice.

363
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,170
Don't make a great blunder.

364
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:08,929
If I don't kill Du Ruhui,

365
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,950
I can't feel at ease.

366
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,980
I thought you didn't split hairs,

367
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,139
but you're still unrepentant.

368
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,070
I was wrong.

369
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:20,000
I aspire to save all,

370
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,879
but couldn't save you at last.

371
00:28:21,879 --> 00:28:23,720
I don't need it.

372
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,549
Master, no more words.

373
00:28:26,549 --> 00:28:28,250
Go ahead.

374
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,750
A'Li!

375
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,780
- A'Bi, take them away. 
 - Yes.

376
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,949
Why didn't you cherish your life after running away from grasslands?

377
00:29:03,949 --> 00:29:07,279
In this case, die with them!

378
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:16,939
I've just been out for a few hours, but you're having such a fierce battle.

379
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,299
- Thank you. 
 - Never mind.

380
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,459
If Taoist Sun hadn't asked me to fetch medicine,

381
00:29:23,459 --> 00:29:25,790
I'd not have encountered such an interesting thing.

382
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,780
Master, hurry and help me.

383
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,140
Did I... Did I hear it right?

384
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,130
You called me "Master."

385
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:34,790
 Go! 

386
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:38,110
It seems I've to rise to the occasion.

387
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:01,499
A'Li, take Minister Du and the others away.

388
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,240
Situ and I will cover you.

389
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:17,610
Hurry up and go!

390
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,810
Minister Du!

391
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,120
Hurry!

392
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:44,000
Hurry!

393
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:51,410
Hurry!

394
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,530
Miss Quan, be careful. I'll open the gate.

395
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:05,150
Why can't I open it?

396
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,610
It can't be opened.

397
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:25,180
- It's open. Let's go. 
 - Hurry!

398
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,200
Go.

399
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,729
- Li Changge! 
  - Hurry! 

400
00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:30,360
Hurry!

401
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,480
What exactly do you care for?

402
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,760
Don't flatter yourself.

403
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,620
The reason why I saved you

404
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,430
is that you're inseparable from the country.

405
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,800
Take Minister Du away!

406
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,930
Minister Du, let's go.

407
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,939
Li Changge, come out.

408
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:53,449
A'Bi, take care of them.

409
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:55,700
I'll save Master.

410
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,100
Minister, let's go.

411
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,940
 Father, 

412
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,790
 I'm sorry. 

413
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:41,189
 Hao Du, you've improved a lot. 

414
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,910
 Thanks, Father. 

415
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:50,539
 Remember, don't be conceited at any time. 

416
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,499
 You're obliged to guard Hongyi Palace 

417
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,360
 and serve Prince Qin. 

418
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,639
 At a critical moment, you might even have to sacrifice your life. 

419
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:02,580
 Are you afraid? 

420
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,449
 No, I'm not. 

421
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,620
 I'll serve Prince Qin and Father forever. 

422
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,379
Hurry!

423
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,960
Miss Quan, be careful!

424
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,760
 Come on. 

425
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,270
Minister Du!

426
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:50,090
 It's a signal from Father. 

427
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,950
Bad news from Liuyun Taoist Temple, right? I want to go as well.

428
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:11,169
Now, Liuyun Taoist Temple's situation is unknown.

429
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:13,070
For your safety, you'd better stay at home.

430
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:16,709
How can I? I don't know whether Changge's in danger.

431
00:34:16,709 --> 00:34:18,770
Let me go with you.

432
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,490
Okay. Yueyan, follow me closely.

433
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:24,170
Okay.

434
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:50,099
I have a nice book. Do you want to have a look?

435
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:51,830
No, thanks.

436
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:54,280
Just have a look.

437
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,690
   

438
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,689
Brother Li, what do you mean?

439
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:08,109
Aren't you going to leave?

440
00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:11,779
It's a gift. Don't forget me in the future.

441
00:35:11,779 --> 00:35:14,270
It's not an ordinary thing.

442
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,299
Where did you get it?

443
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,299
Just a family heirloom.

444
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,700
It's Warcraft of Lord Wei...

445
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,390
Brother Li, are you...

446
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,129
Are you Li Jing, the Lord Wei?

447
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:29,650
Don't I look like him?

448
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,579
- Nice to meet... 
 - Sit down.

449
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,310
If you stand up, how can I talk to you?

450
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:42,650
Do you want or dare you accept this book?

451
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,880
Why not?

452
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,829
Wait.

453
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:58,059
You must finish this game with me,

454
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,890
and then I'll give you this book.

455
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,849
Drums.

456
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,950
It's...

457
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,700
The sound of drums is a signal for assembling reinforcements

458
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,590
from the southwest.

459
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:22,110
It's at Liuyun Taoist Temple.

460
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,610
Liuyun Taoist Temple?

461
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:26,150
Changge!

462
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,919
It hasn't been finished yet.

463
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:29,299
I'll keep my words.

464
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,100
If you go now, you'll never get this book.

465
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,300
I have to go.

466
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,710
The book is so precious.

467
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,890
Thanks, Brother Li.

468
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:51,589
Thanks, General Li. See you.

469
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,090
   

470
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,229
Listen!  If you go on like this,

471
00:37:23,229 --> 00:37:24,849
I'll blow your brains out.

472
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,810
Hypocrite.

473
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,690
Go ahead.

474
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:36,650
Please spare me!

475
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:41,150
Please spare me!

476
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,250
Master!

477
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,030
Master.

478
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,609
Why are you back?

479
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:03,889
You don't have to.

480
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,650
All this happened because of me.

481
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,259
You shouldn't account for it.

482
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,729
Master, take her away. I'm on it.

483
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,339
Master, sit.

484
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:30,140
Wait a second.

485
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:44,430
Today, I won't let you make it.

486
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,910
Don't overestimate yourself.

487
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,130
Attack!

488
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,740
You're awake.

489
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:08,790
Minister, our men are gathering.

490
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,789
Minister Du, please hold on.

491
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:12,679
I've asked a man to find Taoist Sun.

492
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:13,889
You'll be okay.

493
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,290
I'm okay now.

494
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,019
What's going on inside?

495
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,640
Master, A'Li, and Mr. Situ are all inside.

496
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,239
Don't worry. Master and Mr. Situ are skilled in martial arts.

497
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:26,490
Father!

498
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,850
Hao Du.

499
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:30,130
Sorry, I'm late.

500
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:42,169
Hurry and save Li Changge.

501
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:44,299
Sneak through the back.

502
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,409
There are many skilled killers from Ashile Tribe inside.

503
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:48,849
Kill them all and spare no one.

504
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,330
Yes.

505
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,780
   

506
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,640
- Minister. 
 - Duke Du.

507
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:14,730
Princess, why are you here?

508
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:17,739
- I... 
 - Wei Shuyu, take Princess back.

509
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,249
There are many skilled killers from Ashile Tribe inside. It's dangerous.

510
00:40:20,249 --> 00:40:21,640
But...

511
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,510
Where's A'Li?

512
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:24,440
In order to save us, she got herself injured

513
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:26,880
and she is still inside.

514
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,900
Who the heck are you?

515
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,680
The one who will take your life.

516
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,740
Madam, kill her.

517
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,210
It's not the time.

518
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:32,330
Whoever you are, I'll smash you to pieces when I'm out.

519
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,259
Ashile Sun, why are you here?

520
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,570
Jinse, it's you.

521
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,950
You are against me for a woman.

522
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,879
Did you forget your origin?

523
00:42:06,879 --> 00:42:10,020
How dare you betray Khan for the Tang Dynasty?

524
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,159
Kill him. Kill them.

525
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:15,840
None shall survive.

526
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,530
Can you still move?

527
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,350
Yes, I can.
