00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,679
Really?

23
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,660
It's Mimi?

24
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:43,220
So... I was wrong about her.

25
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,080
Yicheng's been threatening Mimi for so long.

26
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,239
But she didn't give in.

27
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:50,760
And she's been helping us secretly.

28
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:58,310
<i>Mimi, whatever happens, I'll believe in you.</i>

29
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:00,339
<i>Do you trust me?</i>

30
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,660
<i>Mimi, tell me what happened.</i>

31
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,760
<i>Changge!</i>

32
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,758
<i>You're being silly!</i>

33
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,199
<i>Why would you still care about me?</i>

34
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,499
<i>What's wrong?</i>

35
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:17,399
<i>She wanted me to... She wanted me to slander you</i>

36
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:20,539
<i>and frame you at the rally.</i>

37
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,890
<i>She even wanted me to point out </i>

38
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:25,780
<i>that you're Li Jiancheng's daughter</i>

39
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,780
<i>in front of everyone.</i>

40
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,900
<i>What can I do? What should I do?</i>

41
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,220
<i>Then just do what she said.</i>

42
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,279
<i>Though I still can't get over the thing about the Tang emperor,</i>

43
00:02:40,279 --> 00:02:42,939
<i>I never question his competence.</i>

44
00:02:43,559 --> 00:02:45,819
<i>Even though my real identity will be exposed,</i>

45
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:47,398
<i>I'm sure he would smooth things over,</i>

46
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:49,278
<i>saying that this is only our domestic affair.</i>

47
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:51,340
<i>Plus, Zhenzhu will also be there.</i>

48
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,678
<i>She's the real Princess of Monan.</i>

49
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:55,780
<i>It's not going to be a fatal problem.</i>

50
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,758
<i>On the contrary, if you do what she said,</i>

51
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:01,439
<i>you'll not only save Buzhen and Mu Jin,</i>

52
00:03:02,179 --> 00:03:06,830
<i>but also earn her trust. </i>

53
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:08,359
<i>You mean, I...</i>

54
00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:09,659
<i>Of course,</i>

55
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:12,719
<i>if it really bugs you, you don't have to force yourself.</i>

56
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,700
<i>No. I'm willing to get information for you.</i>

57
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,879
She's so brave.

58
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,819
But can she really get the message out?

59
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,479
I believe in her.

60
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:49,439
Someone asked me to deliver moon cakes to you.

61
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,460
Before you die,

62
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,020
is there any unfulfilled wish?

63
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,748
After I die, take my body back to the grasslands.

64
00:04:32,749 --> 00:04:35,969
I want to see it being a peaceful place with my own eyes.

65
00:04:35,969 --> 00:04:37,649
All right.

66
00:04:37,649 --> 00:04:42,750
Then I'll let you be a wandering ghost there.

67
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,229
Kill him now.

68
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:48,729
Yes.

69
00:04:50,849 --> 00:04:52,449
Execute him!

70
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,870
Right now, Sun is at the main hall.

71
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,589
Can we believe him?

72
00:05:26,249 --> 00:05:29,190
Do you have any other option than to believe me?

73
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,269
I'm standing in front of you.

74
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,530
Do you need me to teach you what to do?

75
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:40,689
Xu Feng, send a message to Master and Wei Shuyu.

76
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:42,729
Tell them there's a change of plans.

77
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:45,849
Yes.

78
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,370
<i>Stop!</i>

79
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:49,789
Changge.

80
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:06,390
You shouldn't be here.

81
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,089
Li Changge.

82
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:09,663
Release my man.

83
00:07:09,664 --> 00:07:11,465
Release Ashile Sun.

84
00:07:12,029 --> 00:07:17,029
Otherwise, today will be the day of your son's death.

85
00:07:17,749 --> 00:07:19,908
Even if I do release him,

86
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:24,229
you think you can walk out alive on your own?

87
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,490
Protect the princess!

88
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:40,029
Who says I'm here all by myself?

89
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:41,569
Don't say I didn't warn you.

90
00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:43,210
If you make a rash act,

91
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,600
we don't know whose head will be shot next.

92
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:50,770
<i>Changge told us that she'd seize She'er at the main hall</i>

93
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,788
<i>and force Yicheng to release Ashile Sun.</i>

94
00:07:52,789 --> 00:07:54,549
<i>All the guards will flock there at that time.</i>

95
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,009
<i>We should sneak in and split up.</i>

96
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,628
<i>Some of us will go find Buzhen and Mimi</i>

97
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:00,289
<i>while the rest go and get Empress Xiao and her grandson out.</i>

98
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:02,949
<i>We get them out and Yicheng will lose her leverage.</i>

99
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,508
<i>Then she can't stir up trouble.</i>

100
00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:06,870
<i>Whether Changge and Ashile Sun can survive or not,</i>

101
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,050
<i>we must keep them alive.</i>

102
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:23,230
Empress Xiao, we're here to save you.

103
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,428
Don't panic, Young Master.

104
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,370
I'm here to save you.

105
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,509
You!

106
00:08:46,509 --> 00:08:48,560
Even if I die here today,

107
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,690
my people will also shoot Young Khan dead.

108
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:55,868
A life for a life.

109
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,549
Let She'er go.

110
00:08:57,549 --> 00:09:00,509
I'll release Ashile Sun.

111
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:03,189
I'm afraid I get the final say now.

112
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:04,910
Don't you forget

113
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:07,529
that your son is in my hands.

114
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:08,889
Don't move.

115
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:12,269
If you dare touch my son, I'll kill you!

116
00:09:12,269 --> 00:09:14,070
I'm fine.

117
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,350
Release Ashile Sun.

118
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:22,290
Release Ashile Sun!

119
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:25,809
Release him.

120
00:09:41,629 --> 00:09:43,569
Now let She'er go!

121
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,930
Thanks.

122
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:00,868
Let's go!

123
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:02,869
Kill them!

124
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:13,569
Stop!

125
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:22,350
She'er! What are you trying to do?

126
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,490
Mother, let them go.

127
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,000
How dare you point your knife

128
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,890
at your mother?

129
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,370
Let them go!

130
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:43,310
Young Khan, please don't hurt Princess.

131
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:49,529
You're my son.

132
00:10:49,529 --> 00:10:51,989
You won't kill me.

133
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:55,149
Lei Meng, go get them!

134
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,750
Don't!

135
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,569
Yes, I won't kill you.

136
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:09,629
But I'll make you lose me.

137
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,849
Didn't you say that you're doing all this for me?

138
00:11:14,849 --> 00:11:18,449
Now, you don't have to.

139
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,220
So you were...

140
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,280
just playing the martry.

141
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,710
You and Li Changge had it all planned out.

142
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:35,350
You knew I would never hurt you.

143
00:11:35,969 --> 00:11:38,710
So you took advantage of that.

144
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:44,669
You are indeed my good son.

145
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:47,629
You're affectionate and loyal.

146
00:11:50,769 --> 00:11:52,849
Why don't you just kill me?

147
00:11:52,849 --> 00:11:55,029
That way you'll not only save Ashile Sun

148
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:58,189
but also get revenge for your father.

149
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:03,050
Kill me. Kill me!

150
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,830
- Mother.
- Come on!

151
00:12:16,329 --> 00:12:17,009
Mother.

152
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:21,610
If you're not with me, you can get the hell out of here anytime.

153
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:30,730
Lei Meng, go get them.

154
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,690
They must die!

155
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:37,929
Yes.

156
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:55,969
Let's go.

157
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,108
Changge.

158
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:05,591
Changge! Come here.

159
00:13:05,592 --> 00:13:06,592
Changge! Come here.

160
00:13:13,109 --> 00:13:15,250
This place seems to be different from the map.

161
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,548
Listen. You two go out this door and then go straight.

162
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:19,589
You'll see another door.

163
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,330
I've sawn that door bar off.

164
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,709
Push hard and you'll get through.

165
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:25,969
There might still be some guards in the doorway.

166
00:13:25,969 --> 00:13:28,668
But as long as you can break through, you'll get out of here.

167
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:30,869
We?

168
00:13:30,869 --> 00:13:32,208
How about you?

169
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:34,589
I can't leave now. Buzhen is still here.

170
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:36,748
Do you really think I'm here all by myself?

171
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:38,570
They've gone to save your brother.

172
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,269
Don't worry. My Master Situ Langlang is also here.

173
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:42,628
Even immortals can't beat him.

174
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:43,609
Really?

175
00:13:43,609 --> 00:13:45,349
Of course. Why would I lie to you?

176
00:13:45,349 --> 00:13:47,210
Come on, let's get out of here.

177
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:22,988
Go get them.

178
00:14:22,989 --> 00:14:24,589
Yes!

179
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,910
Mimi.

180
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:43,350
Changge, I'm glad you weren't shot.

181
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,649
You'll be okay.

182
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:47,049
I'll get you out.

183
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:49,150
You'll be okay. Trust me.

184
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:18,308
Buzhen. Buzhen.

185
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:23,189
Young Master. Empress Xiao, her grandson, and Buzhen have left here.

186
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:28,130
Good. Good.

187
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:34,709
Take care of Buzhen for me.

188
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,329
We agreed on leaving here together.

189
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:41,950
I'm going to take you and Buzhen back to Eagle Division.

190
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,690
I promise I'll get you out of here.

191
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:48,950
I'll get you out of here, I promise!

192
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,670
Changge, I... I really...

193
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:57,440
I really want to see him again.

194
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:19,050
<i>Kill!</i>

195
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,749
<i>Kill!</i>

196
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:34,769
Why did you come back here?

197
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:37,030
To save my brother, of course.

198
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,950
Mimi,

199
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,100
I'm here.

200
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,020
Mimi.

201
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,820
Mu Jin,

202
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,388
is it really you?

203
00:17:24,388 --> 00:17:25,989
Yes, it's me.

204
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:28,469
Promise me

205
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,448
that you'll take care of Buzhen for me.

206
00:17:35,448 --> 00:17:38,028
We're going to take care of Buzhen together.

207
00:17:38,028 --> 00:17:40,028
We'll take him to the fairs.

208
00:17:40,028 --> 00:17:42,850
We'll take him out for moon cakes.

209
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:45,908
We'll do so many things together.

210
00:17:45,908 --> 00:17:48,569
I can't take care of him on my own.

211
00:17:49,529 --> 00:17:52,350
You can do it.

212
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,430
I want...

213
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,950
I want candies.

214
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,149
I... I'll go buy you some.

215
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:04,609
I'll buy so many candies for you.

216
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,730
Okay?

217
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,029
So sweet.

218
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:31,489
I...

219
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:36,068
I like you.

220
00:18:36,068 --> 00:18:39,830
Mimi, I like you, too.

221
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,310
I like you so much.

222
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:47,950
Ever since I first saw you, I've loved you.

223
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:52,049
<i>Please don't, let me go!</i>

224
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:54,690
<i>Don't, let me go!</i>

225
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,068
<i>Whom did you call a good-for-nothing?</i>

226
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,909
<i>You, you, you! That was you!</i>

227
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:02,299
<i>Mimi, you'll always be a member of Eagle Division.</i>

228
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:04,799
<i>My Mimi.</i>

229
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,079
<i>You're my man.</i>

230
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,359
<i>You have to be responsible for me.</i>

231
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:15,919
I'll take you back to the grassland, okay?

232
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,218
Or the desert.

233
00:19:18,218 --> 00:19:22,419
Let's go home. Let's go home.

234
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,760
Help me take care of...

235
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,379
Take care of...

236
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,039
Mimi.

237
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,280
Mimi.

238
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:45,860
Mimi! Mimi.

239
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,619
Don't leave me, Mimi.

240
00:19:50,619 --> 00:19:54,740
Don't leave me, Mimi.

241
00:20:25,339 --> 00:20:27,139
Mimi.

242
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,000
Mimi.

243
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,600
She'er.

244
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,520
Mimi! Mimi!

245
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,140
Mimi.

246
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,700
Mimi.

247
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,180
Don't touch her!

248
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,018
Why has it come to this?

249
00:22:23,018 --> 00:22:26,178
Why? Why?

250
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,880
Why didn't you protect her?

251
00:22:29,659 --> 00:22:30,780
And you.

252
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,799
Everything she did was for you.

253
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,640
Why didn't you protect her?

254
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:45,919
Why?

255
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,820
Go ask your mother.

256
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,400
She'er,

257
00:22:57,739 --> 00:22:59,830
it was Lei Meng who killed her.

258
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,840
Lei Meng.

259
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,138
- She'er. Calm down.
- Let go of me!

260
00:23:05,138 --> 00:23:06,718
Right now, Li Jing is marching to Dingxiang with an army.

261
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,079
Yicheng won't be a threat to us anymore.

262
00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:13,498
You should come with us.

263
00:23:13,498 --> 00:23:15,199
Let go of me!

264
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,820
I did help you.

265
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:22,120
But it doesn't mean I'd pledge allegiance to Great Tang.

266
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,879
I don't care what you're about to do.

267
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:27,339
You'd better not meddle with my affairs.

268
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,039
She'er!

269
00:23:41,439 --> 00:23:42,999
The Eagle Division was so good at fighting.

270
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:44,399
Our guards were no match for them.

271
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,540
They've made it out of the palace now.

272
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,499
Just a bunch of traitors rose in revolt.

273
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:49,759
No need to panic.

274
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,760
<i>Report!</i>

275
00:23:52,959 --> 00:23:54,559
It's an emergency!

276
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,999
Khatun, Li Jing is approaching Dingxiang.

277
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,260
Cut that nonsense.

278
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,019
He's leading 100,000 infantry on the way here.

279
00:24:03,019 --> 00:24:04,958
How come he's approaching Dingxiang overnight?

280
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:08,038
It wasn't his 100,000 infantry that'd launched a surprise attack against us, but...

281
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:10,699
But the 3,000 well-trained cavalry Li Jing's leading himself.

282
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,398
<i>What? 3,000 well-trained cavalry?</i>

283
00:24:12,398 --> 00:24:14,358
<i>How come?</i>

284
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:16,259
<i>What do we do now?</i>

285
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,030
- What...
- Gosh...

286
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,510
He's a spy!

287
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:25,250
He's just trying to mislead us with heresy so as to damage our morale.

288
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,870
No one is allowed to leave.

289
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,710
Whoever dares step out of this palace gate will be shot on sight.

290
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,510
Lei Meng, I'll kill you!

291
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:43,582
Enough!

292
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,930
Ridiculous.

293
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,149
It's so ridiculous.

294
00:24:55,149 --> 00:24:58,230
What are you fighting for exactly?

295
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,649
For yourselves?

296
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:01,028
For Ashile Tribe?

297
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:03,428
Or for your Princess Yicheng?

298
00:25:03,429 --> 00:25:05,470
She'er!

299
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,709
You've killed so many people already.

300
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:16,289
How many more people do you have to kill for your so-called "great course"?

301
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:18,928
Lei Meng, drag him out.

302
00:25:18,928 --> 00:25:21,010
Guards! Drag Young Khan out.

303
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,990
- Yes!
- Yes!

304
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,630
Mother!

305
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,749
Mother! Stop!

306
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:31,789
Mother!

307
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:37,669
Princess, do you want Young Khan...

308
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,029
Give my order.

309
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:49,770
I want all the soldiers gathered outside the Chengqi Gate on standby.

310
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:54,430
Protect all the commanders to leave Dingxiang together.

311
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:58,789
Lei Meng will take command of Wolf Division.

312
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:02,068
Await my instructions outside the palace gate.

313
00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:03,669
Yes.

314
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:14,560
<i>[A Happy and Prosperous Life]</i>

315
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:36,250
You were right.

316
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:40,308
For all these years, there's not a single day that has gone by

317
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:43,069
that I don't dream of restoring Sui Dynasty.

318
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:48,049
And I am taking advantage of Ashile Tribe to fight for me.

319
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:52,369
That's why I've been enduring humiliation.

320
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:54,830
To keep my place as Khatun,

321
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:57,889
I married four Khans.

322
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:02,709
I'm not only going to make my son

323
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:05,990
the King of the Grasslands.

324
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:11,489
I also want him to overthrow Tang Dynasty and restore Sui Dynasty.

325
00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:19,490
Except that my son stabbed me in the back.

326
00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:23,269
Tell me.

327
00:27:24,189 --> 00:27:27,369
Do you find it ridiculous?

328
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:32,949
Am I the worst mother in the whole world?

329
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:38,310
If I'm the reason that's made you who you are today,

330
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:44,309
then I would rather you didn't give birth to me.

331
00:27:47,189 --> 00:27:49,949
I've lived such a tough life.

332
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:53,550
And now you're telling me

333
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:58,390
you'd rather not be born.

334
00:28:01,089 --> 00:28:02,589
Good.

335
00:28:03,709 --> 00:28:06,410
Very good.

336
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,720
From now on,

337
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:12,299
I'm no longer your mother.

338
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:15,240
And you'll no longer be my son.

339
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,419
- Mother...
- Shut up!

340
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:19,680
Take him away.

341
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,660
Get out of here!

342
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,659
Why are you still here?

343
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:39,519
Princess, wherever you are, I'll be there with you.

344
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:41,199
You idiot!

345
00:28:41,199 --> 00:28:44,799
I want you to lead the best soldiers in Wolf Division and a group of Dingxiang cavalry

346
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,739
to escort She'er out of here from Wuduo Valley.

347
00:28:46,739 --> 00:28:49,478
I'll use those commanders and common people to cover for me.

348
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:52,078
And eventually, I'll break through in Baidao.

349
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:53,999
Princess, you want to draw the enemies away yourself

350
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,139
so that Young Khan will get to live.

351
00:28:56,139 --> 00:28:58,300
Go now!

352
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:03,459
I swear on my life that I'll follow you anytime and anywhere.

353
00:29:03,459 --> 00:29:06,939
Win or lose, live or die.

354
00:29:06,939 --> 00:29:08,999
I need you to take She'er out of here.

355
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,299
Protect him on his way out of the grasslands to a safe place.

356
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:20,019
I'm afraid I can't obey this order.

357
00:29:23,139 --> 00:29:25,920
Even you are going to disobey me?

358
00:29:26,859 --> 00:29:28,498
I dare not.

359
00:29:28,498 --> 00:29:32,760
I just want to protect you until the last minute.

360
00:29:35,979 --> 00:29:40,420
It was me who escorted you away from Sui Dynasty

361
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,879
all the way here to the grasslands.

362
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,140
It's been thirty years now.

363
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,780
Just let me protect you, Princess, okay?

364
00:30:21,979 --> 00:30:24,500
Take She'er out of here.

365
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:29,319
Protect him with your life.

366
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,839
Can you do that?

367
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:42,679
Promise me.

368
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,380
Okay.

369
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:50,598
Go now.

370
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,839
As soon as possible.

371
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,379
<i>Commander!</i>

372
00:31:37,379 --> 00:31:39,899
Why haven't you set off yet?

373
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,200
I'm not going anywhere.

374
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:46,579
Now is not the time for you to throw a tantrum.

375
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:49,460
Remember, you must stay alive.

376
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:53,819
This is the only way for you to repay Princess' love.

377
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:55,238
Where's my mother?

378
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:57,580
Now you know she's your mother?

379
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,600
It's too late.

380
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,299
Take him away.

381
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:03,140
I dare you!

382
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,999
Young Khan. Young...

383
00:32:04,999 --> 00:32:07,180
I'm going to go in there for my mother.

384
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,439
Stop acting like a filial son in front of me.

385
00:32:09,439 --> 00:32:11,438
How can I believe you, Young Khan?

386
00:32:11,439 --> 00:32:13,039
You destroyed Princess's plan.

387
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,379
If you were not her son,

388
00:32:15,379 --> 00:32:17,719
I would've killed you by now.

389
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,018
Take him away.

390
00:32:20,018 --> 00:32:20,838
Let go of me.

391
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:21,559
- Young Khan.
- Mother!

392
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,358
Let's go.

393
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:24,379
<i>Let me go!
[Dingxiang]</i>

394
00:32:24,379 --> 00:32:26,080
<i>Mother!
[Dingxiang]</i>

395
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:35,170
<i>[Dingxiang]</i>

396
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,559
Let's go.

397
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,680
<i>[Dingxiang]</i>

398
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,000
Stop!

399
00:33:09,479 --> 00:33:12,738
Brother Qin, so I bet you've nailed that surprise attack against Dingxiang Palace.

400
00:33:12,738 --> 00:33:15,480
Brother Li, where's my father?

401
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,260
Follow me.

402
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,060
Father!

403
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:30,579
Father.

404
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,679
How is it going?

405
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,479
General, the toxin has spread through his body.

406
00:33:37,479 --> 00:33:40,119
It's good that Khan Yanli was healthy before being poisoned.

407
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,559
That's why he's still alive.

408
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:45,059
But I'm afraid he can't lead troops into combat ever again...

409
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:47,138
Is there any chance to remove the poison from his body?

410
00:33:47,138 --> 00:33:49,018
It's hard to get rid of it completely.

411
00:33:49,018 --> 00:33:51,498
But after a period of rest and recuperation,

412
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:55,480
he might recover his speech and even his mobility.

413
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,000
Father.

414
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,780
Father,

415
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:11,039
I'll take care of you for the rest of your life.

416
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:15,079
Father.

417
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,878
My... My son...

418
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,879
Father!

419
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:29,080
I've ordered the Eagle Division to help the Tang Army take Dingxiang.

420
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,139
Yicheng has been exploiting Ashile Tribe to stir up divisions.

421
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:36,439
Countless youths have died because of her.

422
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,179
The only way to take Dingxiang

423
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,740
is to ally with the Tang Army.

424
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,538
All these years, the grasslands have always been clouded by wars.

425
00:34:47,538 --> 00:34:50,858
The bodies are piling up and the people are suffering.

426
00:34:50,858 --> 00:34:53,220
It's been hard for our people.

427
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:57,399
Let's give them some time to build and heal,

428
00:34:57,399 --> 00:34:59,920
and restore peace in this world.

429
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,100
Okay?

430
00:35:03,159 --> 00:35:04,859
Father,

431
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:09,579
we should stop the war.

432
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,578
You guys take Buzhen back.

433
00:36:49,578 --> 00:36:52,379
I want to spend some time alone with Mimi.

434
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,279
Buzhen, let's go.

Young Master Wei, I was looking for you.

467
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:29,479
General, you wanted to see me?

468
00:39:29,479 --> 00:39:32,279
Empress Xiao has finished packing.

469
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,959
This mission may be of the utmost importance.

470
00:39:33,959 --> 00:39:35,999
You'd better set off as soon as possible.

471
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,059
You're right, General.

472
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:41,739
Shiba. Xu Feng. Now that General Li's here,

473
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:45,378
you two should escort Empress Xiao and her grandson away from here with Wei Shuyu.

474
00:39:45,378 --> 00:39:49,078
This mission is very important. There must be no mistake.

475
00:39:49,078 --> 00:39:51,039
- Yes.
- Yes.

476
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:52,718
Where should we go after that?

477
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:56,438
After the escort task? Don't ask me. Where do you want to go?

478
00:39:56,438 --> 00:39:59,760
Loyalty is paramount to 18 Cavalrymen of Yanyun.

479
00:40:01,579 --> 00:40:03,918
Forget about your identity as a Cavalryman of Yanyun.

480
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:06,858
You need to ask yourself where you want to go.

481
00:40:06,858 --> 00:40:08,659
I'll obey your order.

482
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:12,698
Fine. Then I'm ordering you to give me your answer.

483
00:40:12,698 --> 00:40:14,180
I don't know.

484
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:16,839
Young Master, don't put her on the spot like that.

485
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:21,000
I insist. She can't follow me everywhere for the rest of her life.

486
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:24,160
Shiba, give me your answer now.

487
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:31,180
I guess I want to try for a free life, with my friend.

488
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:37,870
- Friend...
- Friend?

489
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,458
All right. I also have to go.

490
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:51,319
I came here to save my disciple-in-law.

491
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,398
My work here is done. So I'm going to go.

492
00:40:53,398 --> 00:40:55,599
I have to teach my second disciple.

493
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,500
Second disciple?

494
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:00,058
Gosh, I'm so forgetful.

495
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:05,180
I've been too rushed to tell you that I have a second disciple now.

496
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,120
That means you have a little junior.

497
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,420
Last time when we went to find the gromwell,

498
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,238
we found him playing with Yuan at home all day long.

499
00:41:13,238 --> 00:41:17,398
Turns out Yuan is born a genius at martial arts with a superior level of physical fitness.

500
00:41:17,398 --> 00:41:21,659
So he tricked Yuan to be his disciple.

501
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:23,220
I can't believe you'd even deceive a kid.

502
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,639
Wait. What are you talking about?

503
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:27,280
That was not deceiving.

504
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,998
Yuan was so happy about it.

505
00:41:28,998 --> 00:41:31,059
She was cheerful, wasn't she?

506
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,799
Well, you are my first disciple.

507
00:41:34,799 --> 00:41:39,198
Normally, I should give you this Qinghong Sword.

508
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:44,298
But years ago, your grandmaster specifically told me

509
00:41:44,298 --> 00:41:46,499
to keep Yue Maiden's Swordsmanship alive.

510
00:41:46,499 --> 00:41:48,220
I was under a lot of pressure.

511
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:52,718
I also knew that you would not have the time to practice the sword later.

512
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:55,819
So I'm giving this to Yuan.

513
00:41:55,819 --> 00:41:58,439
I hope you don't mind.

514
00:41:58,439 --> 00:42:03,299
Actually, I'm the one who should be thanking you for taking care of Yuan for me.

515
00:42:03,299 --> 00:42:05,839
I hope she can live a safe and happy life.

516
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:09,030
I guess the Gongsuns might take comfort in it.

517
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:15,678
Don't worry. Me and Sun, we'll find time to visit you with Yuan.

518
00:42:15,678 --> 00:42:18,438
Well, then. See you around.

519
00:42:18,438 --> 00:42:20,440
We have so much ahead of us.

520
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,819
Changge, what about me?

521
00:42:26,819 --> 00:42:29,559
Zhenzhu, the war is impending.

522
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:30,800
I'm afraid I can't watch over you.

523
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,799
I'll send someone to escort you back to Monan.

524
00:42:33,799 --> 00:42:35,918
We should say thank you to you and your father.

525
00:42:35,919 --> 00:42:38,660
Changge, you want to get rid of me, don't you?

526
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,059
Of course not.

527
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:41,398
You've been away from home for such a long time.

528
00:42:41,399 --> 00:42:43,339
Your father must be missing you.

529
00:42:43,339 --> 00:42:47,559
When it ends, I'll go visit you with your Brother Sun.

530
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,620
Brother Sun, you must come and visit me.
