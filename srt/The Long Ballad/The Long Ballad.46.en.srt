Why are you here?

Did you ask the emperor for this?

I'm here to get you out.

How about you?

00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:06,490
You...

31
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,700
What does it take to free you?

32
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,409
She'er, before you leave,

33
00:02:16,249 --> 00:02:18,530
there's something I would like to tell you.

34
00:02:19,429 --> 00:02:21,670
I didn't kill your wolf.

35
00:02:22,589 --> 00:02:25,909
Over the years, this is the only thing I can't let go of.

36
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,610
Father didn't want us to bond with each other.

37
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:33,850
Only our rivalry was in the best interest of his reign.

38
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,409
So he had your wolf cub killed,

39
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:39,830
made a quiver from its skin and gave it to me.

40
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,847
Why wait to tell me now?

41
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:44,743
I just wanted you to know it.

42
00:02:44,743 --> 00:02:46,323
Well?

43
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,309
Are you afraid this is your only chance?

44
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,619
Or do you think I can't take the truth?

45
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,858
Can you?

46
00:02:53,859 --> 00:02:56,480
Even if you could,

47
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,800
would you dare to stand up to him?

48
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,239
She'er, for the tribe,

49
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,539
one of us must stand up and do it.

50
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,638
And that is me.

00:03:14,638 --> 00:03:18,500
Sun, what are you going to do?

52
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:38,088
I believe you all recognize Mu Jin of the Eagle Division.

53
00:03:38,089 --> 00:03:43,230
He's been lurking in Dingxiang for days, plotting a rebellion.

54
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,548
The Ashile Tribe has been relocated to Dingxiang.

55
00:03:45,548 --> 00:03:47,248
You should always keep it in mind.

56

Swear your loyalty here.

Don't worry,

59
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:08,449
I won't let you die before your master is here.

60

I thought you would never come here.

64

I am and will always be your son.

65
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,899
If we don't agree with each other,

66
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:54,419
we will only end drifting away from each other.

67
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,188
Mother, during these days in prison,

68
00:05:01,188 --> 00:05:03,290
I kept thinking about the old days.

69
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,788
I slept in your arms every day as a little boy.

70
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:07,429
You were always there for me.

71
00:05:07,429 --> 00:05:10,310
We didn't have to fight for anything,

72
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,130
nor did we worry or fear anything.

73
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,249
It was the happiest time.

74
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:27,049
But this happiest time in your memory was nothing but fragile.

75
00:05:27,049 --> 00:05:32,299
It would easily fall apart
with one word from your uncle.

76

Everything I do now,

00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:39,900
I do it to make sure no one can tear us apart in the future.

00:06:35,058 --> 00:06:38,759
I wonder if it is your arrangement.

84
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:43,309
I really wish it was my arrangement.

85
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,589
It's a pity that she would rather be the Princess of Mobei

86
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,029
than come back to Chang'an.

87
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,309
Envoys, whatever is between me and Great Tang is personal.

00:06:59,309 --> 00:07:02,509
It's complicated,

which I won't tell to save your time.

90
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,259
Now that I'm here on behalf of Mobei,

91
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,139
it means it is authorized by the Emperor of Mobei,

92
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,599
which I believe you all know.

93
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,578
That's true.

94
00:07:13,578 --> 00:07:18,219
The Emperor of Mobei has reached an agreement with my father to make an alliance with Tang.

95
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:27,289
Also, I don't think I need to tell you what I'm going to do with her, do I?

96
00:07:27,289 --> 00:07:29,508
Or is it that the identity of this princess
<i>[High Virtues Should Not Be Confused]</i>

97
00:07:29,509 --> 00:07:32,749
is important to our alliance?

98
00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:34,209
No, it isn't.

99
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:38,599
It's the domestic affair of Great Tang, which is none of our business.

100
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,738
I'm just wondering since you set free Young Khan

101
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:44,358
and made a deal with the Ashile Tribe,

102
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:48,500
why did you lie that you would ally with us?

<i>[High Virtues Should Not Be Confused]</i>

104
00:08:13,644 --> 00:08:18,418
Is this a list of our people who were abducted by the Ashile Tribe?

105
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:19,879
<i>There is a list?</i>

106
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,428
Since the beginning, we had been planning to get your captives back for you.

107
00:08:24,428 --> 00:08:27,828
Envoys, this is a list of captives kept by the Ashile Tribe,
<i>[High Virtues Should Not Be Confused]</i>

108
00:08:27,828 --> 00:08:29,524
without anyone left out.

109
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:33,205
Your Majesty, is this why you freed Young Khan?

110
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:37,429
Young Khan intended to assassinate my son

111
00:08:37,429 --> 00:08:40,169
and had his bodyguard killed.

112
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,130
The list is the only reason

113
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:48,170
why I set free someone who had committed such a felony.

114
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,410
This Treaty of Alliance will be valid forever.
<i>[High Virtues Should Not Be Confused]</i>

115
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:58,567
If you don't want to sign it, for now, I will not force you.

116
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:02,389
And you don't need to worry,

117
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:08,108
as I will still send your people home safe and sound.

118
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:12,909
If we don't sign it, will we still be able to leave here?

119
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,210
<i>Yes, can we?</i>

120
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,009
You can leave as you please.
<i>[High Virtues Should Not Be Confused]</i>

121
00:09:17,009 --> 00:09:20,789
Instead of stopping you, we'll send soldiers to escort you.

122
00:09:20,789 --> 00:09:25,589
It's a long journey which will take you some time.

123
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,729
By the time you get home,

124
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:32,130
you will find your people once imprisoned are already there.

125
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:37,472
So they've already sent them back.

126
00:09:38,801 --> 00:09:42,409
I promise whether you sign the treaty or not,

127
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:45,768
you'll have nothing to worry about.

<i>Right, it's wonderful.</i>

132
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:00,918
I just had a narrow escape from death.
<i>[High Virtues Should Not Be Confused]</i>

133
00:10:00,918 --> 00:10:04,439
I guess I do owe Great Tang a debt of gratitude.
<i>[High Virtues Should Not Be Confused]</i>

134
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:06,399
I believe you.

135
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,520

If you want, I can pull you out of my mother's service.

No, thank you.

Why?

00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:05,270
I have to stay by her side because there's someone I want to meet.

I'll protect you when we get to Dingxiang.

so that you'll enjoy the same treatment as Yueyan.

160
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,969
You can lead a carefree life in Chang'an.

161
00:15:04,969 --> 00:15:09,349
No one will force you to marry or do anything you don't like.

162
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:14,170
Is this why you let Sun go to Dingxiang alone, facing the unknown?

163
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:18,589
So that I will lead a carefree life?

164
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:21,669
That was General Sun's own decision.

165
00:15:21,669 --> 00:15:25,890
You should know why he did it.

166
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,069
I don't want a glamorous life in Chang'an

167
00:15:29,069 --> 00:15:31,729
or the title of a princess.

168
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:35,269
Wherever Sun is, I'll follow him there.

169
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:38,109
Dingxiang will be a dangerous place soon.

170
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:40,408
I can't let you take another risk.

171
00:15:40,408 --> 00:15:45,630
Changge, you're home now.

172
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,988
I won't let you leave again.

173
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,889
Home?

174
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:56,140
As far as your administration is concerned, I'm a snake in the grass.

175
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,680
Why do you want me to stay?

176
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,748
Or is it that you're trying to make up to me

177
00:16:02,748 --> 00:16:05,069
to feel better about yourself?

178
00:16:05,069 --> 00:16:07,330
Make up to you?

179
00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:18,910
I'm doing it because this is your mom's last wish.

180
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:24,308
She wanted you to be safe.

181
00:16:24,309 --> 00:16:29,250
This is the only thing she asked of me before she died.

182
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,950
My mother?

183
00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:01,209
<i>I knew this day would come.</i>

184
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,830
<i>I'll have you and Changge escorted away.</i>

185
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:11,410
<i>No matter what life you would like to lead, I'll make sure you have it.</i>

186
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:14,788
<i>Under this circumstance,</i>

187
00:17:14,788 --> 00:17:19,810
<i>you're still as considerate as in the old days.</i>

188
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:24,809
<i>However, I won't be able to enjoy it anymore.</i>

189
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,869
<i>Madam, please don't say this.</i>

190
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:29,750
<i>Politics is by nature very complicated.</i>

191
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:35,579
<i>Even if you hadn't done it, we might be facing the same result.</i>

192
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:37,580
<i>No.</i>

193
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,940
<i>My conscience won't leave me alone.</i>

194
00:17:43,339 --> 00:17:49,760
<i>It was me who wrote you the letter the other day.</i>

195
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,120
<i>I knew I could never go back then.</i>

196
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,579
<i>His Highness didn't love me, but he did treat me well.</i>

197
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,959
<i>Yet I betrayed him.</i>

198
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,838
<i>It was not my intention to kill him.</i>

199
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:34,539
<i>If you hadn't killed him, you would have been killed.</i>

200
00:18:34,539 --> 00:18:40,139
<i>A woman like me has no voice in political affairs.</i>

201
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:48,978
<i>You saved my life once and treated Changge like your own daughter.</i>

202
00:18:48,978 --> 00:18:51,118
<i>You've taught her so much.</i>

203
00:18:51,118 --> 00:18:56,299
<i>She looked upon you as her father, too. I'm well aware of it.</i>

204
00:18:57,089 --> 00:19:01,420
<i>Now, by doing what I did,</i>

205
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:08,520
<i>I've requited your kindness.</i>

206
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,600
<i>But His Highness...</i>

207
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,460
<i>How could I ever be able to requite his kindness to me?</i>

208
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:26,620
<i>Still, I should thank you.</i>

209
00:19:34,152 --> 00:19:35,113
<i>Don't!</i>

210
00:19:35,113 --> 00:19:37,413
<i>You stay there.</i>

211
00:19:37,413 --> 00:19:38,978
<i>Promise me.</i>

212
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:44,400
<i>Keep Changge safe.</i>

213
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,099
<i>Make her happy.</i>

214
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:49,699
<i>Let her do whatever she likes.</i>

215
00:19:49,699 --> 00:19:53,358
<i>Don't you force her to marry someone she doesn't love.</i>

216
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,159
<i>Don't ever make her sad.</i>

217
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,059
<i>Promise me!</i>

218
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:00,158
<i>I promise you. Put that down.</i>

219
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:07,059
<i>Finally, I owe no one now.</i>

220
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,480
<i>Jin!</i>

221
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:24,468
My father and you.

222
00:20:24,468 --> 00:20:28,489
No matter who died, my mom would die too. Right?

223
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:35,029
Where's the letter?

224
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:36,990
I want to see it.

225
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:41,030
I burned it.

226
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,509
I can't keep it as evidence.

227
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:47,068
The letter was your mother's way of returning my favor.

228
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:54,829
In that difficult situation, she chose to kill herself for closure.

229
00:20:54,829 --> 00:20:58,583
I find myself having not owing anyone my whole life,

230
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,499
but every time I think of her,

231
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:06,890
my heart will ache so much.

232
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:13,130
Changge, believe it or not,

233
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:16,380
I've never ever wanted to kill you.

234
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:20,710
I've always wanted to protect you, but I couldn't find you.

235
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:24,908
With so much going on, I got so busy

236
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,829
that I wasn't able to keep track of a lot of things.

237
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:31,249
It was only till later that I knew about what you'd been through,

238
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:34,869
and the sacrifices you'd made for Great Tang.

239
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:37,830
I feel so sorry for you.

240
00:21:39,489 --> 00:21:43,910
Changge, please stay.

241
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:47,550
Let me take care of you.

242
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,300
If I was given a second chance to choose,

243
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,899
I would make the same decision.

244
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,660
I'm willing to sacrifice myself for the Great Tang people,

245
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:04,138
but I'll never allow those who love me to sacrifice themselves for me.

246
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:07,960
I must go to Dingxiang.

247
00:22:09,468 --> 00:22:11,899
I'm supposed to be pleased to hear it.

248
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,520
But now we're on the verge of war with the Ashile Tribe.

249
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,059
If you must go to Dingxiang,

250
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,980
then I'm afraid...

251
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,930
I'll let your mother down.

252
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,639
If you leave now,

253
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,059
we might never...

254
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:43,139
Fine.

255
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:47,200
We're not common people after all,

256
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,219
whose everyday happiness is beyond our reach.

257
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,818
Changge, you are no longer a little girl.

258
00:22:55,818 --> 00:22:58,781
You've made your own choice.

259
00:22:58,782 --> 00:23:00,883
I won't hold you back.

260
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,910
Child, take care.

261
00:23:07,129 --> 00:23:10,289

This will always be your home.

Second Uncle.

264
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,540
You killed my father,

265
00:24:06,619 --> 00:24:09,219
but you're also my second uncle.

266

If you turn into a bad emperor one day,

268
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:17,780
Okay.

your daughter is just like you.

271

Your Majesty, Princess Yongning had me bring this to you when she left just now.

272
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:28,100
Mother, so this was your own choice.

273
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,180
It hurts me that you went through all this alone.

320
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:56,398
Thank you, Master.

321
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:02,239
If you keep it, I will let you see your brother.

322
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,659
- Thank you, Master.
- I must remind you,

323
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:11,899
you can't afford to make a mistake again when we're in Dingxiang.

324
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:14,819
If you aren't good,

325
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:17,318
you'll never ever see your brother.

326
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:21,599
No, I promise I'll be good.

327
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:33,110
Princess, Young Khan went to visit the Great Khan the minute he came back.

328
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:36,579
Well, I guess no one can stop him.

329
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,200
Let him be.

330
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,560
Do be more careful from now on,

331
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,830
in case of some unnecessary accidents.

332
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,260
Yes.

333
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:04,719
Your Highness.

334
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,720
Look how freely it flies.

335
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:21,960
- Your Highness!
- What are you doing?

336
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,198
Your Highness, be a good boy and stay where you are.

337
00:33:25,198 --> 00:33:27,119
Buzhen!

338
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:28,759
- Your Highness!
- Come with me.

339
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:30,560
Let go of me.

340
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,160
You...

341
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,040
Buzhen!

342
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:42,399
Sister! Sister.

343
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:44,860
<i>[Red Clouds Together Gives An Impression]</i>

344
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,600
Buzhen.

345
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:57,179
Buzhen, let me see you.

346
00:33:57,179 --> 00:33:59,480
Sister.

347
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,280
Your finger.

348
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,600
I don't know why they wanted to cut off my finger,

349
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,478
but His Highness Sui saved me from it.

350
00:34:09,478 --> 00:34:11,520
I'm fine.

351
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,899
That's good. That's good.

352
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:22,170
Commander Lei, news from the western front.

353
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:27,768
Don't worry, Sister. It doesn't hurt anymore.

354
00:34:27,768 --> 00:34:30,069
Don't cry. Please.

355
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:31,449
Okay.

356
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:32,668
Take Buzhen back.

357
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:34,089
Yes, Sir.

358
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:36,888
- Buzhen!
- Sister!

359
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:37,688
Buzhen!

360
00:34:37,689 --> 00:34:39,089
Sister!

361
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,768
- Buzhen!
- Sister!

362
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:42,888
- Come with me.
- Let go of me.

363
00:34:42,888 --> 00:34:45,410
- Sister.
- Buzhen.

364
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:48,810
- Time for you to go back.
- Sister!

365
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:02,649
Young Khan, why are you here?

366
00:35:02,649 --> 00:35:05,470
Open the door for me.

367
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:08,889
Well... but... but Khatun has ordered that...

368
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:12,470
Well? My words don't work here in Dingxiang?

369
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,929
Sorry, Sir.

370
00:35:13,929 --> 00:35:18,210
Tell your men not to report to Khatun about my presence here today.

371
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,209
Yes, Sir, I understand.

372
00:35:20,209 --> 00:35:23,729
I will shut them up.

373
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:27,070
Take me to Ashile Sun.

374
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,329
Yes, Sir.

375
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:30,030
- Open the door.
- Yes, Sir.

376
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,309
Young Khan, please.

377
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,950
<i>[Other tribes have made an alliance with Great Tang by signing a treaty with blood stamps.]</i>

378

<i>[To Give A Gracious Salute]</i>

379
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:41,569
To the dungeon. I'll go talk to Ashile Sun.

380
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:45,728
I can go there alone.

381
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:47,629
Yes.

382
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:55,350
Since when do you like drinking in the dungeon?

383
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:58,248
Since when you were put here.

384
00:35:58,248 --> 00:36:01,148
Is there a better snack to go with wine?

385
00:36:01,148 --> 00:36:02,989
I have no time for this.

386
00:36:02,989 --> 00:36:05,989
Finish it and go, in case your mother finds out.

387
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:08,090
I'm here as I please.

388
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,069
If she finds out, so be it.

389
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:11,969
The look on your face suggests otherwise.

390
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,669
Shut up.

391
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:26,390
I've seen Great Khan.

392
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,449
How is he?

393
00:36:28,449 --> 00:36:31,628
Ill, just like what my mother said.

394
00:36:31,628 --> 00:36:33,890
He can't recognize me now.

395
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,149
And he sent me away.

396
00:36:37,049 --> 00:36:41,710
Do you really believe he could fall this ill overnight?

397
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,369
Why don't you?

398
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:44,309
Stop alienating me from my mother.

399
00:36:44,309 --> 00:36:47,468
I like to see uncle like this because my mother doesn't have to tread on eggshells now.

400
00:36:47,468 --> 00:36:49,370
Isn't it nice that she can see me whenever she wants?

401
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,628
Don't lie to yourself, She'er!

402
00:36:51,628 --> 00:36:56,690
If you truly believe it, why are you here drinking with me?

403
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,589
Young Khan.

404
00:37:16,589 --> 00:37:18,768
Young Khan, Khatun is here.

405
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:19,849
Go.

406
00:37:19,849 --> 00:37:20,989
He's right, Young Khan.

407
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:22,889
I've let you in against Khatun's order.

408
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:25,429
If she finds out about it, then even if I've got ten lives...

409
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:27,248
Calm down.

410
00:37:27,248 --> 00:37:28,890
I'll go by the back door.

411
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:31,088
Yes, Sir. I'll show you out.

412
00:37:31,088 --> 00:37:33,789
Nothing shall happen if you keep your mouth shut.

413
00:37:33,789 --> 00:37:36,988
Yes, Sir. Please.

414
00:37:57,449 --> 00:38:00,069
Young Khan, please hurry.

415
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,670
This way.

416
00:38:12,449 --> 00:38:14,449
Come on.

417
00:38:14,449 --> 00:38:16,629
This way.

418
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:19,538
You can leave me here, in case she gets suspicious.

419
00:38:19,538 --> 00:38:21,739
Thank you, Sir.

420
00:38:31,845 --> 00:38:33,645
Khatun.

421
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,179
Why are you here?

422
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:38,860
I... I...

423
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,019
I asked him here.

424
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:45,939
I want wine. Get me more.

425
00:38:45,939 --> 00:38:50,580
Do you think we're at your Eagle Division?

426
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,620
Leave us alone.

427
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,420
Yes.

428
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:59,998
The used-to-be mighty god of war on the grasslands

429
00:38:59,998 --> 00:39:03,720
is now locked in this dark dungeon.

430
00:39:04,479 --> 00:39:08,758
To be honest, I kind of feel sorry for you.

431
00:39:08,758 --> 00:39:11,119
Just get to the point.

432
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,158
Save the small talk.

433
00:39:13,158 --> 00:39:15,980
Ashile Sun, you're indeed smart.

434
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,559
No wonder your father likes you.

435
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:20,799
My father likes She'er, too.

436
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:23,418
Without a mother who is a plotter,

437
00:39:23,418 --> 00:39:27,519
She'er will establish himself on the grasslands by himself one day.

438
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:31,598
How I help my son establish himself is none of your business.

439
00:39:31,598 --> 00:39:35,359
Your love for him has led you on the wrong path after all.

440
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,300
I won't argue with you today.

441
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,420
I'm here to negotiate with you.

442
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,520
Negotiate?

443
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,498
Great Tang has allied with the other tribes.

444
00:39:44,498 --> 00:39:47,438
They will attack Dingxiang very soon.

445
00:39:47,438 --> 00:39:51,979
Yicheng, you're in no position to negotiate with me.

446
00:39:51,979 --> 00:39:55,718
Since you've guessed it, I'll be straight with you.

447
00:39:55,718 --> 00:39:59,898
You're smart. Smart people always suit their actions to the time.

448
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:03,559
If you lead your Eagle Division to fight for our tribe,

449
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,180
I promise I'll keep you alive.

450
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,859
I won't be leading the Eagle Division to fight for the tribe,

451
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:16,660
but for you and the former Sui Dynasty, will I?

452
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,180
If I'm not wrong,

453
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,979
since the Khan's tent refused to give us the gromwell... No.

454
00:40:21,979 --> 00:40:23,579
Probably prior to that.

455
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:27,900
The master of the Khan's tent is no longer my father but none other than you, Khatun. Am I right?

456
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:34,678
The plague, the attack from the Bear Division in Mobei, and my father's illness...

457
00:40:34,678 --> 00:40:36,739
You're behind all of these.

458
00:40:36,739 --> 00:40:39,159
You've given me no choice.

459
00:40:39,159 --> 00:40:40,378
Have I?

460
00:40:40,378 --> 00:40:45,219
If you are dead, She'er will no longer be threatened on the grasslands.

461
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:49,420
Ashile Sun, aren't you very nice to your friends?

462
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:52,419
Now it's time to be nice to your brother.

463
00:40:52,419 --> 00:40:56,319
I won't help him, nor will I ever help you.

464
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,420
Fine.

465
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,579
Bring Mu Jin here.

466
00:41:19,879 --> 00:41:23,219
Mu Jin. Mu Jin!

467
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,439
Yicheng!

468
00:41:25,439 --> 00:41:29,488
He withheld the intelligence and sneaked in here without reporting,

469
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:31,129
which is a capital offense.

470
00:41:31,129 --> 00:41:36,969
The only reason I've spared him is because of you.

471
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:37,990
Take him away.

472
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,990
- Yes.
- Yes.

473
00:41:41,059 --> 00:41:42,859
Mu Jin.

474
00:42:02,629 --> 00:42:06,829
Okay, I'll do it, on two conditions.

475
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:07,908
What are they?

476
00:42:07,909 --> 00:42:11,069
First, cure Mu Jin.

477
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,329
Second, cure my father.

478
00:42:14,329 --> 00:42:17,988
That's a lot to ask.

479
00:42:17,988 --> 00:42:21,048
I can promise you to cure Mu Jin.

480
00:42:21,048 --> 00:42:25,929
As for your father, when the Eagle Division wins the war for me,

481
00:42:25,929 --> 00:42:29,009
I'll let you see him.

482
00:42:29,009 --> 00:42:31,470
You finally admit it.

483
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:34,330
