00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,290
♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,949
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:15,080
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,760
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:24,940
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,810
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

7
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,680
♫   Tears and regrets go hand in hand   ♫

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,180
♫  But my heart is still fiery-hot  ♫

00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,730
♫  To the distance  ♫

10
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,699
♫  The miserable past is like a dagger  ♫

11
00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:43,610
♫  Though my wings are broken  ♫

12
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:50,730
♫  I will keep flying  ♫

13

♫  Following the direction of the light  ♫

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,349
♫  I'll forget you  ♫

15
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,370
♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

16
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,349
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

17
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,299
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

18
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,460
♫  The river of life is under my feet  ♫

19
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,850
♫  I don't regret my craziness  ♫

20
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,600
   

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,260
   

22
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,360
Yesterday you were still fine.

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,670
And today you're injured.

24
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,190
Did you meet your enemy?

25
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,120
Eat something at least, brave man.

26
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,300
Then you can recover quickly.

27
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:15,200
I've been wandering in the streets since little.

28
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,000
And I've met all kinds of people.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,339
I can conclude that you recently are having some tough days

30
00:02:20,339 --> 00:02:22,910
or you having a blood feud.

31
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,060
Did you just have a tough fight with your enemy today?

32
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,379
If you say one more word, you will die.

33
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,280
No. No. No.

34
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,559
Brave man. No... Master.

35
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:38,720
Though I don't know who you are,

36
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,730
you can't be an ordinary person.

37
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,730
I, A'Dou, live a poor life.

38
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,789
Even if I die someday, I'm afraid that no one will realize it.

39
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:49,090
If I can follow you and do something great, it would be worth it, even if I'd die.

40
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,770
 Search carefully! 

41
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,069
Master, why are soldiers here?

42
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:05,099
They've found this place from Rongen Temple so quickly.

43
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,309
Rongen Temple?

44
00:03:06,309 --> 00:03:10,119
I heard that the soldiers guarding Rongen Temple were poisoned.

45
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:11,550
Was that you?

46
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,069
I knew that I was right about you.

47
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,309
You even dare poison soldiers.

48
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,180
Master, you're indeed not ordinary.

49
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,490
   

50
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,960
Brother Du, it's so late now.

51
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,349
I didn't expect you would be still investigating here.

52
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,280
Brother Du.

53
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,350
Why are you here, Brother Fang?

54
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,539
I heard that Pinxiang Store 
    

55
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,819
has the best pastries in Chang'an.

56
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,320
My wife wants to taste them,

57
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,509
so I'm here on my own to see how good they are.

58
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:53,669
When I was downstairs, I got stopped by soldiers.

59
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:57,989
After inquiry, it turns out Brother Du is investigating here.

60
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:02,010
You're really well-informed, Brother Fang.

61
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,700
   

62
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:12,070
Why is it on fire?

63
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,590
It looks like I can't buy pastries today.

64
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,340
Father.

65
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:21,080
Advisor Fang.

66
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,890
Brother Fang.

67
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,659
Do you really insist on breeding evil?

68
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,149
I don't understand, Brother Du.

69
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,939
I'm confused.

70
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,499
Brother Du, I have to go.

71
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,310
I need to go home now to tell my wife about it.

72
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,140
See you.

73
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:48,810
   

74
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,090
Master, why is it on fire?

75
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,659
Father, it's weird about the fire.

76
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,860
I'm afraid...

77
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,989
Please be assured, Father.

78
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,830
I'll investigate it thoroughly.

79
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:04,550
No need.

80
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,259
Since someone wants to protect her,

81
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,510
he won't leave a trace.

82
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,280
Is it possible... that Advisor Fang set it on fire?

83
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,560
Don't draw a conclusion so soon.

84
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,040
Pinxiang Store is empty today.

85
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,950
That person might not want to hurt innocent people.

86
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,230
Let's leave here.

87
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:24,560
Send people to put the fire out first.

88
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,779
Master, the fire is so strong.

89
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,680
What should we do?

90
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,530
Run.

91
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:00,680
Master, wait. Stop.

92
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,900
Master, why is it suddenly on fire?

93
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,219
And that ladder.

94
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,990
 Looks like someone prepared it for you. 

95
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,880
What's going on?

96
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,209
Master, why don't you say anything?

97
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:16,740
Remove my trace with fire.

98
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,280
There won't be any evidence there.

99
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,099
Then that's a favor for you, right?

100
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,800
A favor?

101
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:26,440
My mother's body is still in Rongen Temple.

102
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,530
I won't accept that favor.

103
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,910
Rongen Temple?

104
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,589
So, Madam Jin is your mother?

105
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,090
Knowing too much won't do you any good.

106
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:39,890
Whoever you are, you're my master.

107
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,259
Pinxiang Store is burned.

108
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,530
From now on, I have no place to stay.

109
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,909
Master, please let me follow you.

110
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,029
Let me say it again. I'm not your master.

111
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:51,820
Following me means you'll die at any time.

112
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:54,290
Leave me alone.

113
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,600
Master...

114
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,390
   

115
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,680
Fang Yi.

116
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,410
   

117
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,600
Yes, Your Highness.

118
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,410
Go to the battalion suburbs and send my order,

119
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,700
that the rebellion stops at Jian City and Yuanji.

120
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,520
I won't blame their followers.

121
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,820
Your Highness, that's...

122
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,540
What happened in Xuanwu Gate was not what I wanted.

123
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,420
No more people should die of it.

124
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,900
Yes.

125
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,340
   

126
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,979
 That was an unexpected disturbance. I can't help with that. 

127
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:51,230
 I wish after the disturbance, Great Tang will be fine 

128
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,759
 and people will be safe. 

129
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:55,939
   

130
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,940
Changge,

131
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:04,740
didn't you say that you'll accept the one hundred amulets that I prayed for you?

132
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,800
You haven't got any, and now you're missing.

133
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,270
Please be safe.

134
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,980
Bodhisattva, please.

135
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:36,290
Please make sure that Changge stays safe.

136
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,370
   

137
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,710
   

138
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,130
General, how is it?

139
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,240
Our effort was in vain.

140
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,989
Prince Qin has suppressed the turmoil among soldiers.

141
00:09:02,989 --> 00:09:04,740
How can he be so quick?

142
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,830
I didn't expect him to be so capable and broad-minded.

143
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:10,130
He pardoned all followers of the two princes.

144
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,639
With only an order, he eliminated the turmoil among soldiers.

145
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:15,350
I underestimated him before.

146
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,670
What should we do now?

147
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,620
Prince Qin isn't an ordinary man.

148
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,219
Even if we continue staying in Chang'an, he eliminated the turmoil among soldiers.

149
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,980
Let's leave here now and go to You State.

150
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,269
You State? Why are we going there?

151
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,211
We can't gain anything here in Chang'an during this visit.

152
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:34,869
Father Khan has been suspicious.

153
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,370
If I go back with no gain, my brother will make a fuss.

154
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,340
You State is like a gateway to Chang'an.

155
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,570
We need to achieve something there

156
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,220
so that we can keep him quiet.

157
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,020
I understand.

158
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,980
Mr. Fang, I'm on my way to meet you at your home.

159
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,740
Greetings to Princess Yongan.

160
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,660
Princess?

161
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,329
Princess might haven't heard about it.

162
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:16,789
During the meeting this morning, Your Majesty has conferred Prince Qin as Crown Prince.

163
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:20,170
Naturally, you are a princess now.

164
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,539
Thanks to Your Majesty.

165
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:28,139
Why did Your Highness want to meet me?

166
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,289
Mr. Fang, I want to ask for your help.

167
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,900
Changge?

168
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,210
I know that Mr. Fang cherishes Changge most.

169
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,910
I also know that you won't catch Changge.

170
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,639
Today, I'm here because I want to know the truth from you.

171
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,760
How is Changge?

172
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,700
Please don't worry, Princess.

173
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,700
Princess Yongning hasn't been caught.

174
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,990
I knew it.

175
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:01,219
I knew Changge would be fine.

176
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,660
Please be assured, Princess.

177
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,180
She was taught by Your Highness and Wei Zheng.

178
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,429
I also spent a lot of time on her.

179
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:13,590
How can she be caught easily?

180
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:19,120
Just... it will be tough on her.

181
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,110
   

182
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,189
About Your Highness's intention to pardon them, I can understand that.

183
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:30,000
But I think Your Highness can't pardon everyone.

184
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,950
What do you mean?

185
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:35,489
The leader of Tianjie Army, Luo Yi, has been good friends with Li Jiancheng.

186
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:38,029
If he wants to revolt, it will be huge trouble.

187
00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:42,819
Also, Li Changge, the daughter of Li Jiancheng, will do harm to...

188
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:48,520
Keming, the essence to make the country in harmony is to win people's hearts.

189
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,469
If officers keep suspecting each other,

190
00:11:50,469 --> 00:11:52,370
and I get strict and abuse punishment,

191
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:55,250
I'm afraid that I'll be like Emperor Yang of Sui.

192
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:58,560
Have you heard the saying?

193
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,099
Civilizing people after the turmoil will be much more effective.

194
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm too ignorant.

195
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,900
Not surprising.

196
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,380
This saying is from Wei Zheng.

197
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,990
Xuanling just recommended him to me.

198
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:20,829
Your Highness, Wei Zheng has always been stubborn.

199
00:12:20,829 --> 00:12:23,489
And now Your Highness wants to recruit him.

200
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:25,610
I'm afraid that it won't be easy.

201
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:27,810
Stubborn?

202
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,460
Wouldn't that just match your flavor?

203
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,140
Mr. Du.

204
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,189
   

205
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,760
It's about the safety of Chang'an City.

206
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,909
Be careful. Don't leave any trace.

207
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:48,339
Besides, it's a period of trouble now.

208
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,730
Send more people to guard every city gate.

209
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,360
Don't let any related person sneak out.

210
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,899
Please be assured.

211
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,050
I'll try my best to do it for His Highness.

212
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,080
   

213
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,979
Does the officer from East Palace also need to hide in Chang'an City?

214
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,460
Move away.

215
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,760
You can even criticize soldiers on the street in public.

216
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,360
What are you afraid of?

217
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,670
So it's you.

218
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,139
Why are you following me?

219
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,840
Following you?

220
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,219
It's you that ran into me.

221
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,389
What do you want?

222
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:51,120
You're from East Palace and you haven't pledged allegiance.

223
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,609
Why can you go in and out at your will?

224
00:13:52,609 --> 00:13:54,610
None of your business.

225
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,460
What are you doing?

226
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,060
Someone's coming.

227
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:17,090
Why do you look like this? As if I'm bullying you.

228
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,069
 From now on, soldiers will guard the city gate and check those in and out. 

229
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:32,670
Yes.

230
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,749
If it weren't for that guy, we would have been out of this city now.

231
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:37,309
Let's figure out another way.

232
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,110
Let's go back first.

233
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,200
Let's go.

234
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,400
   

235
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:01,680
It seems that Advisor Wei is determined to keep sleeping today until it's dark.

236
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:08,970
I'm sorry, Mr. Du.

237
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,410
My father hasn't been feeling well recently.

238
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,290
It's not convenient for him to meet guests.

239
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:17,299
Your father doesn't feel bad physically, but psychologically.

240
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:21,070
My father won't listen to anyone.

241
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:24,560
I apologize on behalf of my father.

242
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,309
Shuyu, do you have siblings?

243
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:33,930
I have three brothers and one sister in my hometown.

244
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,240
They're with my mother now.

245
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,429
Your father is so stubborn.

246
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:42,299
Just like a tall tree, it'll get broken if it's too tough.

247
00:15:42,299 --> 00:15:47,069
If your father has a bad ending, can your family survive?

248
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:50,640
It's just a shame for your Wei family.

249
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:56,390
Don't you understand the gains and losses of it?

250
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,890
I understand.

251
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,770
Good.

252
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:03,730
You're at a similar age with my foster son Hao Du.

253
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,570
He acts very properly.

254
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:09,970
You should learn more from him.

255
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,210
Seeing him is like seeing me.

256
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,900
Can you understand my words?

257
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:29,090
   

258
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,540
 Li Shimin's soldiers. 

259
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,700
 Is Mr. Wei... 

260
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,829
Mr. Du.

261
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:43,790
Please wait, Mr. Du.

262
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:46,010
   

263
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,380
I'll do my best to persuade my father.

264
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,830
Good boy.

265
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,810
His Highness gives this Fish Token especially to you.

266
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:12,459
From now on, you're with us, working for the crown prince.

267
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:15,089
You can use it to get in and out of the palace,

268
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:17,820
and meet His Highness and me at any time.

269
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,580
   

270
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,579
 What's that? 

271
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,380
 There. Look. 

272
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,629
 Look there. 
   

273
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,340
About the case of Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji's rebellion,

274
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,629
since the principal culprits were killed,

275
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,629
the crown prince asked His Majesty to pardon the others.

276
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,909
As long as they pledge allegiance on their own,

277
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,930
they'll be pardoned.

278
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,459
That's really a kind crown prince.

279
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,610
 Right. 

280
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,540
With such a crown prince, it's our fortune.

281
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,030
Changge, that was really you.

282
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,120
You caught me.

283
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,130
And you can get promoted with that, right?

284
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,870
Why would you think of me like that?

285
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,029
I won't do it no matter what.

286
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:28,400
Then, why did you surrender to Du Ruhui?

287
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,310
Answer me.

288
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,770
My father was the advisor to the former crown prince.

289
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,070
Given what happened in East Palace,

290
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,419
the Wei family is in danger and it's going to be ruined anytime.

291
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:44,859
If I treat Mr. Du indifferently, how can I save my parents?

292
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:48,389
But, Changge, it won't last long. Please trust me.

293
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:50,790
I don't trust anyone now.

294
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,290
Changge,

295
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,369
His Highness has ordered that anyone pledging allegiance will be pardoned.

296
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:59,229
Am I guilty? I don't need to be pardoned.

297
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:00,740
You're not guilty.

298
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,449
Neither am I. Everyone isn't guilty.

299
00:19:03,449 --> 00:19:05,899
So you have to trust me. I'll accompany you.

300
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:08,240
No one can accompany me now.

301
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,590
My mother died.

302
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,670
They all died.

303
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:16,310
Changge.

304
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:26,070
 No. The Fish Token. 

305
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,249
 She probably wants to use the Fish Token to get in the palace. 

306
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,510
 Why does she want to go back? 

307
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,830
   

308
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,949
 The Ashile Tribe has been very cunning. They often betray their allies. 

309
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:23,000
 We can't reckon them like others. 

310
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,270
 I'm afraid the turbulence these days was also from them. 

311
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:29,650
It's late now.

312
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,450
You can go back.

313
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,980
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

314
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,700
 Your Highness! 

315
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,830
 It's me. 

316
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,720
Congratulations!

317
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,459
His Majesty asked me to send the seal of the crown prince here,

318
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,710
Your Highness.

319
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:17,090
 Mother died. The East Palace was in a disaster. 

320
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:20,430
 So many people died just for such a thing. 

321
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:22,230
Put it here.

322
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:42,580
If you don't have anything else, you can go back.

323
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,000
Yes, Your Highness.

324
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,620
It looks like something is wrong.

325
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,180
Changge, you can show yourself.

326
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,350
You knew I was here.

327
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,630
You can hide from others,

328
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,650
but not from me.

329
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,960
I've let them record

330
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,840
that Princess Yongning has died.

331
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:18,350
You killed so many people in the East Palace.

332
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,760
Why would you like to let me go now?

333
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,780
Is it that you finally find your humanity?

334
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:28,150
So you can do me a favor

335
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:32,930
and comfort yourself because you suffered from a sense of guilt.

336
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:35,570
Or is it because...

337
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,250
I'm just a woman without the status of a princess?

338
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,910
So I can't be a threat to you.

339
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,790
Changge.

340
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,400
Changge, stop.

341
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,450
Even if I might die,

342
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,930
I'll get revenge for my mother.

343
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,970
Changge, just leave!

344
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,770
Your Highness.

345
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:39,509
Your Highness's safety matters to society.

346
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,970
How can you be in such danger?

347
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:49,080
Traitor, you can't escape now.

348
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,870
Take Li Changge away.

349
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,640
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

350
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:59,770
Stop. That dagger belongs to her.

351
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:05,710
I'll use this dagger that took my mother's life to kill

352
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,570
the murderer.

353
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:10,110
How dare you! Guards!

354
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:13,200
Put her into the death prison.

355
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,800
Wait!

356
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,170
Take Princess Yongning to the wing room,

357
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,840
and take good care of her.

358
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,029
Your Highness, you're breeding evil.

359
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,440
Keming, I'm tired.

360
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,010
About what happened today,

361
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,690
you can't tell anyone else.

362
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,700
Yes.

363
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:39,960
Take her away.

364
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,790
- Move! 
 - Go.

365
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,570
Father, it's already well arranged.

366
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,480
I've set lookouts everywhere in Hongyi Palace.

367
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,280
Please be assured.

368
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:03,640
Father, how is His Highness going to deal with Li Changge?

369
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:08,470
Breeding evil will cause lots of trouble.

370
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,900
Father, don't get too tired.

371
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,780
What should I do next?

372
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,040
Double the soldiers.

373
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,629
And let them secretly guard the wing room at every corner of it.

374
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:25,230
Give her the illusion that she's not well guarded.

375
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,720
If she wants to run away,

376
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,600
kill her on the spot.

377
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,000
Yes.

378
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,740
 Why are they guarding me with so few soldiers? 

379
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,360
 Mother, what should I do? 

380
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,260
Your Highness.

381
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,030
Advisor Fang, I can't fall asleep.

382
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,010
Play chess with me.

383
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,660
Yes.

384
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,350
How dare you!

385
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:23,669
I haven't started. How dare you make your move?

386
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:28,590
Isn't Your Highness waiting for others to make a move first?

387
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:33,410
You can't know me better than myself.

388
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:37,509
Changge isn't a girl easy to deal with.

389
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,290
Your Highness is busy with official duties.

390
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,970
No need to bother with that.

391
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:45,120
Your Highness urgently summoned me here for that.

392
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,180
Your Highness, I'll deal with that.

393
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,150
She's your student.

394
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:54,220
You have to be responsible for her.

395
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,510
Yes.

396
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:59,950
   

397
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:05,490
Assassination at Prince Qin Manor?

398
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:08,500
I didn't expect him to be so dauntless.

399
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,960
General, who are you talking about?

400
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,720
The guy that won against us in the cuju arena.

401
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:16,920
So he's not an ordinary man.

402
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,270
Needless to say.

403
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,350
He's more than uncommon.

404
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:23,210
He also has an uncommon relationship with Prince Qin.

405
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:25,620
Prince Qin didn't put him into prison,

406
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,800
but let him live in the wing room.

407
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,509
So we'll be friends with him.

408
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:31,910
Friends?

409
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,670
The enemy of our enemy is our friend.

410
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,839
What? Changge was caught by my father.

411
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,179
And she got locked?

412
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,749
I heard servants talking about it this morning.

413
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,629
And they were seriously scolded by Commander Hao Du.

414
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:47,900
As for where she is now, I didn't hear that.

415
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:49,269
Changge.

416
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,550
What should we do?

417
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,350
Changge.

418
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,029
Mr. Fang.

419
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,760
Mr. Fang must know where they locked Changge.

420
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:05,409
Mr. Fang.

421
00:31:05,409 --> 00:31:06,219
Princess.

422
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,450
I was going to visit you.

423
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,869
Princess.

424
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:35,520
Mr. Fang is really like a prophet.

425
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,220
The rain tonight is our biggest helper.

426
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:45,030
Are you really prepared, Princess?

427
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,200
I'm afraid.

428
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,609
Don't be afraid, Princess.

429
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:53,179
Think of every step that Mr. Fang has taught you.

430
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,799
And just do as he said.

431
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,390
Things will be okay.

432
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,500
I believe Mr. Fang.

433
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:03,020
Since little, it was Changge that protected me.

434
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:07,600
Now it's time for me to save her.

435
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,869
 As stubborn as she is, Changge won't eat anything these days. 

436
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,179
 But Your Highness ordered that 

437
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,939
 they should take good care of her. 

438
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:17,620
 Those guards are also worrying about that, 

439
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,249
 because no one can afford to neglect the princess. 

440
00:32:21,249 --> 00:32:24,460
 Only your appearance will let Changge eat something. 

441
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,029
 The guards will pretend to stop you. 

442
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,579
 Actually they wish that you can show up. 

443
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:30,790
 Only by this can they avoid responsibility. 

444
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:32,629
 Remember. Don't be afraid. 

445
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:35,740
 The guards will definitely let you get in. 

446
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,770
How dare you! This is the princess.

447
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:43,370
Advisor Du said that no one can get close to the wing room.

448
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:46,120
Please don't make things difficult for us.

449
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:52,749
I heard that Princess Yongning hasn't been eating for 24 hours.

450
00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:55,290
My father said that you should take good care of her.

451
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,849
If something bad happens to her,

452
00:32:57,849 --> 00:32:59,389
can you afford that?

453
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,179
That's...

454
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,509
Princess just wants to send her some food.

455
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:03,819
She won't stay long.

456
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,260
Or are you doubting the princess?

457
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,630
Please, Princess.

458
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:19,430
Wait for me here.

459
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,730
Changge.

460
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,250
Chang... Changge.

461
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,880
I'm Yueyan.

462
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,520
Why are you here?

463
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,450
Who sent you here?

464
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:57,470
 Don't let Changge know that I sent you there. 

465
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:59,419
 She won't accept this favor. 

466
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:02,659
 What you should do is to show flaws deliberately. 

467
00:34:02,659 --> 00:34:05,649
 Give her the information to run away. 

468
00:34:05,649 --> 00:34:09,409
 Let Changge run away by herself instead of being rescued. 

469
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:12,600
 That's what Changge will accept. 

470
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,120
It's raining tonight and suddenly became cold.

471
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,139
The guards in the backyard went home due to the chill.

472
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,350
So I brought you hot soup and pastries.

473
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:24,310
Eat it when it's still hot.

474
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,310
How did you get in?

475
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,349
I'm a princess now.

476
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:37,320
They dare not stop me.

477
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:41,080
Your father killed my father.

478
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,830
You became a princess.

479
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:46,110
Princess Yongan.

480
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,829
Changge, it's not like what you think.

481
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,069
I don't care about being a princess or whatever.

482
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:56,809
From your room to this wing room, you won't pass the backyard.

483
00:34:56,809 --> 00:34:59,740
How did you know that there were no guards in the backyard?

484
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,760
Who taught you that?

485
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,810
 Changge is extremely smart. 

486
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,589
 If she finds out you're lying, 

487
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:09,990
 you don't need to hide anything from her. 

488
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:14,740
Changge, leave here now.

489
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,999
The door of the backyard is open.

490
00:35:15,999 --> 00:35:17,799
The guards were also kept away.

491
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:19,269
Go as far as you can.

492
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:20,609
Don't ever come back.

493
00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:22,620
How can I believe you?

494
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,149
Is it your father's trap, or Du Ruhui's?

495
00:35:26,169 --> 00:35:30,309
Then you'll declare that Princess Yongning died from arrows when she was running away.

496
00:35:30,309 --> 00:35:32,170
Yes or no?

497
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,390
Yes or no?

498
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,530
Changge,

499
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,050
do you really think that I'll hurt you?

500
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,710
It's Mr. Fang.

501
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,690
Mr. Fang taught me that.

502
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,840
He said that you're stubborn.

503
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,330
Only by this can you run away.

504
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,730
Fang Xuanling.

505
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,550
Tell Fang Xuanling,

506
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,899
it's my business. I'll try to think of a way it on my own.

507
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,280
He doesn't need to have pity on me.

508
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,650
I don't want to owe him anything.

509
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,989
 The only thing that can dispel her misgivings 

510
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:23,290
 is your sisterhood since little. 

511
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:28,460
 The only one who can save Changge is actually you. 

512
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,750
Changge, this is the amulet that I had prayed for you recently.

513
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,230
Wear it on you.

514
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,490
Then you'll definitely be safe.

515
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,070
Amulet?

516
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:52,049
The people of Prince Qin Manor killed everyone in our East Palace.

517
00:36:52,049 --> 00:36:54,920
Your father killed my mother and father.

518
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,520
Now you want me to be safe?

519
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,369
I'm sorry, Changge. I didn't know that.

520
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:11,699
I...

521
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,859
I'm sorry.

522
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,630
Princess Yongan,

523
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:21,070
from now on, we two are foes and absolutely irreconcilable.

524
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,640
Changge...

525
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:38,360
We have been best sisters since childhood.

526
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,360
Changge.

527
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,920
Sisters?

528
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:51,839
How can I be sisters with the daughter of the man that murdered my father?

529
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,490
I'll count down from three.

530
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,120
Leave here now.

531
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,600
Otherwise, don't blame me for being cold-blooded.

532
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,780
Three.

533
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:11,430
Two.

534
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,910
One.

535
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:25,250
Changge, I don't believe you really want me to leave.

536
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:30,160
If my death can relieve your hatred for my father,

537
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,699
I won't regret it.

538
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,710
Changge.

539
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,160
Yueyan.

540
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,920
Sorry.

541
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,119
Princess, why don't you say anything?

542
00:39:30,129 --> 00:39:33,410
Is it because Mr. Fang's strategy didn't work?

543
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,400
 His Majesty asked me to send the seal of the crown prince here, 

544
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,590
 Your Highness. 

545
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,589
Anything abnormal?

546
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:41,459
Princess Yongan was here with some food.

547
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,179
I have checked. Nothing abnormal.

548
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:44,109
Princess Yongan?

549
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,510
Right.

550
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,789
Princess?

551
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,349
- Guards. 
 - Yes.

552
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:01,449
Lockdown Hongyi Palace.

553
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:02,649
The rest go after her with me.

554
00:41:02,649 --> 00:41:04,050
 Yes! 

555
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,280
Princess. Princess!

556
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,140
Princess!

557
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,790
Call the imperial doctor.

558
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:21,359
Your Highness, Li Changge is serious trouble of Great Tang.

559
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,269
Your Highness,

560
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:26,099
we found the princess' maidservant knocked unconscious outside of the study.

561
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:27,970
The study?

562
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:30,189
Hurry. Back to the study.

563
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,280
Keming, it's gone.

564
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:47,449
Guards, you have to catch Li Changge.

565
00:41:47,449 --> 00:41:48,860
Yes.

566
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,290
Go!

567
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:14,030
