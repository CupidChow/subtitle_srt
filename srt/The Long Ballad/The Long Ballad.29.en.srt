00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,840
(The Long Ballad)

2
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,040
(This is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,239
(Episode 29)

4
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,439
Well...

5
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,920
This guy is pretty tough.

6
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,000
Everyone. Keep fighting!

7
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,400
He's crashing.

8
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
A bet is a bet.

9
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,079
You won.

10
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,919
You guys are better than I thought.

11
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,919
You won already.

12
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,719
There's no need to mock us.

13
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,560
If we can really fight,

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,680
why must Governor Gongsun sacrifice his life?

15
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,240
Gongsun Heng was a hero.

16
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
What do you know?

17
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,530
I'm just...

18
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,520
I'm just envious.

19
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,759
You risked your lives in fighting with him.

20
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,879
It was worth it.

21
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,319
Why are you laughing?

22
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,400
At that time,

23
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,479
I drank like this with Chang Ge,

24
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,319
and we became friends.

25
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,759
Friends?

26
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:17,159
You're from the grasslands,

27
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,039
and you call Commandant Li your friend?

28
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,039
Can't I do that?

29
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,919
You're quite interesting.

30
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,599
Come on, let's drink.

31
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
Hey.

32
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,199
Don't you want some?

33
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,240
Tell someone to clean up.

34
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,319
Otherwise, the restaurant will chase us out.

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,680
- Drink up. - Here.

36
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,610
- Place this here. - All right.

37
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:34,360
Come with me over there.

38
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,279
Your Highness.

39
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,560
Mr. Wei, you're here.

40
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,759
Look.

41
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:45,920
This place is grand.

42
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:48,240
I can immediately tell...

43
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,610
that once you light up the candles this way in this palace,

44
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:52,199
it will be better than all the palaces in Chang'an.

45
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,399
Your Highness.

46
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,610
It's past curfew time.

47
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,730
How can you do such a ridiculous thing?

48
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:58,879
That's right.

49
00:04:58,879 --> 00:04:59,879
There's a curfew.

50
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:01,319
Then on this main road,

51
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,050
aren't there any structures with lights on?

52
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,319
Your Highness.

53
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:06,399
The curfew has always been imposed.

54
00:05:06,519 --> 00:05:07,680
When inspecting Luoyang,

55
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,610
you must not give others a hold on you.

56
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,639
As long as you don't tell anyone, who would know?

57
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,560
Is my father clairvoyant?

58
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,000
Can he see these things?

59
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,610
Have you ever wondered...

60
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:21,519
how many people can see what's going on here with these lights?

61
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:22,800
It's not just me.

62
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:24,399
Your Highness,

63
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,879
how many impeachment papers do you want His Majesty to receive?

64
00:05:25,879 --> 00:05:27,279
That's enough.

65
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,000
As long as you don't tell on me,

66
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,720
who would have time to care about this?

67
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,000
(Best in the world)

68
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,079
It's just a curfew.

69
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,839
Everywhere else in Luoyang has a curfew.

70
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Besides,

71
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,360
am I not lighting these candles all night...

72
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,000
to seek blessing for the refugees?

73
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,399
From now on,

74
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,199
the Ziwei Palace will become Luoyang's Nightless Palace.

75
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,720
Your Highness...

76
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,920
(Best in the world)

77
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,839
(Luoyang Office)

78
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,279
Your Highness.

79
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:07,319
What if...

80
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:09,360
we inform Mr. Hao?

81
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,160
If he finds out that I let you go out alone,

82
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,160
he'll kill me.

83
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,240
Mr. Hao looks scary,

84
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,399
but he won't eat you.

85
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:18,439
What are you afraid of?

86
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,720
Just tell him that I went to South Mountain.

87
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,920
He won't ask any questions for a while.

88
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,040
I'll return as soon as I can.

89
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:26,439
Your Highness.

90
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:28,279
- Your Highness... - Just do as I say.

91
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,720
Your Highness is planning to go to South Mountain again?

92
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
Mr. Hao.

93
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,519
Her Highness just wants you...

94
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,199
to go with her to the market.

95
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,920
She's been in Luoyang for so long,

96
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,000
and she's been busy with Crown Prince's affairs.

97
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,120
She never had a chance to walk around yet.

98
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,279
Your Highness, aren't you going out?

99
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
Come on.

100
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:32,319
He's used to bribing kids, right?

101
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,759
Yuan Niang likes him so much.

102
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:36,360
News of Young Master...

103
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,480
ended in Luoyang.

104
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,800
Mr. Qin is also very sad.

105
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,399
Yuan Niang may be a child,

106
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,639
but she's sensible.

107
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,959
Is Mr. Qin the one playing with her,

108
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,920
or is Yuan Niang the one trying to cheer him up?

109
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,720
We really can't be sure.

110
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,120
Petty man.

111
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,759
Who are you talking about?

112
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,360
You're jealous.

113
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,600
I'm not.

114
00:07:58,759 --> 00:07:59,759
You want to fight again?

115
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,360
- Nice! - Nice!

116
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,160
- Great! - Great!

117
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,319
- I want to go over there. - All right.

118
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
- Amazing! - Great!

119
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,199
- Wonderful! - Marvelous!

120
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Splendid.

121
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,720
I want to see that.

122
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Umbrellas!

123
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,639
Umbrellas for sale!

124
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,159
- I want one too. - Give me one.

125
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,450
- Give me one. - I want one.

126
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,679
- Give me one. - Stop pushing!

127
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,799
- Don't push me! - Hao Du.

128
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,360
- Look at this shop. - I want one.

129
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:54,559
There are so many people.

130
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,120
- It must be delicious. - I want one too.

131
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,279
I want one more.

132
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:01,399
- Two. - There are too many people.

133
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,759
- I can't squeeze in. - I want one too.

134
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,559
- Why don't you buy some for me? - I want one.

135
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:05,960
Make way.

136
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,559
- Stop pushing. - Hey...

137
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:08,600
Stop pushing.

138
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,960
I want one too.

139
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,210
- What the heck? - All right.

140
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,450
- Stay here then. - Give me one.

141
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:14,090
- Don't go away. - I want one.

142
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,210
- I want another one. - Wait.

143
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,210
Sir, is it ready?

144
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,559
Use the money here.

145
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,559
I can afford this.

146
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:21,559
- Is it ready? - My goodness.

147
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:23,519
Your Highness.

148
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,360
Is it ready, sir?

149
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,330
Are there more?

150
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
Give me some.

151
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Which flavor do you want?

152
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,960
- Something sweet. - Sir, is it ready?

153
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,279
- I want one too. - Hurry up.

154
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,039
- I'm ordering two more here. - Excuse me.

155
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,039
Excuse me.

156
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,799
Chang Ge.

157
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,120
There are a lot of people here. Let's talk somewhere else.

158
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,519
Le Yan.

159
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,559
You've really changed.

160
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,799
In the past,

161
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,200
how would you dare to come out this way?

162
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,480
You always make fun of me.

163
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,639
I'm not making fun of you.

164
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,480
I'm happy for you.

165
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,639
In the past,

166
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:20,480
you've always liked hiding behind people.

167
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,600
You were so timid.

168
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,919
You needed protection.

169
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,879
You're not that way anymore.

170
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:26,840
I found something I want to do.

171
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,639
I want to be Tang's princess.

172
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:31,240
Tang's real princess.

173
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,799
I don't want to see citizens starve.

174
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:37,600
I don't want to see kids go hungry anymore.

175
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,799
I want to be like you,

176
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,039
and be an upright woman.

177
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,240
Le Yan.

178
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,679
You've really changed.

179
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:50,240
Someone once told me,

180
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,799
"I'm a man."

181
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,440
"I can go anywhere."

182
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,039
But I'm a woman, and I can do the same.

183
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,519
So whether you're the Li Le Yan who likes bunnies,

184
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,000
or the Li Le Yan who wants to become Tang's princess,

185
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,440
you can be...

186
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,159
whoever you want to be.

187
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,600
- I want one too. - Don't push me.

188
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,960
Stop pushing.

189
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,240
Are my two orders ready?

190
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,360
- I'll have two. - Your Highness.

191
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:20,759
Le Yan!

192
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,480
- Stop pushing. - Don't push me.

193
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:23,840
Is it ready, sir?

194
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,279
Along the way,

195
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,639
I experienced a lot of things.

196
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,879
I always think that when I see you,

197
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:40,039
I'd surely hug you and bawl like a baby.

198
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,320
Thinking back now,

199
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,679
I don't think they were such a big deal.

200
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:46,960
Yes.

201
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,200
We're all grown up now.

202
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,480
Chang Ge.

203
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,080
Where do you live?

204
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:57,399
How am I supposed to find you now?

205
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,960
I live in Liuyun Abbey.

206
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,039
But you don't have to go out of your way to find me.

207
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,960
Sometimes, I come to South Mountain too.

208
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,639
That means...

209
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,759
we can meet again.

210
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,159
By the way, Chang Ge,

211
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:10,960
Hao Du is in town these days.

212
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,159
You must take care of yourself.

213
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,360
If he sees you, he'll surely hunt you down.

214
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:19,919
Right, Hao Du. I...

215
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,919
Chang Ge, I have to go now.

216
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:23,080
Take care.

217
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,120
Watch it.

218
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,279
My goodness.

219
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:22,159
I...

220
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,840
Just now, I saw...

221
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,559
someone selling sugar figurines,

222
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:26,960
and I craved it,

223
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,320
so I bought one.

224
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,919
I didn't mean to leave.

225
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:33,320
I know that I was wrong.

226
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,559
I'm sorry.

227
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,480
I won't do it again.

228
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,679
You can have the sugar figurine.

229
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:59,279
I...

230
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,360
I thought I lost you.

231
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:03,559
You won't.

232
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I...

233
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,360
You said you'd give this to me.

234
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:27,200
You're not angry anymore?

235
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,519
Hao Du.

236
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,759
Actually, you're not as fierce as you look.

237
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,879
Am I right?

238
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Hao Du.

239
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,000
Where are the pastries you bought for me?

240
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,720
- I ate them. - You ate them?

241
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,399
I didn't tell you to eat them.

242
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,279
You didn't even leave a single one?

243
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,399
I'm asking you a question.

244
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:51,879
Hao Du.

245
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:53,639
Hao Du.

246
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,399
Minister Du.

247
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,039
- Greetings, Your Highness. - Minister Du.

248
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:08,159
Why are you here?

249
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:09,519
We received a message in Chang'an...

250
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,480
that you've already arrived in Luoyang.

251
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,120
But His Majesty is still worried about you.

252
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,840
So I must personally come to see you.

253
00:16:17,799 --> 00:16:20,120
Seeing that you're safe and sound...

254
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:24,919
You are...

255
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,639
His Majesty can finally feel at ease.

256
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,639
I'm fine.

257
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,960
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

258
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
It's late.

259
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,440
Your Highness, please get some rest.

260
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,440
You didn't let His Majesty down.

261
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,559
You found Her Highness.

262
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:57,440
I can feel at ease.

263
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,080
Godfather.

264
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,440
It's been a while since we saw each other.

265
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:02,639
Your health...

266
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:03,639
I'm old.

267
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:05,240
I get sick easily.

268
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
It's all right.

269
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,519
Put your stuff away...

270
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:09,759
and come to the main hall.

271
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:12,079
- I want to talk to you. - Yes.

272
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,559
(Luoyang Office)

273
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:38,359
Godfather.

274
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,119
You didn't come to Luoyang...

275
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,680
just to see Her Highness, right?

276
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,920
I have some personal matters to take care of.

277
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,759
Tell me...

278
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:47,599
what exactly happened to Her Highness.

279
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,039
I only found Her Highness after arriving in Luoyang.

280
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,119
She suffered a lot.

281
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,440
She walked all the way from the border to Luoyang.

282
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,890
It's good that we found her.

283
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,410
Luoyang is not a peaceful place.

284
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,440
Leave tomorrow morning.

285
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,240
Escort Her Highness back to Chang'an.

286
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,920
What's the matter?

287
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,200
Is there a problem?

288
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:10,759
No.

289
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:12,319
But...

290
00:18:13,079 --> 00:18:14,079
Tell me.

291
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:15,480
Stop beating around the bush.

292
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:17,960
Instead of taking Her Highness back to Chang'an,

293
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,960
why don't we let her stay in Luoyang for now...

294
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,200
to comfort the people?

295
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:22,720
With Her Highness here,

296
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,759
she can at least control Crown Prince.

297
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:28,079
What's wrong with His Highness?

298
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,440
His Highness...

299
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,000
has been ill.

300
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,650
Her Highness is personally performing...

301
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,410
all disaster relief efforts.

302
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,480
The citizens trust her more.

303
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,119
For the stability of Luoyang,

304
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,920
please let her stay in Luoyang...

305
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:45,519
and do what she likes to do.

306
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,920
I will stay by her side at all times.

307
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,200
I won't let anything happen to her.

308
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,410
Hao Du.

309
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:56,920
You're very concerned about Her Highness.

310
00:18:57,359 --> 00:18:58,359
Of course.

311
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,799
She's the princess after all.

312
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,890
Just because she is the princess?

313
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:08,039
When I was your age,

314
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,650
I couldn't think straight either.

315
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,519
I couldn't read people,

316
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:15,799
and I couldn't even figure out my own feelings.

317
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:17,319
Godfather.

318
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,759
- No... - You don't have to explain.

319
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:21,890
You don't have to explain...

320
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,410
your affairs.

321
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,920
Have some tea.

322
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,039
Is it because she's the princess,

323
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,559
or is it because she's Le Yan?

324
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,200
What exactly am I thinking?

325
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,279
Nice.

326
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,559
Great!

327
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:43,079
Come.

328
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Here.

329
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
You.

330
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,650
It's you.

331
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:02,200
Your Highness, we meet again.

332
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:07,119
Your Highness.

333
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,119
Mr. Wei is here again.

334
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:10,759
I'm catching up with an old friend.

335
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:12,000
What is he doing here?

336
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,920
I won't keep you.

337
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,240
I'll get going.

338
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,410
Don't go!

339
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,240
Your Highness!

340
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Your Highness.

341
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
I know.

342
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,279
I already know.

343
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:29,519
Your Highness.

344
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,079
If you really have nothing better to do,

345
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,039
go to South Mountain and help my sister.

346
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,279
You're a man,

347
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,680
and you're letting my sister do the work in South Mountain alone.

348
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,079
I'm so ashamed of you.

349
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:42,079
Your Highness...

350
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,079
Madam.

351
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:06,720
Greetings, Madam.

352
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
Madam.

353
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,240
This came from Ziwei Palace earlier.

354
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,799
(Poem)

355
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:02,799
("The Wind and the Rain")

356
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,920
"Since I've already seen you,"

357
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,200
"how can I not be happy?"

358
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:12,880
It seems like...

359
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,039
positioning Sheng Xin here...

360
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:17,119
is right.

361
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Cui Tong.

362
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,640
Yes.

363
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,559
The eastern capital of Luoyang...

364
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,640
is very dry.

365
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:26,920
I'm afraid...

366
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,000
there's going to be a fire.

367
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:31,680
Yes, Madam.

368
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
Silly girl.

369
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,000
You can't keep coming out so often.

370
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:46,799
It's fine.

371
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,279
Hao Du wouldn't know.

372
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:53,119
Chang Ge.

373
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,400
Minister Du is in Luoyang.

374
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:58,279
You must be careful when you go out lately.

375
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,279
I don't think you should come out.

376
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,240
Just stay at Liuyun Abbey.

377
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,119
I couldn't do anything about the past.

378
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:09,680
But from now on,

379
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,279
I'll do my best...

380
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,480
to protect you.

381
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,079
I'll take good care of myself.

382
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:20,839
You should do the same.

383
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,079
Here, slowly.

384
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,000
Take it slow.

385
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:34,319
Thank you, miss.

386
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,640
You still need to rest.

387
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:06,400
Your injury must be treated immediately.

388
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,839
- All right. - Try it, ma'am.

389
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,720
This shouldn't be in your way.

390
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,119
Thank you.

391
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,160
I'm fine now.

392
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,000
They all say that you're an important person from Chang'an.

393
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:20,240
You don't seem to be an important person.

394
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,599
You're the Living Buddha.

395
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:24,200
My dear, she's a princess.

396
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,680
She's not just an important person.

397
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,359
God is really blessing Tang.

398
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,079
Her Highness is so kind.

399
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:32,480
- She's the reincarnation of Buddha. - There's no need for this.

400
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:34,960
People are saying...

401
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,000
that the people in Liuyun Abbey are good.

402
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,559
There's a living Buddha here.

403
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:40,599
- Yes. Right. - Am I right?

404
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,559
Yes.

405
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,680
With regards to the important people who came to inspect Luoyang,

406
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,680
we just haven't seen...

407
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,720
Crown Prince's yet.

408
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,319
Actually, His Highness...

409
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,559
cares about all of you.

410
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,400
That's why he asked me to look after you all.

411
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,440
No wonder everyone is saying...

412
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,799
that His Highness is in seclusion in Ziwei Palace,

413
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,559
and the candles are lit up all night.

414
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,599
It turns out that he's praying for us.

415
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:11,640
Ziwei Palace is a palace from Sui Dynasty.

416
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,359
How is he praying for us?

417
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:15,200
He's praying anyhow.

418
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,079
- Am I right? - Right.

419
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:19,319
- It must be for our own good. - It must be for our own good.

420
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,680
Thank you, Living Buddha.

421
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:31,039
Madam Quan.

422
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,359
What are you doing?

423
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,279
Rumors are spreading everywhere today...

424
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:35,799
that there's an abnormal phenomenon.

425
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:37,759
Fire will surely occur in Luoyang within three days.

426
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:39,160
Even if it's just a rumor,

427
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,279
there are many people here.

428
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:41,440
We must take precautions.

429
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:47,519
Chang Ge.

430
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:50,200
Madam Quan mentioned a fire earlier.

431
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,599
Don't worry too much.

432
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:53,279
That is just a rumor going around.

433
00:26:56,839 --> 00:26:59,440
The refugees left their hometowns.

434
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:02,279
They have an unowned wasteland to farm now.

435
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,599
That can be their livelihood.

436
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,000
It's not a wasteland.

437
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,240
It's Liuyun Abbey's farm.

438
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:13,240
Those wealthy people in Luoyang...

439
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,559
are all worried about the refugees' backgrounds.

440
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:16,920
They don't dare to let them farm.

441
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,799
But Abbess isn't afraid.

442
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,160
Not only is she letting them farm the land,

443
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,279
she even gave them food...

444
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,319
and grains.

445
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,039
Abbess is really the Living Buddha of Luoyang.

446
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Chang Ge.

447
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,440
Shu Yu.

448
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,559
After we parted in Wei River,

449
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,640
how have you been?

450
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,240
I'm good.

451
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,759
All is good.

452
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:03,640
As long as you're fine, all is good.

453
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,279
When did you come back?

454
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:07,720
Why didn't you tell me?

455
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,240
Yan Er...

456
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,000
Why are you with Yan Er?

457
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
After we parted in Wei River,

458
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,839
where did you go?

459
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:15,240
- Also... - Wei Shu Yu.

460
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,960
You're asking too many questions.

461
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:20,359
All right.

462
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,480
I'll stop asking.

463
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,319
I won't ask anything anymore.

464
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,559
All is good as long as you're safe and sound.

465
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,119
This time,

466
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,079
you won't leave again, right?

467
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,240
I don't know.

468
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,880
This isn't my home.

469
00:28:34,119 --> 00:28:35,559
I have nowhere to return to either.

470
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,680
You can go back.

471
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,000
After we're done with the work here in Luoyang,

472
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,359
let's return to Chang'an together.

473
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:43,920
You, me, and Yan Er...

474
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,440
can go back to how we were before,

475
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,480
Chang Ge.

476
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,759
Li Chang Ge is already dead.

477
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,400
You can call me Li.

478
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,000
Regardless of whether your name is Li...

479
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,119
or whatever it is,

480
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:04,079
you'll always be my Chang Ge.

481
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,240
After everything that happened,

482
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,680
seeing you two always together...

483
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,519
and taking care of each other just like before...

484
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:12,039
makes me feel happy for you.

485
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:14,960
Chang...

486
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,680
Li.

487
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:21,079
Can I have a few words with you alone?

488
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,400
I still have a lot of refugees to take care of.

489
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,960
I can't chat with you anymore.

490
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,599
Since you came with Crown Prince,

491
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,359
you must have a lot to do.

492
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
But...

493
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:31,599
Anyway,

494
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:34,039
I can't leave Luoyang for the time being.

495
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:36,279
Leave with Le Yan first.

496
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,119
In the future, if you want to catch up,

497
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:40,240
we'll have plenty of chances.

498
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:58,119
Abbess.

499
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,759
Rumors are abounding in South Mountain, Luoyang.

500
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,000
They say that there will be a fire within three days.

501
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,200
But I'm worried...

502
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,839
that the refugees are a mix of crooked and honest folks.

503
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:07,519
If someone is up to no good...

504
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:08,799
and intentionally creates trouble,

505
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:10,519
I'm afraid it won't be good for Liuyun Abbey.

506
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,920
Please come up with a plan soon.

507
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:14,599
Don't worry.

508
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,640
Everything has its own destiny.

509
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,640
As long as you're confident, Abbess.

510
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,200
No.

511
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,759
I'm not confident.

512
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
Li.

513
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:27,759
Even with this pond of fishes,

514
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:29,559
I wouldn't dare to say...

515
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:32,400
that I'm confident about their thoughts and actions,

516
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:33,960
let alone humans.

517
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,480
You can plan carefully with every possibility taken into account.

518
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,720
You can also plan to guarantee that there's no chance of failing.

519
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:41,960
Those calculations are just techniques.

520
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,079
Our path is the basis.

521
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,440
What path are you referring to?

522
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,480
If you can save someone in front of you,

523
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,000
how can I not save him?

524
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,319
If there are consequences to saving him,

525
00:30:54,039 --> 00:30:55,599
so what?

526
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,440
There's no other way in this path.

527
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,759
Follow your heart,

528
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:10,200
and just suffer the consequences.

529
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,519
In this world,

530
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,680
who isn't the same way?

531
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,920
(Luoyang Office)

532
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:40,839
Shu Yu.

533
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:45,160
Shu Yu.

534
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,079
What are you thinking about?

535
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,160
Nothing.

536
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:51,599
By the way,

537
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:53,880
Crown Prince is having fun in Ziwei Palace every day.

538
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:55,920
At this rate, there will be trouble.

539
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,279
My little brother...

540
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:59,400
is too spoiled.

541
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,960
If there's no other way...

542
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:03,960
If there's no other way, tell Minister Du.

543
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,319
He's usually most scared of those men around Father.

544
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,240
Currently,

545
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:12,079
the South Mountain refugees are starting to talk about it too.

546
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:14,240
If he continues to be naughty,

547
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:15,839
what should we do?

548
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,359
Chang Ge also knows...

549
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:19,720
that Crown Prince is here in Luoyang?

550
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:23,400
You're worried that Chang Ge will do something?

551
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,400
You don't trust Chang Ge?

552
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:29,039
I guarantee.

553
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,960
Chang Ge won't do anything stupid.

554
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,359
I trust her.

555
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:49,279
Your Highness.

556
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:50,960
You found him?

557
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,720
Your Highness.

558
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,440
He said...

559
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,200
He said that you must recognize him first.

560
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,400
That's how he'd be willing...

561
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:01,160
to see you.

562
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,720
Fine.

563
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,119
All right.

564
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,880
Interesting.

565
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,720
And the rules? What are the rules?

566
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,119
First, don't go near him.

567
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:21,279
Second, don't talk to him.

568
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,160
The rest is up to Your Highness.

569
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,960
Don't go near him?

570
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,839
Come on. Do this.

571
00:33:31,839 --> 00:33:34,319
All of you, do this and let me see.

572
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:35,559
- Yes. - Yes.

573
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
Do it.

574
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:11,769
You. It's you.

575
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,880
It's you.

576
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,000
Your Highness is very meticulous.

577
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,289
Greetings, Your Highness.

578
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:26,440
Rise.

579
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Great.

580
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:30,719
I am going to keep you here.

581
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:33,079
Then, Your Highness,

582
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:35,440
let us all stay here.

583
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,329
The more, the merrier.

584
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,480
You're right.

585
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,599
All right. All of you can stay.

586
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:44,639
- Thank you, Your Highness. - Thank you, Your Highness.

587
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,480
Minister Du.

588
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,599
(The city's eastern part...)

589
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:57,599
(Yucai Workshop in the southern or northern streets)

590
00:34:57,769 --> 00:34:58,769
Thank you.

591
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,199
Minister Du, you want to see Mr. Li,

592
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:03,519
but he might not be home.

593
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,559
He's not in Luoyang?

594
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:06,719
He is,

595
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:08,960
but he might be at a tea house in the western part.

596
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,960
Or he could be at a wine shop in the southern part.

597
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,960
He can be anywhere in Luoyang.

598
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:15,960
He just might not be home.

599
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:19,400
He's here in Luoyang, but he never goes home?

600
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,289
It's hard to say during the curfew.

601
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:24,639
I heard that he married a really tough woman.

602
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:26,239
He's hiding from her all day long.

603
00:35:32,769 --> 00:35:33,769
Minister Du.

604
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:36,639
Mr. Wei.

605
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:37,960
You're in such a hurry.

606
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,039
Did something happen?

607
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,039
Minister Du.

608
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:41,599
I have already distributed...

609
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,559
all the supplies for disaster relief that I brought from the capital.

610
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:45,159
Now, Luoyang's situation is improving.

611
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,199
It's just that...

612
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,119
Just tell me.

613
00:35:49,809 --> 00:35:52,119
It's just that since Crown Prince moved into Ziwei Palace,

614
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:53,440
he never showed his face again.

615
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,400
Princess Yong'an is the one arranging everything.

616
00:35:56,079 --> 00:35:57,679
The citizens are already commenting about it.

617
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,920
And...

618
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:01,880
And Crown Prince...

619
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,480
has been hanging out with a circus group all day.

620
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,960
How ridiculous.

621
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:27,199
Your Highness.

622
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,960
Your Highness!

623
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,960
Your Highness.

624
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,480
Your Highness.

625
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,480
- Are you all right? - I'm fine.

626
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:42,960
How are you doing, Sheng Xin?

627
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,769
It's good that you're safe, Your Highness.

628
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,289
It's a shame that the Imperial Diarist isn't here.

629
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:55,119
I can't believe that this scene where a citizen was hurt...

630
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,440
and His Highness feels so bad for him...

631
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,809
can't be known by His Majesty.

632
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,840
Minister Du.

633
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,719
My father is busy.

634
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:08,079
He doesn't need to know...

635
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,199
about such a trivial matter.

636
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:11,840
Rumors are abounding...

637
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:13,599
that all day and all night,

638
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,559
Your Highness is so engrossed in this nightless Ziwei Palace.

639
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:16,960
At this rate,

640
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,000
even if His Majesty doesn't want to know,

641
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,199
he'll also find out.

642
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:22,960
Minister Du, I am truly grateful...

643
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,289
for your criticism.

644
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:25,769
Thank you, Minister Du.

645
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,360
He is my friend from Luoyang.

646
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,639
If you have any complaints,

647
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:35,559
I'll just tell him...

648
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:37,000
to go back where he came from.

649
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:41,920
Take care, Your Highness.

650
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:48,880
Your Highness.

651
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,239
If you want me to go,

652
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,039
I'll leave.

653
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,840
"Since I've already seen you, how can I not be happy?"

654
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,880
I am able to see...

655
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:00,920
a brilliant man like you once in my life.

656
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:03,519
I don't have any regrets anymore.

657
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,079
Hey.

658
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,769
I told Minister Du...

659
00:38:12,769 --> 00:38:15,039
that I'll let you go back where you came from.

660
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:17,960
But you are a child entertainer in Chang'an's Taichang Temple.

661
00:38:18,769 --> 00:38:19,920
If you don't return with me,

662
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:21,289
where will you go?

663
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,769
Thank you, Your Highness.

664
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,400
We've searched this place.

665
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,880
And then here.

666
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:39,329
Where's Ashina Sun?

667
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:40,599
Are we not looking for Chang Ge?

668
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:42,159
He went out before sunrise.

669
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,000
He has a map of Luoyang.

670
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,119
He crosses out each area he has searched.

671
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:47,679
He performs a search all over again after he has searched everywhere.

672
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,769
With his arbitrary searching method,

673
00:38:49,769 --> 00:38:51,119
it would be strange if he found her.

674
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:53,679
He must still rely on us at crucial times.

675
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,039
I'm sorry.

676
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,480
My hand slipped.

677
00:39:06,809 --> 00:39:07,809
Little rascal.

678
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:09,880
Wait for some good news from me.

679
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,920
Come on.

680
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,679
(Extremely noble)

681
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:32,679
(Liuyun Abbey)

682
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:45,769
Li, did you like the food today?

683
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,400
Li, you stay inside the abbey all day.

684
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,599
It won't do you any good.

685
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:52,920
Go and buy some wound medicine with me.

686
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,289
Treat it as exercise.

687
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:56,639
I think it's good to stay inside the abbey.

688
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,039
It can cultivate one's body and mind.

689
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,440
As long as you think it's good, Li.

690
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,639
That's more like it.

691
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:12,239
Li, sit properly.

692
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:13,719
- All right. - Li?

693
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,599
(Liuyun Abbey)

694
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,199
(Liuyun Abbey)

695
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,920
Don't be so petty.

696
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,039
Do you know what I found out today?

697
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:50,519
I feel a bit tired after walking around all day.

698
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,159
This is what we'll do. Massage my legs,

699
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,400
and I'll tell you.

700
00:40:56,039 --> 00:40:57,599
What's the matter? You don't want to?

701
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,400
You're not shy at all.

702
00:40:59,769 --> 00:41:01,119
We rented this place.

703
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,840
We're the ones searching for news too.

704
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:04,039
Aren't you too...

705
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:08,079
If I chop off your legs,

706
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:09,809
you won't feel tired.

707
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,920
Did you find any clues?

708
00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:16,329
I'll let this slide.

709
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,079
I do have a clue.

710
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,159
They say that there's a master named Sun Si Miao...

711
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:22,679
who came from the grasslands to Luoyang.

712
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:24,119
Some say that he put in a lot of effort...

713
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,360
to save a lady.

714
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:28,920
Isn't Commandant Li a lady?

715
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:32,239
What else?

716
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,480
Why aren't you surprised?

717
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:36,329
I thought you didn't know.

718
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:37,719
Cut the crap.

719
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:39,039
What else do you know?

720
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:41,159
We're not sure about Sun Si Miao's whereabouts.

721
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,239
All we know is that he treats refugees.

722
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:45,440
But we're not exactly sure where he is.

723
00:41:46,329 --> 00:41:48,159
Is there a place in Luoyang that takes in refugees?

724
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:50,119
I think there's one at South Mountain...

725
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:51,809
called Liuyun Abbey.

726
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,840
Liuyun Abbey?

727
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:12,719
Why is he leaving again?

728
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:32,119
Is anyone here?

729
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:34,719
(Liuyun Abbey)

730
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,880
Sir.

731
00:42:37,199 --> 00:42:38,599
We're closed for the day.

732
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:41,039
If it's not an urgent illness, come again another day.

733
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:42,329
Can you make an exception?

734
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:43,559
I'm looking for someone.

735
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:45,199
Do you have someone here by the name of Li Chang Ge...

736
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:46,679
or Li Shi Si?

737
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:47,880
Li Chang Ge?

738
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,769
There's no one by that name here.

739
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:51,960
You came to the wrong place.

740
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,199
Please leave now.

741
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:55,039
What about Sun Si Miao? Is there such a person?

742
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:57,039
How can you call Master Sun's name directly?

743
00:42:57,039 --> 00:42:58,289
Yes, Master Sun.

744
00:42:58,559 --> 00:42:59,679
Did he save a woman?

745
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:01,639
Master Sun saved countless people,

746
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:02,880
not just one woman.

747
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,920
I'm sorry.

748
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:07,329
- Chang Ge! - How can you just barge in?

749
00:43:07,329 --> 00:43:08,400
I'll scream for help.

750
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:14,679
Chang Ge!

751
00:43:17,239 --> 00:43:18,239
Chang Ge.

752
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:19,920
Chang Ge.

753
00:43:26,289 --> 00:43:27,289
Chang Ge!

754
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Chang Ge!

755
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:49,159
(Inaction)

756
