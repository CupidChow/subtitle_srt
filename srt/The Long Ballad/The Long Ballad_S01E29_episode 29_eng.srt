00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,999
♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,959
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,930
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,770
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:24,950
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,820
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,689
♫   Tears and regrets go hand in hand   ♫

8
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:34,589
♫  But my heart is still fiery-hot  ♫

00:00:34,589 --> 00:00:37,639
♫  To the distance  ♫

10
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:40,709
♫  The miserable past is like a dagger  ♫

11
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:43,620
♫  Though my wings are broken  ♫

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,940

♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,360
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,309
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,269
♫  The river of life is under my feet  ♫

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,060
♫  I don't regret my craziness  ♫

20
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:32,479
   

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,260
   

22
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:48,465
Well, he's really strong.

23
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:50,322
Come on, buddies!

24
00:01:50,322 --> 00:01:51,555
We have nearly defeated him!

25
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:53,055
A bet is a bet.

26
00:01:53,055 --> 00:01:54,890
You win.

27
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,230
You're more powerful than I thought.

28
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:19,232
You're now the winner.

29
00:02:19,232 --> 00:02:21,011
You don't need to taunt us.

30
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:22,865
If we had been powerful,

31
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:27,060
why would our governor have sacrificed himself?

32
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,399
Gongsun Heng is a hero.

33
00:02:33,399 --> 00:02:35,510
You know nothing!

34
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:45,310
I just... I just envy him

35
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:50,033
for having brothers like you to fight for him.

36
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:51,800
His sacrifice is worthwhile.

37
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:09,344
Why are you laughing?

38
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:13,279
At that time, I was drinking with Changge like this.

39
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,776
We later became brothers.

40
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,287
Brothers?

41
00:03:16,288 --> 00:03:19,255
You as a grassland person, how can you be her brother?

42
00:03:19,255 --> 00:03:21,140
Can't I?

43
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:26,322
You're really an interesting guy.

44
00:03:26,322 --> 00:03:28,590
Come on. Let's drink!

45
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,340
Don't you drink?

46
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,611
Ask someone to clean up here;

47
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:55,100
otherwise, we might be driven away.

48
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,022
 Cheers! 

49
00:03:56,022 --> 00:03:57,470
 Come on! 

50
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:29,940
   

51
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,000
Just set it here.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,600
Okay.

53
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,380
Come with me.

54
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,219
Your Highness.

55
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:43,976
Young Master Wei, you're here.

56
00:04:43,976 --> 00:04:46,322
See. It's grand here.

57
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:48,376
When I saw the palace,

58
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:49,819
I knew that, as long as it was lightened,

59
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:52,539
even the palaces in Chang'an would be overshadowed.

60
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:54,779
Your Highness, the curfew is in force,

61
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:58,032
so how could you do such an absurd thing?

62
00:04:58,032 --> 00:05:00,476
Oh, yes. There's a curfew here.

63
00:05:00,476 --> 00:05:03,589
So there are no high buildings with lights along this road, right?

64
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:06,476
Your Highness, it's the routine.

65
00:05:06,476 --> 00:05:10,650
Please do not let others get the goods on you.

66
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,032
If you keep it secret, who else knows it?

67
00:05:13,032 --> 00:05:17,330
Can Father monitor me far from here?

68
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,739
Have you thought...

69
00:05:18,739 --> 00:05:21,622
about how many people would notice the brilliant lights here?

70
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,449
Would they all keep it a secret?

71
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:26,066
Do you want to be impeached by the officials?

72
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:27,799
It's enough!

73
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:31,965
As long as you can keep it secret, nobody else will care about it!

74
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,769
Curfew...

75
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:37,419
The rest of Luoyang is all under curfew.

76
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,438
By the way, what I've done

77
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:41,230
is all to pray for the refugees.

78
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:51,020
    
 From now on, Ziwei Palace will be out of the darkness.

79
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,720
Your Highness...

80
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:04,740
   

81
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,779
Princess, what about telling Young Master Hao first?

82
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:12,500
If he finds out that I let you leave alone,

83
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,640
he might kill me.

84
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,710
He looks scary, but he won't hurt you. What are you afraid of?

85
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,911
Just tell him I've gone to South Hill

86
00:06:20,911 --> 00:06:23,221
and he won't press about it.

87
00:06:23,222 --> 00:06:25,709
I'll make an early return.

88
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,810
Princess!

89
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,220
Do what I've told you.

90
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,850
Are you going to South Hill again?

91
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,569
Young Master Hao, she hopes you can accompany her to the streets and markets.

92
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:54,129
Though she's been in Luoyang for a while,

93
00:06:54,129 --> 00:06:56,510
she has no time to wander around here

94
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,230
for worrying about the crown prince.

95
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:09,089
Weren't you going to walk around?

96
00:07:09,089 --> 00:07:10,740
Let's go.

97
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,654
Is he an old hand at flattering kids?

98
00:07:32,654 --> 00:07:35,290
Yuan really likes him.

99
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,760
We fail to get Young Master's news as we're in Luoyang.

100
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,899
Young Master Qin might be sad about it.

101
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:42,899
Though Yuan is a kid, she's sensible.

102
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:45,110
We're not sure about whether

103
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,770
Young Master Qin plays with her or if Yuan makes him happy?

104
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,255
Miser.

105
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:55,343
Whom are you calling?

106
00:07:55,343 --> 00:07:56,533
You're envying him.

107
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:58,790
I'm not.

108
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,360
Need another fight.

109
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,980
 Good! 

110
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,320
 Pretty nice! 

111
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,930
I want to go there.

112
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,739
- Okay. 
  - Awesome! 

113
00:08:11,739 --> 00:08:13,709
 Once again! 

114
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,810
 Nice! 

115
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,930
I want to go there!

116
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:07,258
 Colored umbrellas! 

117
00:09:07,258 --> 00:09:10,060
 Colored umbrellas here! 

118
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:43,879
 - I want it! One, please. 
 - I want one! So do I! 
   

119
00:09:43,879 --> 00:09:46,260
Don't crowd!

120
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,855
 Don't jostle! 

121
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:51,980
Hao Du.

122
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,821
As the shop is quite popular,

123
00:09:54,821 --> 00:09:57,240
the food here must be delicious.

124
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:00,476
 - Please give me one! 
 - Two, please! 

125
00:10:00,476 --> 00:10:03,165
So many people there stop me from getting inside.

126
00:10:03,165 --> 00:10:05,109
Could you buy it for me?

127
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:07,277
 Mind your own. 

128
00:10:07,277 --> 00:10:08,710
 Don't push! 

129
00:10:08,711 --> 00:10:10,065
 I want to buy it as well. 

130
00:10:10,066 --> 00:10:14,165
Fine. Then stay here. Don't leave here.

131
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:16,560
 - One more, please!  
 - Hold on.  

132
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,250
- Here's the money. 
 - I have the money for it.

133
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:22,780
   

134
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,820
Princess!

135
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,154
 Ready or not? 

136
00:10:26,155 --> 00:10:28,640
 Is it my turn? 

137
00:10:29,822 --> 00:10:30,976
 I want to buy some! 

138
00:10:30,976 --> 00:10:33,270
Which taste do you want?

139
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:36,269
Sweet.

140
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:38,300
 - Sir! Ready or not? 
 - I want it, too! 

141
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,399
 Hurry up! Two, please! 

142
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,070
Excuse me.

143
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,221
Changge.

144
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,182
So many people here. Let's find another place to talk.

145
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:08,476
Yueyan, you have changed a lot.

146
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,243
How would you have dared to come out like this in the past?

147
00:11:12,243 --> 00:11:13,710
You're the same. Always making fun of me.

148
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,500
I don't.

149
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,766
I'm just happy for you.

150
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:20,665
You always hid behind others.

151
00:11:20,665 --> 00:11:23,343
You were too timid and needed protection.

152
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:24,976
You're quite different now.

153
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,970
I know what I want.

154
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,777
I want to be the princess of Great Tang.

155
00:11:29,777 --> 00:11:32,090
A real princess.

156
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:35,266
I don't want to see people starving

157
00:11:35,266 --> 00:11:38,530
or kids having no rice to eat.

158
00:11:39,344 --> 00:11:40,965
I want to be like you.

159
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,970
I want to be a girl fearing nothing.

160
00:11:44,377 --> 00:11:47,600
Yueyan, you're really different.

161
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:50,743
Someone told me that

162
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:53,969
I could walk around for I was a man.

163
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:57,020
But I still can walk around as I'm a girl.

164
00:11:57,988 --> 00:12:00,930
No matter who you are,

165
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,355
the one who likes rabbits or the one who wants to be a princess,

166
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:07,090
you can be whoever you want.

167
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,655
 - And mine! 
 - Don't push! 

168
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:12,066
 Don't push me! 

169
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,587
 Is mine ready? 

170
00:12:13,588 --> 00:12:15,640
   
 I want two, please. 

171
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,390
Princess!

172
00:12:19,844 --> 00:12:20,990
Yueyan!

173
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,554
 Don't push! 

174
00:12:22,554 --> 00:12:24,930
 Ready or not, Sir? 

175
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:26,830
   

176
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:35,029
I've experienced so many things all the way here.

177
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:37,965
I thought I would embrace you

178
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,832
and cry bitterly after I met you.

179
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:46,000
Well, now for me, it's not a big deal.

180
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,110
Quite right. We've all grown up.

181
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:55,429
Changge, where do you live?

182
00:12:55,429 --> 00:12:57,632
How can I find you later on?

183
00:12:57,633 --> 00:12:59,411
I'm now in Liuyun Taoist Temple.

184
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,232
You don't need to find me especially

185
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,565
for I'll sometimes come to South Hill.

186
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:07,955
It means we can meet again.

187
00:13:07,955 --> 00:13:11,222
By the way, Hao Du is now in the town.

188
00:13:11,222 --> 00:13:13,355
You need to be careful when you're out.

189
00:13:13,355 --> 00:13:16,310
He'll catch you as soon as he sees you.

190
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,132
Hao... Hao Du... Changge, I have to go now.

191
00:13:22,132 --> 00:13:24,200
Be cautious.

192
00:13:51,711 --> 00:13:53,511
 Watch out! 

193
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:55,230
 Oh, come on. 

194
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:16,629
♫  My fate brings me nothing  ♫

195
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:20,320
♫  but loneliness  ♫

196
00:14:21,044 --> 00:14:26,019
I... saw someone was selling sugar figurines,

197
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:28,887
so I went to buy one for I was greedy...

198
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:32,044
I wasn't on purpose to leave...

199
00:14:32,044 --> 00:14:35,118
I know I'm wrong. Sorry about that.

200
00:14:35,118 --> 00:14:37,099
I won't do that again.

201
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,970
I'll give it all to you.

202
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,199
♫   I've loved you from our first meeting   ♫

203
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,859
♫  In this lifetime, I'm devoted to you   ♫

204
00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:52,609
♫  What is love?  ♫

205
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:57,290
♫   There is no escape from this world   ♫

206
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,730
- I... 
 - I thought I lost you.

207
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,210
You didn't. I...

208
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:12,050
♫  I only want you to be happy   ♫

209
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,830
You said it's for me.

210
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,250
You're not mad now?

211
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:35,209
Hao Du, you're not as fierce as your look. Is that right?

212
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:37,730
♫   Putting in our best efforts   ♫

213
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:40,260
♫   We won't be afraid of what may come   ♫

214
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,321
Hao Du, where are my desserts?

215
00:15:43,321 --> 00:15:45,010
- I've eaten them. 
 - Eaten?

216
00:15:45,011 --> 00:15:46,955
I didn't ask you to do so.

217
00:15:46,955 --> 00:15:49,422
Nothing left?

218
00:15:49,422 --> 00:15:51,066
Answer my question.

219
00:15:51,088 --> 00:15:54,510
Hao Du! Hao Du!

220
00:15:59,577 --> 00:16:01,420
Young Master Du.

221
00:16:02,566 --> 00:16:05,232
Greetings to Your Highness.

222
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:07,121
Young Master Du.

223
00:16:07,122 --> 00:16:08,299
Why are you here?

224
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,721
His Majesty has gotten the news of Princess's arrival in Luoyang

225
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,177
but he is still worried about you.

226
00:16:14,177 --> 00:16:17,754
That's why I'm here personally

227
00:16:17,754 --> 00:16:21,090
to see whether you're fine or not.

228
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,950
You...

229
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,610
His Majesty could be at ease now.

230
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:32,033
Never mind. Thanks for your care.

231
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:36,310
As it's getting dark, you'd better have an early rest.

232
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:54,299
You didn't let His Majesty down at last.

233
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,210
As you've found her, I can be at ease now.

234
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:01,654
Father, we haven't seen each other for just a few days.

235
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:02,899
What's the matter...

236
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,665
As I'm old, it's easier for me to get sick.

237
00:17:05,665 --> 00:17:06,810
But it doesn't matter.

238
00:17:06,811 --> 00:17:08,849
Place what's in your hand properly.

239
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,432
Let's have a talk in the main hall.

240
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:13,160
Yes.

241
00:17:37,577 --> 00:17:41,765
Father, you're not only visiting Princess here, right?

242
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:44,199
Yes. But also to deal with my privacy.

243
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:48,199
Tell me what she has experienced.

244
00:17:48,199 --> 00:17:50,840
I finally found her as I was in Luoyang.

245
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,510
She has suffered a lot.

246
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:55,570
She walked from the border to Luoyang all the way.

247
00:17:56,277 --> 00:17:58,133
Well, it's good that you'd found her.

248
00:17:58,133 --> 00:17:59,754
It's not peaceful here.

249
00:17:59,754 --> 00:18:04,380
Escort her back to Chang'an early tomorrow morning.

250
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:09,976
What? Any problems?

251
00:18:09,976 --> 00:18:13,110
No. But...

252
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,421
Don't beat around the bush. Get to the point.

253
00:18:16,421 --> 00:18:18,644
Letting her stay in Luoyang to appease people

254
00:18:18,644 --> 00:18:21,632
is better than asking her to go back.

255
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,000
Someone told me that Crown Prince...

256
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,943
As Princess is here, the refugees can be under control.

257
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,432
What's wrong with Crown Prince?

258
00:18:28,433 --> 00:18:30,810
He...

259
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:32,639
He has been feeling unwell for a long time,

260
00:18:32,639 --> 00:18:34,754
and everything about the disaster relief

261
00:18:34,754 --> 00:18:36,933
is all up to Princess.

262
00:18:36,933 --> 00:18:39,499
People here trust Princess more.

263
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,777
In order to stabilize the situation,

264
00:18:41,777 --> 00:18:44,210
please allow her to stay in Luoyang

265
00:18:44,211 --> 00:18:46,580
and do what she likes.

266
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:50,032
I will give her close supervision.

267
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:52,570
Nothing will go amiss.

268
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:57,632
Hao Du, you really take her into consideration.

269
00:18:57,632 --> 00:19:01,232
Of course. She's the princess after all.

270
00:19:01,232 --> 00:19:04,170
Is it the only reason?

271
00:19:05,366 --> 00:19:08,766
When I was as young as you,

272
00:19:08,766 --> 00:19:11,666
I always failed to know

273
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:16,554
my mind or the mind of others.

274
00:19:16,554 --> 00:19:18,755
Father, I don't.

275
00:19:18,755 --> 00:19:20,377
You don't need to explain.

276
00:19:20,377 --> 00:19:23,899
I won't interfere in young people's matters.

277
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,590
Have some tea.

278
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:10,100
 Princess? Or Yueyan? 

279
00:20:16,644 --> 00:20:19,090
 What am I thinking? 

280
00:20:39,466 --> 00:20:40,810
Good!

281
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,199
Nice job!

282
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,750
Come here.

283
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:47,110
Here you are.

284
00:20:51,355 --> 00:20:54,710
You... It's you!

285
00:21:00,199 --> 00:21:03,470
Your Highness, we meet again.

286
00:21:06,344 --> 00:21:09,621
Your Highness, Young Master Wei is here again.

287
00:21:09,621 --> 00:21:12,059
I'm chatting with my old friend. Why is he here?

288
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,955
Sorry for hindering your time.

289
00:21:13,955 --> 00:21:16,530
Farewell, Your Highness.

290
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,910
Don't leave!

291
00:21:20,266 --> 00:21:24,219
Your Highness! Your Highness!

292
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:27,240
I see!

293
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,655
Your Highness!

294
00:21:30,655 --> 00:21:35,210
If you're free, why not go to South Hill to help my sister?

295
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,800
How can a man like you let a lady roam around in South Hill?

296
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,321
I'm ashamed of you!

297
00:21:41,322 --> 00:21:43,030
Your Highness!

298
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,190
Madam.

299
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:07,590
Greetings to Madam.

300
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:50,940
Madam.

301
00:22:52,255 --> 00:22:54,255
Here's what's sent from Ziwei Palace.

302
00:22:54,255 --> 00:22:55,840
   

303
00:23:04,488 --> 00:23:09,320
As I've seen you, what else should I complain about?

304
00:23:11,988 --> 00:23:15,632
It seems to be a good choice

305
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:18,460
to ask Sheng Xin to go to meet him.

306
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,777
- Cui Tong. 
 - Yes.

307
00:23:20,777 --> 00:23:25,587
Everything in Luoyang has been dry recently.

308
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:30,720
I'm afraid it'll have a blazing fire.

309
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,680
Yes, Madam.

310
00:23:40,855 --> 00:23:42,454
Silly girl,

311
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:45,955
I don't think you should always come to see me.

312
00:23:45,955 --> 00:23:49,410
Don't worry, Hao Du won't know it.

313
00:23:52,183 --> 00:23:55,872
Changge, Minister Du is now in Luoyang.

314
00:23:55,872 --> 00:23:59,120
Be cautious as you're out.

315
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:04,093
I think you'd better stay here rather than go out.

316
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,472
I could do nothing with the past.

317
00:24:08,472 --> 00:24:10,470
But from now on,

318
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:14,600
I'll keep you safe at all costs.

319
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,071
I'll look after myself.

320
00:24:20,071 --> 00:24:21,870
You too.

321
00:24:27,961 --> 00:24:31,016
Here you are. Be careful.

322
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:33,072
Slow down.

323
00:24:33,072 --> 00:24:35,230
Thank you, Sister.

324
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,060
You need to have a good rest.

325
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,860
- Your wound can't be delayed anymore. 
 - Okay.

326
00:25:06,861 --> 00:25:08,094
Have a try.

327
00:25:08,094 --> 00:25:09,816
It won't hinder your action.

328
00:25:09,816 --> 00:25:12,140
Thank you so much.

329
00:25:13,572 --> 00:25:15,579
 My wound is almost healed. 

330
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:18,326
It's said you're a noble from Changan.

331
00:25:18,326 --> 00:25:20,379
I don't think you're a noble.

332
00:25:20,379 --> 00:25:22,215
I think you're a Bodhisattva.

333
00:25:22,215 --> 00:25:26,804
Oh, my wife. She's a princess. Not just any noble!

334
00:25:26,804 --> 00:25:28,571
The heavens bless our nation!

335
00:25:28,571 --> 00:25:31,760
Your Highness is as kindhearted as a Bodhisattva!

336
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,372
Don't be like this.

337
00:25:33,372 --> 00:25:37,299
It is said those from Liuyun Temple are very kind.

338
00:25:37,299 --> 00:25:40,060
I think there's still a Bodhisattva here!

339
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,671
- He's right! 
 - That's it!

340
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:44,915
We've seen all the nobles from Luoyang

341
00:25:44,915 --> 00:25:49,540
only except the crown prince.

342
00:25:52,094 --> 00:25:54,660
Actually, he cares for you.

343
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,920
That's why I'm here to look after you.

344
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,499
That's why it's said

345
00:26:03,499 --> 00:26:05,882
His Highness stays in Ziwei Palace in seclusion

346
00:26:05,882 --> 00:26:07,782
with the lights on all night.

347
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:09,682
Well, he's praying for us.

348
00:26:09,682 --> 00:26:11,649
But it's a palace of the former dynasty...

349
00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:13,869
Is it really a blessing for us?

350
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:16,004
Forget it. Just remember he's praying for us.

351
00:26:16,004 --> 00:26:17,459
 - He's right! 
 - I agree! 

352
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,629
His Highness must do it for the good of us!

353
00:26:19,629 --> 00:26:21,710
Thanks, Bodhisattva!

354
00:26:30,361 --> 00:26:32,749
Miss Quan, what are you doing?

355
00:26:32,749 --> 00:26:35,793
It's said there's an abnormal astronomical phenomenon in Luoyang

356
00:26:35,793 --> 00:26:38,137
and a conflagration will break out in three days.

357
00:26:38,137 --> 00:26:42,510
Though it's hearsay, we still need to be on guard for many people here.

358
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:50,237
Changge, about the conflagration...

359
00:26:50,237 --> 00:26:51,749
Don't be too worried.

360
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,390
It's just hearsay.

361
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,882
These refugees have left their hometown

362
00:26:59,882 --> 00:27:02,793
and now they can have an unclaimed field to farm.

363
00:27:02,793 --> 00:27:05,704
It's a way of living for them.

364
00:27:05,705 --> 00:27:07,504
This place is not a part of the unclaimed lands.

365
00:27:07,505 --> 00:27:10,050
It's Liuyun Taoist Temple's fields.

366
00:27:11,372 --> 00:27:15,638
The rich in Luoyang are worried about their unknown backgrounds

367
00:27:15,638 --> 00:27:17,193
so they dare not let them farm.

368
00:27:17,194 --> 00:27:18,872
But Master cares nothing about it.

369
00:27:18,872 --> 00:27:23,750
She lends them not only fields but also grains and foods.

370
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:26,890
She's really a Bodhisattva of Luoyang.

371
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:45,140
Changge.

372
00:27:48,516 --> 00:27:50,540
Brother Shuyu.

373
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:59,504
Last time, we parted in Weishui. How are you these days?

374
00:27:59,504 --> 00:28:01,960
I'm fine. Everything is okay.

375
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,050
I'll be fine as long as you're okay.

376
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,515
When did you come back? Why hadn't you told me?

377
00:28:08,515 --> 00:28:11,516
And why are you now with Yan?

378
00:28:11,516 --> 00:28:13,719
Where had you gone?

379
00:28:13,719 --> 00:28:17,615
- And... 
 - Wei Shuyu, you have too many questions.

380
00:28:19,627 --> 00:28:22,137
Fine. I'll ask nothing.

381
00:28:22,137 --> 00:28:23,769
I won't ask you.

382
00:28:23,769 --> 00:28:25,926
Everything will be fine as long as you're okay.

383
00:28:25,926 --> 00:28:30,400
As you're here, will you leave again?

384
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:32,249
I don't know.

385
00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:34,248
It's not my home.

386
00:28:34,248 --> 00:28:36,600
I can go nowhere.

387
00:28:37,594 --> 00:28:38,871
You can come with us!

388
00:28:38,871 --> 00:28:41,389
After the things here are settled, we can return to Chang'an together.

389
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:45,715
You, Yan'er, and I can stay together like before.

390
00:28:45,715 --> 00:28:47,510
Changge.

391
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,350
Li Changge has died.

392
00:28:54,883 --> 00:28:57,350
You can call me A'Li.

393
00:28:59,961 --> 00:29:02,315
No matter what you are called,

394
00:29:02,315 --> 00:29:04,782
you are always my Changge.

395
00:29:04,782 --> 00:29:07,320
I'm really glad to see

396
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:13,060
you're the same as before, staying together and looking after each other.

397
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,800
Chang...

398
00:29:16,894 --> 00:29:18,640
A'Li.

399
00:29:19,172 --> 00:29:21,449
Can we have a private conversation?

400
00:29:21,449 --> 00:29:23,793
I still have many refugees to nurse

401
00:29:23,794 --> 00:29:25,749
so I can't chat with you.

402
00:29:25,749 --> 00:29:27,761
As you come with Crown Prince,

403
00:29:27,761 --> 00:29:29,849
you must have many things to do.

404
00:29:29,849 --> 00:29:30,805
But...

405
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:34,782
Anyway, I won't leave here as of yet.

406
00:29:34,782 --> 00:29:37,290
You can take Yueyan first.

407
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:41,350
We still have chances to chat later on.

408
00:29:57,316 --> 00:30:01,249
Master, Luoyang has become rife with rumors these days.

409
00:30:01,249 --> 00:30:03,260
It's said there must be a conflagration in three days.

410
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:06,072
As the good and the bad mix up together,

411
00:30:06,072 --> 00:30:09,182
if someone wants to make trouble,

412
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:10,849
I'm afraid it'll do harm to us.

413
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:13,516
I hope you have a plan in place.

414
00:30:13,516 --> 00:30:15,429
Don't worry.

415
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:19,150
Everything has its own fate.

416
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,450
It's good for you to know what to do.

417
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,960
No. I don't know what to do.

418
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,737
A'Li, even if it's a fish, I dare not tell you

419
00:30:29,737 --> 00:30:32,690
I can control all its actions.

420
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,519
So how can I control people?

421
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:39,629
Reckoning accurately or finding a foolproof way.

422
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:42,128
It all depends on one's skills.

423
00:30:42,128 --> 00:30:44,710
The Dao should be the core.

424
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,760
What does it mean?

425
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:51,193
How can you not save someone in need right in front of you?

426
00:30:51,194 --> 00:30:54,205
If you decide to save, it means you can't plan for the future.

427
00:30:54,205 --> 00:30:56,620
Then so what?

428
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:08,308
Dao only depends on your heart.

429
00:31:08,308 --> 00:31:11,520
Take the consequences.

430
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,700
Everyone in the world should obey it.

431
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:31,130
   

432
00:31:39,738 --> 00:31:41,860
Brother Shuyu.

433
00:31:44,094 --> 00:31:46,290
Brother Shuyu?

434
00:31:47,127 --> 00:31:49,450
What are you thinking?

435
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,850
Nothing.

436
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:54,089
By the way, Crown Prince parties in Ziwei Palace every day.

437
00:31:54,089 --> 00:31:57,240
If he keeps on doing so, things will go wrong.

438
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,815
He's spoiled.

439
00:31:59,816 --> 00:32:01,980
If you...

440
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,589
If you don't know what to do, go to tell Minister Du.

441
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:08,460
He fears him the most.

442
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,793
Nowadays, the refugees in South Hill are starting to discuss it.

443
00:32:12,793 --> 00:32:17,160
If he keeps acting recklessly, what should we do?

444
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,050
Does Changge know he's here?

445
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:24,410
Are you worried she will make trouble with him?

446
00:32:25,883 --> 00:32:28,271
You don't believe her!

447
00:32:28,271 --> 00:32:32,180
I promise she won't do such things.

448
00:32:33,572 --> 00:32:35,520
I know.

449
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:51,815
- Your Highness. 
 - Have you found him?

450
00:32:51,815 --> 00:32:53,159
Report to Your Highness.

451
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:58,482
He says that you need to pick him out first

452
00:32:58,482 --> 00:33:02,300
and then he will come to meet you.

453
00:33:11,938 --> 00:33:13,304
Okay.

454
00:33:13,305 --> 00:33:14,809
Nice.

455
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:16,961
It's so interesting.

456
00:33:16,961 --> 00:33:19,027
Tell me! What are the rules?

457
00:33:19,027 --> 00:33:21,450
You can do whatever you want

458
00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:24,070
except getting close or talking to them.

459
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:27,000
Can't get close...

460
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:34,627
Fine. Watch what I do, then you try!

461
00:33:34,627 --> 00:33:36,580
Yes.

462
00:33:40,805 --> 00:33:42,440
Do it.

463
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,120
It's you! You're the one I want!

464
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,226
Your Highness is so smart.

465
00:34:23,226 --> 00:34:25,515
Sheng Xin greets Your Highness.

466
00:34:25,515 --> 00:34:27,540
Stand up.

467
00:34:28,294 --> 00:34:31,788
Nice. I want you to stay with me!

468
00:34:31,788 --> 00:34:35,793
Your Highness, please let us all stay with you.

469
00:34:35,794 --> 00:34:38,530
More people, more fun.

470
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:39,510
You're right.

471
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,589
Okay. You can all stay.

472
00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:45,850
 Thanks, Your Highness. 

473
00:34:52,761 --> 00:34:54,460
Minister Du.

474
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:58,082
   

475
00:34:58,083 --> 00:34:59,183
Thank you.

476
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:01,660
Do you want to find Young Master Li?

477
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:04,379
Well, maybe he isn't at home.

478
00:35:04,379 --> 00:35:05,826
He isn't in Luoyang?

479
00:35:05,826 --> 00:35:06,849
Yes, he is.

480
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:09,226
Maybe he's at the tea-house in West Market,

481
00:35:09,226 --> 00:35:12,080
or at the tavern in the South Market.

482
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:16,337
He could be anywhere in Luoyang except his home.

483
00:35:16,337 --> 00:35:20,129
He's in Luoyang but out of home all the time?

484
00:35:20,129 --> 00:35:22,726
No one can tell whether he'll return during the curfew.

485
00:35:22,727 --> 00:35:24,894
I've heard that he married a shrewish woman.

486
00:35:24,894 --> 00:35:27,460
How can he not hide outside?

487
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:34,720
Minister.

488
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,326
Young Master Wei, why do you come in a hurry?

489
00:35:39,326 --> 00:35:40,659
Report to Minister Du.

490
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,761
I've already dealt out all the relief funds and materials.

491
00:35:43,761 --> 00:35:46,416
Now the situation here is getting better.

492
00:35:46,416 --> 00:35:48,149
But...

493
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,820
Go ahead.

494
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,479
But Crown Prince hasn't come out since he moved to Ziwei Palace.

495
00:35:53,479 --> 00:35:56,171
It's Princess Yongan who's in charge of everything.

496
00:35:56,171 --> 00:35:58,060
People are starting to gossip about it.

497
00:35:58,061 --> 00:36:00,440
And...

498
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:05,000
And he mixes with a group of jugglers all day...

499
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,980
Absurd!

500
00:36:26,238 --> 00:36:28,120
Your Highness.

501
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,883
- Your Highness! 
 - Your Highness!

502
00:36:38,683 --> 00:36:40,661
Your Highness, are you okay?

503
00:36:40,661 --> 00:36:43,737
Yes. What about you, Sheng Xin?

504
00:36:43,737 --> 00:36:45,840
It's good to hear that.

505
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,426
Unfortunately, I forgot to bring a recorder with me;

506
00:36:53,426 --> 00:36:57,627
otherwise, I would let him record all that you've done for the people

507
00:36:57,627 --> 00:37:01,010
and report to His Majesty.

508
00:37:03,883 --> 00:37:06,983
Minister Du, my father is busy with affairs every day.

509
00:37:06,983 --> 00:37:10,672
It's unnecessary to let him know such a trifle.

510
00:37:10,672 --> 00:37:15,671
There's hearsay that Your Highness indulges in a lavish lifestyle every day.

511
00:37:15,671 --> 00:37:21,183
At this rate, His Majesty will finally know it.

512
00:37:21,183 --> 00:37:24,561
Minister Du, I feel grateful listening to your advice.

513
00:37:24,561 --> 00:37:26,880
Thanks for the trouble.

514
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:31,804
He's my friend in Luoyang.

515
00:37:31,804 --> 00:37:33,726
If you're unsatisfied with it,

516
00:37:33,726 --> 00:37:38,120
I'll ask him to go back where he comes.

517
00:37:39,516 --> 00:37:42,930
I hope you can behave yourself.

518
00:37:48,105 --> 00:37:53,516
Your Highness, if you want me to leave, you can tell me straight.

519
00:37:53,516 --> 00:37:56,850
As I've seen you, what else should I complain about?

520
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,561
It's my great honor

521
00:37:59,561 --> 00:38:04,440
to see such a brilliant person like Your Highness.

522
00:38:10,294 --> 00:38:12,826
I've told him that

523
00:38:12,826 --> 00:38:15,427
I'll ask you to go back where you come.

524
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:18,815
As you're a young musician of Taichang Temple in Chang'an,

525
00:38:18,816 --> 00:38:22,272
where else should you go back except Changan?

526
00:38:22,272 --> 00:38:24,810
Thanks, Your Highness!

527
00:38:33,883 --> 00:38:38,349
I've already searched there and here.

528
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:40,694
Where's Ashile Sun? Aren't we going to find her?

529
00:38:40,694 --> 00:38:42,571
He went out before dawn.

530
00:38:42,572 --> 00:38:44,226
He has a map of Luoyang.

531
00:38:44,226 --> 00:38:46,310
He goes to find and then crosses out one by one.

532
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,130
As he finished, he'll then start a new round.

533
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:51,519
How can he find her by an aimless search?

534
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:54,960
Everything depends on us.

535
00:39:02,205 --> 00:39:03,638
Sorry.

536
00:39:03,638 --> 00:39:05,470
Unaware.

537
00:39:06,805 --> 00:39:10,083
You smart girl. Wait for my good news!

538
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:11,770
Let's go.

539
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:18,950
   

540
00:39:43,072 --> 00:39:47,200
A'Li, do you like the dishes today?

541
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:51,549
A'Li, it's no good for you to stay here all day.

542
00:39:51,549 --> 00:39:54,704
Let's go to buy some medicines and you can limber up.

543
00:39:54,704 --> 00:39:59,060
I think it's pretty nice staying here. Self-cultivation.

544
00:40:02,072 --> 00:40:04,660
Then it'll be good.

545
00:40:09,594 --> 00:40:10,783
That's it.

546
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,916
- Sit well, please. 
 -  Okay.

547
00:40:12,916 --> 00:40:14,740
A'Li...

548
00:40:18,772 --> 00:40:20,870
   

549
00:40:36,494 --> 00:40:38,420
Don't be narrow-minded.

550
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,350
Do you know what I've learned today?

551
00:40:48,694 --> 00:40:50,926
I feel tired after walking all day.

552
00:40:50,927 --> 00:40:54,460
Well, massage my legs and then I'll tell you.

553
00:40:56,094 --> 00:40:57,893
What? Are you unwilling?

554
00:40:57,893 --> 00:40:59,815
I think you have no manners.

555
00:40:59,816 --> 00:41:03,099
We rent the house and asked for news.

556
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,550
So don't you think...

557
00:41:07,038 --> 00:41:10,737
Cut them. Then you won't be tired.

558
00:41:11,983 --> 00:41:13,980
Any clues?

559
00:41:15,405 --> 00:41:17,530
I'll let you off this time.

560
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:19,400
Yes. There's one.

561
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,172
It's said a Taoist called Sun Simiao

562
00:41:21,172 --> 00:41:25,893
came from the grasslands and saved a young lady with a lot of work.

563
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:29,960
Isn't Commandant Li a young lady?

564
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,971
What else?

565
00:41:32,972 --> 00:41:35,027
Why are you not surprised?

566
00:41:35,027 --> 00:41:36,726
I didn't think you guys knew.

567
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,549
Cut the crap! Any other news?

568
00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:41,682
His whereabouts are always unknown.

569
00:41:41,683 --> 00:41:43,460
It's known he will diagnose refugees,

570
00:41:43,461 --> 00:41:46,494
but no one knows where he is now.

571
00:41:46,494 --> 00:41:48,771
Any shelters for the refugees in Luoyang

572
00:41:48,772 --> 00:41:52,640
A place called Liuyun Taoist Temple in South Hill.

573
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,880
Liuyun Taoist Temple?

574
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,750
Why did he run away again?

575
00:42:31,361 --> 00:42:32,920
Anyone here?

576
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,700
   

577
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:38,682
Sir, there's no visit today.

578
00:42:38,682 --> 00:42:41,393
Only people with acute diseases are allowed in.

579
00:42:41,394 --> 00:42:43,780
Could you do me a favor? I'm here to find a lady.

580
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:46,816
Is there anyone called Li Changge? Or Li Shisi?

581
00:42:46,816 --> 00:42:48,926
Li Changge?

582
00:42:48,927 --> 00:42:50,850
There's no Li Changge here.

583
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:53,194
I think you've come to the wrong place. Please leave at once.

584
00:42:53,194 --> 00:42:55,089
What about Sun Simiao? Is Sun Simiao here?

585
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:57,127
How can you call Taoist Sun's name?

586
00:42:57,127 --> 00:42:59,793
That's it! Taoist Sun! Has he saved a lady?

587
00:42:59,793 --> 00:43:01,738
He has saved innumerable people,

588
00:43:01,738 --> 00:43:04,015
so how can I remember all of them?

589
00:43:04,016 --> 00:43:06,372
- Please forgive my offense. 
 - Changge!

590
00:43:06,372 --> 00:43:09,410
You intruder! I'll call others to catch you!

591
00:43:13,872 --> 00:43:15,660
Changge!

592
00:43:17,416 --> 00:43:20,904
Changge! Changge!

593
00:43:26,427 --> 00:43:28,220
Changge!

594
00:43:32,183 --> 00:43:34,740
Changge!

595
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:06,730


596
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:10,430
♫  The heart gradually responds,  ♫

597
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,710
♫  gradually revives,  ♫

598
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:16,130
