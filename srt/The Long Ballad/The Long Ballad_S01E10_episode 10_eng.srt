♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

♫   No one to rely on   ♫

♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:24,950
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,820
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:17,960

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,500
   

21
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,430
   

22
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:39,939
Esteemed Customer, this way.

23
00:01:42,307 --> 00:01:45,720
Looks like you're tired from your travels.

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,999
You aren't from here, are you?

25
00:01:46,999 --> 00:01:47,799
No.

26
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:52,719
Then you're about to taste the local Youyu Smoked Chicken.

27
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,039
But I haven't placed my order.

28
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,299
It's a rule made by our boss.

29
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:58,479
Anyone from out of town will have our Youyu Smoked Chicken for free.

30
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,799
As a welcome gift.

31
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,518
Waiter, let me ask you something.

32
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,459
Shuo State's city is located on the border and rather isolated.

33
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,858
It should be desolate.

34
00:02:07,858 --> 00:02:10,038
Why is it so full of peace and prosperity,

35
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:13,159
even the beggars are treated with such care and kindness?

36
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,239
Sir, you might not know this.

37
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,519
With the endless wars, we are able to live a peaceful life

38
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,359
only because we have a remarkable governor here.

39
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,758
Governor Gongsun Heng.

40
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:24,118
Waiter!

41
00:02:24,119 --> 00:02:26,439
One more bottle of wine and some dishes.

42
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,240
Yes, Sir!

43
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,419
Gongsun Heng.

44
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:35,200
No wonder even the children were imitating him.

45
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,560
He's really respected by the people.

46
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,579
Sir, please enjoy it.

47
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,979
Waiter,

48
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:47,060
could you tell me more about this Governor Gongsun?

49
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,198
Well, Governor Gongsun of Shuo State

50
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,758
has been here since the Sui Dynasty.

51
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,320
Over the years, he has managed to equip the city with

52
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,359
tall and solid walls, and strong soldiers and horses.

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,079
So the Hu people cannot take any advantage of us.

54
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,119
He also encourages land reclamation,

55
00:03:03,119 --> 00:03:04,758
attracting many people to settle here.

56
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:08,700
Among the nearby cities, Shuo State is the most populous.

57
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,359
Our boss makes it a rule to send

58
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:16,420
customers from out of town a free Youyu Smoked Chicken.

59
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,799
We can afford the chicken,

60
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,758
but can't afford to make governor Gongsun look bad.

61
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:22,719
Isn't that right?

62
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,160
 Waiter! 

63
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,119
I'll go back to work. Call me if you need anything.

64
00:03:27,119 --> 00:03:28,999
Sir, this way, please.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,799
 Any empty seats? 

66
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,060
 So the legendary governor is a Sui official. 

67
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:36,959
 Nothing like a war repulses people of his kind. 

68
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,420
 What should I do to persuade him to help me start a war? 

69
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,159
A'Dou?

70
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,798
Master, it's really you!

71
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,518
I thought I saw someone like you just now.

72
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:30,519
So I followed you here.

73
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,899
Well, then this is our destiny.

74
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,759
Hungry?

75
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,478
Come on. Let's go have something nice.

76
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:46,380
Okay.

77
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,398
I always knew you were the living Buddha in my life.

78
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,319
With you, I would have everything.

79
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,879
By the way, Master, are we going to meet the local magistrate now?

80
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,380
Like that time in You State, reasoning with him to help us.

81
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,339
You State is the city where my father has devoted most energy,

82
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:04,358
yet the governor is not completely loyal.

83
00:05:04,359 --> 00:05:06,580
Gongsun Heng is an official from the Sui Dynasty.

84
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,740
Why would he want to help us?

85
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,919
No one is worth trusting in the world anymore.

86
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,838
Master, how about A'Dou?

87
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:18,239
Is A'Dou worth trusting?

88
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,080
You are.

89
00:05:22,359 --> 00:05:26,678
A'Dou, I feel like I've matured a lot these days.

90
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:31,798
Not trusting anybody is more bitter than being cheated.

91
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:35,540
Master, I don't understand.

92
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,779
It's better that you never do.

93
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,439
Come on!  Let's go have something nice.

94
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,440
After that, we'll go to the most impoverished place in Shuo State.

95
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,079
First lesson. Obtaining intelligence.

96
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:23,879
 General is back! 

97
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,238
 General! General! 

98
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:26,179
Sun!

99
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:27,798
 General! General! 

100
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:31,219
Sun, you're back.

101
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:36,919
You are injured?

102
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,720
Long story.

103
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:52,840
That She'er now dares go after you so bluntly.

104
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,119
If I died in the territory of Great Tang,

105
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:57,039
he wouldn't have to be responsible for it.

106
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,999
If I were him, I would have taken the opportunity, too.

107
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,199
We did take a risky move.

108
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,919
If he rats you out to the Great Khan...

109
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,159
He won't. I know him well.

110
00:07:08,159 --> 00:07:12,160
There's no way he'll rat on me and admit his failure.

111
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,060
If you want something, you have to face its consequence.

112
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:23,118
Who patched you up?

113
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:24,838
It's a total mess.

114
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,379
Any other person might have died of this already.

115
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:40,059
Why are you smiling?

116
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:42,399
Nothing.

117
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,779
Something you're not telling me?

118
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:46,599
Stay away from me.

119
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,239
A Great Tang girl bandaged you?

120
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,558
General, Tu Kashe is here.

121
00:07:57,559 --> 00:07:59,819
He's at the gate of the camp.

122
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,920
What's the head of the Bear Division doing here?

123
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,979
It comes at last.

124
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,639
I need to report...

125
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,859
Sun!

126
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,039
So you're still breathing.

127
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,459
I'm very glad.

128
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,079
Your eyes are hurt?

129
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,259
Get to the point.

130
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,439
Put away that attitude.

131
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,239
You think I want to be here?

132
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:07,959
The Great Khan sent my Bear Division here to go to Shuo State with you.

133
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,659
To save you from future defeat.

134
00:09:11,599 --> 00:09:12,879
Anything else?

135
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,380
Yes.

136
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,659
Military order from Khan.

137
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,259
The Great Khan puts the Bear Division in charge.

138
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:33,819
We'll take full charge of this task.

139
00:09:33,819 --> 00:09:38,678
This means that every move of everybody of the Eagle Division

140
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,519
will be reported to me.

141
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,180
Well, reciprocity is a basic rule of social interaction.

142
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:49,139
Will you report what's going on with the Bear Division to us?

143
00:09:50,239 --> 00:09:52,400
Not according to that.

144
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,780
You may leave.

145
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,780
Where were we just now?

146
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,118
Baruch said he could draw a bow now,

147
00:10:01,119 --> 00:10:02,819
and wanted to join next year's hunting.

148
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:04,798
Kelsang wants to learn riding and shooting,

149
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,319
but her mother doesn't allow her, which is fair.

150
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,699
Girls don't learn such things.

151
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:11,479
I'll go talk to her mother.

152
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:12,519
Tell her I'll allow it.

153
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,819
You do?

154
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:15,319
Enough.

155
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,020
I'm leaving.

156
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:19,699
Wait and see.

157
00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:27,139
It seems someone is saying things to the Great Khan again.

158
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:29,519
Tu Kashe never likes or obeys you.

159
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,798
Instead of helping us, he's taking our credit.

160
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,598
It's a no-brainer to figure out who is behind this.

161
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:41,880
If one failure could hold him back, he's not She'er.

162
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:48,320
By the way, you said you'll allow girls to learn riding and shooting?

163
00:10:51,437 --> 00:10:52,990
Yes.

164
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:55,198
I'll allow it.

165
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,900
   

166
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:21,839
Elder Qin, Ashile is heading towards here with great armies.

167
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,439
If I place armies at the northwest and northeast outside,

168
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,038
to support the defense within, what do you say?

169
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:32,238
It's an ingenious stroke.

170
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:35,720
Ashile is doomed this time.

171
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,820
   

172
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,118
Although Shuo State is easy to hold and hard to attack,

173
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:47,759
without the reinforcements of Dai State and Bing State

174
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,000
to solidify the whole defense system,

175
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,799
I'm afraid there's nothing more I can do.

176
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,760
- Governor, bad news. 
 - What is it?

177
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,959
On the way to the temple, Madam and Miss Yuan were attacked

178
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,960
- by bandits. 
 - What?

179
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,300
Along the road, we found the damaged carriage and the carter's body.

180
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,139
What...

181
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:14,439
Get up.

182
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,598
Where are Madam and Yuan now?

183
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:18,558
We didn't find them.

184
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,478
Didn't find them?

185
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:22,639
Those bandits!

186
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,880
At this critical time...

187
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,559
Tell everybody to get ready.

188
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:29,740
We'll go and annihilate the bandits.

189
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,759
And get Madam and Yuan back.

190
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,360
Yes, Sir!

191
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,620
 Husband. 

192
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,220
Madam!

193
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,999
Madam, are you okay?

194
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,659
Yuan and I are both fine.

195
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:49,718
Thanks to two young men, we were able to be spared from disaster.

196
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:51,899
Two young men?

197
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,259
Yuan, are you okay?

198
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:10,699
Good girl, how are you?

199
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:13,378
Daddy, I'm all right.

200
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:16,180
You're all right? That's my girl.

201
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,779
Husband.

202
00:13:17,779 --> 00:13:20,159
They are our lifesavers.

203
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,158
Thanks for saving my family.

204
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,759
I'll do everything to return the favor.

205
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,038
I'm Li Shisi.

206
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:31,639
This is my little brother A'Dou.

207
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,959
It happened so quickly.

208
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,080
I had no choice but to trick Madam into running away.

209
00:13:37,239 --> 00:13:39,039
Trick?

210
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:45,919
Such being the case, please come in and tell us more.

211
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:55,158
A'Dou and I have drifted all the way here from Longxi.

212
00:13:55,159 --> 00:13:58,400
We stopped for a rest in the woods.

213
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,519
He was so tired that he fell asleep.

214
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,399
As I was going to wake him up to hit the road,

215
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,840
I heard several bandits talking nearby.

216
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,718
 A'Dou. 

217
00:14:18,719 --> 00:14:21,958
 A'Dou, wake up. Time to go. 

218
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,179
 Come on. Someone's here. 

219
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,918
 I've heard that Gongsun Heng's daughter is sick. 

220
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:36,199
 His wife will pass here tomorrow on her way to the temple. 

221
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,400
 We must rob her of everything. 

222
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,038
 That bastard Gongsun has burned all our bridges. 

223
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,918
 There's nowhere we can be now. 

224
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:46,038
 I'm kind enough to spare the life of his wife. 

225
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:48,300
 Let's go get prepared. 

226
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,559
Then, how did you save my wife and daughter?

227
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,399
A'Dou and I thought about it for a while.

228
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,918
We couldn't confront the bandits face to face,

229
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:13,399
or report it to you in a timely manner.

230
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,659
Thus, we could only trick Madam.

231
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,119
 They're here. 

232
00:15:30,479 --> 00:15:32,259
 Ready. 

233
00:15:32,259 --> 00:15:34,239
 Let's go. 

234
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:37,459
 Come on! 

235
00:15:37,459 --> 00:15:38,800
 Move out of the way. 

236
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,859
 Move out of the way. Move out of the way. 

237
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:44,359
 - Stop. 
 - Stop. 

238
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,100
 Would you like a ride? 

239
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,060
 Thanks, Madam. 

240
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,359
 My little brother has been sick for half a month. 

241
00:15:58,359 --> 00:15:59,819
 The monks in the temple told me 

242
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:02,699
 I needed to walk to the temple to show my sincerity. 

243
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:06,999
 I couldn't stand him to be tortured like this, but I had no choice. 

244
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,718
 Is that true? 

245
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,819
 Of course it is. 

246
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,060
 Go wait for me outside the temple. 

247
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,478
 I'll walk there with them. 

248
00:16:25,479 --> 00:16:26,999
 Madam, but... 

249
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,919
 We have seen every doctor in town, 

250
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:31,759
 but Yuan couldn't stop coughing. 

251
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,239
 I'm going to ask for the Buddha's help. 

252
00:16:34,239 --> 00:16:36,060
 This young man has a point. 

253
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,119
 Walking there by myself shows devoutness. Go. 

254
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:42,219
 Yes, Madam. 

255
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,279
 Madam, may I carry her? 

256
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,959
 I'd hate to trouble you. 

257
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,399
 It's fine, I'm very strong. 

258
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,900
 Come here. 

259
00:16:56,259 --> 00:16:57,839
 I got you. 

260
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,540
 Come on. We'll go together. 

261
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,439
 Thanks, Madam. 

262
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,540
The only reason I managed to trick Madam was Yuan.

263
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:14,439
Because in the world, every mom would sacrifice herself for her kid.

264
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,539
You saved our lives.

265
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,439
I can never pay you back.

266
00:17:23,379 --> 00:17:25,820
Madam, you're welcome.

267
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:29,438
My mother is just like you.

268
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:32,880
She would do anything for me.

269
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,159
That's true.

270
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,140
Had it been a different excuse, I don't know if I would have gotten off.

271
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,640
But it's a shame that it cost the carter's life.

272
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,559
It was my fault.

273
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:50,238
The carter getting killed was not expected by me.

274
00:17:50,239 --> 00:17:52,959
It was those bandits' fault. They are merciless.

275
00:17:52,959 --> 00:17:54,699
Let it go.

276
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,739
You've done a good job.

277
00:17:56,739 --> 00:17:58,639
Elder Qin, spread my command.

278
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,500
Hold a grand funeral for the carter,

279
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,639
and take good care of his family.

280
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,340
Yes, Sir.

281
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:10,719
You are indeed a young hero.

282
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,319
But I was wondering was it really a coincidence?

283
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,260
Governor, we had no one but each other since little, with no parents.

284
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,159
After many life-or-death moments, death no longer scares me.

285
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:36,219
If I could save Madam by myself, it is a great honor.

286
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:42,040
What's more, I've heard about your good reputation for fairness.

287
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,479
I knew you would surely reward us.

288
00:18:44,479 --> 00:18:46,079
So...

289
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:53,160
So you saved my wife and daughter in order to get a reward from me?

290
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,719
Yes.

291
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:02,438
I admit I did it partly for myself.

292
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:06,640
But that's only because I want to work for a beneficent master.

293
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,620
You think because you saved my wife and Yuan,

294
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:13,139
I would let you stay here and work for me?

295
00:19:13,139 --> 00:19:17,679
Governor, my father was a surrendering Sui general,

296
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,100
who died a mediocre man.

297
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,219
When breathing his last breath,

298
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:23,438
he asked me to achieve success at the border.

299
00:19:23,439 --> 00:19:27,399
Me saving Madam and Yuan is not merely a coincidence.

300
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,000
Isn't it also the will of Heaven that I should work for you?

301
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:35,400
You are very eloquent.

302
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:39,740
Please get up.

303
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,399
Governor, Shisi is the son of a Sui general

304
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,219
and the life-saver of me and Yuan.

305
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:50,140
I guess it is the will of Heaven to some extent.

306
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,819
Since they're homeless, how about...

307
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:55,959
Thanks, Madam.

308
00:20:02,199 --> 00:20:06,680
You two did save Madam and Yuan,

309
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,118
how could I expel you?

310
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:10,939
Since you're willing to stay here,

311
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:14,380
you may live in the guestroom in the backyard for now.

312
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:17,879
As for further arrangements, we'll talk later.

313
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,980
Thank you, Governor.

314
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:33,660
I haven't slept in such a comfortable bed in ages.

315
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,598
Master, did we nail it?

316
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:38,078
Being a wife-and-daughter-loving man,

317
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,039
Gongsun Heng will treat us nicely.

318
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:45,199
But as to earning his trust, will not be that easy.

319
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:48,419
Then, why did he let us stay here?

320
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,680
All because of Madam.

321
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,079
Well, so he still doubts our story?

322
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:56,239
At least he doesn't trust us.

323
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,679
You can never judge people by what they tell you.

324
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,719
He's aware of it.

325
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,500
But still, after today's success,

326
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,718
the first step of our plan is completed.

327
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:14,140
The next step is to earn Gongsun Heng's trust, control his army,

328
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,319
and mobilize...

329
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,119
Never speak out the inner secret.

330
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:29,520
   

331
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,399
What's your opinion?

332
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,800
The young men saved Madam and Yuan.

333
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,760
This hit your soft spot.

334
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:52,239
They are smart, as well as brave.

335
00:21:52,239 --> 00:21:55,679
However, they're also somewhat cunning.

336
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,318
Governor, please rest assured.

337
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:00,800
I'll keep an eye on them.

338
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,059
Now is a time of great uncertainty.

339
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,460
A touch-and-go situation.

340
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,679
We really need some talents.

341
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,980
If they are really what they claimed to be,

342
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,020
only here for fame and glory,

343
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,499
that's a good thing.

344
00:22:16,199 --> 00:22:20,020
Still, we can't risk letting our guard down.

345
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:25,078
Such being the case, we'll stay put and see how it develops.

346
00:22:25,079 --> 00:22:28,159
Don't worry about the affairs of the Governor Manor.

347
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,780
I'll do my best here.

348
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,958
Isn't this General Sun?

349
00:22:48,959 --> 00:22:49,939
What do you want?

350
00:22:49,939 --> 00:22:52,359
I'm here with a question.

351
00:22:52,359 --> 00:22:55,020
Shuo State city is right before us.

352
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,958
When do you plan to attack it?

353
00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:02,580
To attack it or not, and when to attack, I have my considerations.

354
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,479
It's nothing but a tiny city.

355
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:08,438
How much longer do you have to consider?

356
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:10,318
Are you getting cold feet?

357
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:15,180
It is the same tiny city that Shule Khan failed to get.

358
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,019
You're welcome to have a try.

359
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:21,179
Shule Khan failed because he had no able generals.

360
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:22,679
Now you have me.

361
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:27,620
Cities more solid than this, I have broken into numerous times.

362
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:31,819
If we fail this time, will the Bear Division take full responsibility?

363
00:23:31,819 --> 00:23:33,999
How do you know we will fail?

364
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,838
We haven't started yet.

365
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:38,198
And why should we take full responsibility?

366
00:23:38,199 --> 00:23:41,919
The Bear Division will dominate the attack.

367
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,900
As long as the Eagle Division plays along, we will surely get it.

368
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:53,199
I'm looking forward to it.

369
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:55,019
Good.

370
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,238
Go prepare two suits of Tang clothes.

371
00:24:06,239 --> 00:24:08,680
You want to go to Shuo State city?

372
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,020
Know the enemy, and you can win all battles.

373
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:21,020
   

374
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,399
Good girl. Do you want a hug?

375
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:30,159
Miss Yuan!

376
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:33,219
Let's go back.

377
00:24:33,219 --> 00:24:35,679
I want Older Brother. Older Brother.

378
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,198
Madam has made you yummy cakes.

379
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:40,000
- Older Brother. 
 - What's going on?

380
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,100
They're clearly keeping their distance from us.

381
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,198
That's understandable.

382
00:24:44,199 --> 00:24:47,159
Let's go take a walk. Maybe we'll find something new.

383
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,598
Are we going to the bandits for more intelligence?

384
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:52,260
Don't speak of it ever again.

385
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,100
Governor, in the fields east of the city,

386
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,500
several households are arguing for land distribution.

387
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,640
They want to see you.

388
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,100
Such a trifle shouldn't disturb the governor.

389
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,238
It's no trifle.

390
00:25:12,239 --> 00:25:15,219
Divide and register all the lands in the city,

391
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:17,279
distribute them according to the number of adult men.

392
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,958
The government will keep the rest for now.

393
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:22,860
After the teen boys reach manhood, they can claim their share.

394
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,980
How do you like it?

395
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,559
Follow his words.

396
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,160
Yes, Sir.

397
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:33,519
Good morning, Governor.

398
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,399
You know government affairs?

399
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,519
Not very much.

400
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,198
When did you learn it?

401
00:25:38,199 --> 00:25:40,238
My father was a low-rank magistrate.

402
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,339
I learned it from him.

403
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:46,499
Okay, let me quiz you.

404
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:50,238
Within the city, some merchants are dealing with Hu people in secret.

405
00:25:50,239 --> 00:25:51,679
How do you think of this?

406
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,559
Doing business with the foreign state, each taking what he wants.

407
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,839
It's good for the economy, which shouldn't be banned completely.

408
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:02,819
The kinds and quantity of goods to be traded should be specified.

409
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:06,078
Control the big picture, don't be obsessed with minor details.

410
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:10,099
Adjust specific measures based on reality.

411
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:18,159
If I didn't hear it myself, I wouldn't believe this is your own idea.

412
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,478
I'm flattered.

413
00:26:19,479 --> 00:26:23,039
I can never be compared with you.

414
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,078
Where are you heading to?

415
00:26:25,079 --> 00:26:27,539
A'Dou and I have never been to Shuo State before.

416
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:30,219
We'd like to take a walk. See something new.

417
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:32,598
Learn some local customs.

418
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,399
Sounds good. Enjoy yourselves.

419
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:35,900
Yes, Sir.

420
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,879
Did you hear it?

421
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,580
Yes.

422
00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:51,679
Well?

423
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,639
Governor always treasures talents.

424
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,619
They must be what you're looking for.

425
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,439
Indeed.

426
00:26:59,439 --> 00:27:02,530
If every official here were like him,

427
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:05,680
things would be much easier for me.

428
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,900
Elder Qin.

429
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,059
Follow them.

430
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:19,559
Yes, Sir.

431
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:32,599
Your Highness, you can't be too merciful this time.

432
00:27:34,139 --> 00:27:38,159
Duke Du, Crown Princess Consort made some plum pastries.

433
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,980
Would you like one?

434
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,740
The minute Wei Zheng reached Ci State,

435
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,478
he met Li Zhian, who used to work for Li Jiancheng,

436
00:27:45,479 --> 00:27:50,538
and Li Sixing, guard of Li Yuanji, who was to be escorted to Changan.

437
00:27:50,538 --> 00:27:55,679
Wei set them free on the spot, who ran away and disappeared.

438
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,639
This whole thing is outrageous.

439
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,059
Your Highness, please recall Wei Zheng and punish him duly.

440
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,078
Duke Du, are you sure?

441
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:11,718
If I remember it correctly, it was you who prodded him onto this trip.

442
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:14,339
I intended him to calm things down in Hebei,

443
00:28:14,339 --> 00:28:16,238
not to set prisoners along the way,

444
00:28:16,239 --> 00:28:19,318
let alone officers who can command armies.

445
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:21,619
It's okay.

446
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:26,278
- Your Highness... 
 - Mr. Wei reminds me of someone.

447
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:28,838
There's another genius like Advisor Wei?

448
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:30,318
Your Highness, do tell me.

449
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:33,759
Feng Xuan of the State of Qi in the Warring States Period.

450
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,639
That's right.

451
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,860
He canceled people's debt to get their respect.

452
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,060
Just like Advisor Wei.

453
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,419
Feng Xuan only took the liberty to burn IOU notes,

454
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:48,199
while Advisor Wei set free warriors who can fight.

455
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:50,579
Tell the Secretariat to draw an order.

456
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:53,999
Before June 4th, what concerns East Palace and Prince Qi,

457
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,339
and what concerns Li Yuan before the 17th, are prohibited from accusation.

458
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:00,039
Violators will be punished.

459
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,438
Your Highness, please think twice.

460
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:05,159
If we prohibit whistle-blowing,

461
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,100
the get-away enemies will act more unscrupulously.

462
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,679
If he was encouraged, Wei Zheng might even

463
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:16,119
set free Wang Junkuo on the spot.

464
00:29:17,819 --> 00:29:19,319
Take a look.

465
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:32,718
"I cannot put myself before the state.

466
00:29:32,719 --> 00:29:35,679
I am treated as a state scholar.

467
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,919
How can I not perform my duty?"

468
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,479
Nauseating.

469
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,118
As for Wang Junkuo, send a capable team to escort him here.

470
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,958
Do keep a low profile.

471
00:29:48,959 --> 00:29:50,780
Don't treat him like a guilty man.

472
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,239
Just tell people he's being brought here by my order.

473
00:29:55,139 --> 00:29:58,239
Yes, Your Highness.

474
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:08,000
Duke Fang, any news of Yueyan?

475
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,250
Do you think the gods are punishing me?

476
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:21,219
I've already lost Changge.

477
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:24,379
Does it want to take Yan'er away from me, too?

478
00:30:24,379 --> 00:30:27,538
Your Highness, please don't worry.

479
00:30:27,538 --> 00:30:30,580
Noble Princess Yongan and Princess Yongning are blessed by Heaven.

480
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,999
They will come back safe and sound.

481
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,020
I'll send more people to look for them.

482
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,958
So you're a smart girl.

483
00:30:48,959 --> 00:30:52,979
- Elder Hai. Look, I got you some liquor. 
 - Wonderful.

484
00:30:52,979 --> 00:30:54,958
The roast chicken is really great.

485
00:30:54,959 --> 00:30:56,839
Have a smell. Good?

486
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:59,338
- Yes, it's good. 
 - Here, let me wait on you.

487
00:30:59,338 --> 00:31:01,610
It's quality liquor.

488
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,318
Nice.

489
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:06,660
Here, Uncle Mazi.

490
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,198
Bottoms up.

491
00:31:09,199 --> 00:31:10,799
Cheers.

492
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,720
- More? 
 - Top him up.

493
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,918
Cheers. One more.

494
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,180
Here you go.

495
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:31,619
Bottoms up.

496
00:31:54,339 --> 00:31:55,939
Yueyan.

497
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:14,040
Are you going to run away?

498
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,078
They will kill you if they find out.

499
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,919
I finally got them drunk.

500
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,838
This is my only shot.

501
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:22,999
It's highly possible that

502
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
they'll disable me to beg money for them tomorrow.

503
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:30,600
If you want to stay here, don't blame me in the future.

504
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,080
But...

505
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,719
I'll go with you.

506
00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:41,260
Now that's my best friend.

507
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,999
Careful.

508
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,118
Susu, they've locked the door.

509
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:52,920
How do we get out?

510
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,660
Come here.

511
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,660
See that hole over there?

512
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:59,520
But it's too high for us to reach.

513
00:33:00,199 --> 00:33:03,899
I think we can. There are two of us.

514
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:06,999
You're right, Yueyan. I'll go first.

515
00:33:09,619 --> 00:33:11,838
Help me out of here, and I'll come back for you.

516
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:13,439
Okay.

517
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,318
Yueyan, keep quiet.

518
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,759
Mazi is sleeping right here.

519
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,059
Wait here for a while. I'll be back soon.

520
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,379
But...

521
00:33:42,379 --> 00:33:44,200
Susu.

522
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:29,519
They have been wandering the streets all day, without a destination.

523
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,839
They bought some food for the beggars,

524
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,158
in the name of Governor Gongsun.

525
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,180
Nothing suspicious.

526
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,879
People are grateful to the governor.

527
00:34:38,499 --> 00:34:40,479
Enough. Stop following them.

528
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,220
They've spotted you.

529
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,299
Go get some rest.

530
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:46,359
Don't bother to monitor them ever.

531
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,960
Yes, Sir.

532
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:03,478
- Elder Qin. 
 - Elder Qin.

533
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:05,158
You're back.

534
00:35:05,159 --> 00:35:07,519
How do you like Shuo State?

535
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,138
It's good. We walked around the city today.

536
00:35:10,138 --> 00:35:12,958
There are nice food and amusements here.

537
00:35:12,959 --> 00:35:14,140
I'm glad to hear it.

538
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,599
There's intelligence from Changan.

539
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,220
I need to report to the governor.

540
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,538
Excuse me. Come to me if you need anything.

541
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:23,520
See you, Elder Qin.

542
00:35:30,479 --> 00:35:32,158
News from Changan?

543
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:33,999
Probably, yes.

544
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,958
Well...

545
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,700
Let's go inside.

546
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:40,398
If Li Shimin wants to make a big scene searching for us,

547
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:42,158
he would have done it much earlier.

548
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,680
No need to wait until now.

549
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,900
I'm afraid it's something more horrible.

550
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:01,559
 "Bayegu Tribe and Luo Tribe have besieged Wucheng. 

551
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,438
 The army led by Cheng Zhijie and Li Shiji 

552
00:37:03,439 --> 00:37:05,999
 has been fighting with them for months. 

553
00:37:05,999 --> 00:37:08,559
 Yanli actually distracts so many Tang troops"? 

554
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,519
 Could it be... 

555
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,180
 What a wild ambition. 

556
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,438
Excellent Kungfu.

557
00:37:28,439 --> 00:37:32,319
You must be no ordinary guy.

558
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:35,700
This manor is no ordinary place, even the butler is a martial arts master.

559
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,079
Did the governor send you?

560
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,279
No.

561
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:41,759
My master always trusts those he decides to employ.

562
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,100
But if I trusted you too,

563
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:52,019
you wouldn't be here late at night.

564
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,478
You're not from Longxi, are you?

565
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:56,478
I used to live there for a long time.

566
00:37:56,479 --> 00:37:58,878
I'm too familiar with the Longxi accent.

567
00:37:58,879 --> 00:38:03,639
Although you did a good job imitating it, there's a difference.

568
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:06,539
Who on earth are you?

569
00:38:06,539 --> 00:38:08,198
I leaked the information on purpose.

570
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:11,870
So you want to know the intelligence from Changan.

571
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,620
Are you a spy of the North?

572
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:20,280
A pawn of the military governor or from Changan?

573
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,959
So you work for the emperor.

574
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,900
Are you here to make the governor cede military power?

575
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,900
The emperor is intimidated by the governor's power.

576
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,420
But you should understand that the reason Shuo State can survive

577
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,198
is not because of the protection of Changan.

578
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:49,100
You may go see for yourself the life of Shuo State people,

579
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,878
and compare it with that of people in other northern cities.

580
00:38:52,879 --> 00:38:55,799
To lead the people such a happy life on the border

581
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,718
is by no means an easy job.

582
00:38:58,719 --> 00:39:00,359
Please don't worry.

583
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,878
I'm not sent by the emperor.

584
00:39:01,879 --> 00:39:05,478
I'm only here to find someplace to stay.

585
00:39:05,479 --> 00:39:08,999
I only said I was from Longxi so I could relate with the governor,

586
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,479
so that he would let me stay.

587
00:39:11,479 --> 00:39:13,700
Sorry that I lied.

588
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:21,739
I'm not interested in your past, nor do I care about your purpose.

589
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,638
As long as you don't hurt the Gongsuns, I won't come after you.

590
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:34,638
You're a smart fellow.

591
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:37,320
Live up to it.

592
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:19,239
 No, they know Susu has run away. 

593
00:40:56,479 --> 00:40:58,319
Don't be scared.

594
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,180
You're more obedient than her.

595
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:03,560
We won't do that to you.

596
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,380
I come to you to discuss something.

597
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,639
I'm all ears.

598
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:19,460
I've been thinking these days.

599
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:25,159
If you'd like, how about working here as a registrar?

600
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:30,779
A'Dou can work as your assistant.

601
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,938
What's wrong? You feel underemployed?

602
00:41:36,938 --> 00:41:38,198
No.

603
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:42,259
I... thank you, Governor.

604
00:41:42,259 --> 00:41:43,939
You're welcome.

605
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,320
This is my personal imperial guard, Xu Feng.

606
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,780
- Imperial Guard Xu. 
 - Registrar Li.

607
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,539
Good.

608
00:41:54,539 --> 00:41:57,718
The military governor has invited me to his place.

609
00:41:57,719 --> 00:41:59,660
I'll see you later.

610
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:11,158
The governor admires your talent.

611
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:12,958
And we really need some talents now,

612
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:15,319
so I'll let what happened last night go.

613
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:17,678
However, do keep in mind.

614
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:22,539
As long as you don't hurt the Gongsuns, I won't come after you.

615
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:23,918
Elder Qin, you've misunderstood.

616
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:27,399
I'll do my best to work for the governor.

617
