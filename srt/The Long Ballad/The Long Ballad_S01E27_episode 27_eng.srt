1
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,899
♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:09,859
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:14,930
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,770
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:24,950
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,820
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,689
♫   Tears and regrets go hand in hand   ♫

8
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:34,690
♫  But my heart is still fiery-hot  ♫

9
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:37,740
♫  To the distance  ♫

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,709
♫  The miserable past is like a dagger  ♫

11
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:43,619
♫  Though my wings are broken  ♫

12
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:51,040
♫  I will keep flying  ♫

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,099
♫  Following the direction of the light  ♫

14
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:58,359
♫  I'll forget you  ♫

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:04,360
♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,359
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,309
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,370
♫  The river of life is under my feet  ♫

19
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:17,960
♫  I don't regret my craziness  ♫

20
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:32,699
   

21
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,259
   

22
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:39,340
   

23
00:01:55,059 --> 00:01:57,019
Xiao Wu.

24
00:02:00,379 --> 00:02:02,419
Wait for me.

25
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,039
Xiao Wu. Xiao Wu.

26
00:02:15,019 --> 00:02:17,260
Wait for me.

27
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,799
Don't leave me.

28
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:21,020
Xiao Wu.

29
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,280
Xiao Wu.

30
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,759
Princess. Princess.

31
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:35,560
Forgive me, please.

32
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,319
Where is Xiao Wu? Where is Xiao Wu?

33
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:41,298
I've ordered them to bury Xiao Wu.

34
00:02:41,298 --> 00:02:43,239
Please rest at ease.

35
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,840
I just had a dream.

36
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,120
In the dream, Xiao Wu was still alive.

37
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,498
But I don't know why he's running.

38
00:03:08,498 --> 00:03:13,440
He keeps running and doesn't want to come back to me.

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,479
Hao Du, is he still blaming me?

40
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,780
If not for me,

41
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,440
he wouldn't have been wounded and sick for long.

42
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,340
He would have lived well.

43
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,799
I promised to give him a cart of rice.

44
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,259
I would take him to Chang'an

45
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:53,620
to see the blooming spring and picturesque landscape.

46
00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:00,399
Now... it's all gone.

47
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:05,019
Princess, he left with a smile.

48
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:06,720
He didn't blame you.

49
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,119
Don't be sad.

50
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:14,920
Take me to him tomorrow.

51
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:19,319
I want to be by his side until the end.

52
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:23,979
Princess, you're not scared of me now?

53
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,240
After all these things, I'm not scared of death.

54
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,660
You? I'm not scared.

55
00:04:36,119 --> 00:04:39,719
I was scared of many things in the past.

56
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:45,040
Thinking of it, how ridiculous I was.

57
00:04:48,559 --> 00:04:51,740
Heaven rewards the good.

58
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,139
I've been guided to you by this amulet.

59
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:57,458
Now I return it to you.

60
00:04:57,459 --> 00:05:00,279
I wish it a blessing to you.

61
00:05:04,619 --> 00:05:06,458
Why do you have it?

62
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:08,239
It's a long story.

63
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:10,379
I found it in Hongyi Palace.

64
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:14,179
Maybe it's God's will.

65
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:17,740
If God pities me,

66
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,920
please bless the peace of all people.

67
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:25,220
I'm sure he will.

68
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,760
God will bless Great Tang.

69
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,939
It's God's will.

70
00:05:30,679 --> 00:05:32,800
Take it.

71
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,579
I hope it works till the end.

72
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,379
Please don't be upset.

73
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:42,618
Take care of yourself.

74
00:05:42,619 --> 00:05:46,258
I've been ordered to find a servant you're most familiar with to take care of you.

75
00:05:46,258 --> 00:05:48,400
She'll be here soon.

76
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,920
Thanks a lot.

77
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,919
Honestly, it's very lucky for you to come here.

78
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:04,859
You know what?

79
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,778
Liuyun Taoist Temple is a blessed land in the world.

80
00:06:07,779 --> 00:06:09,859
It's perfect with kindness and insight,

81
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,820
delivers all living creatures from difficulty.

82
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:15,740
You aren't listening to me, are you?

83
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,840
How rude this apprentice is.

84
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,220
   

85
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:33,720
   

86
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,398
Nice to meet you, Taoist Sun.

87
00:06:36,398 --> 00:06:39,458
Master has been talking about you. Finally, you're here.

88
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:41,658
Go to tell Master Taoist Sun's coming.

89
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:43,459
Okay.

90
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:46,180
Let's go inside.

91
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,960
This lady is...

92
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,260
She was picked by me.

93
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:59,340
She's in a bad mood; touchy now.

94
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:06,420
Please come in.

95
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,080
Are you better now?

96
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:20,700
Eat something.

97
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,140
Eat it.

98
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,959
Slow down.

99
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,719
Here, we help refugees.

100
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:33,959
They're very pitiful.

101
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:36,659
We help the poor people.

102
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:39,059
This way.

103
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,539
Liuyun Taoist Temple is divided into three yards.

104
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,600
Front, middle, and back.

105
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,139
This is the pharmacy, opposite Taoist Sun's exam room,

106
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,200
which is connected to the exam rooms in the front yard.

107
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,220
This is where Master lives.

108
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,920
Let's go to the backyard.

109
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:16,420
This is the backyard.

110
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,419
It's silent here with many rooms.

111
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:25,220
You can choose one to live in.

112
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:30,159
If you find yourself bored, come to me and A'Bi.

113
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,980
   

114
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:58,700
What are you looking at?

115
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:00,819
What is this place?

116
00:09:00,819 --> 00:09:02,898
Master always meditates here.

117
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:05,380
We call it the Silence Room.

118
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,600
   

119
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,260
Then let me live here.

120
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:35,190
   

121
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,660
Princess.

122
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:09,320
Death is final.

123
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,480
My condolences.

124
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:16,038
Please don't blame yourself.

125
00:10:16,038 --> 00:10:17,939
He had an unkind fate.

126
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:20,119
He took care of you a lot.

127
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,459
He was a righteous man.

128
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:26,338
If you can't reconcile with yourself,

129
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,080
we can ask for a reward for him when we arrive in Chang'an.

130
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,199
He won't care about that.

131
00:10:34,199 --> 00:10:36,260
Besides...

132
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,320
he's gone.

133
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,679
It's useless.

134
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,839
I hope one day that everyone in Great Tang won't need to

135
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,919
suffer from war, coldness, hunger, homelessness, or misery.

136
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:57,919
I hope everyone has food to eat, fields to farm

137
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:03,999
with no theft or danger.

138
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,499
I think it will be happy and peaceful days.

139
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:09,140
It will be.

140
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,459
We'll have that day.

141
00:11:28,659 --> 00:11:33,259
Xiao Wu, I'll eat this bowl of rice for you.

142
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:40,339
You won't be hungry anymore with so much rice.

143
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:06,220
   

144
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:21,520
 I'm not a disloyal man. 

145
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,000
 I didn't recognize you. 

146
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,970
 I apologize to you for my sister. 

147
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,400
 With me, you can't be starving, can you? 

148
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,219
   

149
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,920
   

150
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,769
Finally you're here, Princess.

151
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:23,689
I was so worried about you.

152
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,329
Thank God.

153
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,280
Please take a bath and put on clean clothes.

154
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,790
I'll help you.

155
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,009
Why are you crying?

156
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,800
I'm okay now.

157
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,939
I'm so glad to see you, Princess.

158
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,919
Take a rest first. I can do it myself.

159
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,380
But...

160
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,280
I can do it.

161
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:51,049
Okay. Call me anytime if you need me.

162
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,859
Princess rests here tonight.

163
00:14:05,859 --> 00:14:07,979
Keep your eyes open.

164
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,480
Yes, sir!

165
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,840
Who's the commander?

166
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,379
What brings you here so late at night?

167
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,649
A royal warrant.

168
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,340
I dare not waste time.

169
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,640
Please receive it, Commander.

170
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,560
   

171
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,159
Thanks a lot. Please report for me.

172
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,379
Princess Yongan has been found in Luoyang. She's fine.

173
00:14:56,379 --> 00:14:58,650
Please rest assured.

174
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,270
Yes.

175
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,560
Forgive me, please. I forgot you were...

176
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,249
I'll send some guards for you tomorrow. To protect you.

177
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:10,740
I came here for...

178
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,400
- I'll come tomorrow. 
 - Wait.

179
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,299
It's late now. You must have come here because of an emergency.

180
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:19,830
Yes.

181
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,670
I just received a handwritten letter from His Majesty from Chang'an.

182
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,770
Please have a look.

183
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:32,139
Crown Prince has left Chang'an to inspect the damage to show grace on behalf of His Majesty.

184
00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:34,640
He'll arrive in a few days.

185
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,149
Thank you for delivering the letter, Young Master Hao.

186
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:39,540
I'll read it later.

187
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,240
In that case, I won't hurry to go back.

188
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,750
The crown prince is young and naughty.

189
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,880
I have to look after him.

190
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,670
I can help you with that.

191
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:54,150
- But... 
 - I've decided it.

192
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:57,890
You have to stay with me in Luoyang for a while, Young Master Hao.

193
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:02,200
Princess, you've changed a lot.

194
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:06,380
What happened is a mixed blessing.

195
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,010
I lost, I gained.

196
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,470
Now I know what Father often said to me.

197
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,550
People live hard. How can we stand by?

198
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,200
I'm his daughter.

199
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,160
How can I stay ignorant?

200
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,530
You've suffered a great deal, haven't you?

201
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,680
I met many difficulties

202
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,050
and many people to express my gratitude, as well.

203
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,350
Difficulties will be gone,

204
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:40,500
but the gratitude will be cherished in my heart forever.

205
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,250
In the past, I only saw people's appearance.

206
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:51,140
Now I know I need to see what's in their mind.

207
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,460
Someone seems kind but hides a malicious heart.

208
00:17:55,460 --> 00:18:00,170
Someone has a cold face but a kind heart.

209
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:04,000
Just like you, Young Master Hao.

210
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,390
   

211
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,979
Why can't I master it?

212
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:16,439
 Your Dao is different. 
 (T/N: Dao: Taoism teaches about the various disciplines for achieving "perfection" by becoming one with the unplanned rhythms of the universe) 

213
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:19,319
 You can't do it. Give up now. 

214
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:21,580
Different Dao?

215
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:24,120
Where's the difference?

216
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,420
 In your opinion, what's my reason to defend Shuozhou? 

217
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,380
 Fights or surrenders are just the means 

218
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,079
 to guarantee that the citizens stay away from war and live a happy life. 

219
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,200
 These are the most important. 

220
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,460
 This is the Dao I stick to. 

221
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:58,520
   

222
00:19:59,719 --> 00:20:02,319
What exactly is my Dao?

223
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:09,998
Senior Qin, did Yuan fall asleep?

224
00:20:09,998 --> 00:20:12,559
- Yes. 
 - Okay.

225
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,099
We asked Luo Shiba to share messages with us.

226
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,338
But when we sent the message, she never wrote back.

227
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:22,079
Now she suddenly wanted to see us and would bring a friend to us.

228
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:24,130
A friend?

229
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,178
We have no progress so far.

230
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:33,239
Maybe this friend can bring some messages of Young Master.

231
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:43,000
Luo Shiba, here you are.

232
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,439
Your friend is...

233
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:49,959
Luo Shiba.

234
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:53,320
This is your friend?

235
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,940
Everyone listen, kill Ashile Sun to take revenge for the governor.

236
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,499
Wait.

237
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,940
About Gongsun Heng, I have a clear conscience.

238
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,779
Now Changge is missing.

239
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,739
I come here only to find her.

240
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,380
Find her?

241
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,218
It's you who took her to the grassland

242
00:21:19,219 --> 00:21:22,039
where she encountered misery, isn't it?

243
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:25,798
Luo Shiba, you don't know what Ashile Tribe means to us, do you?

244
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:27,439
How can you bring him to Great Tang?

245
00:21:27,439 --> 00:21:29,180
I only want to find her.

246
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,379
I'll find a way to find her even without your help.

247
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:34,080
You...

248
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,998
Ashile Sun, answer me.

249
00:21:36,998 --> 00:21:41,238
Did you provoke by posting up the notice that Commandant Li sacrificed for the country?

250
00:21:41,238 --> 00:21:43,159
It was me.

251
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,999
It was the best way to defend Commandant Li.

252
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:51,659
So what's your purpose to find her?

253
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,879
I have no purpose.

254
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:59,160
Only because... she's my friend.

255
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,320
Friend?

256
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,480
Commandant Li is your friend?

257
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,938
Senior Qin, you're confused by him.

258
00:22:06,938 --> 00:22:09,319
Do you believe he's a friend of Commandant Li's?

259
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:14,279
You should know how the whole city reviled Commandant Li.

260
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:19,839
It's Ashile Tribe's notice that subsided their rage.

261
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,959
Ashile Sun from Eagle Division is a master in archery.

262
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:27,619
Commandant Li was shot by him that day but survived.

263
00:22:27,619 --> 00:22:30,539
I felt strange at that time.

264
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,538
Now I know why.

265
00:22:33,538 --> 00:22:36,819
You're old friends.

266
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:40,880
So you put Commandant Li first.

267
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,799
How about the revenge for the governor and his wife?

268
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,639
The war always causes many casualties.

269
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:52,130
Ashile Sun granted the governor's wish

270
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,490
to save those citizens.

271
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:58,519
It's his mercy.

272
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:01,679
Xu Feng, it's not the moment for rash actions.

273
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,079
Now our goal is to find Young Master.

274
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:08,619
She has a special status. We can only search for her stealthily.

275
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,080
More hands, more power.

276
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,719
Get prepared, Xu Feng.

277
00:23:14,719 --> 00:23:18,419
Let's go to the city together.

278
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:21,599
Please.

279
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,019
Thanks a lot.

280
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,418
There's no need for that.

281
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:31,019
This way, please.

282
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,119
Where's the magistrate of Luoyang?

283
00:23:48,819 --> 00:23:51,420
Why hasn't he welcomed me by now?

284
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,880
He ignored me.

285
00:23:57,699 --> 00:23:59,859
Young Master Wei, the refugees are disturbing order outside the office.

286
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,418
They have enclosed the office.

287
00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:03,499
The people inside can't get out, and we can't get in.

288
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,538
Let's change the route.

289
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:05,818
Don't catch their eyes.

290
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,058
Yes.

291
00:24:07,059 --> 00:24:08,459
Wait!

292
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:14,019
Your Highness.

293
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:16,439
Father asked me to inspect Luoyang.

294
00:24:16,439 --> 00:24:19,300
He wanted me to observe what people are suffering.

295
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,280
Now I get to observe and be in charge.

296
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,339
Young Master Wei, go with me to the office.

297
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:30,100
I'll let the people know their

298
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:34,690
crown prince is the best one.

299
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:36,460
Your Highness.

300
00:24:39,219 --> 00:24:41,879
 Food! Food! 

301
00:24:41,879 --> 00:24:43,058
 Out! Get out now! 

302
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:44,359
 Food! 

303
00:24:44,459 --> 00:24:46,218
 We want food! 

304
00:24:46,219 --> 00:24:47,700
 Give us food! 

305
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,339
 Out now! Give us food! 

306
00:24:50,339 --> 00:24:51,979
 Food! We want food! 

307
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,280
 Get out! 

308
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,420
 Food! Get out! 

309
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,979
 Give us food! 

310
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,699
 Food! Get out! 

311
00:24:57,699 --> 00:24:58,880
 We want food! 

312
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,099
- Everyone listen to me! 
  - Get out! 

313
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:03,859
I'm the crown prince of this country.

314
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,779
 Food! Give us food! 

315
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,198
 - We want food!  
 - Stop shouting! I'm the crown prince!

316
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,899
 We want food! Food! 

317
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,940
 We want food! 

318
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,518
Crown Prince, are you really the crown prince?

319
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,880
 You want us to die of hunger. 

320
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,438
Everyone! Come here!

321
00:25:24,438 --> 00:25:25,739
Crown Prince is here!

322
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,580
Everyone! Come here! It's the crown prince!

323
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,619
Protect His Highness!

324
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,178
 Crown Prince is here. Come here. It's the crown prince. 

325
00:25:30,178 --> 00:25:32,339
 Crown Prince is here. Give me food. 

326
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:33,298
Wei Shuyu.

327
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,379
Stop them!

328
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,458
Don't let them get close to me.

329
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:36,259
Back off!

330
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,299
Don't hurt anyone. They're all ordinary people without any weapons.

331
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:43,218
 We want food! Food! We want food! 

332
00:25:43,218 --> 00:25:44,900
 We want food! 

333
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,698
 Crown Prince! Crown Prince! 

334
00:25:47,698 --> 00:25:49,919
 Give some food to us. 

335
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,860
Blood.

336
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,859
Blood. He's bleeding.

337
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,958
They're killing us. It's bleeding. He hit us.

338
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,938
I'm scared.

339
00:25:57,939 --> 00:25:59,058
Protect the prince and retreat.

340
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:02,199
Crown Prince can't be hurt. Retreat.

341
00:26:02,199 --> 00:26:04,418
 The guards beat us. 

342
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:05,178
Back off.

343
00:26:05,179 --> 00:26:07,718
 He beat me. They're killing us. 

344
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,058
 Crown Prince killed a man. 

345
00:26:10,059 --> 00:26:11,759
 Back off. 

346
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,640
What happened?

347
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:19,859
Princess, some refugees are creating a disturbance. No need to worry, Princess.

348
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:21,578
Will my brother arrive today?

349
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,540
It should be today.

350
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,439
Open the door.

351
00:26:24,439 --> 00:26:28,439
Princess, it's a mess out there, so please don't go out.

352
00:26:28,439 --> 00:26:30,580
I know them well.

353
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,338
They come from Yunzhou.

354
00:26:32,339 --> 00:26:34,659
I was one of them.

355
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,460
They're just too hungry.

356
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,180
Besides, my brother is coming.

357
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,760
It's okay if they know His Majesty sent Prince here to console them.

358
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,079
- But it's dangerous... 
 - Besides, you're with me, aren't you?

359
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,399
Princess, Young Master Hao. Crown Prince has arrived.

360
00:26:58,399 --> 00:26:59,979
His Highness is outside the door.

361
00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:01,060
Open the door.

362
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,479
But...

363
00:27:02,479 --> 00:27:05,580
- If... 
 - If the prince gets hurt, nobody can take responsibility.

364
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,639
I'll take care of Her Highness. Open it.

365
00:27:07,639 --> 00:27:09,040
Yes.

366
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,560
 They are killing us! 

367
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:19,958
 Guards are killing us. People are dying. 

368
00:27:19,958 --> 00:27:21,899
Young Master Wei, what should we do?

369
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,698
His Highness left us behind.

370
00:27:23,699 --> 00:27:25,178
We'll die of hunger in Luoyang.

371
00:27:25,179 --> 00:27:26,578
Nobody cares about us.

372
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:28,219
 - He's right. Nobody cares.  
- Everyone, listen.

373
00:27:28,219 --> 00:27:30,460
Please calm down and listen to me.

374
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,820
His Highness will never leave you behind.

375
00:27:34,579 --> 00:27:36,359
 Is it true? 

376
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,839
 Really? 

377
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,040
You're talking nonsense.

378
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,840
His Highness does not care about us.

379
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,859
 He's right. He doesn't care. 

380
00:27:45,859 --> 00:27:48,858
 We want food! He doesn't care! 

381
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,760
 We want food! 

382
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,800
 Give food to us. 

383
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,499
   

384
00:28:13,499 --> 00:28:16,320
The noble who can save you is coming.

385
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,058
Tell us what you want.

386
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:28,040
Why do you make a disturbance outside the office?

387
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,659
Who are you?

388
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,578
His Highness doesn't care about us.

389
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:33,499
How can you keep your word?

390
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,178
 Yes. He's right. 

391
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,420
 His Highness doesn't care about us. 

392
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:38,059
 - What can you do? Am I right? Yes. 
 - Yes. 

393
00:28:38,059 --> 00:28:39,259
- Please listen to me. 
  - What can you do? 

394
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,259
 What can you do? 

395
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:42,640
I'm Princess Yongan of Great Tang.

396
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,420
You have my word.

397
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,079
This country will never leave you alone.

398
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,818
Please don't worry.

399
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:52,779
Food, water, clothes, and beds. You'll have them all.

400
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,680
We have to face the difficulties of Luoyang together.

401
00:28:58,339 --> 00:29:00,299
 Really? 

402
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:02,938
 We won't die of hunger. 

403
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:04,739
 Yes. 

404
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,239
What are you doing?

405
00:29:16,239 --> 00:29:19,879
Your wound will fester if the bleeding doesn't stop.

406
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:23,518
- Don't move. 
 - I don't need it!

407
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:26,679
Hao Du.

408
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,979
You pretend to be injured and agitate these people.

409
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,820
What's your purpose?

410
00:29:39,499 --> 00:29:40,999
Answer me.

411
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:46,420
Very good. You don't answer me.

412
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,540
Then never answer me.

413
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,300
Hao Du, he did that because of starvation and fear.

414
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,119
Don't hurt him.

415
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,060
Do you see that?

416
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,160
Her Highness sympathizes with these kinds of people.

417
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,520
How can Her Highness leave you alone?

418
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:08,920
 Yes. He's right. Yes. 

419
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,719
 Brother Shuyu. 

420
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,680
Yueyan, it's you.

421
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:43,480
It's great. You're finally here.

422
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,119
I've been looking for you for such a long time.

423
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:54,178
I almost missed no relevant inch in the north lands.

424
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:56,219
I was afraid of losing you.

425
00:30:57,499 --> 00:31:01,640
Sorry, it's all my fault.

426
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:06,060
I lost you and made you suffer a lot.

427
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,900
Brother Shuyu, it's not your fault.

428
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,299
No one predicts good or bad fortune.

429
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:15,540
See? I'm fine.

430
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:20,020
But you've lost weight.

431
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:24,979
I dare not pile on pounds without finding you.

432
00:31:24,979 --> 00:31:29,799
Yueyan, tell me what happened from You State to Luoyang.

433
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,739
Many things happened during the journey.

434
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,660
If I hadn't experienced it,

435
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:39,319
I'd never know so much of the world

436
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:44,300
and only be a canary in a cage.

437
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,700
Please rest assured.

438
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:49,820
I won't let you suffer anymore in the future.

439
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,760
What's wrong?

440
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,960
Princess, please go and see the crown prince.

441
00:32:23,499 --> 00:32:24,660
Your Highness.

442
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:27,298
His Highness asked me to tell Your Highness that

443
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:30,379
His Highness is scared and suddenly has a fever.

444
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,218
I'm afraid His Highness can't meet refugees

445
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:34,219
in South Hill with Your Highness.

446
00:32:34,219 --> 00:32:35,779
He's ill?

447
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,380
Yes.

448
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,119
Your Highness.

449
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:43,420
His Highness was afraid of passing it to Your Highness.

450
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,959
Her Highness visits her younger brother. How dare you block the way?

451
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:48,139
If His Highness's condition is delayed,

452
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,539
you won't survive even with ten lives.

453
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,420
Don't pretend in front of me.

454
00:33:30,579 --> 00:33:32,200
Sister.

455
00:33:34,219 --> 00:33:36,439
Father sent you to Luoyang

456
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:39,060
to console the people who are suffering from the drought,

457
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,418
and build your image as a crown prince.

458
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:42,779
You're pretending to be ill here.

459
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,719
How could you do that?

460
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:48,580
Sister, you've seen that.

461
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,920
These people are not poor men but gangsters.

462
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,120
Look at them. With blood all over their faces,

463
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,659
they're making threatening gestures.

464
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,859
They've scared me to death.

465
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,139
Just thinking of them, my head is aching.

466
00:34:01,459 --> 00:34:03,260
I'm not going anywhere.

467
00:34:05,099 --> 00:34:09,899
Brother, I know that as a child,

468
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:13,239
when you're facing such situations, you'll be scared.

469
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:16,498
But you need to know that sooner or later,

470
00:34:16,499 --> 00:34:19,120
we have to take on the responsibilities on our own,

471
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,239
especially for you.

472
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:26,338
I know, Sister.

473
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:27,559
I really understand.

474
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:29,058
But I just arrived here.

475
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:31,619
Can you just give me a break?

476
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:34,300
I know what you're talking about.

477
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,659
Please be assured.

478
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:39,179
I'll grow up and be a man.

479
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:41,939
I'm the son of our father.

480
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,179
I heard you.

481
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:46,519
You need to do what you say.

482
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,000
I've experienced a lot in the past few months.

483
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,978
 I've some new understandings. 

484
00:34:53,979 --> 00:34:57,338
 Since we're taking from people in our land, in return, 

485
00:34:57,339 --> 00:35:00,059
we should give them a stable life.

486
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:04,880
Brother, do you know what a crown prince is?

487
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,540
It means you're the future of the country.

488
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,559
And you'll be the leader of our people.

489
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,239
Be a man, brother, like our father.

490
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:19,920
Win the trust of our people.

491
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,460
And be a wise emperor.

492
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,260
Hao Du.

493
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,398
You found Yueyan first.

494
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:50,899
Thank you.

495
00:35:52,299 --> 00:35:55,700
Have you accompanied her all this time?

496
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,980
What do you mean?

497
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,059
Nothing. I just felt regretful.

498
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:03,238
If I hadn't been recalled by His Majesty,

499
00:36:03,238 --> 00:36:07,199
I might have been the one who found Yueyan.

500
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,179
Does that matter?

501
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,180
It matters between you and me.

502
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,759
Is this because of Li Changge?

503
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,939
Protect the crown prince well.

504
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,859
Don't lose His Highness again.

505
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:24,540
Hao Du, Yueyan wouldn't have been left alone in that state

506
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,300
if you didn't insist on hunting Li Changge.

507
00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:29,419
Are you finding yourself some excuses?

508
00:36:29,419 --> 00:36:31,419
I can take responsibility.

509
00:36:31,419 --> 00:36:35,298
I just want you to know those who are obsessed with something

510
00:36:35,299 --> 00:36:37,299
will easily get lost.

511
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:56,879
A'Bi.

512
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,420
Mr. Situ.

513
00:36:59,439 --> 00:37:01,339
What's wrong?

514
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:03,800
What has Changge done to you?

515
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,058
Nothing, really.

516
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:08,979
Ever since she came into the house, she hasn't slept or eaten anything.

517
00:37:08,979 --> 00:37:12,379
I've checked her several times, but she keeps staring at the writing on the wall.

518
00:37:12,379 --> 00:37:14,279
She hasn't moved at all.

519
00:37:14,279 --> 00:37:17,700
Is there something wrong with her?

520
00:37:18,339 --> 00:37:21,500
Look at her. She's just as stubborn.

521
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,499
I've told her she can't make it, she just doesn't listen.

522
00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:26,239
I'll check her out.

523
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,619
Good to see you, Mr. Situ.

524
00:37:31,099 --> 00:37:32,799
Master.

525
00:37:32,799 --> 00:37:35,859
Can I talk to her?

526
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:46,860
   

527
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,820
The night you came,

528
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,400
I was just passing by.

529
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,139
I saw you practicing swordsmanship in the middle of the night.

530
00:38:08,139 --> 00:38:14,580
You've stayed in the Silence Room ever since you came to our temple.

531
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,479
Do you have any thoughts?

532
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,220
I've been taught by my teacher since childhood.

533
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,799
I've read books from all classes of authors.

534
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,720
I've never liked the thought of non-interference of Taoism.

535
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:31,520
To struggle with people, you can find your refuge.

536
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,619
To struggle with people, you can achieve your pursuit.

537
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:38,560
For all these years,

538
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,999
I've held a strong belief in it.

539
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,380
But in these few days,

540
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,400
I started to realize that

541
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,420
I was wrong.

542
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:54,219
If I hadn't struggled,

543
00:38:54,219 --> 00:38:59,800
someone like my real brother wouldn't have died for me.

544
00:39:02,199 --> 00:39:04,220
If I hadn't struggled,

545
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:09,079
someone who has treated me like his daughter wouldn't have died for me.

546
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,700
If I hadn't struggled,

547
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:16,850
someone who had given all he had to me wouldn't have been in danger,

548
00:39:19,479 --> 00:39:24,500
while his dear family wouldn't have died for me as well.

549
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:30,720
One senior saved my life

550
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,679
and taught me to find my own Tao.

551
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:36,679
Non-interference.

552
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,579
This is the way.

553
00:39:41,439 --> 00:39:43,540
God bless us all.

554
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:48,679
If you really think in this way, you've spent some good time

555
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:51,678
in this Silence Room.

556
00:39:51,678 --> 00:39:53,959
What about now?

557
00:39:55,479 --> 00:39:58,679
Dead people are gone forever.

558
00:39:58,679 --> 00:40:01,360
I've wasted so much time on this.

559
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:05,219
It's really precious for us to be enlightened.

560
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,699
There are lots of refugees in Luoyang.

561
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,659
We're busy helping those in need.

562
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:14,439
If you have time,

563
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:18,039
you can help me and Taoist Sun.

564
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:21,519
Everything in Taoism is about people.

565
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,120
We should appreciate the world we live in.

566
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:29,100
Dwelling in the past will only bring you more trouble.

567
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,220
   

568
00:41:05,779 --> 00:41:07,679
From the way she talks,

569
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:10,298
Master must know that she is not an ordinary person.

570
00:41:10,299 --> 00:41:14,519
Do you want to hear more about her story?

571
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:17,138
What are you talking about?

572
00:41:17,138 --> 00:41:18,419
Things come and go.

573
00:41:18,419 --> 00:41:20,600
People come and go, too.

574
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,780
I've never asked.

575
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,578
But I do miss the old times.

576
00:41:24,579 --> 00:41:27,440
When I was of her age,

577
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,799
I also regarded myself as the smartest person in the world.

578
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:39,420
It seems that you and she have some connections.

579
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,119
Tell me about it.

580
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:44,718
In this world, we all come and go.

581
00:41:44,718 --> 00:41:47,099
We share the same fate.

582
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:51,478
Will you come to South Hill with me tomorrow?

583
00:41:51,478 --> 00:41:55,800
I heard that there are more refugees than we have here.

584
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:57,659
Sure.

585
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:03,440
If we can encounter some rare diseases, that'll be worth trying.

586
00:42:04,259 --> 00:42:05,959
Have some tea.

587
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,859
I'm so glad to see you eat something.

588
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,338
I've been worried about you.

589
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:18,978
I heard that Taoist Sun has tried so hard to save you.

590
00:42:18,979 --> 00:42:21,139
Would you like to get changed now?

591
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:44,659
Isn't it beautiful?

592
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,519
Liuyun Taoist Temple is the most beautiful place in Luoyang.

593
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,438
The one you just talked to is our master, Taoist Jingdan.

594
00:42:51,438 --> 00:42:54,699
She has sheltered many refugees suffering from the drought.

595
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,640
She is such a nice person.

596
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,538
She wants to know your plan for the future.

597
00:42:59,539 --> 00:43:02,799
Taoist Sun is going to stay in Luoyang for some days.

598
00:43:02,799 --> 00:43:06,540
Are you going back to your hometown or staying here?

599
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:12,139
My hometown is somewhere I can never go back.

600
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,260
I'll stay.

601
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,779
That'll be great. I've got a mate.

602
00:43:17,779 --> 00:43:21,538
Except for us, Tianjing and Liu'er also live here.

603
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:23,160
We're about the same age.

604
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,659
We can be good friends.

605
00:43:25,659 --> 00:43:28,499
I'm A'Bi from Family Wang. What's your name?

606
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:32,299
 Since Changge is no longer in Great Tang, 

607
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
 I'd avoid some troubles. 

608
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,640
I have no family name.

609
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:43,959
Call me A'Li.
