I'm telling you... The poisoning incident, you're lucky to escape it.

You won't have much luck next time!

24
00:01:58,077 --> 00:02:01,679
Are these pastries for your princess?

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,239
So delicate.

26
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,554
Well, what a pity!

27
00:02:06,555 --> 00:02:08,010
What do you mean?

28
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,521
Nothing.

29
00:02:09,521 --> 00:02:13,911
I just want to warn you to remember who you are!

30
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:15,918
Young Khan cannot help you forever!

31
00:02:15,918 --> 00:02:18,200
Nobody can prevent...

32
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,040
what Noble Princess wants!

Changge!

Have you seen Changge?

35
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,099
She's gone to learn embroidery.

36
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,100
She wants to send Noble Princess a gift.

37
00:02:52,043 --> 00:02:53,804
Hasn't she come back yet?

38
00:02:54,988 --> 00:02:56,613
What's going on?

39
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,454
Nothing...

40
00:02:58,455 --> 00:03:01,118
I want to invite her to have dinner.

41
00:03:01,118 --> 00:03:04,160
Shall we go out to find her?

42
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,699
They said she had left a while ago.

43
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,880
Where can she go?

44
00:03:15,661 --> 00:03:17,589
Mimi.

45
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:19,810
What do you know?

46
00:03:26,616 --> 00:03:28,659
Shouldn't Crown Prince be in Taiji Palace?

47
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,404
Why does he come to such a remote place?

48
00:03:30,404 --> 00:03:35,129
He was afraid that you would be recognized by others,

49
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:37,593
so he chose to meet you in the outlying area.

50
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:40,249
It's good for you.

51
00:03:40,249 --> 00:03:41,930
When did you become his servant?

52
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,370
Quite a long time ago.

53
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,104
- Tell me when.
- It's been too long...

54
00:03:46,105 --> 00:03:48,979
I can't remember the exact time...

55
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,690
Here we are!

56
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,989
If it's a long time ago,

57
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,993
I think it should be before the change of the reign title.

58
00:03:55,994 --> 00:03:58,630
But how can I know nothing about you?

59
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,469
Please rest assured.

60
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:06,549
His Highness is in the room. Let's talk inside.

61
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,419
Tell me!

62
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,949
Who sent you here?

63
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,590
What do you want as his servant?

64
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:15,450
Let's talk with him in the room.

65
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:24,119
You're really smart, Princess.

66
00:04:24,119 --> 00:04:26,415
That's why my master asked me to be cautious.

67
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:28,490
Unfortunately...

68
00:04:29,094 --> 00:04:32,410
<i>[Sifang Pavilion]</i>

69
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:38,304
Brother Sun.

70
00:04:38,305 --> 00:04:39,615
Where did you go?

71
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:41,850
I haven't seen you for a whole day.

72
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,990
Where's Changge?

73
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:47,104
You haven't seen her for a whole day?

74
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:48,215
No.

75
00:04:48,216 --> 00:04:50,950
I thought you were out playing.

76
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,949
The curfew is coming soon.

77
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:02,590
If she doesn't come back till curfew, she must be in trouble.

78
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,270
Let's talk inside.

79
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:25,879
I think it's Princess Yicheng who did it.

80
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,149
She tried to poison Zhixi and pinned his death on Changge.

81
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:30,837
As she failed, she wanted to kidnap her.

82
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:32,415
- I have to go find her.
- Hold on!

83
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,009
It is useless.

84
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,515
Maybe I can find help from She'er.

85
00:05:36,515 --> 00:05:38,550
They won't trust you.

86
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,170
Unless you kill me.

87
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,604
Pretend to assassinate me later.

88
00:05:46,604 --> 00:05:50,350
Maybe it's the only way to can gain Yicheng's trust.

89
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,050
Then you can approach She'er.

90
00:05:53,727 --> 00:05:59,270
Wait... Don't you think you've gone too far in order to rescue Changge?

91
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:10,410
How dare you rush into my mother's room at night?

92
00:06:13,994 --> 00:06:16,730
Who is roaring here?

93
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,815
Where's Changge?

94
00:06:20,816 --> 00:06:22,504
You're joking?

95
00:06:22,505 --> 00:06:24,149
Your people are missing.

96
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,615
Why do you ask me?

97
00:06:25,616 --> 00:06:29,149
In Chang'an, only you want to harm her.

98
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,149
Ashile Sun.

99
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:35,369
The reason why I haven't exposed your identity before the envoys

100
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:37,526
is that I didn't want to embarrass you.

101
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:41,960
But now, how could you offend me for a princess of Great Tang?

102
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,450
If the public knows it, it'll humiliate the grasslands.

103
00:06:50,727 --> 00:06:53,870
Ashile Sun! Behave!

104
00:06:56,448 --> 00:07:00,937
Khatun is my savior! Don't try to harm her!

105
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,680
Brother Sun!

106
00:07:26,222 --> 00:07:28,040
Are you okay?

107
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:32,243
I told you to use a juggler's knife but you refused.

108
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,760
See how much pain you must be in!

109
00:07:38,644 --> 00:07:40,109
Yicheng is so cunning.

110
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:42,221
She wouldn't believe it unless we used a real knife.

111
00:07:42,222 --> 00:07:44,160
She won't trust a fake one.

112
00:07:44,777 --> 00:07:46,265
Mimi has shown me mercy.

113
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:47,654
The wound is slight.

114
00:07:47,654 --> 00:07:52,457
I only hope that she can get Changge's news without a hitch.

115
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:54,687
Think it over after you have applied the medicine.

116
00:07:54,688 --> 00:07:56,099
Don't use it.

117
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:59,460
Here's the best wound medicine of Monan. Quite effective.

118
00:08:00,327 --> 00:08:01,804
Why are you hesitating?

119
00:08:01,804 --> 00:08:03,149
Let me help you.

120
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,830
Come on.

121
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:12,795
I see. You must be shy, right?

122
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:14,479
I'll do it myself.

123
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:18,400
Well... I'll put it here.

124
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,830
Call me if you need help. I'll be outside the door.

125
00:08:45,572 --> 00:08:47,106
Tell me.

126
00:08:47,838 --> 00:08:50,114
What?

127
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:52,498
You've been working for my mother.

128
00:08:56,705 --> 00:09:00,299
As you're her slave, it means you're also mine.

129
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,470
Serve me by sleeping with me tonight.

130
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:25,690
Come on.

131
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,770
Why?

132
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:11,743
Why do you sacrifice yourself to save Changge?

133
00:10:13,233 --> 00:10:16,369
Did you think I wouldn't be able to learn your tricks?

134
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:18,570
How can you hurt him?

135
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:31,610
Go ahead.

136
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,171
What's your plan?

137
00:10:33,172 --> 00:10:35,060
She'er... I...

138
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:37,130
I won't tell my mother.

139
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,670
She'er!

140
00:10:41,438 --> 00:10:43,579
Your mother captured Changge!

141
00:10:43,579 --> 00:10:47,182
Please save her!

142
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:49,637
How dare you accuse my mother?

143
00:10:49,638 --> 00:10:51,304
No... I don't...

144
00:10:51,305 --> 00:10:54,837
Your mother gave me a potion to kill Zhixi.

145
00:10:54,838 --> 00:10:59,510
What she wanted was to frame Changge...

146
00:11:17,772 --> 00:11:19,310
She'er.

147
00:11:20,116 --> 00:11:26,049
I know you've been waiting for a long time to reunite with your mother,

148
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:30,730
and it's quite hard for you to violate your mother's will.

149
00:11:31,383 --> 00:11:36,830
Well, I really have no other choice but to seek you for help.

150
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:41,870
I beg you. Please save Changge! Please!

151
00:11:44,627 --> 00:11:49,550
I'm willing to come back... to serve you.

152
00:11:51,475 --> 00:11:55,826
You're willing to sacrifice yourself to save Changge?

153
00:11:55,827 --> 00:11:57,870
Without her,

154
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:02,230
I would have been killed on the grasslands.

155
00:12:10,359 --> 00:12:12,342
I'm not helping you.

156
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:16,463
I want to know the answer, too.

157
00:12:17,872 --> 00:12:20,889
I know it's all a manipulation by my mother,

158
00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:22,990
but I refuse to admit it.

159
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:26,240
Maybe it's time to know the answer tonight.

160
00:12:27,189 --> 00:12:30,149
How could a delicate woman in my eyes

161
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:33,190
take charge of Khan's Tent step by step?

162
00:12:37,461 --> 00:12:40,429
Your Highness, Sheng Xin succeeded.

163
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,029
Good.

164
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,200
He's worthy of my fondness.

165
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,399
Li Changge can't be dead now.

166
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,399
I need to use her as my hostage to threaten Li Shimin.

167
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:52,015
She's the crux to break their alliance.

168
00:12:52,016 --> 00:12:54,570
- Don't let her escape.
- Yes.

169
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,050
By the way.

170
00:12:58,189 --> 00:13:00,190
Sheng Xin...

171
00:13:01,461 --> 00:13:04,326
doesn't need to go back to Li Chengqian.

172
00:13:04,327 --> 00:13:05,482
What?

173
00:13:05,483 --> 00:13:09,059
Can't you understand my words?

174
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,619
Yes, I can.

175
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,837
I see. I'll go to the cabin of the western suburb right now.

176
00:13:13,838 --> 00:13:15,715
Hold on.

177
00:13:15,715 --> 00:13:19,149
Let Sheng Xin bid farewell to Li Chengqian formally.

178
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,459
Then you can do what I've told you.

179
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,393
Don't bring yourself any trouble.

180
00:13:23,393 --> 00:13:26,430
Yes, Your Highness, I understand.

181
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,739
Changge is at a cabin in the western suburb. You go get her!

182
00:13:36,739 --> 00:13:39,220
Zhenzhu! Tell Wei Shuyu to save her!

183
00:13:40,122 --> 00:13:42,778
- Well...
- What about you?

184
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:45,540
You can go first. I'll wait for you here.

185
00:13:58,077 --> 00:13:59,387
Go!

186
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:01,233
Don't try to escape, Princess.

187
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:03,109
You can't escape.

188
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:05,721
Your life is quite valuable.

189
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:08,143
You want to use me as your hostage?

190
00:14:08,144 --> 00:14:10,140
You really think highly of me.

191
00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:12,821
Take her away.

192
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:14,400
Go!

193
00:14:28,894 --> 00:14:31,782
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

194
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,069
You can't kill me! I'm Crown Prince's servant!

195
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:42,319
No one can survive if the public knows Li Changge's identity!

196
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,889
You can't kill him! He's registered by East Palace.

197
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:47,629
We'll be suspected if you kill him.

198
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,993
Mobei can't break with Great Tang now.

199
00:14:49,994 --> 00:14:52,270
You will be suspected!

200
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:00,270
Let's go.

201
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,989
Soldiers! Mobei envoy conspires to assassinate Crown Prince!

202
00:15:13,989 --> 00:15:15,604
And they even want to kill me!

203
00:15:15,604 --> 00:15:17,310
Anyone here!

204
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:19,870
Soldiers!

205
00:15:23,872 --> 00:15:24,837
Sun...

206
00:15:24,838 --> 00:15:26,293
Let's go!

207
00:15:35,889 --> 00:15:37,390
Don't chase.

208
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:39,704
They've gone far.

209
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:41,093
Check here and find survivors.

210
00:15:41,093 --> 00:15:42,590
Yes!

211
00:16:09,827 --> 00:16:12,989
Sun, you shouldn't have killed Sheng Xin.

212
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,860
We shouldn't have provoked them.

213
00:16:14,861 --> 00:16:16,990
If I couldn't find you tonight,

214
00:16:18,016 --> 00:16:20,130
I would kill even Yicheng!

215
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:27,310
Don't act recklessly.

216
00:16:31,638 --> 00:16:34,890
Oh, my! I'll find a doctor for you!

217
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,482
No!

218
00:16:36,483 --> 00:16:39,610
Pretend to know nothing about it.

219
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:45,190
Brother Sun, I'm a girl and I can...

220
00:16:47,294 --> 00:16:49,090
Medicine!

221
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:51,837
Fine.

222
00:16:51,838 --> 00:16:53,530
Here you are.

223
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,670
Bear it.

224
00:17:04,438 --> 00:17:06,970
- Bring me more medicine.
- I see.

225
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,882
I shouldn't let you get hurt again.

226
00:17:21,883 --> 00:17:23,910
I'm fine.

227
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:28,996
Well, I think they won't let go of it.

228
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,904
The Emperor of Tang still needs you to help him with the alliance.

229
00:17:34,905 --> 00:17:36,949
He won't abandon you so easily.

230
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,726
We need to bring him benefits.

231
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:41,299
It's the same in the grasslands.

232
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,904
Find a balance.

233
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:47,690
I won't kill Yicheng at the time but I won't let her go easily.

234
00:17:48,372 --> 00:17:52,490
Changge, do you believe me?

235
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:34,890
Here's the medicine.

236
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,410
Thank you.

237
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,209
What? Who was killed?

238
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:18,482
Report to your Highness. Here's your servant, Sheng Xin.

239
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:20,330
What?

240
00:19:26,116 --> 00:19:30,271
Hurry! Remove the white cloth and let me see!

241
00:19:45,629 --> 00:19:47,490
Who?

242
00:19:49,661 --> 00:19:51,830
Who did it?

243
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,937
I'll investigate and report to Your Highness.

244
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:02,030
Catch the murderer!

245
00:20:02,589 --> 00:20:07,670
If you can't find the murderer within two hours,

246
00:20:10,016 --> 00:20:14,070
you... you will be punished as well!

247
00:20:26,372 --> 00:20:29,593
Your Highness! Bad news!

248
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:31,510
Sheng Xin died!

249
00:20:33,688 --> 00:20:35,276
And Li Changge has been rescued!

250
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:36,987
Who dropped the hint?

251
00:20:36,988 --> 00:20:40,100
Please forgive me. I haven't found it out.

252
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,810
<i>No need.</i>

253
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:47,059
I did it.

254
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:57,422
Mother, who is he?

255
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,109
My bodyguard.

256
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:01,319
Can a bodyguard go in and out at will?

257
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,476
Can he confer with you about how to murder at any time?

258
00:21:04,477 --> 00:21:05,978
What do you mean?

259
00:21:05,978 --> 00:21:08,580
I heard your conversation last night.

260
00:21:10,033 --> 00:21:13,532
Mother, I want to know one thing.

261
00:21:13,532 --> 00:21:18,473
What you have done is it for our Ashile Tribe or the Sui Dynasty?

262
00:21:20,388 --> 00:21:24,943
As for you, am I Khatun of Ashile Tribe,

263
00:21:24,944 --> 00:21:29,240
a princess of Sui, or your mother?

264
00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:34,099
No matter who I am,

265
00:21:34,938 --> 00:21:37,737
I will be your mother forever.

266
00:21:37,738 --> 00:21:41,279
We're connected by blood.

267
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:43,899
King of Grasslands or Emperor of Sui,

268
00:21:43,899 --> 00:21:49,589
my only purpose is to let my son take charge of everything!

269
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:52,776
Have you asked whether I want it or not?

270
00:21:52,777 --> 00:21:54,800
You're my son.

271
00:21:55,377 --> 00:21:59,120
It's what you're born to do.

272
00:22:00,477 --> 00:22:02,280
Mother...

273
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:05,950
I used to think you were quite delicate.

274
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,150
And now I think you're like a stranger.

275
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:23,040
<i>[Sifang Pavilion]</i>

276
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,100
<i>What is going on?</i>

277
00:23:02,105 --> 00:23:03,829
Is the bodyguard of Mobei Princess here?

278
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:05,780
Please come out.

279
00:23:08,211 --> 00:23:09,980
- Search!
- Yes!

280
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:29,043
You're bold enough to admit what you've done. Great!

281
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:32,287
As you're here, please come with me.

282
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:33,849
Fine.

283
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:36,619
But I need to announce one thing here.

284
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,103
Go ahead.

285
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,899
I am the General of Eagle Division, Ashile Sun!

286
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,504
I killed them last night.

287
00:23:45,505 --> 00:23:47,360
<i>Ashile Sun?</i>

288
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,593
<i>He's Ashile Sun!</i>

289
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,450
<i>He killed them?</i>

290
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:55,590
Khatun and Young Khan of Ashile Tribe

291
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,449
ordered me to stay with the Mobei Princess,

292
00:23:58,449 --> 00:24:03,230
and to find chances to kill her and the Crown Prince of Tang!

293
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,960
My dear son...

294
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:19,560
thinks that I'm like a stranger.

295
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:24,033
Mother, I'm sorry.

296
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:25,800
Tell me.

297
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:29,920
Should I hate your uncle?

298
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,499
Why did he tear us apart?

299
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,260
Why did he engage my son to revolt against me?

300
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,565
I dare not.

301
00:24:39,566 --> 00:24:41,190
Dare not?

302
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,829
You've ruined my plan.

303
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,380
Are you going to ask me to surrender to Great Tang?

304
00:24:46,866 --> 00:24:51,460
Mother, I just feel terrible doing so.

305
00:24:54,022 --> 00:24:58,830
Khatun! Tang soldiers have come to capture Young Khan!

306
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,440
What?

307
00:25:04,855 --> 00:25:08,510
Khatun, the murderer Ashile Sun has told me

308
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,780
that Young Khan and you are the manipulators.

309
00:25:16,888 --> 00:25:18,640
What a joke!

310
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,970
Are you trying to make

311
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:24,744
an enemy of Ashile only by his words?

312
00:25:24,744 --> 00:25:26,233
Don't panic, Khatun.

313
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,560
As long as I find out the truth,

314
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,310
we'll know whether you're innocent or not.

315
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:32,888
Anyway, I have to bring Young Khan back for inquiry.

316
00:25:32,888 --> 00:25:35,899
Otherwise, I cannot explain to Crown Prince.

317
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,977
How dare you!

318
00:25:37,977 --> 00:25:39,500
<i>Mother!</i>

319
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,211
People from the Ashile Tribe are frank and forthright.

320
00:25:50,211 --> 00:25:52,640
As Great Tang wants to find the truth,

321
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,160
a clean hand wants no washing.

322
00:25:57,333 --> 00:25:59,100
She'er...

323
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:23,199
Your Highness, why is he...

324
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:27,600
He's punishing me.

325
00:26:56,637 --> 00:26:58,527
Sun!

326
00:26:59,788 --> 00:27:01,000
Changge!

327
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,088
Changge! You're injured! Why did you come out?

328
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:06,298
It's you who let me have the sedative last night!

329
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:08,370
You know what he wants!

330
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,488
Brother Sun didn't tell me his plan.

331
00:27:10,488 --> 00:27:12,854
He only came to find my help.

332
00:27:12,855 --> 00:27:15,333
I should have thought of it. Since he likes you so much,

333
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,444
he can do everything for you.

334
00:27:18,444 --> 00:27:21,977
He wants to drag the Ashile Tribe into the mire for you.

335
00:27:21,977 --> 00:27:23,590
I...

336
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,422
Could you please go to find His Majesty for help?

337
00:27:26,422 --> 00:27:27,965
Ask him to spare their lives!

338
00:27:27,966 --> 00:27:31,744
Actually, it's no good for General Sun not to let Young Khan off.

339
00:27:31,744 --> 00:27:34,178
I don't care what Yicheng asks you to do.

340
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:35,720
I can't do it.

341
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:39,066
Changge, you're the only one who can solve it!

342
00:27:39,066 --> 00:27:43,160
Only you can go and beg His Majesty to spare their lives.

343
00:27:43,811 --> 00:27:46,032
I know the sage better than you.

344
00:27:46,033 --> 00:27:47,770
What is a sage?

345
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,587
He can abandon his life to boost Tang,

346
00:27:50,588 --> 00:27:53,040
so how can he let an Ashile man off?

347
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,220
Now, Sun sends She'er to Great Tang as a hostage.

348
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,350
He's risking his life

349
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,920
to bring more chances for the alliance.

350
00:28:03,288 --> 00:28:05,780
No matter how hard the future is,

351
00:28:06,433 --> 00:28:09,060
I will keep on doing it.

352
00:28:10,777 --> 00:28:13,020
I will find a way.

353
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:26,820
Tell me! "Defense" and "Control" of Six Secret Strategic Teachings!

354
00:28:30,055 --> 00:28:34,403
If you only want a crown prince who's always impeded by others

355
00:28:34,403 --> 00:28:36,926
and will let a suspect off,

356
00:28:38,194 --> 00:28:40,514
it'll be a disappointment to you.

357
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,300
Now, what I know is the law.

358
00:28:49,633 --> 00:28:52,119
Good.

359
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,470
Fang.

360
00:28:53,471 --> 00:28:57,756
From now on, capital crimes should be judged by the officials

361
00:28:57,756 --> 00:29:01,629
higher than the 4th rank and the directors of six departments.

362
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:04,210
Avoid injustice and abuse as much as possible!

363
00:29:04,211 --> 00:29:08,329
Make his playmate's death clear.

364
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,360
Leave no doubts!

365
00:29:29,911 --> 00:29:31,432
Sorry about that.

366
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:34,240
You're all my intimate officials,

367
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,140
so I didn't evade you.

368
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,040
Your Majesty,

369
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:46,033
my opinion is to follow up on the victory.

370
00:29:46,033 --> 00:29:48,850
Though it's Crown Prince's intimate servant who got killed,

371
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:53,539
actually, the inciter, Ashile Tribe, tried to kill Crown Prince.

372
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:56,333
So we should execute the Ashile man.

373
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:59,377
Then we can establish the alliance by chance.

374
00:29:59,377 --> 00:30:02,230
Therefore, they won't stop us

375
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:05,901
from allying with the tribes.

376
00:30:05,901 --> 00:30:10,060
I've never thought I could

377
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:13,140
agree with you once.

378
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:19,788
Ashile Khatun is in Sifang Pavilion.

379
00:30:19,788 --> 00:30:22,920
Since her only son has been arrested,

380
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,450
she has no response.

381
00:30:25,455 --> 00:30:26,766
It's abnormal.

382
00:30:26,766 --> 00:30:29,180
It seems things are not as smooth

383
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:33,140
as Minister Du's expectation.

384
00:30:36,244 --> 00:30:38,466
Your Majesty, rumors are all over the city.

385
00:30:38,466 --> 00:30:40,331
It's said Ashile Tribe stations their troops in the west

386
00:30:40,331 --> 00:30:42,871
in order to attack the tribes of the desert.

387
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:52,450
<i>We shouldn't have come here!</i>

388
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,072
<i>- We've heard nothing from the head.
- So do I.</i>

389
00:30:55,072 --> 00:30:57,890
It seems we shouldn't have come here!

390
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:00,137
We thought to find us a backer.

391
00:31:00,138 --> 00:31:02,743
But we almost lost our homeland.

392
00:31:02,744 --> 00:31:04,988
We got into trouble ourselves!

393
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,366
What about Monan?

394
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:07,800
None can survive.

395
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,820
Ashile Tribe will soon attack our homeland!

396
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,940
<i>It's a dilemma!</i>

397
00:31:14,894 --> 00:31:18,209
What about my father? Can he tackle it?

398
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,280
Your Highness, he asked you to stay here.

399
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,770
Do not go back.

400
00:31:22,772 --> 00:31:26,770
As he said so, it must be...

401
00:31:28,161 --> 00:31:32,230
You! You... and all of you!

402
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:36,149
Haven't I told you not to provoke the Ashile Tribe?

403
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:38,400
<i>Don't provoke them!</i>

404
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,350
You made it yourselves!

405
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:46,519
Fortunately, our Tiele Tribe has been spared.

406
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,180
See!

407
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,305
What's good to ally with Great Tang?

408
00:31:51,305 --> 00:31:53,661
I suggest you leave early the following morning.

409
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:57,571
Can Great Tang save you when they begin to fight?

410
00:31:57,572 --> 00:31:59,389
<i>Sounds reasonable. What should we do?</i>

411
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:01,860
<i>He's right. We can't ally. We need to protect ourselves!</i>

412
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,816
<i>- Let's leave tomorrow!
- We can't ally!</i>

413
00:32:04,816 --> 00:32:06,990
- Let's leave tomorrow.
<i>- Leave here!</i>

414
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:09,650
<i>Let's leave tomorrow!</i>

415
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:13,405
<i>- That's right.
- Yes! Good choice!</i>

416
00:32:13,405 --> 00:32:16,970
As long as we leave, they must retreat.

417
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:20,894
I think Ashile Tribe will be magnanimous enough to forgive you.

418
00:32:20,894 --> 00:32:25,882
<i>- He's right!
- They must forgive us so let's leave!</i>

419
00:32:25,882 --> 00:32:30,699
<i>- Then shall we leave tomorrow?
- Yes. Let's leave tomorrow!</i>

420
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,610
<i>Deal!</i>

421
00:32:36,427 --> 00:32:38,350
Her Highness wants to see you.

422
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,190
Changge, I know about everything.

423
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:45,360
I heard you were injured. Are you okay?

424
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,710
D-Do you have any news of Sun?

425
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:50,272
Chengqian seems to be mad and wants to kill him.

426
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:54,570
But don't worry. He'll be safe at the moment.

427
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,649
- Are you...
- I'm fine, Yueyan.

428
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,950
Don't worry about me.

429
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,949
By the way, the Ashile Tribe is going to attack.

430
00:33:02,949 --> 00:33:05,259
Does he have any methods to deal with it?

431
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,104
The news comes all of a sudden

432
00:33:08,105 --> 00:33:10,410
and my father hasn't gotten news from the troops.

433
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,549
It takes a few days to deliver a message

434
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,440
but its speed is even faster than the scouts'.

435
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,086
How can it spread all over Chang'an so soon?

436
00:33:18,086 --> 00:33:20,736
Such a trick to disturb people's minds.

437
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:29,390
Yueyan, do you dare take one more risk with me?

438
00:33:40,805 --> 00:33:45,050
Thanks to you. The envoys of each tribe don't suspect.

439
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,800
They all thought these letters were from their leaders.

440
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,450
Even Monan Princess thought

441
00:33:55,450 --> 00:34:00,040
the letter was from Yinan.

442
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:05,690
They believe that Ashile's troops are in the west.

443
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:09,490
Maybe they'll leave Chang'an in a few days.

444
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,090
It must be Commander Yang.

445
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:32,710
Oh, my! A ghost!

446
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,340
<i>[Sacrifice To Be Made for Peace]</i>

447
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,030
You traitor! I'll beat you to death!

448
00:34:56,616 --> 00:34:58,930
He's pretty tough...

449
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,690
How vicious he is!

450
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,989
He united Ashile to murder me and used my death to ruin the alliance.

451
00:35:09,989 --> 00:35:11,227
I'll take him away.

452
00:35:11,227 --> 00:35:15,027
By the way. All the letters inside are fake!

453
00:35:15,027 --> 00:35:17,050
You can take them away!

454
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,660
It's Yicheng's trick.

455
00:35:35,661 --> 00:35:38,230
Let's see what else she can do.

456
00:36:01,394 --> 00:36:06,630
<i>She'er, you'll know me sooner or later.</i>

457
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,561
Your Highness!

458
00:36:08,561 --> 00:36:10,810
Your Highness! Bad news!

459
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,438
Chihe seems to have met with a mishap!

460
00:36:12,438 --> 00:36:16,372
I noticed Li Changge and the Tang princess's bodyguard left the pavilion.

461
00:36:16,372 --> 00:36:18,319
Then I went to the dwelling of the Tiele Tribe,

462
00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:21,437
but I found nobody but a mess there.

463
00:36:21,438 --> 00:36:24,630
Here's what I found.

464
00:36:27,572 --> 00:36:29,872
It's the ornament of Tiele's important official.

465
00:36:29,872 --> 00:36:32,590
But it's not Chihe's.

466
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:36,627
Here... Who can wear it...

467
00:36:38,083 --> 00:36:42,282
is Zhixi... Zhixi is still alive.

468
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:45,880
Mimi Guli didn't kill him!

469
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:53,670
I will let her see how Buzhen and Mu Jin die in front of her!

470
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,599
Besides, if Li Shimin wants to harm my son,

471
00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:00,204
I'll ruin both his daughter and Great Tang!

472
00:37:00,204 --> 00:37:02,570
Yes, Your Highness!

473
00:37:05,227 --> 00:37:06,361
<i>Where are they?
[High Virtues Should Not Be Confused]</i>

474
00:37:06,361 --> 00:37:08,237
<i>What are they going to do?</i>

475
00:37:08,237 --> 00:37:10,326
<i>What is Great Tang going to do?</i>

476
00:37:10,326 --> 00:37:12,549
<i>Why did they call us to gather in the early morning?</i>

477
00:37:12,549 --> 00:37:15,810
<i>What to do if Ashile Tribe attacks us?</i>

478
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,693
That's true!

479
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:19,388
Is it useful to lock us here?

480
00:37:19,389 --> 00:37:23,870
If Ashile Tribe ruins our tribe and breaks our family,

481
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,438
why should we stay here to be their ally?

482
00:37:25,438 --> 00:37:28,130
Please be at ease.

483
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:33,169
They didn't attack your tribes. It's false.

484
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:34,999
<i>False news?</i>

485
00:37:34,999 --> 00:37:37,771
Your Highness, what do you mean?

486
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:39,660
Ashile didn't dispatch troops.

487
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,850
They don't want to attack the desert.

488
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:49,830
Bring them in.

489
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,479
He's Zhixi of the Tiele Tribe.

490
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,027
- He didn't die!
- He's still alive!

491
00:38:01,027 --> 00:38:03,449
<i>He's alive! What's happened?</i>

492
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:06,039
<i>Why is he still alive? I witnessed his death!</i>

493
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:06,989
<i>With my own eyes!</i>

494
00:38:06,989 --> 00:38:10,693
Attention, please. I am Zhixi. I didn't die.

495
00:38:10,693 --> 00:38:15,370
Chihe had long since been bribed by the Ashile Tribe.

496
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,549
Since we arrived at Great Tang, he's instigated me to oppose Tang.

497
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:24,526
He even tried to kill me to break the alliance.

498
00:38:24,527 --> 00:38:30,990
Maybe I would've already been killed without Mobei Princess's help.

499
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:37,680
<i>Princess? It's late. What's going on?</i>

500
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,470
<i>Let's talk inside.</i>

501
00:38:46,672 --> 00:38:48,609
<i>To cut a long story short,</i>

502
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:51,999
<i>Ashile Tribe wants to frame me by killing you with poison.</i>

503
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:54,749
<i>They want to ruin the alliance between the desert tribes and Great Tang.</i>

504
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,250
<i>What? Nonsense!</i>

505
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:00,149
<i>Don't make conclusions in a rush.</i>

506
00:39:00,149 --> 00:39:03,090
<i>You'll know it tomorrow.</i>

507
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,060
<i>The medicine can make you bleed from the mouth and nose.</i>

508
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,250
<i>Just like death from the poison.</i>

509
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,630
<i>But it won't kill you.</i>

510
00:39:16,283 --> 00:39:17,472
<i>What on earth do you want to say?</i>

511
00:39:17,472 --> 00:39:19,959
<i>You won't trust me now.</i>

512
00:39:19,959 --> 00:39:23,869
<i>You'll know what I mean when someone tries to kill you tomorrow.</i>

513
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:27,609
<i>Using it or not, it's all up to you.</i>

514
00:39:27,609 --> 00:39:31,472
<i>Though you haven't lied, why do you want to help me?</i>

515
00:39:31,472 --> 00:39:33,230
<i>I'm not helping you.</i>

516
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,690
<i>It's all for the desert tribes.</i>

517
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:41,570
<i>Ashile Tribe will control us forever without the help of Great Tang.</i>

518
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:52,326
<i>I can't understand it.</i>

519
00:39:52,327 --> 00:39:56,250
I didn't trust her at first.

520
00:39:56,250 --> 00:40:01,710
But on the following day, things happened as she predicted.

521
00:40:06,694 --> 00:40:08,072
<i>Envoy Zhixi.</i>

522
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:13,440
<i>Your maid isn't well today, so she asked me to send your breakfast.</i>

523
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,890
<i>I see.</i>

524
00:41:49,494 --> 00:41:53,970
Why did Mobei Princess know all the things

525
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,989
and prepare the medicine for him to play dead?

526
00:41:55,989 --> 00:41:57,649
He's right.

527
00:41:57,649 --> 00:42:02,649
Ashile Tribe threatened my maid to frame me,

528
00:42:02,649 --> 00:42:06,293
but they underestimated our relationship.

529
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:10,750
Princess found that I acted weird that day.

530
00:42:15,183 --> 00:42:17,610
<i>It's time to repay our princess.</i>

531
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:23,210
<i>Put the poison in Zhixi's food and frame Li Changge with it.</i>

532
00:42:24,272 --> 00:42:28,250
<i>Think about your young brother.</i>

533
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,450
<i>Mimi.</i>

534
00:42:41,872 --> 00:42:44,183
<i>What's wrong? Why are you so panicky?</i>

535
00:42:44,183 --> 00:42:47,210
<i>I'm... I'm fine...</i>

536
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:52,250
<i>Yicheng threatened you?</i>

537
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,929
<i>Changge.</i>

538
00:42:56,929 --> 00:43:02,828
<i>She asked me to poison Zhixi and frame you</i>

539
00:43:02,829 --> 00:43:05,250
<i>in order to ruin the alliance.</i>

540
00:43:06,769 --> 00:43:08,339
<i>She's so malicious!</i>

541
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:12,050
<i>How can she kill a person so easily only to break the alliance?</i>

542
00:43:14,289 --> 00:43:18,190
<i>Since she's threatened you, just do as she said.</i>

543
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:20,440
<i>Don't let her bring you trouble later on.</i>

544
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:23,130
<i>- But...
- Don't worry.</i>

545
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:25,669
<i>There's a way to fool her.</i>

546
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:29,280
<i>Take it easy. I'll protect you from danger.</i>

547
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,326
<i>Let Zhixi play dead first.</i>

548
00:43:31,327 --> 00:43:32,969
<i>We can clarify it after that.</i>

549
00:43:32,969 --> 00:43:35,720
<i>Will he be willing to do so?</i>

550
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,010
<i>It's a gamble. But...</i>

551
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:41,370
<i>I bet he will.</i>

552
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:48,837
I wouldn't have believed it If I hadn't personally experienced it.

553
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:51,672
The reason why I've hidden all along

554
00:43:51,672 --> 00:43:56,530
was because I wanted to see how unbearable they can be!
