22
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:51,739
Stop!

23
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:59,059
Who are you? What are you doing here?

24
00:01:59,059 --> 00:02:00,779
I recently joined the Battalion of Slaves.

25
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,418
And I happened to pass by.

26
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:03,860
Passing by?

27
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,979
What about the guards on the ground?

28
00:02:06,979 --> 00:02:08,578
I have no idea.

29
00:02:08,578 --> 00:02:11,579
When I passed by, they had been sleeping.

30
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:12,819
What a glib tongue.

31
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,619
If you don't tell the truth, I'll cut out your tongue.

32
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,020
I...

33
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,140
Aunt A'Yi'er, why are you here?

34
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,719
He is a slave from Khatun's tent?

35
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:44,339
Aunt A'Yi'er, thankfully you're here in time.

36
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,579
Otherwise, he wouldn't be okay.

37
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:50,138
By the way, I didn't do anything to him.

38
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:52,880
Please let Khatun forgive us.

39
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:02,260
Don't wander around anymore.

40
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:18,299
Get up! Get up!

41
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,059
What's wrong with you?

42
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,199
Please forgive us, General.

43
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,279
We're too tired from the night shift.

44
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:25,419
Somehow we fell asleep.

45
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,478
Such an important prisoner.

46
00:03:26,478 --> 00:03:28,279
How dare you fall asleep?

47
00:03:28,279 --> 00:03:30,198
Guards! Take them away.

48
00:03:30,198 --> 00:03:31,599
<i>Yes.</i>

49
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:33,600
General! It won't happen anymore.

50
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,280
Send more people to guard here day and night.

51
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,819
<i>- General!
- Yes.</i>

52
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,299
Greetings to Khatun.

53
00:04:03,939 --> 00:04:06,920
We're both women from the Central Plains.

54
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:12,340
I prefer to be called Princess Yicheng.

55
00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:15,480
How did Princess know...

56
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,820
How did I know that you were a woman?

57
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,379
People here might think we all look similar.

58
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:28,440
I used to be like you, loving to wear men's clothes.

59
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:31,680
How can't I know it?

60
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:34,039
Good insight, Princess.

61
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:39,400
A'Yi'er, fetch some medicine and food to this...

62
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,099
I still don't know how to call you.

63
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,139
I'm Li Changge.

64
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,719
Do it.

65
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,579
Why do you want to save General Luo?

66
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,498
You misunderstood, Princess.

67
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:01,259
I'm new in the capital and I got lost.

68
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,178
That's why I went to the prison by mistake.

69
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:05,898
No need to hoke me with these lies.

70
00:05:05,899 --> 00:05:07,119
If I wanted to harm you,

71
00:05:07,119 --> 00:05:10,220
I wouldn't have let A'Yi'er take the risk of saving you.

72
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,819
Princess wants to know why I would like to save General Luo.

73
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,139
But I wonder why Princess saved me.

74
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:21,840
You must have suffered a lot.

75
00:05:23,179 --> 00:05:26,950
Otherwise, such a young girl like you

76
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:29,340
wouldn't be so alert.

77
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:34,600
But if you want to survive here,

78
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,899
it's good to be wary.

79
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:40,618
I helped you because I don't want to see

80
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:45,679
you dying here with General Luo.

81
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,278
Princess is the daughter of an emperor of Sui.

82
00:05:49,278 --> 00:05:51,178
You married here for Great Sui.

83
00:05:51,179 --> 00:05:53,320
Though many years passed,

84
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,480
your reputation for righteousness

85
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,579
is still well known in Central Plains.

86
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,300
And people highly praise it.

87
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,580
Changge, Sui doesn't exist anymore.

88
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,740
Now we're just people from Central Plains.

89
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,000
Sorry for my slip of the tongue.

90
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,080
Princess,

91
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,160
General Luo has been fighting in battles with my father for years.

92
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:22,219
He helped my whole family a lot.

93
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,280
I've respected General Luo since little.

94
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,178
And I take him as an elder of my family.

95
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,380
That's why I took the risk.

96
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,440
Your father worked for Luo Yi before?

97
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,879
Yes.

98
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,219
No wonder. I see.

99
00:06:38,219 --> 00:06:41,699
When Sui still existed, General had been staying in Zhuojun

100
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,819
and protecting the territory.

101
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:47,520
He's a loyal, brave, and righteous hero.

102
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,620
I admire him,

103
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,118
but I can't do anything.

104
00:06:52,118 --> 00:06:56,040
To protect you, I've taken a huge risk.

105
00:06:56,659 --> 00:07:00,119
Princess, I don't understand.

106
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,199
It's the first time that we have met.

107
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:05,120
Why are you so frank with me?

108
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,919
Because we two are so similar.

109
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:12,458
I also heard about what you did in Weishui.

110
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:14,139
If I guessed it correctly,

111
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,680
it was you that saved the emperor of Tang, right?

112
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,540
On behalf of people in Central Plains,

113
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,820
I have to kowtow to express my gratitude.

114
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,860
You protected Central Plains from wars.

115
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,799
Please get up, Princess.

116
00:07:32,939 --> 00:07:36,759
Princess, that's too much.

117
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,920
In that case,

118
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,459
how about us thinking of a way to get General Luo out?

119
00:07:43,459 --> 00:07:45,100
That's an impossible task.

120
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,259
Khan's Tent is like a huge prison.

121
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,758
No one can escape.

122
00:07:50,758 --> 00:07:52,519
But you're Khatun.

123
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,300
What you can do is surely much more than what I can.

124
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,778
You don't understand.

125
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:58,539
Though I'm Khatun,

126
00:07:58,539 --> 00:08:01,639
I'm only a woman they don't believe from Central Plains.

127
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:03,680
Great Khan...

128
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:07,558
Never mind.

129
00:08:07,558 --> 00:08:09,059
But...

130
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,780
We're both homeless people

131
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,819
wandering here in the poor northern region.

132
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:21,039
Changge, please try to survive.

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,359
A'Yi'er, put those things there.

134
00:08:44,599 --> 00:08:46,379
<i>I'm back.</i>

135
00:08:48,339 --> 00:08:51,539
I dare not go too far away, so I just walked around.

136
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,740
Thankfully, there is some dry wood.

137
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,980
What are you drawing?

138
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,658
Nothing.

139
00:09:00,659 --> 00:09:03,340
I'm bored, so I just draw it for fun.

140
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:13,680
Is this... your family?

141
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,658
You miss your parents, Xiao Wu?

142
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:23,059
No.

143
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,179
I don't even remember what they look like.

144
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,780
How can I miss them?

145
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:31,159
Then they must look like this.

146
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,180
Here.

147
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,338
So ugly.

148
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:41,520
Just like you now.

149
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,059
You're the same.

150
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,939
I don't survive depending on my appearance.

151
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,478
But you do. You're so ugly.

152
00:09:46,478 --> 00:09:48,859
I'm afraid you can't get married in the future.

153
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:56,860
You're coughing again.

154
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,059
I'm not cold. Cover yourself.

155
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,338
You're my little brother.

156
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:03,379
You don't need to pretend in front of your sister.

157
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,139
Understand?

158
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,479
Xiao Wu,

159
00:10:11,479 --> 00:10:14,440
missing someone isn't a humiliating thing.

160
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,899
I also miss my father very much.

161
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:19,660
I'll tell you a secret.

162
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,139
I even felt angry with him before.

163
00:10:22,139 --> 00:10:23,419
Why?

164
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,100
Because he was always very busy.

165
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,780
He didn't even have time to see me.

166
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,959
But now I can understand.

167
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,119
Though he's my own father,

168
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:37,780
he's more than my own father.

169
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:41,660
There is famine everywhere now.

170
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:44,419
He must be working very hard.

171
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:46,880
I don't know whether he is getting some good rest or not.

172
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,059
Why doesn't he look for you?

173
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,579
He must have looked for me.

174
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:53,539
But it's such a big world.

175
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,560
How can he know where I am?

176
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,258
Therefore, as long as we hold on together,

177
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:02,499
when we're in Luoyang, things will go well.

178
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:06,659
At that time, I'll take you to Chang'an and meet my father.

179
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:09,100
Chang... Chang'an?

180
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,880
That's my hometown.

181
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,479
When we're in Changan, we won't need to wander from place to place,

182
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:16,979
or fight against anyone for food.

183
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,379
You can eat whatever you want.

184
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,700
And I'll teach you

185
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,658
literature, etiquette, music, and poems.

186
00:11:25,659 --> 00:11:27,939
If you really want to learn martial arts,

187
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,980
I'll find famous teachers for you and teach you that.

188
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,600
If you like freedom,

189
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,238
I can take you to see

190
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:37,979
the beautiful scenery and great mountains in Chang'an.

191
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,640
As long as we're in Luoyang,

192
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,939
things will be better.

193
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,519
<i>I hope one day,</i>

194
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,900
<i>it'll be a peaceful and harmonious world.</i>

195
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:23,800
It's been a long time since I saw someone from my hometown.

196
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,959
Princess.

197
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,379
Do you miss your home?

198
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,880
I can't go back anymore.

199
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,440
But you still have a chance,

200
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:49,880
have a chance to go back to Central Plains,

201
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,300
to our hometown.

202
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,660
If it happens one day,

203
00:12:56,659 --> 00:12:59,520
please look at it for me

204
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,399
whether it has changed or not.

205
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:05,919
All right. I promise.

206
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:14,059
Child, don't make impulsive actions.

207
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,080
Being alive matters most.

208
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,040
Thank you.

209
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,860
You can go back.

210
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,739
Why are you here?

211
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,099
Great Khan asked me to accompany him in his tent.

212
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,900
I can't walk around at will.

213
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,898
I can only come out secretly to meet you.

214
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:34,558
Don't take the risk of coming here anymore.

215
00:14:34,558 --> 00:14:36,359
I'm fine.

216
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:38,430
Someone changed the dressing for you.

217
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,719
It was Princess Yicheng.

218
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:45,279
She also sent me some food and medicine.

219
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,199
Changge, in the capital, don't trust anyone except me,

220
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,330
even though she's from Central Plains.

221
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,040
Okay.

222
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,860
Kurultai is coming soon.

223
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,779
I'll try to get you out of here.

224
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,599
Sun, General Luo Yi is here.

225
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:07,218
Li Changge, are you crazy?

226
00:15:07,219 --> 00:15:09,579
That's General Luo. I can't just leave him here.

227
00:15:09,579 --> 00:15:10,900
You want to get Luo Yi out. Impossible.

228
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,180
I still have to take the risk.

229
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,819
I hope at that time, you won't stop me.

230
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,420
Li Changge, please stay alive.

231
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,699
I have to go.

232
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,219
<i>Great!</i>

233
00:16:09,819 --> 00:16:10,658
<i>Who's that?</i>

234
00:16:10,659 --> 00:16:12,218
<i>I can't believe you don't know her.</i>

235
00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:13,299
<i>She's Great Khan's</i>

236
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,879
<i>most cherished wife.</i>

237
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:16,280
<i>Really?</i>

238
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:21,700
<i>She's so pretty.</i>

239
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,980
Khan.

240
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,120
How dare you!

241
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,479
My tent isn't a place that you can come and go at your will.

242
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,798
I haven't been here for only three months.

243
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:21,019
And now I can't even enter it?

244
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,440
Khan is indeed fickle.

245
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:30,038
In Dingxiang, how is it going with the orphans and widows of Sui?

246
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:32,299
Please be assured, Khan.

247
00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,139
Empress Xiao and the little Prince of Sui

248
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:38,019
are now well-behaved after my "guidance."

249
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,200
They wouldn't dare cause any trouble.

250
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:45,159
Khan.

251
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:49,079
When Khan Shule picked up Empress Xiao and the little prince,

252
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:51,999
he promised to treat them well.

253
00:17:51,999 --> 00:17:53,400
But now...

254
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,600
Now I'm Khan, not Shule.

255
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,839
Are you trying to restrain me with Shule's rule?

256
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,379
I dare not do that.

257
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,559
However, Khan, if you do it in this way,

258
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,979
I'm afraid you'll lose the support of the people in Dingxiang.

259
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,859
There are only tens of thousand of people in Dingxiang.

260
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:17,619
And they're all from Central Plains.

261
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,280
It doesn't matter whether I lose it or not.

262
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,938
I think you're worried about losing Shule's son's support.

263
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,239
That's not it.

264
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,818
I haven't blamed She'er for what he did

265
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:32,839
during this expedition to the south.

266
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,920
I haven't looked into it.

267
00:18:36,219 --> 00:18:40,680
On behalf of She'er, I've expressed my gratefulness for your grace.

268
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:45,580
I better go so I won't disturb you, Khan.

269
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:55,058
Khan, after this journey, I'm so tired.

270
00:18:55,059 --> 00:18:57,859
Look. After one cup, it's all gone.

271
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,760
Yicheng!

272
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,859
Haven't you heard Madam Jinse saying that she's thirsty?

273
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:10,019
I've heard that.

274
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,058
Then come and serve her the wine.

275
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:16,220
Do you want me to personally do it?

276
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:30,019
Thank you, Khatun.

277
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,740
Why are you just standing there?

278
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,700
Look at her.

279
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:05,740
Useless!

280
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,899
You can't even serve the wine.

281
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,259
So useless.

282
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:17,299
You look so unpleasant again.

283
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,880
It was you that sent her to me.

284
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,760
Now you look like this for who to see?

285
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,219
Get out!

286
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:32,879
Yes, Khan. I'll take my leave.

287
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,379
You're so pretty.

288
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:52,019
Khatun, that's too offensive.

289
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:53,859
Khatun, are you okay?

290
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,298
Please don't mind.

291
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:57,798
You'll always be the only Khatun.

292
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,320
Sorry for what you saw, General Shixin.

293
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,979
I'm fine.

294
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,938
Go and get Changge here.

295
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,819
And don't get noticed by others.

296
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,600
Khatun.

297
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:55,780
Who hurt you?

298
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:00,599
Was that Great Khan?

299
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:05,699
I didn't ask you to come here to care about my situation.

300
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,558
How can Great Khan hurt you?

301
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:09,480
You're Khatun.

302
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:11,979
I'll help you to save General Luo.

303
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,270
Why?

304
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,919
I've had enough!

305
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,579
I've had enough of staying here.

306
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:25,820
People only know I'm a Princess of Great Sui.

307
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,759
And I marryied here out of my willingness

308
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,419
for righteousness and peace.

309
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,160
But no one knows what I've been going through all these years.

310
00:22:40,239 --> 00:22:42,980
Thirty years ago,

311
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,900
I got married to Khan Qimin.

312
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,380
When he died,

313
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,560
his son Khan Shibi married me.

314
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:59,220
Then it was Khan Shule.

315
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:03,940
And the last time, it's Yanli.

316
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:09,119
I'm also a woman from Central Plains.

317
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:11,680
I've been educated since I was a young girl,

318
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,019
but now I'm so disgraced like this.

319
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,399
I can't even see my own son.

320
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:21,519
You have a son?

321
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:25,480
You've seen him.

322
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,219
She'er.

323
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:28,939
She'er?

324
00:23:28,939 --> 00:23:32,300
But I can only be Yanli's Khatun,

325
00:23:33,199 --> 00:23:36,160
not my son's mother.

326
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:42,058
Great Khan forced She'er to swear that if he meets me secretly,

327
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:47,139
I'd be cursed by the God of Sirius and I'd die immediately.

328
00:23:47,139 --> 00:23:50,419
I didn't expect She'er was your son.

329
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:52,259
Changge.

330
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,679
She'er is a good boy.

331
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:01,379
Though he's a little impatient, he won't harm you.

332
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:07,539
Listen, Kurultai is a great festival here.

333
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:09,859
Leaders from all tribes will come.

334
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,859
Today, Great Khan will host those aristocrats.

335
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,458
After Kurultai, tomorrow morning,

336
00:24:15,459 --> 00:24:19,298
Great Khan will go hunting with these leaders.

337
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:21,079
At that time...

338
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,179
Why were you in Khatun's tent?

339
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,280
I didn't really expect that.

340
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,899
You enchanted Ashile Sun and Mimi Guli.

341
00:24:57,899 --> 00:25:01,240
Now, you even enchanted Khatun.

342
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,199
You really seek by all means to achieve your plan.

343
00:25:03,199 --> 00:25:04,779
What are you trying to say?

344
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,418
You try in every way to get close to her. What do you want?

345
00:25:07,418 --> 00:25:11,079
She'er, she misses you very much.

346
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,958
You're not qualified to mention her.

347
00:25:13,958 --> 00:25:17,039
She's living a hard life now.

348
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,999
Shut up!

349
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,360
You... You have no Adam's apple.

350
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,519
You're a woman!

351
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,160
<i>Don't worry. I'm fine.</i>

352
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,080
<i>I'll return to Eagle Division safely.</i>

353
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,698
That's why.

354
00:25:44,699 --> 00:25:48,799
I was still wondering how Mimi could fall in love with a man so soon,

355
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,619
and why Ashile Sun cares about a man so much.

356
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,439
What do you want?

357
00:25:53,439 --> 00:25:56,619
Now you're under my control.

358
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,380
If you don't want Ashile Sun to see your dead body, just do as I tell you.

359
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,000
Khatun told me you're a good boy and you won't hurt people.

360
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,600
Shut up.

361
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,740
What I do has nothing to do with her.

362
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:13,279
If Great Khan knew Ashile Sun brought a woman

363
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,539
who knows how to shoot arrows and has set my Wolf Division up,

364
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:19,899
what would Great Khan do to Ashile Sun?

365
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,040
What do you want?

366
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,579
You have to do exactly as I tell you.

367
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,579
<i>Drink it.</i>

368
00:26:41,439 --> 00:26:43,419
<i>Come here.</i>

369
00:26:43,419 --> 00:26:44,840
<i>Open your mouth.</i>

370
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,720
<i>Let me fill this up.</i>

371
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,240
<i>Drink. Cheers.</i>

372
00:26:57,459 --> 00:27:00,000
<i>Fill it up. Cheers.</i>

373
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,780
<i>Cheers.</i>

374
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,639
<i>Come. Drink it.</i>

375
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,700
<i>Fill it up.</i>

376
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,179
Kurultai is a great festival here.

377
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:43,178
You're all invited here.

378
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:45,739
Allow me to toast to you.

379
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:47,200
<i>Thank you, Great Khan.</i>

380
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,180
Thank you, Great Khan.

381
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:01,919
Why hasn't She'er arrived?

382
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,558
Great Khan, Young Khan must have been delayed by something.

383
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:10,520
I'll take a look.

384
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:39,239
I'm late.

385
00:28:39,239 --> 00:28:41,339
I'm sorry for that, Uncle Khan.

386
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,320
You're so late.

387
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,219
Have a seat.

388
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,779
Why are you hiding?

389
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,159
Serve the wine for me.

390
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:39,379
One more.

391
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,460
She'er, the slave beside you

392
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,860
looks really pretty.

393
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:55,780
Uncle Khan, she's just a slave from my tent.

394
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,159
She's nothing special.

395
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:00,580
Today, I asked her to dress up

396
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,299
and liven things up here in Kurultai.

397
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:06,199
You're really in the mood.

398
00:30:06,199 --> 00:30:13,099
But this slave... I think she looks quite familiar.

399
00:30:13,099 --> 00:30:17,979
In our tent, when did such a beauty join here?

400
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,298
Can't our pretty Khatun satisfy you, Khan?

401
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:28,919
What kind of beauty do you want?

402
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:34,719
Look at you, you're not making any sense.

403
00:30:34,719 --> 00:30:37,159
Was I wrong?

404
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:40,279
Khan can't be too greedy.

405
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:45,300
Khatun was the prettiest lady of Central Plains.

406
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:49,079
Khatun, am I right?

407
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:58,998
Enough. You're not qualified to talk here.

408
00:30:58,998 --> 00:31:02,860
Everyone, cheers.

409
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:14,739
You.

410
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:18,760
Go serve the wine for my brother Sun.

411
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:26,539
Can't you understand?

412
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,040
What do you think?

413
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:20,499
Don't you think it tastes better?

414
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:46,579
Father, I want to toast to you and ask for an award.

415
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:52,659
What do you want, Sun?

416
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,660
Just go ahead.

417
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:59,299
Except for people from Khatun's tent, I can give you anything.

418
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:07,339
Today is Kurultai.

419
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:10,279
I want to duel according to custom.

420
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,620
I want to challenge She'er.

421
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:21,060
If I win, give me the slave next to him as reward.

422
00:33:26,219 --> 00:33:31,298
You two were both taught by Khan since little.

423
00:33:31,299 --> 00:33:32,779
In our Ashile Tribe,

424
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:35,899
you two's martial arts are among first-class.

425
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:40,140
If you two duel, that would be spectacular.

426
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,179
She'er, do you want to accept that?

427
00:33:51,199 --> 00:33:55,500
Uncle Khan, since General Sun invited me,

428
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,700
how can I refuse?

429
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:02,619
But I also want some reward.

430
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,799
What do you want?

431
00:34:13,299 --> 00:34:16,879
Since Ashile Sun wants the slave from my tent,

432
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:22,140
if I win the duel, I want the female slave called Mimi Guli in your tent.

433
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,840
<i>Mimi.</i>

434
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,960
Good!

435
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,839
You two duel for the beauty.

436
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,320
That's a much-told tale of our Ashile Tribe.

437
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,120
I'll allow it!

438
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:22,619
I remember when you two were little, you fought for a little wolf.

439
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:27,700
After so many years, you two will fight for women.

440
00:35:28,939 --> 00:35:32,459
You two are like the lions.

441
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,619
And you're the glory of Ashile Tribe.

442
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:39,880
Warriors always fight for honor and belief.

443
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,439
Try your best!

444
00:35:49,439 --> 00:35:52,979
Things that happened years before haven't been solved yet.

445
00:36:01,299 --> 00:36:02,859
Good!

446
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,250
Give up now. Otherwise, you'll be disgraced.

447
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,560
That can't happen.

448
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,020
Do you know how she suffered at my place?

449
00:36:35,979 --> 00:36:38,160
Enough! Stop!

450
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,778
You are brothers!

451
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:41,720
Shut up!

452
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:07,400
She'er!

453
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:17,399
You lost!

454
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,680
<i>Great!</i>

455
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,200

00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:48,180

480
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,879
Let's go.

481
00:40:38,779 --> 00:40:41,879
She'er, you're Khan Shule's son.

482
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:45,590
You're the real descendant of the God of Sirius here.

483
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,099
But today on the Kurultai, in front of all leaders,

484
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,699
you were defeated by Sun.

485
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,760
Do you want a man from Central Plains to govern here?

486
00:40:58,579 --> 00:41:00,519
Uncle Khan.

487
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,719
Great Khan.

488
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,479
I don't want to leave the capital.

489
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,520
Why?

490
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,379
I belong here, so I want to follow my master.

491
00:41:30,379 --> 00:41:32,779
I don't want to change to another master.

492
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,460
Have you heard that? Ashile Sun,

493
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,539
even a slave doesn't want to follow you.

494
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:46,180
Shut up!

496
00:41:50,059 --> 00:41:56,460
Sun, I'll let people tie her up and send her to your Eagle Division.

00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,000
No need.

498
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,600
This female slave has made me sick.

499
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,139
Just let her stay with She'er.
