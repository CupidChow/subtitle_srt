1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,049
♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,009
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,970
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,720
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,990
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,770
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

7
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,640
♫   Tears and regrets go hand in hand   ♫

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,740
♫  But my heart is still fiery-hot  ♫

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,690
♫  To the distance  ♫

10
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,660
♫  The miserable past is like a dagger  ♫

11
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:43,570
♫  Though my wings are broken  ♫

12
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:51,380
♫  I will keep flying  ♫

13
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,149
♫  Following the direction of the light  ♫

14
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:58,409
♫  I'll forget you  ♫

15
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,410
♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

16
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,310
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,360
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

18
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,420
♫  The river of life is under my feet  ♫

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,400
♫  I don't regret my craziness  ♫

20
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:32,579
   

21
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:36,919
   

22
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,529
Military Governor gave me the command

23
00:01:38,529 --> 00:01:41,230
of coming to take over Gongsun Heng's token.

24
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,629
Where's the token?

25
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:44,690
Give it to me!

26
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:47,687
The thieves are so fast!

27
00:01:47,687 --> 00:01:49,210
Let's go!

28
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:01,869
Madam, you'd better step aside.

29
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,909
Don't force us to hurt you.

30
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:07,710
This is the Manor of the Gongsun Family, not your office.

31
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,429
No matter what you want to take over,

32
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:13,229
I cannot give you for I'm a woman.

33
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:17,389
I have to wait for my husband and listen to his order.

34
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,570
You'd better cooperate with us.

35
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,349
The earlier you give it to me,

36
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,448
the earlier he can get rid of the suspicion.

37
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:27,709
Then you could reunite soon.

38
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:30,826
As Governor Gongsun has been detained,

39
00:02:30,826 --> 00:02:34,237
his end is all up to the military governor.

40
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:38,749
It's not the time for you to annoy us.

41
00:02:38,749 --> 00:02:40,589
What a coincidence.

42
00:02:40,589 --> 00:02:43,608
While I'd been accompanying Gongsun Heng

43
00:02:43,609 --> 00:02:46,793
all the time when he went on expeditions,

44
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:50,789
your sarcastic comments can't scare me.

45
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:54,380
Then don't blame me for being rude to you.

46
00:03:01,261 --> 00:03:02,260
Who's there?

47
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,510
Who did it?

48
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:08,088
You can say whatever you want but do not be impudent

49
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:09,989
in front of my master.

50
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,190
Governor isn't here and Madam cannot decide for him.

51
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,369
You can discuss it with me.

52
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,929
Can you decide for them?

53
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,680
Since My Lord has been arrested by you, do I have other choices?

54
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,650
Madam, if you believe in me,

55
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,470
you can let me handle it

56
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,693
then you can go back to look after Yuan.

57
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:32,780
Thanks for the trouble.

58
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,450
That's fine.

59
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:40,310
Sirs, please follow me.

60
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:55,749
i&gt;Oh, my goodness!

61
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:57,727
Gosh! Thieves in the house!

62
00:03:57,727 --> 00:03:58,972
Nonsense!

63
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:01,760
How can they come to steal here? Are you kidding me?

64
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,760
Though I haven't counted all the losses,

65
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:06,569
huge losses of the study and accountants office are clear to be found.

66
00:04:06,569 --> 00:04:09,649
If we want to reduce losses, we must lead troops to catch them!

67
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,660
Okay, stop! You cheeky guy!

68
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,905
This here is Guard Wang from Governor Sima.

69
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:15,694
Greet him!

70
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:18,415
You've come just in time. Please help us catch them at once!

71
00:04:18,415 --> 00:04:19,537
So funny.

72
00:04:19,538 --> 00:04:23,110
Is it my business?

73
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,549
Give me the token at once!

74
00:04:24,549 --> 00:04:26,537
Token?

75
00:04:26,537 --> 00:04:29,080
It's in the study!

76
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:32,060
Well... What bad luck!

77
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,271
Where's the study?

78
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:35,049
Just over there.

79
00:04:35,049 --> 00:04:36,560
Let's go!

80
00:04:50,216 --> 00:04:51,890
Elder Qin.

81
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,890
Thieves did come to steal.

82
00:04:58,616 --> 00:05:00,220
Search here at once!

83
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,016
What can we do now?

84
00:05:10,016 --> 00:05:11,690
Oh gosh...

85
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:21,140
Guard Wang! No token here.

86
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:26,209
Don't fool me!

87
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:29,209
I don't care about the thieves.

88
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:34,661
If I can't get the token in three days, you will all lose your peace.

89
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:35,690
Let's leave!

90
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,250
   

91
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:56,848
Elder Qin, how did you know that?

92
00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:00,661
Sima Tu has been forcing him to submit it.

93
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:05,780
He just wanted to get the token by detaining our master.

94
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,394
What I've done is kick the can down the road.

95
00:06:10,394 --> 00:06:12,161
Then, what should we do now?

96
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:13,982
Must we give him the token?

97
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:16,261
Do you think he can mobilize the troops in Shuo State

98
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:19,389
as he gets the token?

99
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:22,226
You can go to have a try with it

100
00:06:22,226 --> 00:06:25,682
and see whether they'll listen to you or not.

101
00:06:25,682 --> 00:06:27,061
What do you mean?

102
00:06:27,061 --> 00:06:30,337
Can't the token control them?

103
00:06:30,337 --> 00:06:34,249
Not only the token but also the imperial jade seal

104
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,050
cannot control soldiers and generals in Shuo State.

105
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:45,960
What they're most willing to follow is not the lifeless token.

106
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,250
But only the governor Gongsun Heng.

107
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,072
 Elder Qin! 

108
00:06:52,072 --> 00:06:53,926
- Elder Qin! 
 - Any news?

109
00:06:53,926 --> 00:06:55,809
Sima Tu asked his men to open the treasury.

110
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,670
He wants to make peace with the Ashile Tribe Army by giving all the assets.

111
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,750
Oh no! We can't yield to them!

112
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,404
We'll gain nothing but destruction!

113
00:07:04,405 --> 00:07:07,450
While Governor is arrested, he cannot command the army.

114
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,730
What can we do?

115
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:13,449
At the worst, we can command soldiers to rush into the jail

116
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,550
and rescue the governor.

117
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,020
Rush into the jail?

118
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,216
It's just what Sima Tu hopes for.

119
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:26,880
You can not only fail to save him but also put Shuo State in danger.

120
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:35,720
As he has invited and hired you, I hope that you won't let him down.

121
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,709
I didn't expect that Elder Qin would be quite deliberate.

122
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:58,029
Though he moves in a wobbly fashion, he has an intelligent brain!

123
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:00,160
Is that right, Master?

124
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,750
Master?

125
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:05,940
Master?

126
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,300
What are you thinking about?

127
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,990
I'm thinking about how to save Governor.

128
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,804
Ask thousands of elites to surround Governor Mansion.

129
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:16,649
Everything could be solved

130
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,910
- as long as I... 
 - You're noisy.

131
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:24,460
We've just arrived in Shuo State and know little about here.

132
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,689
Even Elder Qin now has no plan.

133
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,182
While Gongsun Heng trusts me a lot, how can I not rescue him?

134
00:08:30,183 --> 00:08:32,590
What else can you do except the carjacking?

135
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:35,070
Or are you going to kill Sima Tu?

136
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,720
Why are you looking at me?

137
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,737
I have an idea.

138
00:08:40,738 --> 00:08:42,216
Master, where are you going?

139
00:08:42,216 --> 00:08:44,260
I'm going to find Elder Qin.

140
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:54,528
I've been waiting for you for a while.

141
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:55,989
You knew I'd come?

142
00:08:55,989 --> 00:08:58,189
You must have had an idea.

143
00:08:58,189 --> 00:09:00,016
Time is limited.

144
00:09:00,016 --> 00:09:01,520
Just go ahead.

145
00:09:03,272 --> 00:09:05,816
I do have a plan, but I need soldiers.

146
00:09:05,816 --> 00:09:07,049
Tell me in detail.

147
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:09,216
I need some of his reinforcements.

148
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,800
Then I'll...

149
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:32,790
It's a risky plan.

150
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:36,830
We'll lose everything if we can't make it but, at the moment,

151
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:39,750
it's our last stratagem.

152
00:09:40,529 --> 00:09:45,360
You deserve his trust.

153
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,009
He had foreseen he would be arrested

154
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,350
before he went to Military Governor Manor.

155
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:57,020
Then he asked me to give it to you when the time came.

156
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,350
   

157
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,826
I won't let him down!

158
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:10,204
Good.

159
00:10:10,204 --> 00:10:12,116
Tell me what to do.

160
00:10:12,116 --> 00:10:16,626
Elder Qin, I want some of his reliable generals.

161
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:18,961
And ask them to meet me.

162
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:20,049
Fine.

163
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:24,104
I need to tell you that I'm not helping you.

164
00:10:24,104 --> 00:10:26,890
It's all for the governor.

165
00:10:35,961 --> 00:10:38,871
Master, aren't you going to discuss it with him?

166
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,182
But why did he leave?

167
00:10:40,183 --> 00:10:41,471
I've got the answer.

168
00:10:41,472 --> 00:10:42,809
What answer?

169
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,426
The governor left me a note.

170
00:10:44,427 --> 00:10:46,383
What?

171
00:10:46,383 --> 00:10:48,290
It's the will of the people.

172
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:52,800
I finally know what Shen Gu meant at that time.

173
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:11,116
General Guo Ning and Zhang Hui greet you.

174
00:11:11,116 --> 00:11:12,172
Save the courtesy.

175
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,680
Please stand up.

176
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:18,748
I think you know the governor has been arrested.

177
00:11:18,748 --> 00:11:21,489
Sima Tu is going to make peace by giving money.

178
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:23,329
The reason why I invited you two here

179
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:26,429
is that I hope we can cooperate and solve it.

180
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:27,719
You can tell us what to do.

181
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:30,350
As long as we can stop him from opening the gate and welcome back Governor Gongsun,

182
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,240
we'll do whatever you want.

183
00:11:33,872 --> 00:11:36,000
Well, in this case, I'll get down to the point.

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,638
How many light cavalries are there in the city?

185
00:11:37,638 --> 00:11:40,710
6,000. Each of us leads 3,000 soldiers.

186
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:44,537
Then transfer 1,000 soldiers and let General Guo lead them.

187
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,809
Divide them into two groups.

188
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,061
Lead them to harass the Ashile Campsite at night.

189
00:11:49,061 --> 00:11:51,404
Withdraw the troops once they fight back.

190
00:11:51,404 --> 00:11:53,626
Do not damage our strength.

191
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:54,837
Yes.

192
00:11:54,837 --> 00:11:56,760
How about me? What should I do?

193
00:11:56,761 --> 00:11:59,826
I hope General Zhang Hui can transfer some soldiers to the suburb secretly.

194
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:02,293
Station on the hills in the northwest and northeast.

195
00:12:02,294 --> 00:12:05,294
Form a corner with the troops in the city.

196
00:12:05,294 --> 00:12:07,815
Soldiers in the town are less than 30,000.

197
00:12:07,815 --> 00:12:09,182
It's hard to defend the city.

198
00:12:09,183 --> 00:12:11,337
Registrar, why do we transfer them out?

199
00:12:11,338 --> 00:12:13,182
If something goes wrong while making peace,

200
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,327
General Zhang Hui's troops can bring them an illusion of having reinforcements.

201
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:19,170
Then we can hold them in awe.

202
00:12:20,338 --> 00:12:22,329
I see. Please be at ease.

203
00:12:22,329 --> 00:12:25,149
It'll be finished before they open the gate.

204
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:27,200
Thanks for the trouble.

205
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:38,270
Master, can a note mobilize a powerful army?

206
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:43,800
It's not up to the note but the will of the people.

207
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:48,030
If something goes wrong, 
    

208
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,370
maybe it'll also bring the governor another disaster.

209
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,710
When a bird's nest is overturned, no egg can remain intact.

210
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:58,710
It's the only plan that comes into my mind.

211
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,572
By the way, Elder Qin.

212
00:13:02,572 --> 00:13:04,705
Could you please find a secret place?

213
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:08,150
I hope nobody knows it except you and Xu Feng.

214
00:13:12,394 --> 00:13:13,526
Fine.

215
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:18,049
I hope the governor's judgment will be right.

216
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:21,237
Come with me. There's a secret room here.

217
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:45,350
 May I know your name? 

218
00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:47,061
 We meet only by chance. 

219
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:48,740
 I won't meet you again. 

220
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,249
 Can we be friends? 

221
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,630
 Aren't we friends now? 

222
00:13:58,072 --> 00:13:59,393
 Grasslands? 

223
00:13:59,393 --> 00:14:01,260
 I know nothing about there. 

224
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,615
 I'd better not go there. 

225
00:14:02,615 --> 00:14:04,820
 But you know me. 

226
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,771
What's up?

227
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:35,560
Sun, you've been like another man since you came back from the Great Tang.

228
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,371
For example, you smile more than before.

229
00:14:37,371 --> 00:14:41,440
And the smile is... quite creepy.

230
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,226
Are you keeping anything back from me?

231
00:14:43,226 --> 00:14:44,915
No.

232
00:14:44,915 --> 00:14:50,408
Ashile Sun, did you fall in love with a girl in the Great Tang?

233
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:57,615
Thanks to Sirius. Our Sun finally knows to love someone.

234
00:14:57,615 --> 00:14:59,283
Are you idling all day?

235
00:14:59,283 --> 00:15:02,172
Don't change the topic. Just tell me whether I'm right or not.

236
00:15:02,172 --> 00:15:03,770
You're right.

237
00:15:04,409 --> 00:15:06,280
It's so boring.

238
00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:29,150
Fire!

239
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:32,010
Where's the water?

240
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,930
Put out the fire!

241
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,900
Fire!

242
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,269
How could it be like this?

243
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:43,910
- General. 
 - Didn't you tell me Gongsun Heng had been arrested?

244
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:46,429
- I... 
 - How was there a night attack?

245
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:47,805
I...

246
00:15:47,805 --> 00:15:49,472
 Report! 

247
00:15:49,472 --> 00:15:52,315
General! Our army provisions were put on fire by the Tang army!

248
00:15:52,315 --> 00:15:54,840
Have you put out the fire?

249
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,919
Go to put out it as it's kindling!

250
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:00,049
- Why do you report to me? 
 - Yes!

251
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:03,504
Is it useful? Go!

252
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,608
You'd better make it clear.

253
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:12,760
Otherwise, I'll kill you and then massacre the city!

254
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,972
Yes!

255
00:16:13,972 --> 00:16:15,660
I'll go to see Sima Tu now.

256
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,460
Right now!

257
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:23,050
   

258
00:16:31,972 --> 00:16:33,660
What happened?

259
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,482
Bear Division's provisions have been set on fire. They're putting out the fire.

260
00:16:36,482 --> 00:16:39,926
While we only lost a few camps. No casualties.

261
00:16:39,926 --> 00:16:43,115
They sneak attack like flies. Disgusting!

262
00:16:43,115 --> 00:16:45,093
But we can't catch them!

263
00:16:45,093 --> 00:16:46,337
Well, it's quite funny.

264
00:16:46,337 --> 00:16:48,238
Bear Division is always hapless.

265
00:16:48,238 --> 00:16:50,480
And he takes no precautions.

266
00:16:52,372 --> 00:16:53,580
What are you thinking about?

267
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,571
Gongsun Heng's been in command of troops for decades.

268
00:16:55,571 --> 00:16:57,920
No attacks, only guards.

269
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,271
It's quite abnormal this time.

270
00:16:59,272 --> 00:17:03,940
It seems that... there's another master-hand in Shuo State.

271
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,130
Master-hand...

272
00:17:11,472 --> 00:17:13,327
A secret way.

273
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:16,120
There's a secret way under the governor's manor.

274
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:20,620
It should have been built early in the Sui Dynasty.

275
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,770
Pretty nice.

276
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,970
A'Dou, remember all my following words.

277
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:38,815
In the future, what you hear and see here is prohibited to tell others.

278
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,693
- Will you remember? 
 - Yes.

279
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:44,337
Though I don't know why. Since you're up to something great,

280
00:17:44,338 --> 00:17:46,790
I'll do what you ask me to do.

281
00:17:47,716 --> 00:17:49,510
Young Leader.

282
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:53,304
How's it going? Any casualties?

283
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:54,893
No casualties in the army.

284
00:17:54,894 --> 00:17:57,420
Then we'll keep on harassing them as we planned.

285
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,569
The repeated harassment brings them a mess and no sleep.

286
00:18:01,569 --> 00:18:05,450
I think maybe they'll leave because they might be tired of it.

287
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,861
We've got what we want.

288
00:18:06,861 --> 00:18:08,616
It's time to change our plan.

289
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:09,893
What do you mean?

290
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:14,900
Well, the plan needs your help.

291
00:18:53,561 --> 00:18:55,140
Governor.

292
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,860
Haven't I told you not to call? Why do you...

293
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:12,715
Tu Kashe asked me to come and ask about your plan.

294
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:16,604
If you've changed your mind about not opening the gate to surrender,

295
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:18,710
then I can go back and report to him.

296
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,400
At that time,

297
00:19:22,483 --> 00:19:25,680
pay for your own bill.

298
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:34,394
We've been checking the government repository

299
00:19:34,394 --> 00:19:37,004
and it'll be handled soon.

300
00:19:37,005 --> 00:19:39,449
So why did you say that?

301
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:43,488
 Our army has been harassed by your army every night. 

302
00:19:43,489 --> 00:19:47,469
We cannot sleep peacefully at night.

303
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:51,620
Is it your sincerity?

304
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,389
How could it happen?

305
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:58,869
The army here is controlled by you, and Gongsun Heng has been arrested.

306
00:19:58,869 --> 00:20:02,590
Will I believe that you know nothing?

307
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,888
Gongsun Heng is in jail and it's impossible for him to escape.

308
00:20:05,889 --> 00:20:08,871
 It's impossible for him to command the army. 

309
00:20:08,872 --> 00:20:11,771
My dear brother, it's said that

310
00:20:11,771 --> 00:20:14,649
Gongsun Heng's token has been stolen by a thief several days ago.

311
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:19,594
It seems the thief must be the troublemaker.

312
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:23,782
Recently, all his family is strictly on guard by me.

313
00:20:23,783 --> 00:20:26,940
 They're all in the manor. 

314
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,350
I'm now to ask Wang Li

315
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,149
to search the whole city!

316
00:20:40,149 --> 00:20:43,394
We'll find him at all costs.

317
00:20:43,394 --> 00:20:47,069
In this case, I'll do you another favor.

318
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:50,470
I already know where he is.

319
00:21:04,272 --> 00:21:08,869
It seems you've been monitored all the way.

320
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:10,870
Haven't you noticed that?

321
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,770
Did Gongsun Heng ask you to do so?

322
00:21:14,429 --> 00:21:17,649
I know he hides his malicious intent!

323
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:19,583
He wants to rebel!

324
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:21,737
Soldiers! Take him away.

325
00:21:21,737 --> 00:21:24,815
Brother, let me deal with him.

326
00:21:24,815 --> 00:21:29,910
I promise I'll bring him some gruesome tortures.

327
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,860
Bring him to the room.

328
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,340
Enough.

329
00:22:04,438 --> 00:22:07,704
It's impossible for you to die.

330
00:22:07,704 --> 00:22:11,093
While it's also not easy for you to survive.

331
00:22:11,094 --> 00:22:14,580
You... You bastard!

332
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:17,150
Then it means you refuse to tell.

333
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:42,160
You're sure to bring a few soldiers with you tomorrow?

334
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,349
Precipitous hills and marshes are in the east of Shuo State.

335
00:22:45,349 --> 00:22:46,916
No sneak attacks there before.

336
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:50,882
Gongsun Heng relies on the good location and cares little about there.

337
00:22:50,882 --> 00:22:53,271
So... it's enough.

338
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:56,527
The scout came to report that the military counselor of Bear Division

339
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:59,210
went to Shuo State again tonight.

340
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,883
I'm afraid it'll be a fake surrender tomorrow.

341
00:23:02,883 --> 00:23:04,560
Maybe they're going to attack.

342
00:23:04,561 --> 00:23:08,537
If Tu Kashe plans to do so, he can cooperate with us.

343
00:23:08,538 --> 00:23:11,626
But I don't think Registrar Li will do nothing.

344
00:23:11,627 --> 00:23:15,061
I don't know whether Tu Kashe can cope with him or not.

345
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,149
- Registrar Li? 
 - I've investigated him.

346
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:20,399
He's the new registrar of Shuo State, coming from some other place.

347
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,510
He hasn't worked for long.

348
00:23:26,861 --> 00:23:29,190
Xu Feng?

349
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,582
It's all my fault.

350
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:31,927
Get exposed?

351
00:23:31,927 --> 00:23:34,182
Yes. And they found me.

352
00:23:34,182 --> 00:23:36,737
I could finally escape after fighting against them for a while.

353
00:23:36,738 --> 00:23:40,460
And I came back after circling several hours.

354
00:23:41,261 --> 00:23:43,549
Never mind. Go back to take a rest first.

355
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:45,720
Do not go out these days.

356
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,660
 I'll tell you! 

357
00:24:21,883 --> 00:24:23,889
 That's right. 

358
00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:26,730
 I know where Registrar Li is. 

359
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,526
 I can bring you to find him. 

360
00:24:29,526 --> 00:24:34,590
 I know where their hideout is. 

361
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,540
 - I won't escape. 
 - Fine. 

362
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:43,860
 If you can catch the registrar, I'll reward you a lot. 

363
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:49,550
 If you escape, you know your end. 

364
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:07,390
Is he Registrar Li?

365
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,949
That will be nice.

366
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:15,340
A wise man submits to fate.

367
00:25:17,238 --> 00:25:19,190
Kill him.

368
00:25:21,361 --> 00:25:23,790
Kill him!

369
00:26:17,127 --> 00:26:22,649
I've never thought you could be so heartless.

370
00:26:22,649 --> 00:26:25,429
Nice! I like it.

371
00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:27,630
Dispose of him!

372
00:26:43,289 --> 00:26:46,040
Congratulations to Ibukan!

373
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:51,550
I've already killed Registrar Li and the list of presents is prepared.

374
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:54,661
Shuo State is all ours so do I need it?

375
00:26:54,661 --> 00:26:56,871
I'll replace General to reward you.

376
00:26:56,872 --> 00:26:59,505
Thanks, Commander and General.

377
00:26:59,505 --> 00:27:01,160
Let's go.

378
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:17,189
The counselor said Registrar Li has been killed

379
00:27:17,189 --> 00:27:19,716
and the list of presents is prepared.

380
00:27:19,716 --> 00:27:21,630
What's the full name of Registrar Li?

381
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,250
I'm not clear about it.

382
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:28,210
By the way, is Shisi's last name Li?

383
00:27:33,449 --> 00:27:35,830
Many people in the world are of the same surname.

384
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,510
Maybe he's not your Shisi.

385
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:40,304
Ask a team of soldiers to follow Tu Kashe.

386
00:27:40,304 --> 00:27:42,250
Don't let him die so easily.

387
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,540
I know.

388
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:50,870
   

389
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:20,404
Military Governor Sima Tu replaces Shuo State Governor Gongsun Heng

390
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:23,820
to open the gate and handle our list of presents.

391
00:29:25,149 --> 00:29:30,768
We beg that Ashile General has the virtue of cherishing lives

392
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:34,040
and spares the lives of the whole city.

393
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,893
Thanks to Your Grace.

394
00:29:35,894 --> 00:29:39,271
We'll be all grateful for your pity.

395
00:29:39,271 --> 00:29:41,300
Give it to me.

396
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:50,304
Here's the list of presents we're going to submit.

397
00:29:50,304 --> 00:29:52,071
Please look it over.

398
00:29:52,072 --> 00:29:53,950
Okay.

399
00:30:15,827 --> 00:30:17,972
How could it be like this?

400
00:30:17,972 --> 00:30:20,130
How can he still be alive?

401
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:24,460
Surrender or not?

402
00:30:26,149 --> 00:30:28,620
What do you mean?

403
00:30:32,089 --> 00:30:33,609
Are you ambushing me?

404
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:35,249
Please allow me to explain!

405
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:36,639
You want the hard way?

406
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,360
Wait...

407
00:30:47,438 --> 00:30:49,816
Halt! Otherwise, I'll kill you!

408
00:30:49,816 --> 00:30:53,140
Oh, no! Things might have changed in the city.

409
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,060
Warriors!

410
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,271
Don't spare these hypocrites!

411
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,815
Come on! Let's attack!

412
00:30:59,815 --> 00:31:03,150
 Fight! 

413
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,910
 Fight! 

414
00:31:25,169 --> 00:31:27,230
 Fight! 

415
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,720
 Fight! 

416
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,740
Release the arrows!

417
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:54,749
Set the signals! Ask 5,000 soldiers to drive them to the river bank!

418
00:31:54,749 --> 00:31:57,882
 General, Registrar Li is now in charge of operations. 

419
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:00,369
 As they lay in an ambush and we lack soldiers, 

420
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:02,871
 shall we go back to join the main forces? 

421
00:32:02,872 --> 00:32:06,560
 Did you tell me that Gongsun Heng was arrested and his counselor died? 

422
00:32:06,561 --> 00:32:08,380
 I... 

423
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:14,015
 Stop the attack! Retreat! 

424
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:27,309
If you don't know their intentions, you can't be friends with them.

425
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:31,371
If you know nothing about the terrain, you cannot lead a troop.

426
00:32:31,371 --> 00:32:34,882
Next, it's all up to General Guo.

427
00:32:34,882 --> 00:32:36,540
Yes.

428
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,493
As the military governor has died in front of the army

429
00:32:39,493 --> 00:32:42,779
and we need a commander, it should be replaced by the official

430
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,350
with the highest position.

431
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:47,850
I see. I'll now release our governor out.

432
00:32:57,509 --> 00:33:00,349
Sima Jian is right that there's no water in July.

433
00:33:00,349 --> 00:33:02,449
It's convenient for us to march.

434
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,060
Bros! Follow up!

435
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:08,190
As we arrive in Shuo State, we'll be at ease and do whatever we want!

436
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,249
Go!

437
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,450
Hurry!

438
00:33:19,227 --> 00:33:20,638
Stop!

439
00:33:20,638 --> 00:33:21,616
Please save us, Commander!

440
00:33:21,616 --> 00:33:24,793
The Tang Army laid in ambush, and pursuing troops are behind us.

441
00:33:24,793 --> 00:33:26,320
General.

442
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:32,149
Remind me of killing Registrar Li myself after we conquer Shuo State.

443
00:33:32,149 --> 00:33:35,437
General. They stopped their attack.

444
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:51,760
Why don't you keep on chasing? Come on!

445
00:33:51,761 --> 00:33:52,969
 Come over here! 

446
00:33:52,969 --> 00:33:55,269
 Come here! 

447
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:57,250
 Hurry! 

448
00:34:27,472 --> 00:34:30,737
Retreat! Speed up!

449
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:35,690
   

450
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,226
All thanks to Registrar Li.

451
00:34:41,226 --> 00:34:44,049
Shuo State may be in danger without him!

452
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:45,382
Good strategy!

453
00:34:45,383 --> 00:34:48,770
Kill Sima Tu with the help of the Bear Division.

454
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:52,089
Well, I have a question.

455
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,760
How did you predict that he'd come to attack?

456
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,928
Sima Tu fears death.

457
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,710
As he tried to make peace with Ashile,

458
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,569
it's just to bring disaster upon himself.

459
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:05,750
Their ambition is not only to plunder food and money

460
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,838
but also to conquer the city with a chance.

461
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:11,230
They're very greedy.

462
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:14,550
I was to make use of the opportunity.

463
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:16,393
I see.

464
00:35:16,393 --> 00:35:20,050
Our success cannot get rid of Xu Feng's contribution.

465
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:23,016
Without his cooperative performance with me,

466
00:35:23,016 --> 00:35:25,594
it wouldn't have been easy to trick Sima Tu.

467
00:35:25,594 --> 00:35:27,429
It's not a big deal.

468
00:35:27,429 --> 00:35:31,430
I won't hesitate to lose my life to save my governor.

469
00:35:33,194 --> 00:35:36,172
We ought to be loyal for being with the governor for years.

470
00:35:36,172 --> 00:35:37,849
Registrar Li gains my admiration

471
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:41,793
for he can leave life and death out of consideration as he's just arrived.

472
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,004
Well, I want to ask you one thing.

473
00:35:46,005 --> 00:35:49,238
As long as I'd pressed the knife a little bit deeper,

474
00:35:49,238 --> 00:35:52,416
it might have gone through the blood pack and hurt your heart.

475
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,694
So why can you trust me?

476
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:58,700
What I trust is your loyalty to the governor.

477
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,570
Well spoken.

478
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:09,528
It's really my great privilege

479
00:36:09,529 --> 00:36:12,640
to work with loyal warriors like you.

480
00:36:15,638 --> 00:36:19,728
Commandant Li, I should thank you, too.

481
00:36:19,728 --> 00:36:22,030
Elder Qin, what did you call me?

482
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:25,700
Commandant of Light Chariot, Li Shisi.

483
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:33,049
You've built a dam filled with water in the upper reach,

484
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,505
and then released the water to drown the enemy.

485
00:36:35,505 --> 00:36:38,920
Good strategy, Commandant Li.

486
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:45,100
Getting rid of surrendering our city to the enemy this time

487
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,027
depends on your contribution.

488
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:51,480
Please accept my courtesy call on behalf of the people in the whole city.

489
00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:56,127
Governor!

490
00:36:56,127 --> 00:36:58,900
I don't deserve that, Governor.

491
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,250
I've let you down for letting someone rescue Tu Kashe.

492
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,240
Come on. Stand up.

493
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,910
Stand up.

494
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:13,850
The Bear Division seemed to move all its troops this time.

495
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:16,600
I've never thought that...

496
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,605
Are you worried about Eagle Division?

497
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:22,260
Eagle Division?

498
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,049
It's the strongest division of the Ashile Tribe.

499
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:30,670
They're not incompetent as Tu Kashi's army.

500
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,809
If they still have the energy to attack...

501
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:36,305
It's impossible to cross during the flood tide.

502
00:37:36,305 --> 00:37:37,990
There are mountains in the southeast

503
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:40,928
and mires are all over the outside of the east gate.

504
00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:42,837
Even Shuo State people have to make a detour.

505
00:37:42,837 --> 00:37:48,090
Therefore, we should move troops from the east to the west.

506
00:37:54,827 --> 00:37:57,515
Okay. Listen up.

507
00:37:57,515 --> 00:38:00,015
Just do as he said.

508
00:38:00,015 --> 00:38:01,880
 - Yes. 
 - I see. 

509
00:38:26,727 --> 00:38:31,188
General, the Tang Army are really cunning.

510
00:38:31,188 --> 00:38:35,704
They laid a snare to let you kill my brother.

511
00:38:35,704 --> 00:38:40,980
Registrar Li of Gongsun Heng is my deadly enemy!

512
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:53,129
What's up?

513
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:56,161
Are you distressed for me killing Sima Tu?

514
00:38:56,161 --> 00:38:59,671
No. It's due to my brother's incompetence.

515
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:03,016
As the military governor, he cannot control a governor.

516
00:39:03,016 --> 00:39:04,750
It's his fault.

517
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:08,370
My loyalty to you can be proved by Heaven.

518
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:13,449
Though Sima Tu has died, I still have the opportunity

519
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,383
to provide you the information about Shuo State.

520
00:39:15,383 --> 00:39:19,710
I hope you can give me another chance.

521
00:39:25,772 --> 00:39:29,515
Remember that I can kill you at any time.

522
00:39:29,516 --> 00:39:30,927
I know.

523
00:39:30,927 --> 00:39:34,416
I won't let Registrar Li escape again.

524
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:36,471
 Report! 

525
00:39:36,471 --> 00:39:39,637
General, Ashile Sun gathered soldiers and left all of a sudden.

526
00:39:39,637 --> 00:39:41,590
I don't know where they went.

527
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:53,326
Attention please, everybody!

528
00:39:53,326 --> 00:39:56,304
I'm going to tell you a story today.

529
00:39:56,304 --> 00:39:58,750
At that moment, I saw with my own eyes

530
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:02,416
that Registrar Li flipped in the air

531
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:07,471
and then released a dark-steel arrow of more than 50 kilograms.

532
00:40:07,472 --> 00:40:09,782
The arrow avoided our soldiers accurately.

533
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:13,489
With no diversion of its trajectory,

534
00:40:13,489 --> 00:40:17,450
it hit right in the list being held by the Ashile general.

535
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:20,083
 Good! 

536
00:40:20,083 --> 00:40:21,688
We shouldn't call him Registrar Li anymore.

537
00:40:21,689 --> 00:40:23,728
Governor has put up the notice

538
00:40:23,729 --> 00:40:25,580
that he's promoted to the position of a commandant.

539
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,909
That's it.

540
00:40:26,909 --> 00:40:28,869
He's pretty young

541
00:40:28,869 --> 00:40:30,990
and he's now become Governor Gongsun's right-hand man!

542
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:34,199
- It's the luck of Shuo State! 
 - I agree.

543
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:37,950
   

544
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:49,671
I've never thought that you could help my husband defeat enemies

545
00:40:49,672 --> 00:40:51,071
in only a few days.

546
00:40:51,072 --> 00:40:53,920
It's really my good luck to meet you.

547
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,726
Let me toast to you with a cup of tea.

548
00:40:57,726 --> 00:40:59,070
I'm flattered.

549
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:03,840
It's my great honor to work with Governor to guard Shuo State.

550
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:12,527
You're so slender.

551
00:41:12,527 --> 00:41:14,760
It's cold in the north so you should wear more clothes.

552
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,220
I'll find some suitable fabric and make you some suits.

553
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,915
Madam, you treat me so well.

554
00:41:21,916 --> 00:41:24,760
I'm very moved.

555
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,349
She wants to do something for you.

556
00:41:26,349 --> 00:41:29,571
I think you should accept it.

557
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:33,800
If you don't mind, you can consider this place as your home.

558
00:41:36,005 --> 00:41:37,626
Thank you, Governor.

559
00:41:37,626 --> 00:41:39,310
Thank you, Madam.

560
00:41:41,272 --> 00:41:44,768
It's been my first time to feel the warmth and love again

561
00:41:44,768 --> 00:41:47,030
after my mother passed away.

562
00:41:50,070 --> 00:41:52,890
Madam, I want it, too.

563
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:57,183
Don't worry. I'll make it for you, too.

564
00:41:57,183 --> 00:41:59,438
Make some more for him.

565
00:41:59,438 --> 00:42:01,493
- Let's eat first. It's almost cool. 
 - Yes.

566
00:42:01,494 --> 00:42:03,893
Governor, our granary was on fire.

567
00:42:03,893 --> 00:42:05,283
And it has turned into ash.

568
00:42:05,283 --> 00:42:06,890
What?

569
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:19,204
Eagle Division did it.

570
00:42:19,205 --> 00:42:20,519
Any casualties?

571
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:23,669
The fire spread rapidly but Guard Xu has led us to put it out.

572
00:42:23,669 --> 00:42:26,527
No civilian was involved.

573
00:42:26,527 --> 00:42:28,827
He's right. You can leave.

574
00:42:28,827 --> 00:42:30,720
Yes.

575
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,110
Governor, is it the special forces you're worried about?

576
00:42:37,094 --> 00:42:38,310
They finally came.

577
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:41,260
I've never thought they could arrive so quickly.

578
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:45,537
Governor, we found some boards in the swamp outside the east gate.

579
00:42:45,537 --> 00:42:49,189
As their cavalries march fast, maybe they've crossed the swamp

580
00:42:49,189 --> 00:42:52,600
with the help of the boards.

581
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,782
Governor, it's all my fault.

582
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:59,782
I capitalize on terrain too much, moving our troops from east to west.

583
00:42:59,783 --> 00:43:03,526
I want to atone for my faults. Please let me handle them.

584
00:43:03,526 --> 00:43:05,140
Fine.

585
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:15,090
