00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,269
Governor, this is all my fault.

23
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:42,349
I capitalized on terrain too much, moving our troops from east to west.

24
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:46,089
I want to atone for my faults. Please let me handle them.

25
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:47,229
Fine.

26
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,968
The war is all about wit and moral courage.

27
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:51,789
It's not entirely your fault.

28
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,389
I just didn't know

29
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:57,150
the elite squad of Ashile Tribe could be this cunning.

30
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,950
Xu Feng, summon all our people

31
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,829
to meet me and Commandant Li at the East Gate and confront the enemies.

32
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:04,489
Yes.

33
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,750
But, Governor, they were constantly on the run

34
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,210
before they attacked our barn.

35
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,209
Now they're at the east gate, miles apart from the barn.

36
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,069
How could they be so quick?

37
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:18,910
Shisi, you should know that, from now on,

38
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,589
you're facing the most elite and powerful cavalry of the Ashile Tribe.

39
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:01,230
On my order.

40
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:04,030

Governor!

47
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,349
Governor, you should go back. I'll be here.

48
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,350
You need to lead the troops and defend the east side.

49
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,909
Yes!

50
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,309
Take Governor back, now!

51
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:30,909
Yes.

52
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,130
This isn't good. They've got reinforcements.

53
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:52,969
Ya Luo has destroyed all the state-owned land according to your plan.

54
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:55,849
Gongsun Heng shall find out about it soon.

Wear this.

Come on, I'm so handsome.

Why would I wear this?

58
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:05,529
All right, fine.

59
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:08,409
I should've picked a prettier one.

60

63
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:28,199
You're afraid that he'll recognize us.

64
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,239
So you've both hidden your real identities.

65
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:31,839
Shut up.

66
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,608
So you're not real friends.

67

Well, that just makes everything fine.

68
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:36,830

69
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,089

Go all the way to attack the city.

Registrar, the east gate has always been the least defended area.

77
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,108
I've sent people to get lookout towers and catapults from elsewhere.

78
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:21,950
Do we have any more javelins?

79
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,790
The remaining iron caltrops are less than 50 kilos.

80
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,889
We can only lay one line of defense with the iron caltrops now available.

81
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:42,590
And the Eagle Division can easily avoid it.

82
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,828
We should do whatever we can to make the best use of the existing iron caltrops.

83
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:46,449
Yes!

84

Whoever they are, the Eagle Divison or reinforcements,

85
00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:54,490
they must've been on the run the entire night.

86
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,708
They wouldn't have enough time to feed their horses with food and water.

The chief commander of Shuo State didn't die.

00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:12,088
It boosted their morale.

It's not a great time for us to launch an attack.

Master, you're seriously injured.

It's just minor bruising.

Not to mention that the doctor has changed my dressing.

138

Right now, what really matters is our war against Ashile Tribe.

How could I rest?

141
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:33,489
Governor's new injury triggered his old wounds.

142
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,830
He's in his bedroom now.

143
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:39,149
A'Dou, you should go to bed now.

144
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:41,449
- I'll go talk to Governor and see what we can do.
- Master!

145
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:44,808
Don't forget that your target is not Shuo State, but Chang'an.

146
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:46,869
Your health is everything.

147
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:51,469
A'Dou, compared to this war in Shuo State,

148
00:13:51,469 --> 00:13:54,349
the personal hatred between me and Li Shimin is nothing.

149
00:13:54,349 --> 00:13:57,770
Right now, the situation in Shuo State is grim.

150
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,030
I can't just sit by and do nothing.

151
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,869
Well,

152
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:07,850
you'll change my dressing on time. Right?

153
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,390
I'm just worried about your health.

154
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:22,169
Look, I'm fine.

155
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,889
Wolf Division is targeting Yun State and Dai State.

156
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,989
Great Khan ordered you to take Shuo State in ten days

157
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:57,150
or he'll lead the troops himself.

158
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,250
If we just camp outside the city like this,

159
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,969
I doubt if we can take Shuo State in ten days.

160
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:05,929
By that time, Eagle Division will be an object of universal derision.

161
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:08,350
A trapped beast will still struggle.

162
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,429
But it won't last long.

163
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,930
Fair enough.

164
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,908
We've burned their barns and destroyed their lands.

165
00:15:15,908 --> 00:15:18,089
They'll starve to death.

166
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:19,709
Mu Jin,

167
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,390
what do you think of my archery?

168
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,450
You never miss a target.

169
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:37,268
Sun, don't tell me you're sneaking into Shuo State at a time like this.

170
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:38,988
No way. I won't permit that.

171
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:40,369
I was wrong.

172
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,509
Your archery is just great.

173
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:44,209
Li Shisi must be all right.

174
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,409
Really.

175
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:51,469
Take the reports.

176
00:15:51,469 --> 00:15:53,729
Let's go to see Tu Kashe.

177
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:56,589
I need to get rid of him.

178
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,449
Eagle Division must be the one

179
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:01,649
to take over Shuo State.

180
00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:08,729
General, there's no need to be angry.

181
00:16:08,729 --> 00:16:12,488
If you want to surpass Eagle Division, I have another plan.

182
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,670
What are you doing here?

183
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:26,930
Bear Division was badly injured.

184
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,189
What are you going to do?

185
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,910
General.

186
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,449
General, have mercy on me.

187
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,330
I swear, I promise!

188
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,590
I will kill Registrar Li.

189
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,889
Please, General, give me another chance.

190
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:52,568
You missed your chance and that's it. You lost it forever.

191
00:16:52,568 --> 00:16:56,648
It was your trick that rendered half of the Bear Division dead.

192
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,209
If we give you another chance,

193
00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:03,529
maybe even the Eagle Division wouldn't be able to save you.

194
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:11,408
General, God knows how eager I am

195
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:14,130
to serve the Bear Division.

196
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,710
You think you can just kill him

197
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,029
and get things over with Great Khan?

198
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:42,329
Bear Division was misled by a treacherous minister.

199
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:47,649
I will explain it to Great Khan myself.

200
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,710
No need.

201
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,970
I have received Khan's order.

202
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:02,650
Now you're taking it from me. What?

203
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,789
Are you trying to humiliate me?

204
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:07,310
We just want you to stop being reckless.

205
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,330
We don't want to take credit for occupying Shuo State.

206
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,270
We just want you to stop holding us Eagle Division back.

207
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:16,689
You just can't wait to tread Bear Division underfoot, right?

208
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:18,910
Why the rush?

209
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,190
Then you leave us no choice but to report the truth to Great Khan.

210
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,489
That Tu Kashe defied his intructions openly.

211
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:39,729
General Sun, the General of Bear Division has received your order.

212
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:43,969
Now, please.

213
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,580
Ibukan.

214
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:53,829
Ibukan! Ibukan!

215
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,949
Isn't there anyone who'll guard the entrance for me?

216
00:18:57,949 --> 00:18:59,128
This is the camp of Bear Division.

217
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:01,869
Do your job and guard the damn door!

218
00:19:06,069 --> 00:19:08,288
Eagle Division changed their camp site.

219
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:10,028
They must be up to something.

220
00:19:10,028 --> 00:19:11,209
Keep an eye on him.

221
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,509
Keep an eye on him! Understand?

222
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:15,170
Yes!

223
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:18,570
And guard the damn door!

224
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,230
Just say it.

225
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,209
You could've just bought over that counselor.

226
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,650
Why did you provoke Tu Kashe into killing him?

227
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:35,470
I don't like traitors.

228
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,049
But he was right.

229
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,830
Gongsun Heng got a brave general all of a sudden.

230
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,748
Things would be much easier if we kill Li Shisi first.

231
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:45,028
You know it better than anyone that what will happen if Great Khan leads the troops himself.

232
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:47,350
Why are you just laying siege to this city?

233
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,830
She'er's Wolf Division will soon take Dai State.

234
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,129
Great Khan ordered us to assist them.

235
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:55,308
I'll send you there.

236
00:19:55,308 --> 00:19:57,230
Me?

237
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,768
Ashile Sun, yes, I am a bit talkative.

238
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:02,008
But that doesn't mean you've got to throw me to the wolves.

239
00:20:02,008 --> 00:20:04,089
Once this war ends, you'll leave.

240
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:06,449
Remember, when you're in Dai State,

241
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,469
save some clothes of Tang defenders and don't hassle common people.

242
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,889
You don't have to tell these to Great Khan.

243
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:16,990
That's it?

244
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,910
Shouldn't you set things straight before you go?

245
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,210
<i>- Hurry!
- Run!</i>

246
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,549
<i>Run! Run!</i>

247
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:42,689
<i>Run!</i>

248
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,269
<i>Hurry! Hurry!</i>

249
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:46,569
<i>Run!</i>

250
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,350
<i>Hurry! Run!</i>

251
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,329
<i>Hurry!</i>

252
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,230
<i>Run!</i>

253
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,368
<i>Help!</i>

254
00:21:07,368 --> 00:21:09,149
What's going on? What are you doing?

255
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:11,009
- Help!
- You can't come in.

256
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:13,008
Open the door. Help!

257
00:21:13,008 --> 00:21:15,410
- What happened?
- The enemies are breaking in.

258
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,869
Close the door.

259
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:18,129
Please, I'm begging you.

260
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:19,750
Come on. Help me close the door.

261
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,530
<i>Just take my kid in, okay?</i>

262
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,249
I'm begging you! Please!

263
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,449
Open the door! Open it!

264
00:21:27,449 --> 00:21:28,768
<i>Please!</i>

265
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:30,888
<i>Just let my kid in!</i>

266
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,369
Please help us!

267
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,590
<i>I'm begging you!</i>

268
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,909
<i>Let my kid in! Please!</i>

269
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:45,010
What are you doing?

270
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:47,110
Let them in.

271
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,110
Are you nuts?

272
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,650
Who the hell do you think you are?

273
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,588
How dare you point the scissors at me? You're seeking your doom.

274
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:30,910
Help me!

275
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,570
Where did she go?

276
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:36,140
What are you doing here?

277
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,309
Great Khan sent us to chase after the Dai State Force that has fled from the city.

278
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:40,909
Hurry up!

279
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,590
<i>Come on!</i>

280
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,368
Master, where are we going now?

281
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:18,648
Let's go and take a look at the east side.

282
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:21,089
Right now, the east side is under siege by the Eagle Division.

283
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,829
But outside the east gate, there are towering and forested mountains.

284
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,168
We don't have our forces garrisoned there.

285
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:26,528
So might the Eagle Division.

286
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:28,288
However tight their defense might be,

287
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:31,128
I don't think they can find us among so many mountains.

288
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:35,709
A'Dou, you've really grown up.

289
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:46,128
Go now!

290
00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:47,709
Master, let's go together!

291
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:49,410
Get someone here!

292
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,850
You followed me the whole way here.

293
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,049
I guess you want more than the Seal of Crown Prince.

294
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,769
You also want to kill me.

295
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:25,128
So what?

296
00:25:25,129 --> 00:25:27,168
Right now, Governor Gongsun is seriously wounded.

297
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:29,028
Shuo State is surrounded by enemies.

298
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,209
Do you really have to kill me right now?

299
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,130
Cut the nonsense.

300
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,949
It's my duty to execute you here.

301
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:48,549
Princess Yongning, any last words?

302
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:50,649
Even if I were to die,

303
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:54,869
I wouldn't be killed by a pawn.

304
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,530
Master, are you okay?

305
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,830
Do you know who she is?

306
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,248
If you help her,

307
00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:14,269
you'll regret it later, for sure.

308
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:19,168
All I know is that she's the commandant

309
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:22,610
who's protecting Shuo State.

310
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:27,248
Young man, you must've sneaked into Shuo State

311
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:29,529
before the siege by the Eagle Division, right?

312
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:32,788
Then you must be clear about what's going on here.

313
00:26:32,788 --> 00:26:34,750
The governor is wounded.

314
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:39,709
Everyone in Shuo State relies on Commandant Li.

315
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:43,010
So I won't let you hurt her.

316
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,370
If you insist on helping her,

317
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:49,350
we'll wait and see.

318
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,130
Elder Qin, thank you.

319
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,569
Elder Qin, I have an idea.

320
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:14,770
We can get out of here.

321
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,969
Back then when we flooded Tu Kashe,

322
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,329
we pumped the stone canal dry

323
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,929
that once drained into Wuding River.

324
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,929
Master, just leave it to me.

325
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,550
You're still injured...

326
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,589
I'll go.

327
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:34,809
I might be a bit more familiar with this place than you.

328
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:37,989
Commandant Li.

329
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:43,469
Commandant Li.

330
00:27:43,469 --> 00:27:45,070
Governor?

331
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:47,609
- Help Elder Qin out.
- Governor.

332
00:27:47,609 --> 00:27:49,930
- Commandant Li, Elder Qin told me
- Why are you here?

333
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:53,090
that you found a stone canal that might lead out of Shuo State.

334
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,729
Seeing you dressed like this,

335
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,569
are you going to deliver the message yourself?

336
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:03,049
The stone canal in the city leads straight to Wuding River.

337
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,288
Shuo State is now under siege by the Eagle Division.

338
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:07,169
Wuding River is the only area with no garrison.

339
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:08,488
If we don't spread the message now,

340
00:28:08,489 --> 00:28:09,628
I'm afraid we're running out of time.

341
00:28:09,628 --> 00:28:14,009
I plan to get out of here and deliver the message while it's still dark.

342
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:16,969
You've already been seriously injured.

343
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,449
And today you were almost assassinated,

344
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,809
which just made things even worse.

345
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:24,670
How could I let you risk your life?

346
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:28,809
Right, Commandant Li. That guy hit you real hard.

347
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:33,829
Commandant Li, let me do it.

348
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:35,710
Shuo State needs you and Master.

349
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,849
You're the hope of Shuo State.

350
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,668
Also, I'm Master's bodyguard.

351
00:28:39,668 --> 00:28:41,410
This is my duty.

352
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:43,248
No.

353
00:28:43,249 --> 00:28:44,749
The stone canal was built for drainage.

354
00:28:44,749 --> 00:28:47,510
It's too small for you to get through.

355
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,888
Governor, Iet me do it. I can get through it.

356
00:28:52,888 --> 00:28:54,309
A'Dou!

357
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:56,449
Master, I know you're worried about me.

358
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,689
You don't want to put me at risk.

359
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,709
But you're already badly injured.

360
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:00,929
If you don't get a good rest,

361
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,950
you won't be able to carry on.

362
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,329
You don't want to pass out halfway

363
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,750
and cause a delay in reinforcement requests, right?

364
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,128
So I'm the best choice for this task.

365
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:11,449
Governor, please place your trust in me.

366
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,008
I won't let you down.

367
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:14,488
Enough of this nonsense.

368
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:15,969
You're just a kid.

369
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,809
How could I put you at risk?

370
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,248
Yes, I'm too young,

371
00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:22,289
and that's why I won't attract their attention.

372
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:26,368
Besides, Master accepted me as a disciple

373
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:27,929
because I'm smart.

374
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,609
I've been learning from Master for a long time.

375
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,408
I've commanded so many tricks.

376
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:33,329
But when I'm back,

377
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,689
Governor, would you award me some titles?

378
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:44,710
Master, stop hesitating.

379
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,629
We've been through so much.

380
00:29:46,629 --> 00:29:50,069
You don't think I can handle it, do you?

381
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,110
Fine.

382
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,329
Take this baggage with you and don't lose it.

383
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,689
You'll find an escape route map in it

384
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,608
and some pocket crossbows with which you can beat off the enemies.

385
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:11,368
Master, nice choice.

386
00:30:11,369 --> 00:30:12,528
And when I'm back in glory,

387
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:16,250
you'll all call me General Dou.

388
00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:23,909
A'Dou, take care of yourself.

389
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:25,308
I will, Master.

390
00:30:25,308 --> 00:30:29,309
Tell everyone to hang in there and wait for me.

391
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:43,050
Commandant Li, you have a great disciple.

392
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,690
I didn't teach him anything.

393
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:52,690
In fact, I'm the lucky one to meet him.

394
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:02,409
General.

395
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,648
I sent people to spy on Mu Jin.

396
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:09,590
But he managed to get rid of them halfway.

397
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,949
He seemed to be leaving for Dai State.

398
00:31:11,949 --> 00:31:13,550
Dai State?

399
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,189
What does that mean?

400
00:31:19,189 --> 00:31:22,089
Great Khan has taken Dai State?

401
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:25,269
What's happening?

402
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:26,950
Why?

403
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:29,849
I know nothing at all!

404
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,209
What? Do they take our Bear Division seriously?

405
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,689
General, don't be anxious.

406
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,488
I will lead a team to keep an eye on Ashile Sun.

407
00:31:35,489 --> 00:31:37,449
I won't let him fool Great Khan

408
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,128
and take all the credit for occupying Shuo State.

409
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:40,790
Enough!

410
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,969
Cut that nonsense!

411
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,668
Get lost! Now!

412
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,680
<i>[Governor's Manor]</i>

413
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,050
<i>[Original Just and Honest Source]</i>

414
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:56,429
Yuan'er.

415
00:31:56,429 --> 00:31:58,390
You're finally back.

416
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,689
People sent food here just now.

417
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,888
They said they'd eat chaff and herbs

418
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:05,548
as long as you and the soldiers are well fed.

419
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,469
And I had people send it back.

420
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:10,049
They saved their own food.

421
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,489
I couldn't accept it, really.

422
00:32:12,489 --> 00:32:15,510
Madam, you are right.

423
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,869
Father.

424
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,849
Everyone is saying that

425
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,109
you're the one who's defending Shuo State.

426
00:32:26,489 --> 00:32:29,049
Your mother must have praised me again, right?

427
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:33,170
But I think,

428
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:37,400
they're the reason Shuo State exists,

429
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,049
not me.

430
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,050
I can't take the credit.

431
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,049
Check all the food provisions

432
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,768
and the grains we have.

433
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:52,069
Distribute it to the common people.

434
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:55,229
We must hold out till A'Dou comes back.

435
00:32:55,229 --> 00:32:56,749
Yes.

436
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:37,688
General, we've killed all the Tang soldiers around Dai State on Great Khan's command!

437
00:33:37,688 --> 00:33:38,768
What about those who fled Dai State?

438
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:40,128
They were all killed!

439
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:41,008
Good!

440
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:43,049
General of Eagle Division has sent someone here from Shuo State.

441
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,008
Great Khan ordered us to meet him.

442
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:47,149
Let's go back to Dai State. Don't keep that messenger waiting.

443
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:48,449
Yes, Sir!

444
00:33:56,489 --> 00:33:58,770
<i>Damn it. The post road was blocked.</i>

445
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,609
<i>I can't send the message to Chang'an.</i>

446
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,988
<i>And Dai State fell to the enemies, too. We won't be able to get any reinforcements.</i>

447
00:34:02,988 --> 00:34:04,210
<i>What should I do now?</i>

448
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:07,430
<i>I must go back and inform Master of this.</i>

449
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,968
You guys. Find some clothes of Tang soldiers

450
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:30,488
and get changed on our way out of Dai State.

451
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,889
Yes!

452
00:35:00,729 --> 00:35:03,909
Come on. Come on. Get up!

453
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:14,690
<i>Have mercy on us.</i>

454
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,249
<i>Don't kill us!</i>

455
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:19,009
<i>Please spare us!</i>

456
00:35:19,009 --> 00:35:20,409
Come on, kneel down!

457
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,129
Why should I?

458
00:35:22,129 --> 00:35:25,070
They are the real culprits, the offenders.

459
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,510
Just kneel down!

460
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:36,109
<i>Have mercy on us! Don't kill us! Please!</i>

461
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,530
<i>Please don't kill us!</i>

462
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,729
- Stop it.
- Who are you?

463
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:08,089
You don't know me. That's fine.

464
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,210
But I'm sure you can recognize this spike arrow.

465
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:17,148
Since when does Eagle Division get to tell us what to do?

466
00:36:17,148 --> 00:36:18,649
If you're smart, you'd get lost now.

467
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,629
You know well what Eagle Division is capable of.

468
00:36:21,629 --> 00:36:26,108
I suppose you wouldn't want to die for these refugees.

469
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,050
Let's go!

470
00:36:44,729 --> 00:36:46,429
You should go now.

471
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:50,408
<i>Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!</i>

472
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,049
We must get back to Shuo State as soon as possible.

473
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,529
- Yes!
- Yes!

474
00:36:55,289 --> 00:36:58,569
<i>Thank you!</i>

475
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,909
<i>- Let's go home.
- Great!</i>

476
00:37:09,909 --> 00:37:11,610
<i>Father.</i>

477
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,990
Isn't he that... that...

478
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:54,130
that guy's apprentice?

479
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,148
Yes!

480
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,849
I know you.

481
00:37:57,729 --> 00:38:00,710
Kill him. Just kill him. Now.

482
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,808
Wait! My Lord! My Lord!

483
00:38:02,808 --> 00:38:04,849
I've got an update for you.

484
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,948
Lord? He's our General.

485
00:38:07,948 --> 00:38:09,749
Yeah, okay. General! General!

486
00:38:09,749 --> 00:38:12,008
You got my title wrong.

487
00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:13,448
Kill him. Kill him. Just kill him.

488
00:38:13,448 --> 00:38:17,609
General, right now you must be desperate to know what's going on in Shuo State.

489
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:23,489
Spare my life and I'll prove myself useful to you.

490
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,030
Then tell me how you might be helpful to us...

491
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,709
or I will kill you myself.

492
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,649
General, you know that

493
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,008
I'm Registrar Li's trusted follower.

494
00:38:50,009 --> 00:38:52,428
I know his tricks better than anyone.

495
00:38:52,428 --> 00:38:55,088
During the battle around Wuding River, you lost so many soldiers.

496
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:56,989
The situation for you is grim.

497
00:38:56,989 --> 00:38:59,728
I also heard that now it's the Eagle Division that's leading the attack.

498
00:38:59,729 --> 00:39:01,089
Screw you!

499
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,189
I don't want to hear any of this.

500
00:39:03,189 --> 00:39:05,169
Did you bring him to me just to piss me off?

501
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,709
- Kill him. Just kill him. Kill him.
- If you were still able to manage the battle,

502
00:39:07,709 --> 00:39:11,409
how come you know nothing about Li's promotion to Commandant?

503
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:14,688
General, spare my life.

504
00:39:14,689 --> 00:39:16,089
Let me talk to the generals in Shuo State.

505
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:19,569
I'll make Commandant Li offer up Shuo State submissively.

506
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:37,350
Now even a cute little cub

507
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,700
dares to cheat me.

508
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,390
Do I look like a fool to you?

509
00:39:44,029 --> 00:39:44,928
Do I?

510
00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:46,588
Sima Jian, that liar, he cheated you.

511
00:39:46,588 --> 00:39:49,369
General, you don't know it. Commandant Li and Governor Gongsun are dying at this moment.

512
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:50,728
The Eagle Division hit them really hard.

513
00:39:50,729 --> 00:39:52,868
This is the best time for negotiation.

514
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:54,288
I know them quite well.

515
00:39:54,289 --> 00:39:57,349
I'd be the best one for this task.

516
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,768
It's been so long since the Eagle Division laid siege to Shuo State

517
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,768
and people there are still closely united with high morale.

518
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:10,348
Even if I fail, which is highly unlikely,

519
00:40:10,348 --> 00:40:12,968
it'll demoralize them greatly.

520
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:16,529
That's something Eagle Division can never do.

521
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:27,149
Let's take his words for the moment.

522
00:40:27,149 --> 00:40:29,108
Tie him to my horse.

523
00:40:29,108 --> 00:40:31,289
He'll be going into a battle with me.

524
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:33,230
Don't kill him yet.

525
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:35,889
Yes.

526
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:04,528
Great Khan ordered that anyone who makes a rash act will be executed.

527
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,070
Come on!

528
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,650
- Hang on.
- I'm too tired.

529
00:41:32,669 --> 00:41:36,189
Miss, I can't take it, Miss.

530
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:39,310
Wear these.

531
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:46,030
Miss, you're so kind.

532
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:50,109
Thank you for saving my life.

533
00:41:50,109 --> 00:41:53,750
I wish someone could save my daughter.

534
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,968
You must survive.

535
00:41:55,969 --> 00:41:58,409
Maybe you'll get to see your daughter one day.

536
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,248
General, the Eagle Division collected many clothes of the soldiers

537
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:21,609
defending Dai State while cleaning up the battlefield.

538
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:25,609
And later on their way back, Mu Jin ordered the Eagle Division to change into Tang uniforms.

539
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,230
They want to grab the credit from us.

540
00:42:35,009 --> 00:42:36,908
Gather Bear Division now!

541
00:42:36,908 --> 00:42:38,609
Hurry! Come on!

542
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:52,159
