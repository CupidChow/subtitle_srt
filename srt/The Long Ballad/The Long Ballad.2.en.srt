Greetings, Father.

23
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,950
That "lad" who reversed the game today. It was you, right?

24
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,309
I didn't mean to break into the arena.

But we were on a losing streak at that time.

So...

27
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:56,660
that's why I had to...

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,640
Well done.

29
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:06,654
You've brought not only the treasured dagger,

30
00:02:06,654 --> 00:02:08,787
but also honor for me.

31
00:02:08,787 --> 00:02:11,754
Your Grandfather heard it and requested my presence at once.

32
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:13,176
He praised you very highly

33
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:15,250
and gave many rewards.

I've never thought that a girl

could do better than your brothers.

36
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,365
Thanks for the praise, Father.

37
00:02:25,365 --> 00:02:30,570
Changge, where's the Ashile Tribe's treasured sword?

38
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,943
Send it to my room.

39
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,200
I want to appreciate it.

40
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,770
I've already sent it to Second Uncle.

42
00:02:42,877 --> 00:02:45,710
How "good and dutiful" you are!

43
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,810
It's me who's raised you

44
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,359
but how can you send the treasure to other people?

45
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:53,870
Second Uncle is also my family...

46
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,279
He's your family, so what about me?

47
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,176
How dare you take his side?

48

00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:07,040
but also hate to part with me.

170
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:14,040
Changge,

171
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,238
Biyong Hall is different from here.

172
00:10:16,239 --> 00:10:18,920
The servants there are not that meticulous,

173
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,670
so can you take special care of yourself?

174
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:23,521
When meals don't agree well with you,

175
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:27,520
can you make yourself a few delicious dishes?

176
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:30,800
As your clothes are torn

177
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,210
and I'm not at your side,

178
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:37,330
sew it yourself according to how Nanny San taught you.

179
00:10:38,088 --> 00:10:40,630
Put on more clothes,

180
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,160
if it's rainy or snowy.

181
00:10:44,155 --> 00:10:46,410
Mother.

182
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,054
How about I not go

183
00:10:48,054 --> 00:10:50,630
and stay with you?

184
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,240
Can I?

185
00:10:55,711 --> 00:10:57,054
No.

186
00:10:57,054 --> 00:10:58,940
Set out at once.

187
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,587
Do not come back without my permission!

188
00:11:01,587 --> 00:11:03,430
Mother.

189
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:06,870
Mother.

190
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:13,440
Fine, I'm leaving.

191
00:11:22,811 --> 00:11:24,580
Changge.

192
00:11:25,577 --> 00:11:27,440
Could you...

193
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,140
call me "mother" once again?

194
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:04,120
Madam.

195
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,250
You hate to part but why do you...

196
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,080
Only in this way can she live a good life.

197
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,450
<i>The mission will depart tomorrow.</i>

<i>We're not driving northward to leave.</i>

207

<i>It's not the way to Biyong.</i>

208
00:15:14,644 --> 00:15:16,199
Is it the wrong way?

209
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,400
It's not the way to Biyong.

210
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,909
We didn't go wrong.

211
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:21,310
Princess, don't worry.

212
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:25,950
Madam has told me to send you there safely.

213
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:28,380
<i>She's been weird since yesterday.</i>

214
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,843
<i>Where is she going to send me?</i>

215
00:15:30,843 --> 00:15:32,690
<i>Hurry!</i>

216
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,110
Hold on.

217
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,250
She's never treated me in this way before.

218
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,560
She must be keeping something back from me.

Ask someone and send it to East Palace.

243

Be sure to invite Crown Prince to read it.

Yes.

Too late.

Xuancheng,

254
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,321
you've persuaded him a lot.

255
00:20:08,321 --> 00:20:10,632
Is it useful to write it?

256
00:20:10,632 --> 00:20:11,910
Why do you come here?

257
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:13,670
I'm here to save you.

258
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,054
I don't need it.

259
00:20:15,054 --> 00:20:20,421
But why are you going to suggest him again?

260
00:20:20,421 --> 00:20:23,587
The officials should be loyal to their masters.

261
00:20:23,587 --> 00:20:26,487
I should fulfill my duty.

262
00:20:26,488 --> 00:20:28,443
Let me tell you that

263
00:20:28,444 --> 00:20:30,643
a loyal official cannot die with his master.

264
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:33,519
You've done your duty.

265
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,160
All your duty.

266
00:20:36,911 --> 00:20:38,340
You!

267
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,220
I'm here to prevent you.

268
00:20:42,222 --> 00:20:44,065
As I'm here,

269
00:20:44,066 --> 00:20:47,454
others will think you're under house arrest,

270
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,078
so I can preserve both your reputation

271
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,879
and your life.

272
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,850
- I don't need it!
- Xuancheng.

273
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:57,099
Do not let me down.

274
00:20:57,099 --> 00:20:58,510
Get out!

275
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,619
Get out now!

276
00:20:59,619 --> 00:21:03,990
You and I cannot leave here today.

277
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,409
Anything strange happened since last night?

278
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:11,776
Prince Qin went to East Palace.

279
00:21:11,777 --> 00:21:13,643
The emperor withdrew from court today.

280
00:21:13,643 --> 00:21:15,176
Xuanwu Gate has been closed.

281
00:21:15,176 --> 00:21:18,076
Nearly 300 cavalrymen appeared at the gate.

282
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:21,888
They left after a while.

283
00:21:21,888 --> 00:21:23,843
Who gave the order to close the gate?

284
00:21:23,843 --> 00:21:24,999
Crown Prince's subordinate.

285
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,150
General of Xuanwu Gate Chang He.

286
00:21:30,488 --> 00:21:33,270
He controlled the entrance.

287
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,240
General.

288
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,890
We found it outside Xuanwu Gate.

289
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:52,332
It's from Youzhou.

290
00:21:52,332 --> 00:21:55,860
Li Jiancheng commands the army in Youzhou.

291
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,676
As Chang He guarded the gate,

292
00:21:57,676 --> 00:22:01,670
why did he stop Crown Prince's army to enter?

293
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:07,580
Prince Qin is not that simple.

294
00:22:09,322 --> 00:22:14,090
Chang He might have turned the gun round.

295
00:22:18,155 --> 00:22:20,060

- Who are they?
- They...
- Princess?

321

Chang He! Save her! Please save my mother!

322
00:24:25,921 --> 00:24:28,065
She's lying there!

323

501
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:58,540
I will kill the murderer...

502
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,780
by all costs.

503
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:11,819
♫ <i> Life's uncertainty is like a endless dream </i> ♫

504
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:16,480
♫ <i> Joy and sorrow can fades within a flash </i> ♫

505

<i>[Crown Prince and Prince Qin died. Execute all their soldiers.]</i>

506
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,566
Now the rumor has spread.

507
00:40:24,566 --> 00:40:29,958
I'm afraid it's useless for Your Highness to swear

508
00:40:29,958 --> 00:40:33,630
or ask His Majesty's help.

509
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:37,238
What a malicious rumor!

510
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:39,429
Someone must want to stir up trouble,

511
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:42,199
causing the friction between you

512
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,021
and the generals of Li Yuanji and Li Jiancheng.

513
00:40:45,022 --> 00:40:48,450
You should make a decision as soon as possible.

514
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:52,887
Your Highness, the suburban army is the main force to support Wu City.

515
00:40:52,887 --> 00:40:54,443
We can't move it so easily.

516
00:40:54,443 --> 00:40:59,232
What about inviting the general to come in the name of giving out awards?

517
00:40:59,232 --> 00:41:02,876
Separate soldiers and their generals and then handle them.

518
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:06,399
If they're to be malicious, how could they come?

519
00:41:06,399 --> 00:41:10,232
If they refuse, it shows their wild ambitions.

520
00:41:10,232 --> 00:41:14,254
It will only alarm them and trigger a war.

521
00:41:14,254 --> 00:41:18,365
I think you'd better solve it at once, strictly and rapidly.

522
00:41:18,365 --> 00:41:19,821
I don't agree.

523
00:41:19,821 --> 00:41:24,788
I think you'd better part and rope them in, slowly and gently.

524
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:28,050
<i>[Crown Prince and Prince Qin died. Execute all their soldiers.]</i>

525
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,933
- Let's wait and see.
- Your Highness!

526
00:41:31,933 --> 00:41:35,450
That will do for the present.

527
00:41:40,788 --> 00:41:42,232
- Commander Hao!
- Commander Hao!

528
00:41:42,232 --> 00:41:43,910
Someone poisoned us.

529
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,040
Please forgive us.

530
00:41:46,644 --> 00:41:48,722
Who did it?

531
00:41:48,722 --> 00:41:49,855
A common man.

532
00:41:49,855 --> 00:41:52,243
He was clean-cut and brought us pastries from Pinxiang Store.

533
00:41:52,244 --> 00:41:54,770
We didn't eat it until he finished eating safely...

534
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:56,820
Please forgive us!

535
00:42:01,755 --> 00:42:03,370
Anything else?

536
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:07,350
No... nothing... We fainted after having it.

537
00:42:09,088 --> 00:42:10,177
Commander Hao.

538
00:42:10,177 --> 00:42:13,254
We've examined the sacrificial tablet and tributes of the Madam of East Palace.

539
00:42:13,254 --> 00:42:15,040
Nothing is missing.

540
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,600
Father.

541
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,329
Sorry for letting Father be startled by the poisoning case.

542
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:29,700
It's not a normal case.

543
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:33,140
It happened around the Madam of East Palace.

544
00:42:34,711 --> 00:42:36,340
Father, here you are.

545
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,920
They were poisoned to faint after eating these.

546
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,450
Besides, nothing was stolen.

547
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:49,998
The guy dares to poison the emperor's soldiers but steals nothing.

548
00:42:49,998 --> 00:42:52,480
It seems to be our old friend.
