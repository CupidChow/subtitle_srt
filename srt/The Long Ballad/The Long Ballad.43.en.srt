When is it her turn to send Zhixi breakfast?

24
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,380
Zhixi.

25
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,579
Why didn't you answer me?

26
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:00,639
Zhixi. Zhixi.

27
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,998
Someone help!

28
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,638
He's dead! Someone help!

29
00:02:06,638 --> 00:02:08,918
Someone help!

30
00:02:08,918 --> 00:02:11,438
Someone help me!

31
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:14,199
<i>Look. Zhixi died a terrible death.</i>

32
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,338
<i>He was fine yesterday. How could it be?</i>

33
00:02:16,338 --> 00:02:18,059
Wait.

34
00:02:24,559 --> 00:02:26,239
He was poisoned.

35
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,140
Carry him away.

36
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,879
Princess of Mobei.

37
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,599
Even if Zhixi was not willing to ally with you,

38
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,478
you didn't have to kill him.

39
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,219
<i>What? It's Princess of Mobei.</i>

40
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:42,938
Princess of Mobei did it.

41
00:02:42,938 --> 00:02:44,638
What are you talking about?

42
00:02:44,638 --> 00:02:48,419
What am I talking about? What am I talking about?

43
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,398
I'm talking about the truth!

44
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:56,159
I saw the maid of Princess of Mobei send Zhixi breakfast.

45
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,758
Then Zhixi died!

46
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,838
Out of all of them, Zhixi was the only one who didn't agree with the treaty of alliance.

47
00:03:01,839 --> 00:03:03,558
So you killed him.

48
00:03:03,559 --> 00:03:05,478
<i>How evil she is!</i>

49
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:08,920
What if all the tribes don't agree with you?

50
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,118
Will you kill them, one by one?

51
00:03:12,119 --> 00:03:13,918
<i>If we don't sign, will you kill us?</i>

52
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:15,819
<i>He's right.</i>

53
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,599
All of you, back off.

54
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,398
This happened in Great Tang,

55
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:26,038
so I, an official of Tang, will be responsible for it.

56
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:31,639
Luckily, you're here. The murderer is the maid of the Princess of Mobei.

57
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,999
She sent Zhixi breakfast.

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,359
After I entered his room, he was dead.

59
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,759
It must be her maid!

60
00:03:40,279 --> 00:03:42,478
Envoy, please calm down.

61
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,678
Since I'm here, I'll find out the truth

62
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:48,320
and make it clear to all the envoys.

63
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:15,639
What did you find?

64
00:04:19,419 --> 00:04:22,820
It's confidential, I can't tell you.

65
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,299
Goodbye.

66
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:58,279
Young Master Wei, why are you hesitating?

67
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,319
Since you've found the evidence, you can just report it.

68
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,838
Even if you're afraid the Princess of Mobei will be involved,

69
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:06,539
- you can't just hide it.
- He's right.

70
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:09,919
Princess of Mobei helped to bring about the alliance.

71
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,759
If she is a suspect, the alliance will definitely be influenced.

72
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,678
But we can't just hide it.

73
00:05:16,679 --> 00:05:21,760
If Tang conceals the murderer, it'll influence the base of the alliance.

74
00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:35,199
It's the officer's room. People with no duty shall not come in.

75
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,479
A maid dared to poison someone here?

76
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,378
Say it. Did she instigate you to do so?

77
00:05:51,378 --> 00:05:53,398
You have no evidence. Don't slander us.

78
00:05:53,398 --> 00:05:55,978
You killed him. Why can't I say?

79
00:05:55,978 --> 00:06:01,060
Since you want your maid to be your scapegoat, I'll help you with it!

80
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,240
Young Khan.

81
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,678
<i>- Young Khan.
- Young Khan.</i>

82
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:18,078
You pointed to a woman with your sword in public.

83
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:21,000
You are a shame to our tribe.

84
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,319
You're all heroes in all tribes.

85
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,278
You kill enemies on battlefields.

86
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,219
When did you become interested in bullying a woman?

87
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,558
Please, calm down.

88
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:44,440
We found a bottle of poison in this maid's room.

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,960
According to our research, Zhixi died of this poison.

90
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:53,539
Now that the evidence is here, how can you explain now, evil woman?

91
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:56,278
I said it. Don't bully a woman.

92
00:06:56,278 --> 00:07:00,139
Young Khan, are you going to protect the murderer?

93
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:01,599
I haven't finished yet.

94
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,699
Although I found this bottle from the maid's room,

95
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:07,139
it doesn't belong to her.

96
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:11,440
This bottle belongs to Young Khan of the Ashile Tribe.

97
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,900
- It's...
- That's right.

98
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:23,000
Houses in central plains are mostly made of wood, so there're mice and insects.

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,278
Therefore, I prepared this poison.

100
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,639
The poison is mine, and I gave it to Zhixi.

101
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,338
Young Khan, this... this poison is really yours?

102
00:07:33,338 --> 00:07:37,159
But I saw this maid walk out of Zhixi's room.

103
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,039
And the poison was found in her room.

104
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,538
It's... How can you explain this?

105
00:07:42,538 --> 00:07:49,039
Do you mean I instigated this Mobei maid to kill Zhixi and framed her?

106
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,900
I'm just stating the facts of what I saw.

107
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,459
This case still has many suspicious points.

108
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:59,778
We'll look into the case. We won't frame an innocent person.

109
00:07:59,778 --> 00:08:04,919
You're all esteemed guests of Great Tang. We'll treat you with due respect.

110
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:08,789
Before we find out the truth, Young Khan must stay in the room.

111
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,239
Soldiers of Tang will watch him.

112
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,239
He should be ready to cooperate with the trial.

113
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:15,379
This maid must stay in Sifang Pavilion.

114
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:19,440
If you try to escape, you'll be regarded as a murderer.

115
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,440
Young Khan, please.

116
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:31,459
This is becoming complicated.

117
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:34,120
Who did this?

118
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,070
<i>Go!</i>

119
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,760
Go. Go!

120
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:14,458
If only these peaceful days could last.

121
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:20,519
I hope every resident in Tang has food to eat and clothes to wear.

122
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:22,238
They will.

123
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:26,260
His Majesty governs the country well and loves the people here.

124
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,820
I'm sure Great Tang will be prosperous.

125
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:37,880
Elder, let me help you.

126
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,000
Are you okay?

127
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:46,079
I'm fine. My grandson is waiting for me to cook for him.

128
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,998
- Elder. let me help you.
- I can do it myself.

129
00:09:49,998 --> 00:09:52,580
You can just accompany your wife.

130
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,879
No, no.

131
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,659
Elder, I can't betray my wife's will.

132
00:09:58,659 --> 00:10:00,559
Let me help you.

133
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,379
Thank you.

134
00:10:03,379 --> 00:10:06,159
I met good people today.

135
00:10:26,546 --> 00:10:28,339
<i>[Sifang Pavilion]</i>

136
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:33,759
I thought he understood what I was doing.

137
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,699
But today, I knew it was not like that.

138
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:45,418
She'er had been away from me for too long.

139
00:10:45,418 --> 00:10:51,320
He didn't know what I was doing and what I meant.

140
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,619
He stood out today to be the scapegoat for Mimi Guli.

141
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:59,179
By doing so, he was betraying me.

142
00:10:59,179 --> 00:11:04,959
Should I punish him, or should I punish myself?

143
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,738
Princess, be at ease.

144
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:10,399
I'll deal with it.

145
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,860
I'll make sure Young Khan is safe and sound.

146
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:18,618
Well, bring Sheng Xin here tomorrow.

147
00:11:18,618 --> 00:11:21,059
A long delay may cause trouble.

148
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:23,420
We need to hurry up.

149
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,520
I understand.

150
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:33,299
Changge, I want to meet She'er.

151
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:36,678
Please help me to beg Young Master Wei and let me meet She'er.

152
00:11:36,678 --> 00:11:39,080
Why do you want to meet with him?

153
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,980
I didn't imagine he would stand out to be the scapegoat for me.

154
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,698
I was his playmate and slave when we were young.

155
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:53,799
But he regarded me as his friend.

156
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:57,339
Actually, he is pathetic.

157
00:11:57,339 --> 00:11:59,870
Okay, I can help you.

158
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,799
But you need to hurry back after you meet him. You can't let anyone know it.

159
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:10,599
Stop.

160
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,959
Why are you here?

161
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,038
I was afraid you didn't like the food of Great Tang.

162
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,580
So I made mutton noodles for you.

163
00:12:45,619 --> 00:12:47,719
Eat them while they're warm.

164
00:13:01,719 --> 00:13:03,419
It's delicious.

165
00:13:11,479 --> 00:13:14,459
Why did you stand out to be the scapegoat for me?

166
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,899
By doing so, Khatun will be angry.

167
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,859
Aren't you afraid this will ruin the reputation of the Ashile Tribe?

168
00:13:37,779 --> 00:13:39,760
She'er!

169
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:43,819
Mimi.

170
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:46,499
It's been so long since I ate the food you made.

171
00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:49,138
Are you listening to me?

172
00:13:49,138 --> 00:13:51,759
Why did you admit that poison was yours?

173
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,139
How do you know it's not mine?

174
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,740
Did you really poison him?

175
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:09,538
The Mimi I know is a woman who is kind, warmhearted, and willing to help others.

176
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:12,000
How could she kill someone?

177
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,879
Since I was young, everyone has been pretending to respect me.

178
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,619
It's all because I am Young Khan.

179
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,218
Only you, you're the only one who treats me like a friend.

180
00:14:28,218 --> 00:14:30,679
I miss those days very much.

181
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,840
Since you left, I've never given my heart to anyone else.

182
00:14:40,359 --> 00:14:45,240
Today, I just wanted to protect the one I want to protect.

183
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:48,059
She'er.

184
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:50,619
Thank you.

185
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:55,039
But we can't be together.

186
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,320
It's my own business.

187
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,359
I shall leave now.

188
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:16,460
She'er.

189
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,478
Actually, in this world,

190
00:15:20,478 --> 00:15:23,780
many people are not as simple as you think of them,

191
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,480
like... like me.

192
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,599
Maybe...

193
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:34,079
Maybe I'm not as kind as you thought.

194
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,099
I hope no matter what you encounter in the future,

195
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:41,299
you can judge it with your heart.

196
00:15:41,299 --> 00:15:46,320
Because you're different from other people in the tribes.

197
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,519
Why are you so rash? Clean it.

198
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,060
Okay, okay.

199
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,199
Khan. Khan.

200
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:15,079
Khan.

201
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,580
Khan.

202
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,999
I'm Mu Jin.

203
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,959
Khan, I'll ask you some questions.

204
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:54,359
If it's right, just blink.

205
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:58,920
Yicheng made you become like this?

206
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:15,740
Now the Ashile Tribe is controlled by Yicheng.

207
00:18:25,499 --> 00:18:27,258
- Commander Lei.
- Is Great Khan awake?

208
00:18:27,258 --> 00:18:30,139
Commander, he is still sleeping.

209
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:34,199
Khan, we're in Dingxiang.

210
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:38,280
Is the Emperor of Sui also here?

211
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,099
Khan, I'm alone now. I can't save you.

212
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:50,199
But I'll find a way to inform Sun.

213
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,198
That's right. Sun is not dead.

214
00:18:55,198 --> 00:19:00,260
If he knows about your situation now, he'll come to save you.

215
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:08,020
<i>[Reaching Hundreds of Abilities]</i>

216
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,880
I lent you the Fish Token and let Mimi Guli meet She'er.

217
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,150
This has violated the law.

218
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:00,898
This time, Bayegu Tribe admitted their crime. Just leave it alone.

219
00:20:00,898 --> 00:20:03,118
Since you knew I came here for the poison case,

220
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,098
you must have known it's not that simple.

221
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:07,579
Changge,

222
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:12,079
the Bayegu Tribe has admitted he took the poison of Ashile Tribe's Young Khan.

223
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,339
Then he put it in your maid's room.

224
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:17,318
The thing has become like this now. He's the only one to be the murderer.

225
00:20:17,318 --> 00:20:20,198
I don't believe you'll punish Ashile She'er.

226
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:22,179
If you want to find the real murderer,

227
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,139
you can't just draw a conclusion easily.

228
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,960
But he has committed suicide.

229
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,638
Wei Shuyu. Sometimes, there're some things

230
00:20:29,638 --> 00:20:33,880
that what you see with your eyes, hear with your ears is not the truth.

231
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,920
The truth...

232
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:43,879
Changge.

233
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,879
Not all the truth has to be traced to the root.

234
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,499
Sometimes, the truth will bring more trouble.

235
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,739
What are you afraid of?

236
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,139
Nothing is more important than the alliance.

237
00:21:02,139 --> 00:21:04,859
The case had better end like this.

238
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:11,319
And... your maid is not that simple.

239
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:13,818
She has sticky fingers. You should beware of her.

240
00:21:13,818 --> 00:21:15,379
You'd better let her stay away from you.

241
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:17,560
I know what I'm doing.

242
00:21:19,139 --> 00:21:21,198
I suggest you do not trust anyone easily.

243
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:25,519
What hurts people most is the betrayal of their intimate friends.

244
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,020
I'm just worried about you as a friend.

245
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,310
But now, those who accompany and protect you

246
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:37,700
are not friends of Great Tang.

247
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:40,158
I trust them,

248
00:21:40,158 --> 00:21:42,480
and they trust me.

249
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,559
It doesn't matter whether they're from Great Tang or the grasslands.

250
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,338
Changge, I'm just worried about you.

251
00:21:49,338 --> 00:21:51,478
I have no other...

252
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:55,480
Save your worries.

253
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,698
If you were talking about Sun just now, I can tell you clearly.

254
00:21:59,698 --> 00:22:02,639
Whether it's him or the maid Mimi you're talking about,

255
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,538
they've gone through thick and thin with me.

256
00:22:04,538 --> 00:22:07,379
They are friends that are worth making in my life.

257
00:22:07,379 --> 00:22:09,918
I've been through a lot recently.

258
00:22:09,918 --> 00:22:13,218
I know things are not just about right or wrong.

259
00:22:13,218 --> 00:22:15,418
Someone has his reasons to do something.

260
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:18,700
If there has to be a price for my trust,

261
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,680
I'm willing to pay for it.

262
00:22:27,326 --> 00:22:28,800
<i>[Sifang Pavilion]</i>

263
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:35,200
<i>[Sifang Pavilion]</i>

264
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:39,580
Your Highness.

265
00:22:42,219 --> 00:22:45,620
How can you be so senseless?

266
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:52,231
Your Highness.

267
00:22:52,231 --> 00:22:55,638
If you're curious about what Sifang Pavilion looks like, just tell me.

268
00:22:55,638 --> 00:22:58,799
I can take you here. But you chose to walk.

269
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,218
My feet hurt now.

270
00:23:00,218 --> 00:23:02,799
Why did you follow me?

271
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,918
My relative is living here as well. I'm here to meet her.

272
00:23:05,918 --> 00:23:07,960
Relative?

273
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,919
We'll be allies later.

274
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,180
So all tribes will be families with us in the future.

275
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,760
Let's go.

276
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,299
Your Highness, I want to go to the toilet.

277
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:21,859
Toilet? Go ahead.

278
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:45,299
Li Changge!

279
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,160
Boring. You're always like this.

280
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,019
If I scare my sister, she'll cry.

281
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:54,880
You should try to scare your father.

282
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,100
Then you'll be the one who cries.

283
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:59,300
You're so boring.

284
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,299
Why do you always mention my father to me?

285
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:03,319
I didn't tell him you were here.

286
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:05,019
I treat you so well.

287
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:06,519
But you're so serious.

288
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:10,480
Your father knows everything. You don't need to tell him.

289
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,478
Your sister will get married soon.

290
00:24:12,479 --> 00:24:14,459
If you have nothing to do, go home and help with it.

291
00:24:14,459 --> 00:24:15,799
I have something to do.

292
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:17,499
Don't bother me.

293
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,358
My sister is going to marry the foster son of Minister Du.

294
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,879
I don't like him at all.

295
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,739
I hope the best man in the world can marry my sister.

296
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,419
Why do you look at me like this?

297
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:34,060
Now I understand why your father let you be the prince.

298
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,699
Of course, that's because I'm good at both martial arts and literature.

299
00:24:36,699 --> 00:24:40,650
I'm a talent and also a rare real man in the world.

300
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,238
Don't go.

301
00:24:43,239 --> 00:24:45,529
Well... Tell me.

302
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:47,279
Why did my father let me be the prince?

303
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,718
Although you're not talented...

304
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:49,799
Shut up.

305
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,639
You're not smart and competent.

306
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,078
But you can always see the kindness of others.

307
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,958
The emperor should care for the people around him.

308
00:24:58,959 --> 00:25:00,399
The one who cares for people around him

309
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,420
will care for people in the world.

310
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:06,379
I guess he didn't want something to happen again.

311
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:09,199
If you were in that situation,

312
00:25:09,199 --> 00:25:11,838
I guess you would protect people around you.

313
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,279
Just tell me if you want to praise me.

314
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,138
I am worthy of the finest compliments in the world.

315
00:25:16,138 --> 00:25:17,899
Why did you scold me?

316
00:25:17,899 --> 00:25:20,559
Let me tell you! I'm competent.

317
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:25,219
I used to think if you were a man, you could match my sister.

318
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:28,059
If I were a man, I couldn't marry your sister.

319
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:30,560
Because my surname is Li as well.

320
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:35,959
You're right.

321
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:48,160
So, Li Changge is from the royal family?

322
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:54,019
Yang Cheng, search about Li Jiancheng's genealogy.

323
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,939

You only need to act according to our plan.

If you help me revive Sui, you'll get the top prize.

Yes, Princess.

We failed to frame Princess of Mobei this time,

336
00:26:32,199 --> 00:26:36,638
because I didn't imagine that Young Khan liked Mimi Guli.

337
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:40,378
Since this chess piece failed to function as it should

338
00:26:40,378 --> 00:26:46,580
and she may disturb Young Khan, how about abandoning her?

339
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:50,999
After all, I taught her with my heart.

340
00:26:50,999 --> 00:26:54,559
It's a pity to abandon her.

341
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,319
Forget it.

342
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:59,179
As long as we still use Buzhen to threaten her,

Mimi Guli will still work for us.

Unfortunately, so is She'er.

Princess, it's time to let Young Khan learn a lesson now.

349

Don't say you cause me trouble anymore.

360

I understand.

361

You must have tried hard to make Bayegu Tribe become the scapegoat.

It's no big deal.

These are the desserts you like.

Mother, do you know who poisoned him?

366
00:28:42,719 --> 00:28:45,068
Is it important?

367
00:28:45,068 --> 00:28:47,909
If the truth is not important, then what is important?

I'm sorry.

I shouldn't have asked.

No.

It's not that you shouldn't have asked.

But you should have understood.

Since your Uncle Khan separated us,

375
00:29:11,138 --> 00:29:15,199
you've been growing wildly outside.

376
00:29:15,199 --> 00:29:17,278
You have your way of doing things.

I won't blame you.

378

But now the world is fickle and people are evil.

00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:28,850
I didn't have a chance to teach you.

380
00:29:29,719 --> 00:29:33,138
So you're walking further and further from me.

381

There're three reasons why I want to marry Changge.

00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:08,170
I want to accompany her for the rest of my life.

488
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,370
Secondly, I learned martial arts when I was young.

489
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:14,810
I think I have some achievements.

490
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,548
Although I'm not the General of Eagle Division anymore,

491
00:40:16,549 --> 00:40:19,189
I'm confident that I can protect Changge.

492
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,969
I won't let her starve.

493
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:24,469
And I won't let anyone hurt her.

494
00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:29,029
In my heart, Changge is more important than my life.

495
00:40:30,029 --> 00:40:35,570
Thirdly, if you ask me what I'm pursuing, I thought much about it,

496
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:40,530
I went through a lot, and I suffered a lot; but in the end,

497
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:45,149
all I want is just peace.

498
00:40:45,669 --> 00:40:48,150
This is Changge's wish.

499
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:52,370
I think... this is also your wish.

500
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:57,208
After the alliance talk ends, I'll take Changge to the countryside.

501
00:40:57,208 --> 00:41:02,030
We'll stay away from conflicts and enjoy the rest of our lives.

502
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:07,070
Now, I don't have money to buy betrothal presents.

503
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,988
But rest assured, Madam.

504
00:41:08,988 --> 00:41:14,029
I swear to Sirius, whether it's money or my love for Changge,

505
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:18,143
I'll give her all I have.

506
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:19,404
<i>[Memorial Tablet of Lady Jin]</i>

507
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,930
<i>[Memorial Tablet of Lady Jin]</i>

508
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,430
<i>[Memorial Tablet of Lady Jin]</i>

509
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:17,588
<i>[Letter of Proposing Marriage]</i>

510
00:42:17,589 --> 00:42:20,449
<i>Sugar Figurine Candy! Come buy some Sugar Figurine Candy.!</i>

511
00:42:20,449 --> 00:42:22,810
I finally found you.

512
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,089
Who are you?

513
00:42:26,089 --> 00:42:28,609
I'm His Highness's servant, Sheng Xin.

514
00:42:28,609 --> 00:42:30,889
His Highness let me deliver a message for you.

515
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:33,070
He wanted to meet you.

516
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:37,329
Don't be nervous, Princess.

517
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:39,869
Since His Highness can tell me such a private thing,

518
00:42:39,869 --> 00:42:41,588
it means he trusts me.

519
00:42:41,588 --> 00:42:43,369
I won't tell anyone about it.

520
00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:47,569
Otherwise, His Highness and you can kill me at any time.

521
00:42:47,569 --> 00:42:49,789
Make a long story short.

522
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:54,028
His Highness is busy now.

523
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,089
So he asked me to look for you

524
00:42:56,089 --> 00:42:58,728
and tell you that he found something important.

525
00:42:58,728 --> 00:43:00,788
He wanted to give it to you in person.

526
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:03,548
I'm afraid you wouldn't believe me.

527
00:43:03,549 --> 00:43:05,108
His Highness thought about it.

528
00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:07,769
But he still asked me to say he is looking for you,

529
00:43:07,769 --> 00:43:10,450
so you'll believe me.

530
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:14,048
If you doubt it, you can bring someone you trust.

531
00:43:14,048 --> 00:43:16,910
Then you can go with me.

532
00:43:16,910 --> 00:43:18,069
It's not like that.

533
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:20,108
His Highness said this is an emergency.

534
00:43:20,108 --> 00:43:23,430
He wanted you to meet him immediately.
