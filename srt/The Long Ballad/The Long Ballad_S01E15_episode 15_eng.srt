00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,999
♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,959
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,930
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,819
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:34,689

♫  To the distance  ♫

10

♫  The miserable past is like a dagger  ♫

♫  Though my wings are broken  ♫

♫  I will keep flying  ♫

♫  I'll forget you  ♫

♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

16
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,359
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,310
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,269
♫  The river of life is under my feet  ♫

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,760

20
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:32,479
   

21
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,968
   

22
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:40,519
Governor! Governor!

23
00:01:41,419 --> 00:01:43,119
I promise you.

24
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,699
I'll protect Madam and Little Miss Yuan.

25
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,760
Princess.

26
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,959
Then I'm feeling relieved.

27
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,760
Elder Qin, you can work for Changge in the future.

28
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,979
Elder Qin and Xu Feng have worked for me for many years.

29
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:10,640
If you have any difficulty,

30
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,160
they'll surely help you.

31
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,640
Elder Qin!

32
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,828
Do you want to witness the governor's death because of the trade?

33
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:23,429
I...

34
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,428
Master, you want me to watch you die,

35
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:30,449
isn't it too cruel?

36
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,289
Elder Qin,

37
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:01,230
you always say I'm stubborn.

38
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,290
And you?

39
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,709
You're stubborn, too.

40
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:11,309
Work for Changge.

41
00:03:11,309 --> 00:03:14,110
Maybe she'll realize your belief.

42
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,510
In this city,

43
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:26,150
at this moment, not a single family has escaped.

44
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:30,029
They trust me so much.

45
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:33,089
I can't let them down.

46
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,710
However, in the end, I've failed my wife and daughter.

47
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:47,109
Look. This tea flower blooms beautifully.

48
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:54,449
We planted it together when I first met my wife.

49
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:57,310
I know it.

50
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:02,249
My wife likes to plant flowers.

51
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,390
But I don't have time to accompany her.

52
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:16,829
Honey, let's meet in our next life.

53
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,929
I'll accompany you more.

54
00:04:33,869 --> 00:04:39,590
Ride a quick horse and gallop.

55
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,329
Governor!

56
00:04:43,329 --> 00:04:45,030
Master!

57
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,009
On the way to death,

58
00:04:51,429 --> 00:04:53,950
I choose to go first!

59
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:09,879
♫   The past never blows away the moonlight   ♫

60
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:15,234
♫   I can't forget where to look back   ♫

61
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,770
Why don't you save him? Why don't you save him?

62
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,688
How could I save him?

63
00:05:28,688 --> 00:05:31,388
Why don't you save him?

64
00:05:31,388 --> 00:05:33,709
Tell me.

65
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:37,670
How could I save him?

66
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,649
Is this worth it?

67
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:47,229
He did so, after thousands of years,

68
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:50,969
who will remember Gongsun Heng?

69
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:55,809
Who will thank him?

70
00:05:56,769 --> 00:05:59,150
Is it worth it?

71
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:07,630
He doesn't care whether he will be remembered.

72
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:11,090
Even if everyone blames him, so what?

73
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:14,950
He never cared about this.

74
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:20,589
What he defends with his life is just caring about people.

75
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,390
Madam.

76
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,670
Everyone will die.

77
00:06:26,749 --> 00:06:29,050
He died for what he wants.

78
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:33,129
It's not his sacrifice.

79
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:36,900
But as the guard army leader, it's the highest glory for him.

80
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:42,510
♫   Joy and sorrow can fades within a flash   ♫

81
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,429
He died suddenly.

82
00:06:45,429 --> 00:06:48,149
Please, give me some time.

83
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:49,908
I want to accompany him.

84
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:51,849
Yes, Madam.

85
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,370
Commandant.

86
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:59,910
♫   Ah... It's like a sudden realization   ♫

87
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,690
When did you have this idea?

88
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:31,089
Is it three days ago,

89
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,229
five days ago,

90
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:35,649
or every day?

91
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,589
But you never told me.

92
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:43,489
We've been married for so many years.

93
00:07:43,489 --> 00:07:46,850
How could I not know what you thought? 
    

94
00:07:48,359 --> 00:07:53,100
 You never changed. 

95
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,140
That year,

96
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:01,440
you married me with a bride-price of wild geese.

97
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:05,178
I asked you what your ambition was.

98
00:08:05,178 --> 00:08:08,018
You said even if people's life was hard,

99
00:08:08,018 --> 00:08:10,659
you would overcome difficulties,

100
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,059
settle the chaos,

101
00:08:14,059 --> 00:08:16,859
and protect people.

102
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,639
I thought you were bragging.

103
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,079
However,

104
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:30,060
you sacrificed your life for this promise.

105
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:36,980
 Rest assured. 

106
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:41,279
We've prepared winter coats for soldiers and people.

107
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,599
And we stocked seeds for next spring.

108
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,498
After everything is settled,

109
00:08:49,498 --> 00:08:54,599
Shuo State will be safe and sound as you wish.

110
00:08:54,599 --> 00:08:57,120
We were born in this turbulent world.

111
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,510
I hope I can live a peaceful life

112
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:05,250
and spend every day with you.

113
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,560
It's just a wild wish now.

114
00:09:11,359 --> 00:09:13,059
Forget it.

115
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,570
   

116
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:36,038
You died to defend this city.

117
00:09:36,038 --> 00:09:38,499
You died as you wish.

118
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:41,660
But as a mother,

119
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:47,560
I'm a little selfish.

120
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:55,399
Yuan'er may suffer in the future.

121
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,860
Fool!

122
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,160
You two fools!

123
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:41,419
Governor and his wife died for people.

124
00:10:41,419 --> 00:10:43,779
They died in glory.

125
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,939
But, Princess,

126
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:52,280
do you understand what the home is, what the country is,

127
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,819
what the people are, what the world is?

128
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:02,040
Governor asked me to work for you.

129
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,320
But what do you believe in?

130
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,840
And what is your belief?

131
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,020
Belief...

132
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,760
My belief...

133
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,660
What is my belief?

134
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:22,329
♫   The shadow left behind   ♫

135
00:11:22,329 --> 00:11:26,669
♫   I hope your voice lasts a moment longer   ♫

136
00:11:26,669 --> 00:11:30,239
♫   Don't ask the falling sand   ♫

137
00:11:30,239 --> 00:11:35,884
♫   Allowing time to continue another moment   ♫

138
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:09,959
I didn't expect Gongsun Heng to surrender so easily.

139
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:13,340
And you agreed on his conditions so easily.

140
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,779
Gongsun Heng is a hero.

141
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:17,939
He deserves our bow with wine.

142
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:33,839
Our brothers don't know you promised Gongsun Heng that

143
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,460
you wouldn't enslave or kill the people in Shuo State.

144
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,799
They respect you.

145
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,760
You can just tell them.

146
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,819
But how will you explain to Great Khan?

147
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,420
You wanted to defy Great Khan's order at the beginning?

148
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:57,640
So you risked your life to meet Gongsun Heng.

149
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,320
I thought you just wanted to check if that Shisi was fine.

150
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,220
Sun, are you crazy?

151
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,630
I only care if we can get Shuo State or not.

152
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,099
I don't want to kill all the people there.

153
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:11,570
You!

154
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,379
You are not what you used to be.

155
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,800
When did you become so merciful?

156
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:20,219
There's another thing.

157
00:13:20,219 --> 00:13:22,039
Ibukan is dead.

158
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:24,499
Tu Kashe suffered many losses.

159
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:26,540
When Shuo State surrenders tomorrow,

160
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,119
make sure Tu Kashe won't cause us any trouble.

161
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:34,240
Do you think Shuo State will pretend to surrender tomorrow?

162
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,039
You don't know them.

163
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:37,740
They won't.

164
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,759
They?

165
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,640
You shall go back.

166
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:14,130
   

167
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:45,239
 Governor, let me accompany you to see Shuo State again. 

168
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:51,640
 I think I understand the reason why you wanted to guard this place. 

169
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:57,599
 You chose the hardest way. 

170
00:14:57,599 --> 00:15:00,580
 After you died, you became god. 

171
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,940
 Even in hell, your soul will still be a hero. 

172
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,039
 Although I'm not as kind and brave as you are, 

173
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:10,939
 I'll guard this place and the people here for you! 

174
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:14,059
 Even if there are difficulties and enemies, 

175
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:16,619
 I'm not afraid. 

176
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,952
   

177
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:57,520
   

178
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:22,018
Why has no one come out?

179
00:16:22,018 --> 00:16:24,359
Did they pretend to surrender again?

180
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:28,440
We can't trust what they said.

181
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,700
Wait.

182
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,639
Why isn't Commandant Li here?

183
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,499
Has he left here?

184
00:16:43,499 --> 00:16:44,439
I'll find him.

185
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:45,739
Wait.

186
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:48,259
He'll surely come.

187
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:55,210
   

188
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,348
   

189
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,000
Gongsun Heng has died.

190
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,119
Shuo State will surrender.

191
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,480
It's useless to let you live now.

192
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,680
It's not settled yet.

193
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,000
As a Princess of Great Tang,

194
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,939
I'll fight for my people this time.

195
00:18:30,939 --> 00:18:35,039
If you try to stop me, you'll be the enemy of Great Tang.

196
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:58,799
My beloved ones were all killed like dogs.

197
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,760
I was expelled from where I was born.

198
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,620
I'd rather die every day.

199
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,240
After I settle this,

200
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:15,780
you can kill me.

201
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,604
   

202
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,819
As a princess,

203
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:57,839
you knelt down to the surrendered General of Sui.

204
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:00,000
He deserves it.

205
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,840
Because, in Shuo State, thanks to Gongsun Heng,

206
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,179
I've found I have my own belief now.

207
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:11,920
I don't want to give it up.

208
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,560
He sacrificed his life to defend this city.

209
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,699
He deserves it more than anyone else.

210
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,899
Did you remake the accounts of treasury and ordnance?

211
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,159
Yes.

212
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:06,839
We hid over 70 percent.

213
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:09,979
When Ashile Sun comes in with pleasure,

214
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:12,759
you'll send Yuan'er out of the city.

215
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:15,720
At the same time, we'll transport these things secretly.

216
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,780
Without my message, no one shall come back.

217
00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:23,780
You don't have confidence in this surrender, Commandant Li?

218
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,619
The cities in the north have belonged to the Ashile Tribe.

219
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,939
Chang'an didn't come to the rescue.

220
00:21:29,939 --> 00:21:35,738
It seems the war in the north is not important as Li Shimin's throne.

221
00:21:35,738 --> 00:21:39,000
No one knows what will happen after we surrender.

222
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,760
Governor left his daughter and this property with us.

223
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,660
I can feel relieved after I entrust you with that.

224
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,139
He sacrificed his life to protect Shuo State.

225
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,140
I'll protect this place for him.

226
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:04,368
I, Qin Gu, am just a normal person.

227
00:22:04,368 --> 00:22:06,368
I'm more than 60 years old.

228
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:10,049
I worked for five masters as their adviser.

229
00:22:10,049 --> 00:22:12,528
They're all great men.

230
00:22:12,528 --> 00:22:14,629
Some of them even can be emperors.

231
00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:18,350
But they didn't defeat the Li Family and died.

232
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:25,080
A person like me, do you really want me to work for you?

233
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,499
Although I still don't know what belief I have,

234
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:36,290
I know one thing clearly.

235
00:22:37,009 --> 00:22:39,229
I've lost my home.

236
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,580
I don't want to lose Great Tang.

237
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:50,570
Please help me.

238
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:52,628
Okay.

239
00:22:52,628 --> 00:22:57,690
Whatever you do, I'll support you.

240
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,868
Okay. We need to try our best.

241
00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:03,129
Okay.

242
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:08,949
You don't need to follow me.

243
00:23:08,949 --> 00:23:11,109
I'll go alone.

244
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:21,069
♫   Nowhere to escape. No one to rely on   ♫

245
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:27,058
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

246
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:36,970
♫   Never give in. Forget about one's youth   ♫

247
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,949
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

248
00:23:39,949 --> 00:23:42,971
♫   Tears and regrets go hand in hand   ♫

249
00:23:42,972 --> 00:23:48,890
♫  But my heart is still fiery-hot. To the distance  ♫

250
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,920
♫  The miserable past is like a dagger  ♫

251
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,824
♫  Though my wings are broken  ♫

252
00:23:54,824 --> 00:24:02,275
♫  I will keep flying  ♫

253
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:09,519
♫  Following the direction of the light, I'll forget you  ♫

254
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:15,520
♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

255
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,606
   

256
00:24:18,606 --> 00:24:21,499
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

257
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:29,707
♫  The river of life is under my feet. I don't regret my craziness  ♫

258
00:24:37,607 --> 00:24:43,660
♫  Following the direction of the light, I'll forget you  ♫

259
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:49,549
♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

260
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:52,599
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

261
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:55,470
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

262
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:03,316
♫  The river of life is under my feet. I don't regret my craziness  ♫

263
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:14,630
   

264
00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:34,450
Isn't this Shisi?

265
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,768
On behalf of troops and people in Shuo State,

266
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,949
I, Commandant Li Shisi, open the gate and surrender.

267
00:25:40,949 --> 00:25:46,190
Shuo State Governor, Gongsun Heng has committed suicide due to his guilt.

268
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:52,029
He hoped to use his death to release the anger of the general.

269
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:54,869
His head is here.

270
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:57,369
Please have a look, General.

271
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,360
Go.

272
00:26:35,699 --> 00:26:39,499
General, this is Gongsun Heng's head.

273
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:49,298
 You knew he was hurt? 

274
00:26:49,298 --> 00:26:51,798
 I bound it up for him. Of course, I knew. 

275
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:54,459
 You're that veterinarian! 

276
00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:24,768
 My surname is Qin and given name is Zhun. 

277
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,269
 A'Zhun? 

278
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,489
 Are you really A'Zhun? 

279
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,589
We fought against you.

280
00:27:46,589 --> 00:27:48,769
We knew we were sinful.

281
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:54,330
The criminal Gongsun Heng asked me to give you treasury and food.

282
00:27:55,129 --> 00:27:57,730
Now we've counted it.

283
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,869
Please go inside and check, General.

284
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:03,490
Now we'll open the gate.

285
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:11,469
General and the soldiers of Ashile Tribe can take treasures in the city.

286
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:17,670
As a criminal,

287
00:28:24,989 --> 00:28:31,029
I hope General can spare the lives of the people in Shuo State.

288
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:34,338
If you had known it, why hadn't you surrendered earlier?

289
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:36,239
Now many of our brothers have died.

290
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,859
Let you go? Nonsense!

291
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:40,300
 - We can't let him go. 
 - Kill him! 

292
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,378
 Kill him! 

293
00:28:41,378 --> 00:28:43,178
 Revenge for our brothers! 

294
00:28:43,178 --> 00:28:44,598
 Kill him! 

295
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:47,039
 Kill them! 

296
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,098
 We can't let him go! 

297
00:28:48,098 --> 00:28:50,839
 Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! 

298
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:53,598
 - Kill him! 
 - We can't let him go! 

299
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,759
 - Kill him! 
 - We can't let him go! 

300
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:57,559
 Kill him! 

301
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,760
Why do you think I'll promise you?

302
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,939
If you want to kill me, I have nothing to say.

303
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:15,580
But if you want all people in this city to die,

304
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:18,440
it's impossible.

305
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,219
If so, I'd choose to die together.

306
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,038
You loser.

307
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,459
Why don't you surrender?

308
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:29,800
 Loser, just surrender! 

309
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,048
 I can kill you now! 

310
00:29:32,048 --> 00:29:33,630
 Surrender! Surrender! 

311
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:38,030
So, you think you can still fight with me now?

312
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,040
I'm not bragging.

313
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,819
But there're woods and potassium nitrate in the city.

314
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:47,799
If you promise not to kill us, we won't choose to die with you.

315
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:53,820
If you insist on killing all the people in the city,

316
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:59,200
we'll choose to die together with your troop.

317
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,380
I should have warned you,

318
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,700
I hate to be threatened.

319
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,680
It's not like that, General.

320
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,600
This is just a trade.

321
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,700
Okay. I promise you.

322
00:30:51,199 --> 00:30:52,798
The snow has stopped.

323
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,680
Right. It's sunny again.

324
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
That's right.

325
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,960
Thank you for your mercy, General.

326
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,540
I hope you can fulfill your promise.

327
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,019
Don't kill the people here.

328
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:06,160
But I have a condition.

329
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,139
I want you to be my servant.

330
00:31:08,139 --> 00:31:12,260
I'm your master and you should work for me.

331
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,279
Good! Such a good idea!

332
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:28,579
Now that Gongsun Heng died, he'll be the commandant of Shuo State.

333
00:31:28,579 --> 00:31:32,698
Let them see how their commandant became our slave now.

334
00:31:32,698 --> 00:31:38,559
 Good idea! 

335
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,650
If you agree, I won't kill the people in Shuo State.

336
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,880
You...

337
00:31:45,859 --> 00:31:48,199
You want me to be your slave?

338
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:50,299
Right.

339
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:52,019
My slave.

340
00:31:52,019 --> 00:31:54,760
Now everyone in Shuo State has known that

341
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,759
you betrayed your master and become a traitor.

342
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,319
You can't stay here now.

343
00:32:05,499 --> 00:32:07,660
Don't make me wait.

344
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,740
I don't have patience.

345
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,060
I can withdraw my promise at any time.

346
00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:33,140
I'll be your servant.

347
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:12,460
Yuan'er, you're awake.

348
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,599
Where's Brother Li?

349
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,919
Brother Li said he wanted you to behave well.

350
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,100
After a while, he'll come to play with you.

351
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:29,018
I'll behave well.

352
00:33:29,018 --> 00:33:33,400
I want to see Brother Li soon.

353
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,319
Yuan'er is a good girl.

354
00:33:35,319 --> 00:33:38,380
You're such a good girl.

355
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,899
 Move! 

356
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:08,780
 Step aside! 

357
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,779
 Step aside! 

358
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:15,560
 Step aside! Step aside! 

359
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,360
 Step aside! 

360
00:34:18,259 --> 00:34:20,359
 Just go! Be quick. 

361
00:34:21,439 --> 00:34:23,139
 Step aside! 

362
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,279
Look, what happened?

363
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:30,880
I don't know.

364
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,019
There're so many people.

365
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:01,478
 Traitor! Traitor! 

366
00:35:01,478 --> 00:35:03,298
 Traitor! 

367
00:35:03,298 --> 00:35:04,859
 Traitor! Traitor! 

368
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,240
 You betrayed your master! 

369
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,440
 Why are you still alive? 

370
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,039
 - Traitor! 
 - You traitor! 

371
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:15,099
 Governor and his wife died all because of you! 

372
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,240
 You traitor! 

373
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,439
 Why didn't you die? 

374
00:35:17,439 --> 00:35:18,298
 You villain! 

375
00:35:18,299 --> 00:35:21,099
 Traitor! Traitor! 

376
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:23,450
 Why didn't you die? 

377
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,520
 Shameless! 

378
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,660
 Traitor! 

379
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,399
 Traitor! 

380
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:32,479
 It's all because of you! 

381
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:33,498
 Villain! 

382
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:36,079
 It's all because of you! 

383
00:35:37,879 --> 00:35:40,240
 Just go to hell! 

384
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,700
 Go to hell! 

385
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,438
He didn't even explain.

386
00:35:57,438 --> 00:35:59,520
Explain?

387
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,700
Will it work?

388
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:05,620
People will only believe what they want to believe.

389
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:09,970
 Evil traitor! 

390
00:36:15,939 --> 00:36:17,459
Step aside! Step aside!

391
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,739
- Shameless! 
 - Step aside!

392
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:20,519
Step aside!

393
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,039
The Governor of Shuo State has died.

394
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:33,859
Great Khan admires his courage,

395
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:36,739
so he'll pardon Shuo State.

396
00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:39,000
 Pardon us? 

397
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,498
 Great. 

398
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:42,158
 Right. 

399
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,540
 We won't be killed. 

400
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,819
 Great. 

401
00:36:44,819 --> 00:36:47,078
 - We're pardoned. 
 - We're pardoned. 

402
00:36:47,078 --> 00:36:49,699
 We don't need to die. 

403
00:36:57,879 --> 00:37:00,119
General Sun won't betray his promise.

404
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,400
Do you feel relieved now?

405
00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:11,220
Look at them.

406
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,100
None of them understands your sacrifice.

407
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,159
They hate you.

408
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,239
Is it worth it?

409
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,619
 Who will thank him? 

410
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:40,480
 Is it worth it? 

411
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,800
 What he defends with his life is just caring about people. 

412
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,680
Yes, it is.

413
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,230
   

414
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,138
Sun, you really don't need to watch them packing?

415
00:38:48,138 --> 00:38:52,199
What if someone can't tolerate it and kills some of our brothers?

416
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:55,980
If you are worried, go to check yourself.

417
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,859
 Where is he? 

418
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:01,538
Tu Kashe, you're so shameless.

419
00:39:01,538 --> 00:39:03,298
This is not the area of Bear Division.

420
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,679
Did we ask you to come in?

421
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:07,520
I never had a defeat during these years.

422
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,978
But I have never won since I came here.

423
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:11,039
I have already been shameless!

424
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:15,359
Let me ask you!  Why did you let the defenders go secretly?

425
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,039
It's none of your business.

426
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:22,158
I asked this for Great Khan.

427
00:39:22,158 --> 00:39:24,638
The young men in the city are either dead or injured.

428
00:39:24,638 --> 00:39:26,319
The rest are some elders and women.

429
00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:27,560
If we bring them back, who will take care of them?

430
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,338
We can kill them and bring their heads back.

431
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:32,139
Many soldiers in Bear Division died.

432
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,999
How could I explain to them?

433
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:37,030
Many brothers in Eagle Division died as well!

434
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,760
If you didn't plunge into action,

435
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,660
how could we fail in camouflage?

436
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:47,460
Tu Kashe, you ruined the plan Great Khan made.

437
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,439
Now you want to blame me on behalf of Great Khan?

438
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,220
Are you qualified?

439
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:56,119
I'm not!

440
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:58,040
But you can't let them go!

441
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:03,139
If I were you, I'd choose to shut up.

442
00:40:03,959 --> 00:40:06,140
If so,

443
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:10,620
maybe I can share some profit with you.

444
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,539
Otherwise,

445
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:16,280
I don't know what I'll write on my battle report.

446
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,679
Let's wait and see.

447
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,519
Do you really want to report this to Great Khan?

448
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:40,159
In the past, we were merciful to people in Great Tang.

449
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:41,619
No other people would know of it.

450
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:44,249
But this time, the Bear Division saw what we did.

451
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,219
They'll surely take the chance to defame us in front of Great Khan.

452
00:40:46,219 --> 00:40:50,120
Mu Jin, remember.

453
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:55,460
It's my decision. It's not related to Eagle Division.

454
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,759
- You... 
 - Also, do me a favor.

455
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,679
 Have a look. 

456
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:08,779
 What is this? 

457
00:41:08,779 --> 00:41:09,760
 Here. 

458
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,919
 Come on. What is it? 

459
00:41:10,919 --> 00:41:12,740
 Have a look. 

460
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,770
   

461
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:20,179
If he knew this, why would he do that?

462
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:22,039
He must have felt guilty.

463
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:24,940
Since he's dead, it's all over now.

464
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,419
Commandant Li has made contributions to Shuo State.

465
00:41:29,419 --> 00:41:30,660
 That's right. 

466
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,139
He paid for it.

467
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:33,700
He has paid for it!

468
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,479
 Come on, let's go. 

469
00:41:35,479 --> 00:41:38,598
- Let's go. 
 - He paid for it.

470
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,140
If you die,

471
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,960
I won't let the people here go.

472
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,280
What do you want to do?

473
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,620
Don't forget.

474
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,079
I've made the Ashile Tribe suffer a great loss.

475
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,859
If you want me to work for you,

476
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,220
what will Tu Kashe do?

477
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:48,279
What will other tribes and Great Khan think of it?

478
00:42:48,279 --> 00:42:50,680
What a pity!

479
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,100
Commandant Li has died.

480
00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:56,100
From now on,

481
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,200
you'll just be a slave in Eagle Division.

♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

497
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,910
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

498
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:12,289
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

499
00:44:12,289 --> 00:44:16,859
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

500
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:19,619
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

501
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:21,560
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

502
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:28,730
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

503
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:35,839
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

504
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:41,669
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

505
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:45,180
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

506
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:51,690
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

507
00:44:51,690 --> 00:44:54,050
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

508
00:44:54,050 --> 00:44:56,419
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

509
00:44:56,419 --> 00:45:00,999
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

510
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,770
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

511
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:05,669
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

512
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:13,280
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

513
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,750
♫  It is sleepless  ♫

514
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:34,580
