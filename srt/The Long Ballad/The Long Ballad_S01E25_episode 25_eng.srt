Let go of my mother.

Now that you kneel down, what about a kowtow to amuse us?

24
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,109
Do you think your dignity's more important than your mother's life?

Let's see the physician, okay, Mother?

32
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,510
I'll kill them!

Did you kill her?

48
00:05:31,119 --> 00:05:32,239
No, I didn't.

49
00:05:32,239 --> 00:05:34,339
It was her...

50
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,680
We're too late.

51
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,519
- Sun! 
 - Sun!

52
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:16,780
General Sun!

53
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,779
- General Sun! 
 - Sun!

54
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:19,600
Find General Sun in all directions! Hurry!

55
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,400
Guard A'Yi'er. Sun!

56
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,419
- Find General Sun! 
 - Sun!

57
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:25,920
Hurry. Sun!

58
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,520
No!

59
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,638
Mother! Mother!

60
00:06:51,638 --> 00:06:53,379
She'er.

61
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,959
Mother, are you okay?

62
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,720
Step aside.

63
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,019
No, Sun. I'm begging you.

64
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:03,540
For the sake of my relationship with A'Yi'er for years, I'm begging you.

65
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,099
Don't hurt She'er.

66
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,200
Ashile Sun,

67
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,898
A'Yi'er died at my sword.

68
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:11,360
Just kill me.

69
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,498
Don't hurt my mother.

70
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,799
No. I'm his mother.

71
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:16,378
I can die for him.

72
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:18,139
Don't hurt him.

73
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,040
No!

74
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,958
Mother. It's okay.

75
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:52,019
She'er, are you okay?

76
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:52,839
Are you okay?

77
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,880
Khatun.

78
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,259
Khatun, are you okay?

79
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,780
Guards, take Ashile Sun!

80
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,750
Sun!

81
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:14,999
Eagle Division Vanguard is here. Take General back.

82
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:15,951
Take General back.

83
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:18,334
Who dares ask for trouble?

84
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,539
Guards, escort Khatun and Young Khan back.

85
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,760
Don't let them go.

86
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,579
- Take She'er down. 
  - Yes! 

87
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:29,378
Sun!

88
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:30,218
Su Yishe!

89
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:31,060
Piss off.

90
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,639
Sun, calm down!

91
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:35,258
Sun.

92
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:37,059
Calm down?

93
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,453
I told you not to act recklessly. Did you listen to me?

94
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:43,650
If you hadn't been stubborn, how could it be like this?

95
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:47,400
If you hadn't been stubborn, how could my mother have died?

96
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,819
Mu Jin, take him away.

97
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:06,199
Assemble the Wolf Division and chase them.

98
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:10,319
Wait!  Let them go.

99
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:12,839
The capital was in chaos, and Khatun was badly hurt.

100
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:15,060
How can you account for this?

101
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,580
Chase them back.

102
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,479
Stop.

103
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:41,179
What's wrong now?

104
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,179
Mu Jin, there's a dry river bed.

105
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,520
You can hide inside.

106
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,199
And Shiba, protect A'Yi'er's body.

107
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:50,059
What about you?

108
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,898
I'll take the troop to the right.

109
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,739
You want to distract the Wolf Division?

110
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,809
Yes.

111
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,299
After I distract them, take Sun to see a physician.

112
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,399
No. After Sun wakes up, he'll hate me.

113
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:02,880
No, he won't.

114
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,760
I caused his mother's death and involved Eagle Division.

115
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,478
He must hold a grudge against me.

116
00:10:07,478 --> 00:10:09,419
It's too risky.

117
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,649
Mu Jin, Eagle Division is inseparable from Sun.

118
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:14,040
You're the only one who can protect Sun.

119
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,570
He'll be clear of the charges She'er accused him of

120
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,558
when Great Khan's back.

121
00:10:17,558 --> 00:10:19,598
Only you can protect Sun well.

122
00:10:19,598 --> 00:10:21,279
Go.

123
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,158
There's no time. Go!

124
00:10:23,158 --> 00:10:26,279
Eagle Division Vanguard, listen to Military Counsellor Li.

125
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,779
Yes.

126
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,880
Eagle Division Vanguard, go ahead with me.

127
00:10:47,599 --> 00:10:49,080
Wake up, bastard!

128
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,980
Don't sleep.

129
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,138
Military Counsellor, what's wrong?

130
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:14,029
Listen to my order!  In line with Ashile Tribe's rules,

131
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,840
captives from their own tribe won't be killed.

132
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,258
If Wolf Division arrives, don't resist desperately.

133
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:20,350
Surrender once being caught.

134
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,038
For the sake of Eagle Division and General Sun, protect your lives.

135
00:11:23,038 --> 00:11:24,718
What about you?

136
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:26,739
They won't let go of me because I released Luo Yi.

137
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,499
Don't worry about me. I'll run away then.

138
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,200
But...

139
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,459
Remember what I said.

140
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:36,039
Save your lives.

141
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,578
I'm not under Eagle Division now.

142
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:39,119
Don't worry about me.

143
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:51,119
- Chase them respectively. 
 - Yes.

144
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,799
 What's wrong? 

145
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:43,919
 What happened to General? 

146
00:12:50,119 --> 00:12:52,171
Mu Jin, what happened to General?

147
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,258
- Go find a witch doctor. 
 - I'll go now.

148
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:55,959
Witch doctor.

149
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,319
Mu Jin! Mu Jin, wait!

150
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:04,366
What's wrong with General Sun? Where's Changge?

151
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,018
Why isn't Changge back with you?

152
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:08,439
I've no time to explain to you.

153
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:11,159
Where's she?

154
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,899
Put me down.

155
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,799
General Sun.

156
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:16,399
Sun.

157
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:19,919
Where's my mother?

158
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:23,559
Where's my mother?

159
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,799
We've taken A'Yi'er's body back.

160
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,680
I want to see her.

161
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,359
Mu Jin, take me to see her.

162
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,220
Mother.

163
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:03,260
I failed to protect you well.

164
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:09,960
I know Father took you hostage,

165
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,999
and connived She'er to fight with me.

166
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:15,520
I thought as long as...

167
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,080
as long as I pretend not to care much about you, you'd not be involved.

168
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:24,499
But I was wrong.

169
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:29,840
If I had known it,

170
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:34,659
I would have brought you back even if I had to disobey Father

171
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:37,229
and give up everything.

172
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:39,686
The victory or loss is far less important

173
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,420
than the well-being of families and clansmen.

174
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:50,499
Mother, you may rest assured.

175
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,839
From now on, I won't be reckless,

176
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:02,539
or do things that cause killing sprees.

177
00:16:02,539 --> 00:16:06,280
Now I just want to protect the ones I want to protect

178
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:11,960
from sufferings like you.

179
00:16:15,479 --> 00:16:17,740
Please rest assured.

180
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:25,520
I can only pay my debt of gratitude to you in my next life.

181
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,819
Take the medicine.

182
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:02,359
Sit down.

183
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,880
What about the others?

184
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,979
Su Yishe and the other men were captured by the Wolf Division,

185
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,179
but are not in danger.

186
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:27,619
What about Li Changge?

187
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,711
Did she return to Central Plains?

188
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:31,411
She...

189
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,178
She got separated from Su Yishe.

190
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,720
I've sent men to find her.

191
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,900
Luo Shiba went as well.

192
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,980
Got separated?

193
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,020
What do you mean?

194
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:44,319
Tell me.

195
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:46,959
She distracted the Wolf Division's soldiers.

196
00:17:46,959 --> 00:17:51,200
Now... Now she's missing.

197
00:17:55,379 --> 00:17:57,959
Sun, you haven't recovered. You have to a rest.

198
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,538
I must find her.

199
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:01,058
Don't stop me.

200
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:04,000
Sun! Sun.

201
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,059
Changge finally secured your life.

202
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,599
Are you asking for death?

203
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:10,418
I've lost my mother.

204
00:18:10,418 --> 00:18:12,111
I can't lose her.

205
00:18:12,111 --> 00:18:13,979
She's unfamiliar with the grasslands.

206
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,239
She can't survive.

207
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:20,238
Li Changge said you must stay alive,

208
00:18:20,238 --> 00:18:22,078
and not to make her efforts go in vain.

209
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:24,039
Neither can I.

210
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:26,058
I've sent all the men to find her.

211
00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:29,858
I'll go as well, and keep you updated on any news.

212
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,880
You must be alive to wait for her return.

213
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:42,899
Mimi.

214
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,359
Mimi, where are you going?

215
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,560
I want to find Changge.

216
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,078
How can you find her without knowing her position?

217
00:18:49,078 --> 00:18:50,218
Everyone's looking for her.

218
00:18:50,219 --> 00:18:52,079
Why can't I?

219
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:55,999
Being out of the capital, Changge must be heading for the Eagle Division.

220
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:58,499
I believe that, as long as she's alive,

221
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,079
she'll even crawl her way to meet me.

222
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,119
I want to find her.

223
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:04,219
Let me accompany you.

224
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,018
How's it going with Khatun?

225
00:19:35,018 --> 00:19:36,899
Thank Sirius.

226
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,400
Finally, the arrow was taken out.

227
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,900
Khatun's out of danger.

228
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,439
Great.

229
00:19:44,439 --> 00:19:48,958
Young Khan, it's not convenient for you to step close.

230
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:56,299
Now that Khatun's out of danger, you may as well go back first.

231
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,598
All of you can step in and out to help and look after her except me.

232
00:20:04,598 --> 00:20:10,880
Young Khan, we're all grateful for Khatun's kindness in daily life.

233
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,339
In such a clutch, we'll take good care of her for sure.

234
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,719
Young Khan, don't worry.

235
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:23,338
If Great Khan knows you're standing here, Khatun will be in trouble.

236
00:20:23,338 --> 00:20:25,840
Just go back.

237
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:30,539
I'll go.

238
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:44,060
Even as Young Khan,

239
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:48,880
I have no right to visit my mother.

240
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:53,860
I'm not Young Khan at all.

241
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:10,399
 Threatening me with a woman, She'er, you're a coward! 

242
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,560
 Mother! 

243
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,499
 Ashile Sun, how could we be like this? 

244
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,859
 What have we been doing all these years for? 

245
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,959
 If I were not Young Khan and you hadn't gone to Eagle Division, 

246
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:31,620
 would we be friends? 

247
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,460
Young Khan.

248
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,469
Most of the cavalry of the Eagle Division

249
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:49,739
that broke into the capital have been captured in prison.

250
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,458
Where's Ashile Sun?

251
00:21:51,459 --> 00:21:53,099
We didn't find him in the pursuit.

252
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,279
According to the scout, he returned to Eagle Division.

253
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:01,479
I knew he wouldn't die that easily.

254
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:06,119
This time, we lost the golden chance to kill him.

255
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,860
It'll be much harder for us to kill him.

256
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:14,160
It seems you're more desperate to kill him than me.

257
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,260
Isn't it our goal to uproot the Eagle Division?

258
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:21,418
Has your heart softened?

259
00:22:21,418 --> 00:22:23,019
I...

260
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:25,020
No, it hasn't.

261
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,459
Don't you forget Great Khan's expectation of you?

262
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:32,679
You'll never be satisfied with being outperformed by Ashile Sun, right?

263
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,659
I don't know if you can meet Khatun after defeating Ashile Sun,

264
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,439
but I can tell for sure.

265
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:45,920
If you can't win, Great Khan will never allow you to meet Khatun.

266
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:51,298
Don't forget without Khatun's protecting you from the arrow,

267
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,899
Ashile Sun's arrow would have pierced your throat.

268
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:56,480
Did he show mercy on you?

269
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:01,399
Young Khan, the kindness to the enemy is the cruelty to yourself.

270
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,259
If Khatun hadn't been that lucky,

271
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,938
you would have lost your mother forever today.

272
00:23:07,939 --> 00:23:09,439
Enough!

273
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,840
I don't need you to remind me.

274
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,019
Where's Li Changge?

275
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,640
When we surrounded her, a skilled swordsman suddenly popped up from nowhere.

276
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,218
Is he from the Eagle Division?

277
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:48,139
No.

278
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,259
He was dressed like a man from the Central Plains.

279
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,219
I followed them secretly.

280
00:24:53,219 --> 00:24:56,578
Judging from the donkey's hooves, they went straight south

281
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:58,938
instead of heading for Eagle Division.

282
00:24:58,939 --> 00:25:00,818
Does anyone else know about it?

283
00:25:00,819 --> 00:25:05,659
Except for the men searching for her from the Wolf Division, no one knows.

284
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:30,680
Changge, where are you?

285
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:37,559
Though she's a woman, she's a hero

286
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:40,458
and a true warrior in the Eagle Division.

287
00:25:40,459 --> 00:25:43,018
All the men in the Eagle Division will remember her.

288
00:25:43,018 --> 00:25:45,718
I don't want her to be a hero.

289
00:25:45,718 --> 00:25:50,538
I just hope she can return safe and sound.

290
00:25:50,539 --> 00:25:52,539
She will.

291
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:56,680
She likes the Eagle Division and you so much.

292
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,578
She'll return no matter what.

293
00:26:00,579 --> 00:26:04,979
She's a bastard never knowing how to take care of herself,

294
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,800
but only knowing to pressure herself.

295
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,698
Mu Jin, I'm really afraid.

296
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:15,379
Changge shouldn't die.

297
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,700
I believe she'll be okay for sure.

298
00:26:22,479 --> 00:26:25,220
Yes, you're right.

299
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,599
Maybe our men have found her and taken her back, right?

300
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:34,178
Yes. Maybe she's in the Eagle Division now.

301
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:35,879
Let me take you back.

302
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:53,973
 If you hadn't been stubborn, how could it be like this? 

303
00:26:53,973 --> 00:26:57,420
 If you hadn't been stubborn, how could my mother have died? 

304
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:04,179
I didn't mean it.

305
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:09,859
Sun.

306
00:27:13,939 --> 00:27:15,720
Any news?

307
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:20,819
With so many men having searched so many places,

308
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,950
if she hasn't been found,

309
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:28,610
she may have been captured by the Wolf Division.

310
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,860
If so, what's your plan?

311
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:38,938
How's it going with my mother?

312
00:27:38,939 --> 00:27:40,598
Don't worry.

313
00:27:40,598 --> 00:27:42,979
Khatun's getting better.

314
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,218
She just took the medicine and fell asleep.

315
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:49,358
All right. You may leave.

316
00:27:49,358 --> 00:27:50,700
Yes.

317
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,400
Unexpectedly, it's you.

318
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,737
You still remember the previous password.

319
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:35,578
I didn't mean to kill A'Yi'er.

320
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:37,179
In fact, I—

321
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:44,859
You killed my mother.

322
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,840
Don't mention her!

323
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:49,659
It... It was an accident.

324
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,399
Accident?

325
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:54,279
My mother died because of your accident.

326
00:28:54,959 --> 00:28:59,959
She'er, is victory or loss that important to you?

327
00:28:59,959 --> 00:29:02,139
Isn't it important?

328
00:29:02,139 --> 00:29:05,159
Because you're the one who always wins.

329
00:29:06,639 --> 00:29:10,139
Ashile She'er, till when can you understand?

330
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:13,450
Whether Young Khan or General, it's not only a title,

331
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:15,189
but also the responsibility on our shoulders

332
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,431
for the future of the grasslands.

333
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,338
At this point, you're still talking about the false

334
00:29:22,339 --> 00:29:24,500
and ridiculous victory with me.

335
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,644
Naive!

336
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:29,673
Since childhood, you've always been so naive.

337
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:36,820
The moment my mother passed away, no...

338
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:40,539
Even now, I wish I could tear you to pieces.

339
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,399
But I won't.

340
00:29:45,439 --> 00:29:47,659
Because I can't change anything by killing you.

341
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,619
I can't get my mother back by killing you.

342
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,320
Understand?

343
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:01,139
Revenge and killing

344
00:30:01,139 --> 00:30:04,520
can only bring endless pains and fights.

345
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:09,060
I have nothing left to talk to you about.

346
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,080
Let go of my men in Eagle Division and Li Changge.

347
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,000
Just target me.

348
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,270
You've got the wrong person.

349
00:30:19,271 --> 00:30:22,289
I can release the men in the Eagle Division, but Li Changge isn't in my hand.

350
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:23,627
What?

351
00:30:23,627 --> 00:30:27,218
Wolf Division didn't capture her, believe it or not.

352
00:30:27,219 --> 00:30:28,279
Where did she go?

353
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:30,280
I don't know!

354
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,519
The grassland is full of dangers, with quicksand, swamps, poisonous snakes, and beasts.

355
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:38,620
She ran away alone. Do you think it's possible for her to survive?

356
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:41,838
I experienced life and death with her. She can't die so easily.

357
00:30:41,838 --> 00:30:44,259
Go find her yourself!

358
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,379
Don't be so worried.

359
00:31:16,819 --> 00:31:20,100
Sun. Any news?

360
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,360
She'er said Changge wasn't in his hand.

361
00:31:23,199 --> 00:31:25,019
How can you believe in She'er?

362
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,019
It seems not to be a lie.

363
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:31,059
Did Changge really have an accident?

364
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,058
No.

365
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:37,298
I believe she won't die so easily.

366
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:38,519
Yes.

367
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,398
Changge won't die this easily.

368
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,800
Let's find her until we make it.

369
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:07,958
She is awake.

370
00:32:07,958 --> 00:32:11,030
As I said, she may not live long,

371
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,250
but she won't die this soon.

372
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,340
Who are you?

373
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,929
Where am I?

374
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,630
Don't you remember?

375
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:37,159
No, I don't.

376
00:32:41,419 --> 00:32:43,979
Unbelievable. Her head didn't get injured.

377
00:32:43,979 --> 00:32:47,359
How come? It's unreasonable.

378
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:52,278
All right. If you don't remember, let me tell you.

379
00:32:52,278 --> 00:32:55,739
I'm Situ Langlang, a swordsman.

380
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,499
This is Taoist Sun, my creditor.

381
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,818
We just passed by.

382
00:33:00,819 --> 00:33:05,259
I saved you a half-dead from the Ashile Tribe,

383
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,499
and he found ways to save you a half-dead.

384
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,520
That's it.

385
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,859
No need to say something like repaying our favors even after your death.

386
00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:20,760
We get used to healing the wounded and rescuing the dying.

387
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,099
 Li Changge, how powerful do you think you are? 

388
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,298
 Now Luo Yi's dead. 

389
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:28,779
 You got yourself, Eagle Division and I involved. 

390
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,264
 It's the result of your stubbornness. 

391
00:33:31,264 --> 00:33:34,549
 If you hadn't been stubborn, how could my mother have died? 

392
00:33:40,359 --> 00:33:42,159
Leave me alone.

393
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:52,019
 Sorry, Sun. 

394
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,740
 I caused your mother's death. 

395
00:34:05,699 --> 00:34:09,099
- Ask She'er here. 
 - Yes.

396
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,629
What?

397
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:12,040
Who told you to report to Great Khan?

398
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:17,459
For such a big deal, others would have reported to Great Khan if I hadn't.

399
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,738
It's my duty not to get Wolf Division involved.

400
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:22,139
But...

401
00:34:23,819 --> 00:34:26,079
But A'Yi'er is my mother's slave.

402
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,258
What if Mother gets involved?

403
00:34:28,259 --> 00:34:31,438
It depends on how you explain to Great Khan.

404
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:33,939
What you said is the fact.

405
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,060
Great Khan will believe you.

406
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:44,499
But A'Yi'er died at my sword.

407
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:47,179
- Why must you... 
 - Why must you keep it in mind?

408
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,498
She's just a slave.

409
00:34:48,499 --> 00:34:50,120
Just?

410
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,007
I haven't been able to meet Mother for years.

411
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:56,319
It was A'Yi'er who sent letters for us so that we could know about each other.

412
00:34:56,319 --> 00:34:59,219
Mother and I owe a debt of gratitude to her.

413
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,818
I acted so recklessly that I threatened Ashile Sun with A'Yi'er.

414
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:04,379
I regret it very much.

415
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,880
What's more, A'Yi'er is Ashile Sun's foster mother.

416
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,699
Why can't I return her favor?

417
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,099
You remember her favor,

418
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:17,160
but forget Khatun's sufferings and tears for years?

419
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:19,999
How has Great Khan treated Khatun?

420
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:21,940
Don't you know it?

421
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,338
As long as you have power, you'll soon get reunited with Khatun

422
00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:30,819
and free her from sufferings.

423
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:33,298
Ashile Sun is the biggest obstacle to

424
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:36,679
your grasp of the supreme power in the grasslands.

425
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:41,564
Your mercy on him is your mercilessness on Khatun.

426
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,840
You can't be swayed by his words.

427
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,159
Young Khan, Great Khan asked to see you.

428
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,258
Uncle Khan, I'm sorry for my neglect of duty.

429
00:36:12,259 --> 00:36:13,718
I beg your pardon.

430
00:36:13,718 --> 00:36:16,379
As for Luo Yi, I've killed him.

431
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,378
Please go check with me, Uncle Khan.

432
00:36:18,378 --> 00:36:21,240
Assemble all the elite soldiers in Wolf Division,

433
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,002
prepare bows and crossbows, and go with me.

434
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:25,818
What for?

435
00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:29,438
Ashile Sun rescued the Tang captive

436
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:32,039
and shot Khatun when I was away.

437
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:36,160
I can't keep such an alienated guy anymore.

438
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,100
Uncle Khan!

439
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:44,779
I have a thing to report.

440
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,459
Eat first.

441
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,238
You don't sleep, drink, or eat.

442
00:37:14,238 --> 00:37:18,240
Before being punished by Great Khan, you'll collapse first.

443
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,559
What's this?

444
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:25,699
It shows the pastures and waters I found before.

445
00:37:25,699 --> 00:37:30,198
If... If one day the capital forsakes the Eagle Division,

446
00:37:30,198 --> 00:37:32,959
move our men out to these places.

447
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:36,778
Sun, I know what your plan is.

448
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:38,556
There's no "if".

449
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,818
You won't be with our Eagle Division later?

450
00:37:40,819 --> 00:37:46,640
Are you going to settle everything here and then leave, aren't you?

451
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,619
I'm busy now. Go out.

452
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:51,419
I won't.

453
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:54,699
Are you going to shoulder all things alone?

454
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:55,759
What do you think of me?

455
00:37:55,759 --> 00:37:58,440
What do you think of our men in Eagle Division?

456
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:02,299
- General. 
 - What's up?

457
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:05,179
According to our scout, the men from the capital are coming

458
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,989
with banners of Great Khan and Wolf Division.

459
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:09,020
They will be here soon.

460
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:15,339
There seems to be no need for my explanation.

461
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,760
Sun, what about assembling all the cavalry?

462
00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:34,379
No.

463
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,200
A war can only badly undermine the Eagle Division.

464
00:38:39,879 --> 00:38:42,379
I'll protect each and every one of you.

465
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,080
Mu Jin, remember,

466
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:51,540
no matter what you see or hear later, don't act recklessly.

467
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,220
Listen to my orders.

468
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,120
Besides,

469
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,500
prepare to welcome a new general.

470
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,939
In the Eagle Division, I only claim Ashile Sun as our leader.

471
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:14,020
All men in the Eagle Division only claim you as our general, Ashile Sun.

472
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:17,999
Do as I ordered.

473
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,440
General!

474
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,139
I know what you're coming for.

475
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,100
Father, for our years of relationship,

476
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,480
please spare the lives of the others in the Eagle Division.

477
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,260
Stand up.

478
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,859
Let's talk inside the tent.

479
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:33,759
I know what happened to A'Yi'er.

480
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,580
Sun,

481
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:42,899
you suffered a lot.

482
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:47,559
I received a letter on the third day of my hunting.

483
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:52,139
It said the Eagle Division helped Luo Yi out, fought with the Wolf Division,

484
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,818
and shot Khatun.

485
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:57,958
On hearing it, I was so furious that I even wanted to kill you myself.

486
00:40:57,958 --> 00:41:01,778
But She'er told me what happened in detail.

487
00:41:01,779 --> 00:41:07,379
It was good of you two to compete for Luo Yi,

488
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:11,559
but held a grudge against each other for credit.

489
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:16,918
Sun, I know you'd not hurt Khatun on purpose.

490
00:41:16,918 --> 00:41:22,718
Anyway, A'Yi'er died at She'er's sword.

491
00:41:22,718 --> 00:41:24,859
It was his fault.

492
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,199
She'er, apologize to Sun.

493
00:41:30,479 --> 00:41:34,119
I shot Khatun, so I deserve the punishment.

494
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,839
Why are you doing so?

495
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,939
It's not your fault.

496
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:40,980
I'll justify you.

497
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:43,678
Thanks, Father.

498
00:41:43,678 --> 00:41:46,139
Sun, stand up.

499
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:53,498
This time I took lots of supplies and weapons from the capital

500
00:41:53,499 --> 00:41:55,439
and gave them all to the Eagle Division.

501
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:00,239
I know these can't make it up to you,

502
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:04,940
but now, a dead man can't come back to life.

503
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:08,359
This time, I took the Wizard with me.

504
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,999
I'll let him pray for A'Yi'er.

505
00:42:11,999 --> 00:42:16,619
I'll pray for A'Yi'er as well.

506
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:24,018
Sun, what else do you want?

507
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:26,540
Just tell me.

508
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:31,839
Your foster mother passed away, but your father who loves you

509
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,018
will always be by your side.

510
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:38,258
I have a thing to ask for your permission.

511
00:42:38,259 --> 00:42:43,099
I'll approve of whatever you want.

512
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,259
My mother had always

513
00:42:45,259 --> 00:42:48,258
been eager to visit some further places,

514
00:42:48,259 --> 00:42:50,759
but hadn't found a chance to in these years.

515
00:42:50,759 --> 00:42:52,719
She's no longer here now.

516
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:58,959
I want to fulfill her last wish and visit the world at large.

517
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:03,538
If you can find someone suitable to take over the Eagle Division,

518
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,999
please let him take good care of it.

519
