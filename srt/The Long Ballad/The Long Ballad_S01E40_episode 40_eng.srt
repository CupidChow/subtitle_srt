24
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,890
 - Long time no see. 
 - Yes. 

25
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,026
 Follow me. 

26
00:01:43,027 --> 00:01:44,693
 - This way, please. 
 - Let's go. 

27
00:01:44,694 --> 00:01:46,590
 It's a nice place. 

28
00:01:48,172 --> 00:01:49,083
 Please. 

29
00:01:49,083 --> 00:01:52,090
 You're here. Come on. 
   

30
00:01:55,627 --> 00:01:57,230
Is it nice?

31
00:01:57,905 --> 00:02:00,390
Look at that. You can't see it in the desert.

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,250
The yard is special for you.

33
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:12,138
You don't need to live with them. It'll be more comfortable.

34
00:02:12,138 --> 00:02:13,783
That's nice of you. Thank you.

35
00:02:13,783 --> 00:02:16,830
Do you have to thank me?

36
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,625
If you're not used to living here, you can tell me at any time.

37
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:22,137
Thank you for accompanying us here.

38
00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:26,170
As everything is ready, maybe you should report early.

39
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,330
Get an early rest.

40
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:37,450
Changge, so many rooms here, where do you want to live?

41
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:41,538
- You can choose first. 
 - Great! I want the one over there.

42
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:43,338
You two! Follow me!

43
00:02:43,338 --> 00:02:45,270
 Yes. 

44
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,190
Hurry up!

45
00:02:47,838 --> 00:02:49,382
Changge, which one do you want?

46
00:02:49,383 --> 00:02:50,838
I'll tidy it up for you!

47
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:52,961
I'm not in a hurry because

48
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:56,850
I have to go out to see an important person.

49
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,870
I'll go with you.

50
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:17,383
Young Master Wei, it's time to report to His Majesty.

51
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:20,105
Go back and rest, and I can go myself.

52
00:03:20,105 --> 00:03:21,490
Yes.

53
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:31,310
Brother Shuyu looks so tired

54
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,893
that he doesn't see us here.

55
00:03:32,894 --> 00:03:37,190
Young Master Wei just came back. He left without entering his home.

56
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,490
   

57
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,861
Greetings, Noble Princess Yongan.

58
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:48,641
- Please stand up. 
 - Thank you, Your Highness.

59
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:51,690
Young Master Wei's in a hurry. Where has he gone?

60
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:54,972
He just helped Mobei envoys settle down in Sifang Pavilion.

61
00:03:54,972 --> 00:03:57,230
He's gone to the palace to report.

62
00:03:58,110 --> 00:04:00,870
He works so hard.

63
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,727
Did you have a good journey?

64
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:04,071
Everything went well.

65
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:07,550
It seems Young Master Wei met his old friend in Mobei.

66
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,910
Noble Princess, here's the room for Mobei Princess.

67
00:04:34,783 --> 00:04:36,094
I see.

68
00:04:36,094 --> 00:04:37,730
Yes.

69
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,127
It's you!

70
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:00,650
- Last time... 
 - You're bold!

71
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:04,070
- Here's Noble Princess Yongan of Great Tang. Don't be rude! 
 - An Rou.

72
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,350
Are you the Noble Princess?

73
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,330
 Well... She's Changge's friend. 

74
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,230
 But isn't there enmity between them? 

75
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,990
 Should I tell her Changge is now in Chang'an? 

76
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:23,910
I've never thought you were the Princess of Mobei.

77
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,330
What happened in Yun State was really a mistake.

78
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,761
I always wanted to ask you

79
00:05:28,761 --> 00:05:33,050
why you knew there was the word "rabbit" on my pouch.

80
00:05:33,738 --> 00:05:37,205
Because there was the same word embroidered on my pouch.

81
00:05:37,205 --> 00:05:39,850
Maybe it was a coincidence.

82
00:05:41,272 --> 00:05:43,890
It's really our fate.

83
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,390
It was a present from my best friend.

84
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,330
I thought you might know her.

85
00:05:51,938 --> 00:05:56,004
As you've just had a long trip, I hope you can rest well.

86
00:05:56,005 --> 00:06:00,004
You can tell the servants here if you need any help.

87
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:01,810
I'll leave you in peace.

88
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,160
 What should I do? 

89
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,900
 She's still alive? 

90
00:06:49,359 --> 00:06:54,160
 Noble Princess will be happy to know it. 

91
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,660
Noble Princess, why have you not been yourself after we came back?

92
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:22,320
The princess we met...

93
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,930
makes me recall Changge.

94
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:29,490
I don't know whether she's good or not.

95
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,409
I felt puzzled when you talking about

96
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:35,530
the pouch and things in Yun State.

97
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,890
Those things are in the past.

98
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,770
Just trifles.

99
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,405
Maybe Young Master Wei is still in the palace.

100
00:07:42,405 --> 00:07:45,550
Do you want to see him?

101
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,130
He's been quite busy recently,

102
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,430
so I'll go to visit him later.

103
00:08:03,527 --> 00:08:04,999
Where are we?

104
00:08:04,999 --> 00:08:07,008
   

105
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:09,630
This is where my mother sleeps her long sleep.

106
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,070
I brought you here to see her.

107
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,210
What are you doing?

108
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:27,169
It's her first time seeing me.

109
00:08:27,605 --> 00:08:29,725
I have to leave her a good impression.

110
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,850
If she saw you in person,

111
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:36,290
she would like you.

112
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,950
Changge,

113
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,910
thanks for bringing me to see her.

114
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,487
Let's go.

115
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:58,830
   

116
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:20,130
It seems someone is missing her.

117
00:09:21,027 --> 00:09:23,490
Not only is there no dust here,

118
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,850
but also the tributes are fresh.

119
00:09:27,762 --> 00:09:29,354
That's it.

120
00:09:29,354 --> 00:09:33,450
I'd never thought someone in Chang'an would be missing her.

121
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,950
I wonder who asks servants to do it. Yueyan or Shuyu?

122
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,970
When I left Chang'an,

123
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:42,628
my greatest dread was that

124
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:45,990
no one in Chang'an would recall such an innocent victim.

125
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:51,890
But it seems that I can be at ease now.

126
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:17,480
Mother,

127
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,620
I'm here to see you.

128
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:23,990
This is Sun.

129
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:26,990
I wanted to bring him to see you.

130
00:10:29,038 --> 00:10:32,370
Ashile Sun greets Madam.

131
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,210
Changge, I want to propose a toast to her.

132
00:10:48,044 --> 00:10:51,600
Madam, it's our first time meeting.

133
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,510
I didn't have enough time to prepare, so let this cup of wine

134
00:10:54,511 --> 00:10:57,640
deliver my apology and respect to you.

135
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,550
Changge has suffered a lot for me all the way.

136
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,560
I beg your pardon.

137
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,900
As we have fallen in love with each other recently,

138
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,140
please allow me to care for her.

139
00:11:28,766 --> 00:11:30,600
Madam, please be at ease.

140
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,966
I will love and care for her as much as I can.

141
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:35,760
I'll compensate her in the future.

142
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:40,470
What are you driveling to my mother?

143
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:43,530
It's not driveling. I'm talking to her sincerely.

144
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,450
Have you forgotten what you'd told me in Mobei?

145
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,547
Are you going to go back on your words in front of your mother?

146
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:54,290
Men from the grasslands will love,

147
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:59,040
protect, and care for the girl they like.

148
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:07,187
Thank you, Sun.

149
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:11,280
You don't have to stand on ceremony with me.

150
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:16,500
Mother, I will always come back to see you.

151
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,255
With Sun. We'll come together.

152
00:12:40,522 --> 00:12:42,460
Changge?

153
00:12:54,744 --> 00:12:56,260
Changge.

154
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,600
Last time, we parted in Weishui.

155
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,230
I can be at ease

156
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,000
for you're good now.

157
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,740
I will survive all along

158
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:17,560
until I can kill the murderer myself.

159
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,280
Don't move!

160
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,560
Stay away from her!

161
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,030
The heavens are above you.

162
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,019
Don't you fear receiving its retribution?

163
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:17,240
Don't show me your pretension.

164
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,500
You're not qualified to be here.

165
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:23,900
I will kill you, sooner or later.

166
00:14:29,922 --> 00:14:33,065
Changge, if you'd really wanted to kill me,

167
00:14:33,065 --> 00:14:38,054
I might already have been killed in Weishui.

168
00:14:38,055 --> 00:14:43,111
You shot an arrow at me in Weishui. Is that right?

169
00:14:43,111 --> 00:14:45,100
I didn't want to save you.

170
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,580
What I wanted to save was the people of Great Tang.

171
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:52,660
You could put Great Tang and its people first.

172
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,140
You didn't damage the country because of personal enmity.

173
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,620
Very good.

174
00:15:00,922 --> 00:15:06,440
You've really grown up.

175
00:15:08,022 --> 00:15:11,860
Du has told me

176
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,565
what you've done in Luoyang.

177
00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:15,440
So what?

178
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,780
I won't forgive you.

179
00:15:19,255 --> 00:15:21,980
I've never wished for

180
00:15:28,122 --> 00:15:30,209
your and Jin's forgiveness.

181
00:15:30,209 --> 00:15:32,100
Shut up!

182
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:38,610
Don't call her name!

183
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,960
Step back, Fang Yi.

184
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:45,420
Don't worry.

185
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:50,900
Princess puts our country first, so she won't harm His Majesty.

186
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,740
I brought you up.

187
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,480
I know that...

188
00:16:01,599 --> 00:16:04,360
you're a good girl.

189
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,800
Well-matched.

190
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,600
As he can be with you and protect you, I think

191
00:16:20,477 --> 00:16:25,620
Jin can be at ease now.

192
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,220
   

193
00:16:47,144 --> 00:16:50,320
It's he who worships my mother...

194
00:16:53,755 --> 00:16:55,420
Mother.

195
00:16:57,255 --> 00:17:00,320
I'm afraid I can't take revenge for you.

196
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,576
Here's the identity certificate for you.

197
00:17:17,576 --> 00:17:20,876
You can live here with a new identity.

198
00:17:20,876 --> 00:17:23,640
There's no need to hide anymore.

199
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,460
Did he ask you to do so?

200
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,139
It's not important.

201
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,380
We hope you can have a new beginning

202
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,200
and live the life you want.

203
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,680
Changing my identity is to bury my past.

204
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,980
That's what you want.

205
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,600
I'd once taught you for several years.

206
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,940
I think I know you a little.

207
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,110
As you're not persistent in taking revenge,

208
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:55,821
why can't you let go of your past?

209
00:17:55,821 --> 00:17:58,840
I still have some missions to complete.

210
00:18:01,366 --> 00:18:05,240
It's you who wrote the secret letter.

211
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,921
Do you really want to be the envoy of the desert?

212
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:14,102
The reason why I'm an  envoy of Mobei is for the support and the peace.

213
00:18:14,102 --> 00:18:20,000
If Great Tang can be Mobei's backing, Mobei will also fight for Tang.

214
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,640
At that time, if Ashile wants to conquer the desert

215
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,960
or fight against Great Tang, they'll think before they act.

216
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,365
Do you know if each tribe is deciding to unite for fear of the situation,

217
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:38,700
not for their sincere will,

218
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,390
then the covenant will be fragile?

219
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:43,276
It's an empty promise.

220
00:18:43,277 --> 00:18:45,500
- It deserves a try. 
 - It deserves a try.

221
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,655
Teacher, as you're now with a more powerful side,

222
00:18:53,655 --> 00:18:56,150
is it because of fearing the situation?

223
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,230
Changge,

224
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:04,240
do you know the secret why His Majesty knew

225
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:10,400
your father and Prince Qi wanted to make trouble for him?

226
00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:14,133
Of course, he learned from his spies in East Palace.

227
00:19:14,133 --> 00:19:17,019
Crown Prince Jiancheng was alert

228
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:21,800
so that His Majesty couldn't spy on his study.

229
00:19:22,677 --> 00:19:24,187
So who did it?

230
00:19:24,187 --> 00:19:28,280
Let me tell you a story first.

231
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:32,165
At that year, Emperor Yang of Sui was inspecting the Great Wall.

232
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:37,099
When he was at Yanmen Pass with his men, they were circled by Ashile Tribe.

233
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,577
 A young general saved a young beauty by chance 

234
00:19:40,577 --> 00:19:45,160
 when he was on the way to rescue the emperor. 

235
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:51,000
 As soon as he went go out to battle, 

236
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,060
 he asked the lady to stay there with the womenfolk. 

237
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,300
Well... he'd saved my mother.

238
00:20:04,866 --> 00:20:06,820
It's impossible...

239
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,100
Well...

240
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,720
My mother...

241
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,620
She wouldn't harm my father for he's her husband!

242
00:20:14,622 --> 00:20:17,569
My story isn't over.

243
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,260
The young general was appointed to a position of trust

244
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,159
for making great achievements at his first battle.

245
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:26,600
Afterward, he went out to battle more and more.

246
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:32,387
 He had no idea that his brother treated the lady 

247
00:20:32,388 --> 00:20:36,620
 as his concubine after getting drunk. 

248
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:42,840
 When he came back, the lady was pregnant. 

249
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,460
So she's my mother?

250
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,040
 After you were born, he doted on you. 

251
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,200
 Maybe it was your fate. 

252
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,459
 You wouldn't laugh when you saw your father. 

253
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,870
 You smiled only if he was with you. 

254
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:08,294
 Then you grew up. 

255
00:21:08,294 --> 00:21:13,830
 You can recall all your personal memories. I won't mention them. 

256
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,950
Changge,

257
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:23,730
he is the only one who cares about you and your mother in this world.

258
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,290
But why hasn't my mother told me before?

259
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:31,330
Is it the grudge between them?

260
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:35,350
My father had never been happy to see me.

261
00:21:35,989 --> 00:21:39,270
I thought it was my fault.

262
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,090
As I didn't understand her thoughts,

263
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,230
how can I be her daughter?

264
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,730
Changge.

265
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:52,870
You did bring her much happiness.

266
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,510
As you were with her,

267
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:57,850
she wouldn't feel alone.

268
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,630
As...

269
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,170
it's my mother who warned him,

270
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:05,170
why did he kill her?

271
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:09,130
Sometimes, maybe what you saw

272
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:12,590
is not the whole truth.

273
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:25,410
The whole truth...

274
00:22:32,305 --> 00:22:34,130
   

275
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:43,350
Sun, are his words all true?

276
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:48,310
All the hatred was just my imagination.

277
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,594
Is that true?

278
00:22:50,594 --> 00:22:54,115
Changge, it's not your fault.

279
00:22:54,115 --> 00:22:56,630
Things in the world are complex.

280
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:00,310
They cannot be explained only by a single truth.

281
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,950
Whoever wants to leave Chang'an must pass through this road.

282
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,270
At that time...

283
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:15,530
 I left here as the rebellious princess of Great Tang. 

284
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:21,130
I thought I would come back with my troops

285
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,430
to kill him and resume my father's former fame.

286
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:29,468
I've never thought I would be back with doubts

287
00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:32,210
and hesitate to my enemy.

288
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:36,090
But I have to admit

289
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,670
 that he's really a good emperor. 

290
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:41,450
I should hate him

291
00:23:42,083 --> 00:23:44,530
but it's he who dotes on me the most.

292
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,670
All my skills and knowledge were taught by him.

293
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,950
Our relationship was closer than mine with my father.

294
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:54,270
I know how you feel now.

295
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:57,310
When my mother died because of She'er,

296
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,770
 I wished I could kill him at once, 

297
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:02,090
 getting revenge for her. 

298
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:06,870
When I started to do so, I hesitated too.

299
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,770
If I had really killed him,

300
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:13,810
all the people of Eagle Division would have been involved

301
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,209
and the situation of the grasslands would have been in danger.

302
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:19,030
That's not what I wanted,

303
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,810
and is not what my mother wanted.

304
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:25,583
While facing the conflict of enmity between family and country,

305
00:24:25,583 --> 00:24:28,261
all of us will be confused.

306
00:24:28,261 --> 00:24:32,150
Moreover, the one you confront is the emperor of Great Tang

307
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,070
and the people behind him.

308
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:40,150
The reason why you hesitate is that you care much about the people's well-being.

309
00:24:41,572 --> 00:24:46,930
I think your father and your mother wouldn't blame you.

310
00:24:49,716 --> 00:24:51,810
It's all over.

311
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,750
Maybe the tragedy would have still happened

312
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,550
whether she had reminded him or not.

313
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,915
I think it might be hard for her

314
00:25:01,915 --> 00:25:04,030
to be sandwiched between two brothers.

315
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:06,070
I know.

316
00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:09,470
But I still feel sorry for her.

317
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,194
She couldn't tell others about these things.

318
00:25:13,194 --> 00:25:17,890
So that's why she asked me to kneel before Buddha

319
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:21,310
 and swear that I would hate nobody. 

320
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,609
Well, she'd expected it very early.

321
00:25:23,609 --> 00:25:26,490
She's a wonderful woman

322
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:29,330
and an amazing mother.

323
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:34,990
So you have to pull yourself up and live a good life.

324
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:41,200
Sun, when everything is over,

325
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,388
Great Tang, the desert, and even the whole grasslands

326
00:25:44,388 --> 00:25:47,816
may enjoy peace for a long time.

327
00:25:47,816 --> 00:25:52,930
By then, can we move to the countryside?

328
00:25:53,694 --> 00:25:57,650
I will go wherever you are.

329
00:26:05,327 --> 00:26:09,389
♫  Who dares to say that  ♫

330
00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:14,610
♫  there's a moment along the way  ♫

331
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:18,569
♫   Like the colors blooming across the blue sky   ♫

332
00:26:18,569 --> 00:26:24,210
♫   Just like it's dyed at the corner of your eyebrows   ♫

333
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,529
♫   You're in my sight   ♫

334
00:26:26,529 --> 00:26:28,749
♫   With my heart beating fast   ♫

335
00:26:28,749 --> 00:26:33,415
♫   You invade into my mind   ♫

336
00:26:33,415 --> 00:26:35,820
♫   When I look at you   ♫

337
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:38,109
♫   I can feel that   ♫

338
00:26:38,109 --> 00:26:45,290
♫   it's a kind of warmth that I've hoped for a long time   ♫

339
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:47,600
♫   How I hope that you were me   ♫

340
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,160
♫   you can be my endless song   ♫

341
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:55,009
♫   bringing me parting from loneliness?   ♫

342
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,290
   

343
00:27:18,327 --> 00:27:20,270
Changge.

344
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,460
What's the matter with you?

345
00:27:22,461 --> 00:27:24,204
It seems you're not in a good mood.

346
00:27:24,204 --> 00:27:26,130
I'm fine.

347
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,950
I was too obsessive

348
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:31,410
and magnified my family's hatred...

349
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,290
It almost...

350
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,270
made me kill the one who's nice to me.

351
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,470
It's all over.

352
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:45,550
So do you forgive your enemy?

353
00:27:47,427 --> 00:27:49,070
I don't know...

354
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:54,430
Sometimes, it's hard to distinguish between right and wrong.

355
00:27:55,770 --> 00:27:58,950
If so, I should have told her earlier...

356
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,710
What?

357
00:28:01,489 --> 00:28:04,669
Noble Princess of Tang came here yesterday.

358
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,049
The one that you had given a sachet to.

359
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:09,671
Yueyan? What did she say?

360
00:28:09,671 --> 00:28:12,010
She thought I was the Mobei princess

361
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:15,170
and asked me about the sachet.

362
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:20,648
I didn't tell her the truth for I feared you didn't want to see her.

363
00:28:20,648 --> 00:28:23,250
She's my best friend in Chang'an.

364
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:26,150
That's it...

365
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,970
I should have gone to visit her first.

366
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:34,183
Didn't we go to Sifang Pavilion yesterday?

367
00:28:34,183 --> 00:28:37,804
Why do we go again without a carriage today?

368
00:28:37,804 --> 00:28:39,910
So secretive.

369
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:45,670
The girl we met yesterday wasn't the Mobei princess.

370
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:48,649
According to her clothing and its material,

371
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:50,737
we would learn that she is not a noble.

372
00:28:50,737 --> 00:28:54,271
I think... she's only a maid.

373
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:57,788
Noble Princess, you... you can judge it only by these?

374
00:28:57,788 --> 00:29:02,115
When I asked her about the sachet yesterday, she hesitated to tell me.

375
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:05,650
 It was entirely different from her behaviors in Yun State. 

376
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:10,290
So I'm sure she must know Changge.

377
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,050
What? Princess Yongning is there?

378
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:17,550
For her safety, we should keep a low profile.

379
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:22,615
I'm here only to verify my guess. I don't want to alarm anybody.

380
00:29:22,616 --> 00:29:26,310
By the way, I really hope she's there.

381
00:29:27,127 --> 00:29:28,970
Let's go.

382
00:29:37,261 --> 00:29:39,230
Hao Du.

383
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,393
I found you were out without a carriage.

384
00:29:41,393 --> 00:29:43,171
I'm worried about your safety.

385
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:46,537
So are you tailing after me again?

386
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:49,390
I'm just caring about your safety.

387
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:52,437
It's Chang'an. I'm quite safe.

388
00:29:52,437 --> 00:29:53,882
You're right.

389
00:29:53,883 --> 00:29:58,450
As the envoys from many tribes are here, you still need to be careful.

390
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:05,310
Hao Du, you told me that you only catch the one who harm Great Tang. Right?

391
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,930
Yes.

392
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:10,215
If you're not at ease, I will follow you at a distance.

393
00:30:10,216 --> 00:30:14,150
As long as there's no danger, I won't bother you and...

394
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,810
your friends.

395
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:21,815
Fine. I don't want to gain more censures.

396
00:30:21,815 --> 00:30:25,115
I see. I'll keep it secret.

397
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,983
Changge. Changge! 
    

398
00:30:40,983 --> 00:30:43,850
Let me go with you!

399
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,838
Mimi, don't worry. I won't be in danger.

400
00:30:45,838 --> 00:30:47,471
But we're in Chang'an.

401
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,460
And it's also your sad place.

402
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,549
I cannot be at ease.

403
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,894
If you keep on refusing, I'll go to tell Sun.

404
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,350
- Well... 
 - Do you want to go out?

405
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,970
I want to find Yueyan.

406
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,850
Do you want to go to the palace?

407
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:06,230
I have to find Shuyu before I visit Yueyan.

408
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,410
Well, she's here!

409
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,150
Changge!

410
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:15,793
Yueyan!

411
00:31:15,793 --> 00:31:17,590
Changge!

412
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,850
I knew you were here!

413
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:22,510
Though I didn't see you yesterday, I thought you must still be here.

414
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,309
It's my fault for not visiting you on my arrival here.

415
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:27,690
It's not too late.

416
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:30,571
She's Mimi Guli. I knew her in the grasslands.

417
00:31:30,572 --> 00:31:32,770
You've seen each other before.

418
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:35,749
- He is... 
 - I know him.

419
00:31:35,749 --> 00:31:38,990
It was he who saved your life in Luoyang.

420
00:31:40,161 --> 00:31:41,526
He's Sun.

421
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:44,050
Sun, this is my sister.

422
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,150
Fine. Let's talk inside! Come on.

423
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:05,069
I'm so happy for all my good friends are here today.

424
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:08,590
It's really an unimaginable reunion for me.

425
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:13,630
Changge, will you leave here?

426
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:22,570
Well...

427
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:26,030
How can I keep you?

428
00:32:26,894 --> 00:32:30,408
Anyway, why are you the Princess of Mobei?

429
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:32,750
It's a long story.

430
00:32:39,272 --> 00:32:41,559
It's the tune for the guests to feast.

431
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,868
Feast?

432
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:45,094
Courtesy of entertaining guests.

433
00:32:45,094 --> 00:32:47,659
It's for new envoys.

434
00:32:47,659 --> 00:32:50,715
But the envoys from all the tribes are here!

435
00:32:50,715 --> 00:32:53,630
Why is there a new one?

436
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,889
I don't know.

437
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,226
Listen. Mimi, stay and wait for us here.

438
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:58,660
Yueyan and I will go to have a look.

439
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,760
Fine. Then go and return in a hurry.

440
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,904
We will.

441
00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:04,310
- Why are you anxious? 
 - What should we do?

442
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:08,471
- We can't wait for our death here. We need to find ways. 
 - He's right.

443
00:33:08,471 --> 00:33:09,561
Is that right?

444
00:33:09,561 --> 00:33:11,890
Changge!

445
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,090
Changge, who is this woman from Great Tang?

446
00:33:15,889 --> 00:33:19,149
Princess, do you know that the Ashile envoys are here?

447
00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:22,015
Were they invited by Great Tang?

448
00:33:22,016 --> 00:33:24,049
It's impossible.

449
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:26,993
You... You're from Great Tang!

450
00:33:26,994 --> 00:33:29,910
The Mobei princess is meeting someone from Great Tang privately!

451
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,837
You're mistaken about her.

452
00:33:32,838 --> 00:33:36,627
The reason why they have come is because they know of our alliance.

453
00:33:36,627 --> 00:33:38,593
I don't care asbout your private relation.

454
00:33:38,593 --> 00:33:41,171
- We only want to leave here! 
 - Zhi Xi!

455
00:33:41,172 --> 00:33:43,072
As the Ashile Tribe knows we want to unite with Tang,

456
00:33:43,072 --> 00:33:46,449
won't we lose everything if they go and  attack our tribes?

457
00:33:46,449 --> 00:33:48,182
 He's right. Our hometown might be conquered! 

458
00:33:48,182 --> 00:33:50,430
We have to go back at once.

459
00:33:51,338 --> 00:33:52,990
Please be at ease.

460
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:57,580
I can promise you that Great Tang won't abandon you

461
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,315
for I'm Noble Princess Yongan of Tang.

462
00:33:59,315 --> 00:34:02,150
- Noble Princess? 
 - She's Noble Princess!

463
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,937
Anyway, we have to go back.

464
00:34:05,937 --> 00:34:07,815
Great Tang is too distant to save us.

465
00:34:07,816 --> 00:34:10,126
It's reasonable for you to say it now,

466
00:34:10,127 --> 00:34:12,171
but will you help us at the time?

467
00:34:12,172 --> 00:34:13,793
I think you will abandon us!

468
00:34:13,793 --> 00:34:15,937
 - He's right! 
 - Let's leave! 

469
00:34:15,937 --> 00:34:18,871
Hold on! Everyone, listen to me! Be quiet!

470
00:34:18,871 --> 00:34:22,137
- Step aside! 
 - Calm down! Listen to me first!

471
00:34:22,137 --> 00:34:25,049
Oh, please! Listen to...

472
00:34:25,049 --> 00:34:27,470
Enough!

473
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:41,709
As the Ashile Tribe dares to come to Sifang Pavilion,

474
00:34:41,709 --> 00:34:43,868
they must gain a customs clearance.

475
00:34:43,868 --> 00:34:45,509
It should be on a diplomatic mission.

476
00:34:45,509 --> 00:34:49,909
If they really want to make trouble, will Great Tang disregard it?

477
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:53,070
What exactly are you afraid of?

478
00:34:56,883 --> 00:34:58,293
We have no other choice...

479
00:34:58,294 --> 00:35:00,730
Why are you all standing here?

480
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,880
Are you welcoming our tribe?

481
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,300
Young Khan!

482
00:35:08,522 --> 00:35:10,500
It's you.

483
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,621
 - People from the Ashile Tribe are here. 
 - Yeah. 

484
00:35:18,621 --> 00:35:20,538
 It's said Young Khan is also here. 

485
00:35:20,538 --> 00:35:25,179
 And he escorted the Khatun of Ashile Tribe here. 

486
00:35:25,179 --> 00:35:27,369
 - Is it true? 
 - Yes. I think so. 

487
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:29,600
 Anyway, that's what I've learned. 

488
00:35:36,688 --> 00:35:38,700
Khatun...

489
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:42,260
It will come anyway.

490
00:35:44,499 --> 00:35:47,120
 Mimi of the past has died. 

491
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,978
 Now, you can be bold, brave, and free. 

492
00:35:50,978 --> 00:35:53,720
 You can be yourself. 

493
00:36:03,533 --> 00:36:05,720
You see.

494
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,198
As long as the Ashile Tribe is here,

495
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:11,200
they're as cowardly as rabbits seeing an eagle.

496
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,677
Knowing nothing but escape.

497
00:36:12,677 --> 00:36:14,021
Who will escape?

498
00:36:14,021 --> 00:36:15,500
Monan won't fear Ashile!

499
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,280
Zhenzhu.

500
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:22,210
You're standing in Sifang Pavilion in a strange suit,

501
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:24,731
so what do you want to play this time?

502
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:31,400
If I tell them who you're, will you...

503
00:36:32,422 --> 00:36:34,400
She'er.

504
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:51,100
Y-You're still alive!

505
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:55,220
Why did you deceive me?

506
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,899
You bastard!

507
00:36:56,899 --> 00:36:59,500
I thought you had died.

508
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,879
But I've never thought you'd fake your own death!

509
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:03,460
Coward! Liar!

510
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,161
I shouldn't haven thought highly of you

511
00:37:05,161 --> 00:37:07,850
and asked the servants to carve your name on the warrior monument.

512
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,430
You're not qualified!

513
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:13,290
Don't pretend to be innocent.

514
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:16,390
Don't tell me that you know nothing

515
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:19,220
about the conspiracy against me.

516
00:37:20,433 --> 00:37:23,280
I don't want to make an enemy of you.

517
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,340
But from now on,

518
00:37:26,466 --> 00:37:28,900
we're not brothers anymore.

519
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,776
Yicheng has come to Chang'an herself.

520
00:37:44,776 --> 00:37:46,600
Who is she?

521
00:37:51,049 --> 00:37:55,770
Long time no see, Li Changge.

522
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,569
Great Khan is pretty quiet today.

523
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,266
When he just moved here, he always moaned.

524
00:38:12,266 --> 00:38:15,333
Exactly. Maybe the medicine is now working.

525
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:16,710
He won't make any noise now.

526
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,721
How majestic he was!

527
00:38:18,721 --> 00:38:21,700
- While he's so ill now... 
 - What are you talking about?

528
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:28,521
I've told you not to discuss things here.

529
00:38:28,521 --> 00:38:31,449
Commander Lei, please forgive us! We know we're wrong!

530
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,640
This is the last chance for you.

531
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,087
I've shown my kindness to spare your lives.

532
00:38:46,087 --> 00:38:50,960
It's also to warn the rest, it's the consequence of gossiping.

533
00:38:56,499 --> 00:39:01,040
 It seems there is something weird about Khan's illness. 

534
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,230
   

535
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,622
How can Khatun come to Chang'an?

536
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:14,688
 Changge, who is she? 

537
00:40:14,688 --> 00:40:16,800
She's She'er's mother.

538
00:40:17,892 --> 00:40:20,732
I'm the Khatun of Ashile Tribe.

539
00:40:20,732 --> 00:40:26,940
As Great Khan is sick, my son and I are here in his place

540
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:31,465
to show our goodwill to Great Tang and all tribes.

541
00:40:31,465 --> 00:40:35,460
Besides, I'm here to discuss the engagement

542
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,588
between Tang and Ashile.

543
00:40:38,588 --> 00:40:40,066
Actually, I shouldn't come here.

544
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:41,700
As it's the engagement for my son,

545
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:45,820
one of his parents should be present.

546
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:51,732
Great Tang is always faithful, so I think you'll keep your words this time.

547
00:40:51,732 --> 00:40:57,180
I think you come to Chang'an because of it, right?

548
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,800
 They're to make peace by marriage. 

549
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:02,020
 Make peace by marriage? 

550
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:06,820
Come on. Let me drink a toast to you.

551
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,120
Changge, does she mean

552
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,498
His Majesty promised to make peace with the Ashile Tribe by marriage?

553
00:41:21,498 --> 00:41:25,159
If Great Tang doesn't obey it, does it mean

554
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:28,260
Great Tang will break the covenant with the desert tribes?

555
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:32,080
How dare she announce it on this occasion?

556
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:37,420
Is she sure that His Majesty won't agree to the marriage?

557
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:42,560
Hao Du, take her back first.

558
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,560
Let me take care of her here.

559
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,978
As Khatun and Young Khan have just arrived here,

560
00:41:57,978 --> 00:42:02,860
let me drink a toast to you in the name of Mobei.

561
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,500
Hold on.

562
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,120
Why don't you ask your bodyguard to drink it for you?

563
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,115
Your servant is really obedient.

564
00:42:47,115 --> 00:42:50,569
It seems you control him well.

565
00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:54,210
As Khatun can be sent to Chang'an on a diplomatic mission,

566
00:42:54,210 --> 00:42:58,600
it seems you've controlled Khan's tent well.

567
00:42:59,311 --> 00:43:04,880
It's none of the business of a bodyguard from Mobei.

568
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:26,400
