00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:06,950
♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,909
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:14,989
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:18,829
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,829 --> 00:00:25,009
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:28,769
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

7
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,648
♫   Tears and regrets go hand in hand   ♫

8
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:34,648
♫  But my heart is still fiery-hot  ♫

00:00:34,648 --> 00:00:37,789
♫  To the distance  ♫

10
00:00:37,789 --> 00:00:40,669
♫  The miserable past is like a dagger  ♫

11
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:43,569
♫  Though my wings are broken  ♫

12
00:00:43,569 --> 00:00:51,190
♫  I will keep flying  ♫

13

♫  Following the direction of the light  ♫

14
00:00:56,249 --> 00:00:58,409
♫  I'll forget you  ♫

15
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:04,410
♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

16
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,410
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

17
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,368
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

18
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:12,328
♫  The river of life is under my feet  ♫

19
00:01:12,329 --> 00:01:18,110
♫  I don't regret my craziness  ♫

20
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:32,430
   

21
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,850
   

22
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:39,269
Governor, this is all my fault.

23
00:01:39,269 --> 00:01:42,349
I capitalized on terrain too much, moving our troops from east to west.

24
00:01:42,349 --> 00:01:46,089
I want to atone for my faults. Please let me handle them.

25
00:01:46,089 --> 00:01:47,229
Fine.

26
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,968
The war is all about wit and moral courage.

27
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:51,789
It's not entirely your fault.

28
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:53,389
I just didn't know

29
00:01:53,389 --> 00:01:57,150
the elite squad of Ashile Tribe could be this cunning.

30
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,950
Xu Feng, summon all our people

31
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,829
to meet me and Commandant Li at the East Gate and confront the enemies.

32
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:04,489
Yes.

33
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,750
But, Governor, they were constantly on the run

34
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,210
before they attacked our barn.

35
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,209
Now they're at the east gate, miles apart from the barn.

36
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,069
How could they be so quick?

37
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:18,910
Shisi, you should know that, from now on,

38
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,589
you're facing the most elite and powerful cavalry of the Ashile Tribe.

39
00:02:58,789 --> 00:03:01,230
On my order.

40
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:04,030
Shoot!

41
00:04:56,169 --> 00:04:57,669
Master!

42
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,529
- Governor! 
 - Master!

43
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:02,608
- Governor! 
 - Governor!

44
00:05:05,129 --> 00:05:06,629
I'm fine.

45
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:09,080
Put a bandage on it and it'll do.

46
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:11,550
Governor!

47
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,349
Governor, you should go back. I'll be here.

48
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,350
You need to lead the troops and defend the east side.

49
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:26,909
Yes!

50
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,309
Take Governor back, now!

51
00:05:29,309 --> 00:05:30,909
Yes.

52
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,130
This isn't good. They've got reinforcements.

53
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:52,969
Ya Luo has destroyed all the state-owned land according to your plan.

54
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:55,849
Gongsun Heng shall find out about it soon.

55
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,950
Wear this.

56
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,689
Come on, I'm so handsome.

57
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,089
Why would I wear this?

58
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:05,529
All right, fine.

59
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:08,409
I should've picked a prettier one.

60
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:16,279
How about it? Do I look good?

61
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,420
   

62
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,179
Isn't that Shisi?

63
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:28,199
You're afraid that he'll recognize us.

64
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,239
So you've both hidden your real identities.

65
00:06:30,239 --> 00:06:31,839
Shut up.

66
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,608
So you're not real friends.

67
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:35,789
Well, that just makes everything fine.

68
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:36,830
I'll kill him.

69
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,089
Destroy the leader and the gang will collapse.

70
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,169
Shut up!

71
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,609
Give out my order.

72
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,349
Go all the way to attack the city.

73
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:54,628
Attention, Eagle Division! Kill!

74
00:06:54,628 --> 00:06:57,690
 Kill! 

75
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:10,669
 Kill! 

76
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,728
Registrar, the east gate has always been the least defended area.

77
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:20,108
I've sent people to get lookout towers and catapults from elsewhere.

78
00:07:20,108 --> 00:07:21,950
Do we have any more javelins?

79
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:24,790
The remaining iron caltrops are less than 50 kilos.

80
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:40,889
We can only lay one line of defense with the iron caltrops now available.

81
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:42,590
And the Eagle Division can easily avoid it.

82
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,828
We should do whatever we can to make the best use of the existing iron caltrops.

83
00:07:44,828 --> 00:07:46,449
Yes!

84
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,508
Whoever they are, the Eagle Divison or reinforcements,

85
00:07:52,508 --> 00:07:54,490
they must've been on the run the entire night.

86
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,708
They wouldn't have enough time to feed their horses with food and water.

87
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:17,090
 Don't eat that! Don't eat that! 

88
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,430
 Stop eating! 

89
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,389
 Stop it! 

90
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:28,690
 Rein up! 

91
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:45,709
Nice!

92
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,830
It's him again!

93
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,068
Sun, we must kill him.

94
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:57,129
If we get defeated, Great Khan would be so mad at us!

95
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,630
Sun! What are you hesitating about?

96
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:08,670
General Sun!

97
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,700
   

98
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,140
   

99
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,500
   

100
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:10,408
Registrar!

101
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:12,430
Master!

102
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,549
Master! Master!

103
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:19,549
 Registrar! 

104
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:23,209
 Help! 

105
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:26,270
 Help! 

106
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,449
 Master! Master! 

107
00:10:28,449 --> 00:10:30,790
 Master! 

108
00:10:35,309 --> 00:10:37,049
Your commander is now dead.

109
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:40,129
Surrender now, disarm, and we won't kill you.

110
00:10:40,129 --> 00:10:47,750
 Surrender! Surrender! Surrender! 

111
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:59,609
 Surrender! 

112
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:12,749
 Surrender! Surrender! 

113
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,390
   

114
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,009
Commandant Li stood up!

115
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:52,209
 - Commandant Li didn't die! 
 - Commandant Li didn't die! 

116
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:53,949
 Commandant Li stood up! 

117
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,309
How could it be?

118
00:12:00,309 --> 00:12:03,088
Sun, you're the best warrior on the plains.

119
00:12:03,088 --> 00:12:04,668
You never miss the targets!

120
00:12:04,668 --> 00:12:08,228
 Great! 

121
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,308
No way, Sun.

122
00:12:09,308 --> 00:12:10,889
The chief commander of Shuo State didn't die.

123
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:12,088
It boosted their morale.

124
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:14,749
It's not a great time for us to launch an attack.

125
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,430
 Well... this... 

126
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,990
Withdraw. Encamp outside the walls.

127
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,409
 Withdraw now! 

128
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,029
We won! We won!

129
00:12:37,029 --> 00:12:42,550
 We won! We won! We won! 

130
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,950
Master!

131
00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:11,890
Master, why are you up?

132
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,569
How's Governor doing?

133
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:15,709
Master, you're seriously injured.

134
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:17,629
I can't believe you're still worrying about others.

135
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:19,029
I'm fine.

136
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:21,049
It's just minor bruising.

137
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:23,989
Not to mention that the doctor has changed my dressing.

138
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:27,950
Right now, what really matters is our war against Ashile Tribe.

139
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,929
Governor is also wounded.

140
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:31,689
How could I rest?

141
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:33,489
Governor's new injury triggered his old wounds.

142
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,830
He's in his bedroom now.

143
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:39,149
A'Dou, you should go to bed now.

144
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:41,449
- I'll go talk to Governor and see what we can do. 
 - Master!

145
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:44,808
Don't forget that your target is not Shuo State, but Chang'an.

146
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:46,869
Your health is everything.

147
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:51,469
A'Dou, compared to this war in Shuo State,

148
00:13:51,469 --> 00:13:54,349
the personal hatred between me and Li Shimin is nothing.

149
00:13:54,349 --> 00:13:57,770
Right now, the situation in Shuo State is grim.

150
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,030
I can't just sit by and do nothing.

151
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,869
Well,

152
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:07,850
you'll change my dressing on time. Right?

153
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:11,390
I'm just worried about your health.

154
00:14:19,069 --> 00:14:22,169
Look, I'm fine.

155
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,889
Wolf Division is targeting Yun State and Dai State.

156
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,989
Great Khan ordered you to take Shuo State in ten days

157
00:14:54,989 --> 00:14:57,150
or he'll lead the troops himself.

158
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,250
If we just camp outside the city like this,

159
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,969
I doubt if we can take Shuo State in ten days.

160
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:05,929
By that time, Eagle Division will be an object of universal derision.

161
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:08,350
A trapped beast will still struggle.

162
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,429
But it won't last long.

163
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,930
Fair enough.

164
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,908
We've burned their barns and destroyed their lands.

165
00:15:15,908 --> 00:15:18,089
They'll starve to death.

166
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:19,709
Mu Jin,

167
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,390
what do you think of my archery?

168
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:25,450
You never miss a target.

169
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:37,268
Sun, don't tell me you're sneaking into Shuo State at a time like this.

170
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:38,988
No way. I won't permit that.

171
00:15:38,988 --> 00:15:40,369
I was wrong.

172
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:41,509
Your archery is just great.

173
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:44,209
Li Shisi must be all right.

174
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,409
Really.

175
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:51,469
Take the reports.

176
00:15:51,469 --> 00:15:53,729
Let's go to see Tu Kashe.

177
00:15:53,729 --> 00:15:56,589
I need to get rid of him.

178
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:58,449
Eagle Division must be the one

179
00:15:59,189 --> 00:16:01,649
to take over Shuo State.

180
00:16:06,869 --> 00:16:08,729
General, there's no need to be angry.

181
00:16:08,729 --> 00:16:12,488
If you want to surpass Eagle Division, I have another plan.

182
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:23,670
What are you doing here?

183
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:26,930
Bear Division was badly injured.

184
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,189
What are you going to do?

185
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,910
General.

186
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,449
General, have mercy on me.

187
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,330
I swear, I promise!

188
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,590
I will kill Registrar Li.

189
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,889
Please, General, give me another chance.

190
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:52,568
You missed your chance and that's it. You lost it forever.

191
00:16:52,568 --> 00:16:56,648
It was your trick that rendered half of the Bear Division dead.

192
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:59,209
If we give you another chance,

193
00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:03,529
maybe even the Eagle Division wouldn't be able to save you.

194
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:11,408
General, God knows how eager I am

195
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:14,130
to serve the Bear Division.

196
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,710
You think you can just kill him

197
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,029
and get things over with Great Khan?

198
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:42,329
Bear Division was misled by a treacherous minister.

199
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:47,649
I will explain it to Great Khan myself.

200
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,710
No need.

201
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:58,970
I have received Khan's order.

202
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:02,650
Now you're taking it from me. What?

203
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,789
Are you trying to humiliate me?

204
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:07,310
We just want you to stop being reckless.

205
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:09,330
We don't want to take credit for occupying Shuo State.

206
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:12,270
We just want you to stop holding us Eagle Division back.

207
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:16,689
You just can't wait to tread Bear Division underfoot, right?

208
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:18,910
Why the rush?

209
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,190
Then you leave us no choice but to report the truth to Great Khan.

210
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:25,489
That Tu Kashe defied his intructions openly.

211
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:39,729
General Sun, the General of Bear Division has received your order.

212
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:43,969
Now, please.

213
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,580
Ibukan.

214
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:53,829
Ibukan! Ibukan!

215
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,949
Isn't there anyone who'll guard the entrance for me?

216
00:18:57,949 --> 00:18:59,128
This is the camp of Bear Division.

217
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:01,869
Do your job and guard the damn door!

218
00:19:06,069 --> 00:19:08,288
Eagle Division changed their camp site.

219
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:10,028
They must be up to something.

220
00:19:10,028 --> 00:19:11,209
Keep an eye on him.

221
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:13,509
Keep an eye on him! Understand?

222
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:15,170
Yes!

223
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:18,570
And guard the damn door!

224
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,230
Just say it.

225
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,209
You could've just bought over that counselor.

226
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,650
Why did you provoke Tu Kashe into killing him?

227
00:19:33,329 --> 00:19:35,470
I don't like traitors.

228
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,049
But he was right.

229
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,830
Gongsun Heng got a brave general all of a sudden.

230
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,748
Things would be much easier if we kill Li Shisi first.

231
00:19:41,748 --> 00:19:45,028
You know it better than anyone that what will happen if Great Khan leads the troops himself.

232
00:19:45,028 --> 00:19:47,350
Why are you just laying siege to this city?

233
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,830
She'er's Wolf Division will soon take Dai State.

234
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,129
Great Khan ordered us to assist them.

235
00:19:52,129 --> 00:19:55,308
I'll send you there.

236
00:19:55,308 --> 00:19:57,230
Me?

237
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,768
Ashile Sun, yes, I am a bit talkative.

238
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:02,008
But that doesn't mean you've got to throw me to the wolves.

239
00:20:02,008 --> 00:20:04,089
Once this war ends, you'll leave.

240
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:06,449
Remember, when you're in Dai State,

241
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,469
save some clothes of Tang defenders and don't hassle common people.

242
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,889
You don't have to tell these to Great Khan.

243
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:16,990
That's it?

244
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,910
Shouldn't you set things straight before you go?

245
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,210
 - Hurry! 
 - Run! 

246
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,549
 Run! Run! 

247
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:42,689
 Run! 

248
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:45,269
 Hurry! Hurry! 

249
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:46,569
 Run! 

250
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,350
 Hurry! Run! 

251
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,329
 Hurry! 

252
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,230
 Run! 

253
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,368
 Help! 

254
00:21:07,368 --> 00:21:09,149
What's going on? What are you doing?

255
00:21:09,149 --> 00:21:11,009
- Help! 
 - You can't come in.

256
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:13,008
Open the door. Help!

257
00:21:13,008 --> 00:21:15,410
- What happened? 
 - The enemies are breaking in.

258
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,869
Close the door.

259
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:18,129
Please, I'm begging you.

260
00:21:18,129 --> 00:21:19,750
Come on. Help me close the door.

261
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:21,530
 Just take my kid in, okay? 

262
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,249
I'm begging you! Please!

263
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:27,449
Open the door! Open it!

264
00:21:27,449 --> 00:21:28,768
 Please! 

265
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:30,888
 Just let my kid in! 

266
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,369
Please help us!

267
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,590
 I'm begging you! 

268
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:42,909
 Let my kid in! Please! 

269
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:45,010
What are you doing?

270
00:21:46,069 --> 00:21:47,110
Let them in.

271
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,110
Are you nuts?

272
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,650
Who the hell do you think you are?

273
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,588
How dare you point the scissors at me? You're seeking your doom.

274
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:30,910
Help me!

275
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,570
Where did she go?

276
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:36,140
What are you doing here?

277
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,309
Great Khan sent us to chase after the Dai State Force that has fled from the city.

278
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:40,909
Hurry up!

279
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:43,590
 Come on! 

280
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,368
Master, where are we going now?

281
00:24:16,369 --> 00:24:18,648
Let's go and take a look at the east side.

282
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:21,089
Right now, the east side is under siege by the Eagle Division.

283
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,829
But outside the east gate, there are towering and forested mountains.

284
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,168
We don't have our forces garrisoned there.

285
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:26,528
So might the Eagle Division.

286
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:28,288
However tight their defense might be,

287
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:31,128
I don't think they can find us among so many mountains.

288
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:35,709
A'Dou, you've really grown up.

289
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:46,128
Go now!

290
00:24:46,129 --> 00:24:47,709
Master, let's go together!

291
00:24:47,709 --> 00:24:49,410
Get someone here!

292
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,850
You followed me the whole way here.

293
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,049
I guess you want more than the Seal of Crown Prince.

294
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,769
You also want to kill me.

295
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:25,128
So what?

296
00:25:25,129 --> 00:25:27,168
Right now, Governor Gongsun is seriously wounded.

297
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:29,028
Shuo State is surrounded by enemies.

298
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,209
Do you really have to kill me right now?

299
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,130
Cut the nonsense.

300
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,949
It's my duty to execute you here.

301
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:48,549
Princess Yongning, any last words?

302
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:50,649
Even if I were to die,

303
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:54,869
I wouldn't be killed by a pawn.

304
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,530
Master, are you okay?

305
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,830
Do you know who she is?

306
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:12,248
If you help her,

307
00:26:12,249 --> 00:26:14,269
you'll regret it later, for sure.

308
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:19,168
All I know is that she's the commandant

309
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:22,610
who's protecting Shuo State.

310
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:27,248
Young man, you must've sneaked into Shuo State

311
00:26:27,249 --> 00:26:29,529
before the siege by the Eagle Division, right?

312
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:32,788
Then you must be clear about what's going on here.

313
00:26:32,788 --> 00:26:34,750
The governor is wounded.

314
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:39,709
Everyone in Shuo State relies on Commandant Li.

315
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:43,010
So I won't let you hurt her.

316
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,370
If you insist on helping her,

317
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:49,350
we'll wait and see.

318
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,130
Elder Qin, thank you.

319
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,569
Elder Qin, I have an idea.

320
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:14,770
We can get out of here.

321
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,969
Back then when we flooded Tu Kashe,

322
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:18,329
we pumped the stone canal dry

323
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,929
that once drained into Wuding River.

324
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:28,929
Master, just leave it to me.

325
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,550
You're still injured...

326
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,589
I'll go.

327
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:34,809
I might be a bit more familiar with this place than you.

328
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:37,989
Commandant Li.

329
00:27:41,769 --> 00:27:43,469
Commandant Li.

330
00:27:43,469 --> 00:27:45,070
Governor?

331
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:47,609
- Help Elder Qin out. 
 - Governor.

332
00:27:47,609 --> 00:27:49,930
- Commandant Li, Elder Qin told me  
 - Why are you here?

333
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:53,090
that you found a stone canal that might lead out of Shuo State.

334
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,729
Seeing you dressed like this,

335
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:57,569
are you going to deliver the message yourself?

336
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:03,049
The stone canal in the city leads straight to Wuding River.

337
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,288
Shuo State is now under siege by the Eagle Division.

338
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:07,169
Wuding River is the only area with no garrison.

339
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:08,488
If we don't spread the message now,

340
00:28:08,489 --> 00:28:09,628
I'm afraid we're running out of time.

341
00:28:09,628 --> 00:28:14,009
I plan to get out of here and deliver the message while it's still dark.

342
00:28:14,769 --> 00:28:16,969
You've already been seriously injured.

343
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,449
And today you were almost assassinated,

344
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:20,809
which just made things even worse.

345
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:24,670
How could I let you risk your life?

346
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:28,809
Right, Commandant Li. That guy hit you real hard.

347
00:28:31,669 --> 00:28:33,829
Commandant Li, let me do it.

348
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:35,710
Shuo State needs you and Master.

349
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,849
You're the hope of Shuo State.

350
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,668
Also, I'm Master's bodyguard.

351
00:28:39,668 --> 00:28:41,410
This is my duty.

352
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:43,248
No.

353
00:28:43,249 --> 00:28:44,749
The stone canal was built for drainage.

354
00:28:44,749 --> 00:28:47,510
It's too small for you to get through.

355
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,888
Governor, Iet me do it. I can get through it.

356
00:28:52,888 --> 00:28:54,309
A'Dou!

357
00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:56,449
Master, I know you're worried about me.

358
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,689
You don't want to put me at risk.

359
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,709
But you're already badly injured.

360
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:00,929
If you don't get a good rest,

361
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,950
you won't be able to carry on.

362
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,329
You don't want to pass out halfway

363
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:06,750
and cause a delay in reinforcement requests, right?

364
00:29:07,330 --> 00:29:10,128
So I'm the best choice for this task.

365
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:11,449
Governor, please place your trust in me.

366
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,008
I won't let you down.

367
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:14,488
Enough of this nonsense.

368
00:29:14,489 --> 00:29:15,969
You're just a kid.

369
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,809
How could I put you at risk?

370
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,248
Yes, I'm too young,

371
00:29:19,249 --> 00:29:22,289
and that's why I won't attract their attention.

372
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:26,368
Besides, Master accepted me as a disciple

373
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:27,929
because I'm smart.

374
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:29,609
I've been learning from Master for a long time.

375
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,408
I've commanded so many tricks.

376
00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:33,329
But when I'm back,

377
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:36,689
Governor, would you award me some titles?

378
00:29:42,009 --> 00:29:44,710
Master, stop hesitating.

379
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,629
We've been through so much.

380
00:29:46,629 --> 00:29:50,069
You don't think I can handle it, do you?

381
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,110
Fine.

382
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:05,329
Take this baggage with you and don't lose it.

383
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,689
You'll find an escape route map in it

384
00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:09,608
and some pocket crossbows with which you can beat off the enemies.

385
00:30:09,608 --> 00:30:11,368
Master, nice choice.

386
00:30:11,369 --> 00:30:12,528
And when I'm back in glory,

387
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:16,250
you'll all call me General Dou.

388
00:30:20,009 --> 00:30:23,909
A'Dou, take care of yourself.

389
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:25,308
I will, Master.

390
00:30:25,308 --> 00:30:29,309
Tell everyone to hang in there and wait for me.

391
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:43,050
Commandant Li, you have a great disciple.

392
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,690
I didn't teach him anything.

393
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:52,690
In fact, I'm the lucky one to meet him.

394
00:31:01,009 --> 00:31:02,409
General.

395
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,648
I sent people to spy on Mu Jin.

396
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:09,590
But he managed to get rid of them halfway.

397
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,949
He seemed to be leaving for Dai State.

398
00:31:11,949 --> 00:31:13,550
Dai State?

399
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:19,189
What does that mean?

400
00:31:19,189 --> 00:31:22,089
Great Khan has taken Dai State?

401
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:25,269
What's happening?

402
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:26,950
Why?

403
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:29,849
I know nothing at all!

404
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,209
What? Do they take our Bear Division seriously?

405
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:33,689
General, don't be anxious.

406
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,488
I will lead a team to keep an eye on Ashile Sun.

407
00:31:35,489 --> 00:31:37,449
I won't let him fool Great Khan

408
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:39,128
and take all the credit for occupying Shuo State.

409
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:40,790
Enough!

410
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,969
Cut that nonsense!

411
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,668
Get lost! Now!

412
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,680
   

413
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,050
   

414
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:56,429
Yuan'er.

415
00:31:56,429 --> 00:31:58,390
You're finally back.

416
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,689
People sent food here just now.

417
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:02,888
They said they'd eat chaff and herbs

418
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:05,548
as long as you and the soldiers are well fed.

419
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,469
And I had people send it back.

420
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:10,049
They saved their own food.

421
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,489
I couldn't accept it, really.

422
00:32:12,489 --> 00:32:15,510
Madam, you are right.

423
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,869
Father.

424
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,849
Everyone is saying that

425
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,109
you're the one who's defending Shuo State.

426
00:32:26,489 --> 00:32:29,049
Your mother must have praised me again, right?

427
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:33,170
But I think,

428
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:37,400
they're the reason Shuo State exists,

429
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,049
not me.

430
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,050
I can't take the credit.

431
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,049
Check all the food provisions

432
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,768
and the grains we have.

433
00:32:49,769 --> 00:32:52,069
Distribute it to the common people.

434
00:32:52,769 --> 00:32:55,229
We must hold out till A'Dou comes back.

435
00:32:55,229 --> 00:32:56,749
Yes.

436
00:33:34,129 --> 00:33:37,688
General, we've killed all the Tang soldiers around Dai State on Great Khan's command!

437
00:33:37,688 --> 00:33:38,768
What about those who fled Dai State?

438
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:40,128
They were all killed!

439
00:33:40,129 --> 00:33:41,008
Good!

440
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:43,049
General of Eagle Division has sent someone here from Shuo State.

441
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,008
Great Khan ordered us to meet him.

442
00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:47,149
Let's go back to Dai State. Don't keep that messenger waiting.

443
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:48,449
Yes, Sir!

444
00:33:56,489 --> 00:33:58,770
 Damn it. The post road was blocked. 

445
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,609
 I can't send the message to Chang'an. 

446
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:02,988
 And Dai State fell to the enemies, too. We won't be able to get any reinforcements. 

447
00:34:02,988 --> 00:34:04,210
 What should I do now? 

448
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:07,430
 I must go back and inform Master of this. 

449
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:27,968
You guys. Find some clothes of Tang soldiers

450
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:30,488
and get changed on our way out of Dai State.

451
00:34:30,489 --> 00:34:31,889
Yes!

452
00:35:00,729 --> 00:35:03,909
Come on. Come on. Get up!

453
00:35:13,489 --> 00:35:14,690
 Have mercy on us. 

454
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,249
 Don't kill us! 

455
00:35:17,249 --> 00:35:19,009
 Please spare us! 

456
00:35:19,009 --> 00:35:20,409
Come on, kneel down!

457
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,129
Why should I?

458
00:35:22,129 --> 00:35:25,070
They are the real culprits, the offenders.

459
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,510
Just kneel down!

460
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:36,109
 Have mercy on us! Don't kill us! Please! 

461
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,530
 Please don't kill us! 

462
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,729
- Stop it. 
 - Who are you?

463
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:08,089
You don't know me. That's fine.

464
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,210
But I'm sure you can recognize this spike arrow.

465
00:36:13,929 --> 00:36:17,148
Since when does Eagle Division get to tell us what to do?

466
00:36:17,148 --> 00:36:18,649
If you're smart, you'd get lost now.

467
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:21,629
You know well what Eagle Division is capable of.

468
00:36:21,629 --> 00:36:26,108
I suppose you wouldn't want to die for these refugees.

469
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,050
Let's go!

470
00:36:44,729 --> 00:36:46,429
You should go now.

471
00:36:46,429 --> 00:36:50,408
 Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! 

472
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,049
We must get back to Shuo State as soon as possible.

473
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,529
- Yes! 
 - Yes!

474
00:36:55,289 --> 00:36:58,569
 Thank you! 

475
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:09,909
 - Let's go home. 
 - Great! 

476
00:37:09,909 --> 00:37:11,610
 Father. 

477
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,990
Isn't he that... that...

478
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:54,130
that guy's apprentice?

479
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,148
Yes!

480
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,849
I know you.

481
00:37:57,729 --> 00:38:00,710
Kill him. Just kill him. Now.

482
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,808
Wait! My Lord! My Lord!

483
00:38:02,808 --> 00:38:04,849
I've got an update for you.

484
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,948
Lord? He's our General.

485
00:38:07,948 --> 00:38:09,749
Yeah, okay. General! General!

486
00:38:09,749 --> 00:38:12,008
You got my title wrong.

487
00:38:12,009 --> 00:38:13,448
Kill him. Kill him. Just kill him.

488
00:38:13,448 --> 00:38:17,609
General, right now you must be desperate to know what's going on in Shuo State.

489
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:23,489
Spare my life and I'll prove myself useful to you.

490
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:42,030
Then tell me how you might be helpful to us...

491
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:45,709
or I will kill you myself.

492
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,649
General, you know that

493
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:50,008
I'm Registrar Li's trusted follower.

494
00:38:50,009 --> 00:38:52,428
I know his tricks better than anyone.

495
00:38:52,428 --> 00:38:55,088
During the battle around Wuding River, you lost so many soldiers.

496
00:38:55,088 --> 00:38:56,989
The situation for you is grim.

497
00:38:56,989 --> 00:38:59,728
I also heard that now it's the Eagle Division that's leading the attack.

498
00:38:59,729 --> 00:39:01,089
Screw you!

499
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:03,189
I don't want to hear any of this.

500
00:39:03,189 --> 00:39:05,169
Did you bring him to me just to piss me off?

501
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,709
- Kill him. Just kill him. Kill him. 
 - If you were still able to manage the battle,

502
00:39:07,709 --> 00:39:11,409
how come you know nothing about Li's promotion to Commandant?

503
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:14,688
General, spare my life.

504
00:39:14,689 --> 00:39:16,089
Let me talk to the generals in Shuo State.

505
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:19,569
I'll make Commandant Li offer up Shuo State submissively.

506
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:37,350
Now even a cute little cub

507
00:39:37,350 --> 00:39:39,700
dares to cheat me.

508
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,390
Do I look like a fool to you?

509
00:39:44,029 --> 00:39:44,928
Do I?

510
00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:46,588
Sima Jian, that liar, he cheated you.

511
00:39:46,588 --> 00:39:49,369
General, you don't know it. Commandant Li and Governor Gongsun are dying at this moment.

512
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:50,728
The Eagle Division hit them really hard.

513
00:39:50,729 --> 00:39:52,868
This is the best time for negotiation.

514
00:39:52,868 --> 00:39:54,288
I know them quite well.

515
00:39:54,289 --> 00:39:57,349
I'd be the best one for this task.

516
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,768
It's been so long since the Eagle Division laid siege to Shuo State

517
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:07,768
and people there are still closely united with high morale.

518
00:40:07,769 --> 00:40:10,348
Even if I fail, which is highly unlikely,

519
00:40:10,348 --> 00:40:12,968
it'll demoralize them greatly.

520
00:40:12,969 --> 00:40:16,529
That's something Eagle Division can never do.

521
00:40:24,689 --> 00:40:27,149
Let's take his words for the moment.

522
00:40:27,149 --> 00:40:29,108
Tie him to my horse.

523
00:40:29,108 --> 00:40:31,289
He'll be going into a battle with me.

524
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:33,230
Don't kill him yet.

525
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:35,889
Yes.

526
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:04,528
Great Khan ordered that anyone who makes a rash act will be executed.

527
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,070
Come on!

528
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,650
- Hang on. 
 - I'm too tired.

529
00:41:32,669 --> 00:41:36,189
Miss, I can't take it, Miss.

530
00:41:37,529 --> 00:41:39,310
Wear these.

531
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:46,030
Miss, you're so kind.

532
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:50,109
Thank you for saving my life.

533
00:41:50,109 --> 00:41:53,750
I wish someone could save my daughter.

534
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,968
You must survive.

535
00:41:55,969 --> 00:41:58,409
Maybe you'll get to see your daughter one day.

536
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,248
General, the Eagle Division collected many clothes of the soldiers

537
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:21,609
defending Dai State while cleaning up the battlefield.

538
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:25,609
And later on their way back, Mu Jin ordered the Eagle Division to change into Tang uniforms.

539
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,230
They want to grab the credit from us.

540
00:42:35,009 --> 00:42:36,908
Gather Bear Division now!

541
00:42:36,908 --> 00:42:38,609
Hurry! Come on!

542
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:47,330
