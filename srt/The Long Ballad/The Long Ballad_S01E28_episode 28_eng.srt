00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,999
♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,959
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,430
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,869
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,450
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,819
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

7
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:31,689

8
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:34,789

♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

16
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:07,359
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,309
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,060
♫  I don't regret my craziness  ♫

20
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:24,650


21
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:32,570
   

22
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:36,280
   

23
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,380
An Rou, is the carriage ready?

24
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,360
Young Master Hao has been waiting here for a long time.

25
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,400
Forget it. I'd better go on my own.

26
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,579
You should stay here.

27
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,338
If His Highness really feels uncomfortable,

28
00:01:55,339 --> 00:01:57,518
look for doctors as soon as possible.

29
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:01,019
Princess, don't you need me with you?

30
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:04,680
Since Young Master Hao is with me, you shouldn't be worried.

31
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,159
Stay here and look after Crown Prince.

32
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:10,040
You must trust Young Master Hao a great deal.

33
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,459
No kidding at this moment.

34
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,519
Yes.

35
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:15,020
Go.

36
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,339
Don't take away my little brother!

37
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,739
Miss Wu!

38
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,218
Don't take away my little brother!

39
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,159
- He's still alive! 
 - Ms. Wu!

40
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:38,439
Don't cremate him!

41
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,578
- Don't cremate him! 
 - Miss Wu!

42
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,059
He's my younger brother!

43
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:44,399
Don't cremate him!

44
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:47,140
- What are you doing? Let her go! 
 - Save him!

45
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,018
They want to cremate my brother!

46
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,859
- He'll die! 
 - He has the plague.

47
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:53,099
My brother!

48
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,179
Miss Wu!

49
00:02:54,179 --> 00:02:55,339
Stop her!

50
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,719
My brother!

51
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,899
Don't cremate him!

52
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,499
He's really my younger brother!

53
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:00,899
Miss, Young Master.

54
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,439
One by one, people die of the plague.

55
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,779
The corpses must be cremated.

56
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:05,339
It can't be delayed.

57
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,640
Princess.

58
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,198
- Brother! 
 - Miss Wu!

59
00:03:09,198 --> 00:03:11,319
Miss Wu! I know.

60
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,159
Don't cremate him.

61
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,660
I know you can't believe it.

62
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,040
But your brother was seriously ill.

63
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,719
Don't chase him.

64
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:24,479
Now, he's no longer in pain.

65
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:38,979
Last night, I hummed a ditty to put him to sleep.

66
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:43,000
Suddenly, he had a high fever

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,680
and black spots on his skin.

68
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,480
Then his body became cold.

69
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,920
Slowly.

70
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,539
I rubbed his hands, feet, and face.

71
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,119
But he became totally cold.

72
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,279
I'm useless.

73
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,339
He died.

74
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,840
Miss Wu, your brother became bereaved after birth.

75
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,419
It was already hard for you to raise him up.

76
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:19,359
It's lucky that you're sister and brother.

77
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,319
Granny.

78
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:29,480
He's not had enough rice and steamed buns.

79
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,200
 He came to this world 

80
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,278
 but left as if he had never existed. Why? 

81
00:04:35,278 --> 00:04:38,059
 When we arrive in Luoyang, I can give you anything you want. 

82
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:43,240
 I want you to give me a lot of rice. 

83
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,259
 I've never tasted white rice. 

84
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,140
I know your brother

85
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,470
went to see your parents in the netherworld.

86
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,940
Let him go.

87
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,439
I hope he won't be born into a family like ours in the next life.

88
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:08,999
He went to see our parents.

89
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,639
But I'm not happy at all.

90
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,779
I don't want him to see our parents.

91
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:19,600
I know.

92
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,920
Miss Wu,

93
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,919
you can miss him.

94
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,579
You can feel sad.

95
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,579
But you should continue your life.

96
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:36,599
Lead a good life with the hope of your brother.

97
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,020
   

98
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,339
Sun.

99
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:46,959
A'Li, you had a nightmare.

100
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,739
You repeatedly called Sun.

101
00:06:49,739 --> 00:06:51,900
Who is he?

102
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,898
Nothing.

103
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:56,539
You shouldn't shut yourself up in your room every day.

104
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:59,138
One will think too much if staying alone for a long time.

105
00:06:59,138 --> 00:07:03,000
What you dream about at night reflects what you think about in the day.

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,920
A'Bi, thank you.

107
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,019
You're welcome.

108
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,558
I don't read many books.

109
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:12,099
Thanks to Miss Quan, I have very basic knowledge.

110
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,018
But when I was little, my mom always told me that

111
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:16,138
one can always lead a good life

112
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:19,558
if one combs one's hair, brushes their teeth, cleans one's face with tissues,

113
00:07:19,558 --> 00:07:22,579
and has three full meals every day.

114
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,539
I think Master is right.

115
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,560
You're so clever that you always think too much.

116
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:33,559
What you just said reflects real wisdom.

117
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,039
Yes.

118
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,100
Master always says my vague manner conceals a brilliant mind.

119
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,498
By the way, did you call the man, Sun?

120
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:45,359
Or is it a monkey you raise?

121
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,379
It's Sun.

122
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,658
Sun?

123
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,919
So it's a bird you raise?

124
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:53,500
He's my former companion.

125
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,879
Since he's your companion, why doesn't he look for you?

126
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,299
I don't think that's right.

127
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,900
I did something that hurt him.

128
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:05,480
If he doesn't look for and hate me,

129
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:09,459
I'll feel a bit relieved.

130
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:30,259
Any information on Changge?

131
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,219
Elder Qin, I have some news.

132
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,118
We found a person similar to Young Master.

133
00:08:34,118 --> 00:08:37,880
She went to Luoyang with a doctor and a young man in a donkey cart.

134
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,218
Who are the doctor and the man?

135
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,979
Is Changge safe with them?

136
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,940
Stop pretending to care about her.

137
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,539
We'll find Commander Li.

138
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:47,739
None of your business!

139
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,140
Xu Feng!

140
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:51,439
He's impetuous.

141
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:53,238
He never cares about what he says.

142
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:55,478
But he has always been loyal to Young Master.

143
00:08:55,478 --> 00:08:57,480
Don't think too much.

144
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:03,790
So we should speed up and arrive in Luoyang

145
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,810
as soon as possible.

146
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,779
Since we're all here for Young Master's good,

147
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:19,039
why do you always embarrass him?

148
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:24,759
During these days, haven't you found that he really cares about Young Master?

149
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,119
Even if he really cares about Young Master,

150
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:36,179
I'll never forget the hatred in Shuo State.

151
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:38,580
I know how you're feeling.

152
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,319
Since we are consistent in our goals, we should work together.

153
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,379
No need to quarrel with him without thinking twice.

154
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,458
All right.

155
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:50,099
Don't think too much.

156
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,279
Brother A'Zhun, water.

157
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,999
Have a rest.

158
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:57,039
Set out early tomorrow.

159
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,180
Hug me.

160
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:04,619
Come here.

161
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:07,779
Brother A'Zhun, throw me high.

162
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:09,840
One more time.

163
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,340
Stop!

164
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,399
Yuan is naive. Are you naive, too?

165
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,299
It's too dangerous! What's your purpose?

166
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,458
You frightened her.

167
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:22,459
Yuan, don't play with him.

168
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,040
Play with me.

169
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,419
No.

170
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,798
Miss Yuan, you can play with any other person,

171
00:10:28,798 --> 00:10:30,739
except him.

172
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,058
He's not called Zhun. He's Ashile Sun.

173
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:35,479
- He put your parents— 
 - Xu Feng!

174
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,299
A'Zhun, it's late at night.

175
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,520
Take Yuan to sleep.

176
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,279
Yuan, behave yourself.

177
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:53,658
Yuan, shall we play together elsewhere?

178
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,740
You have gone too far!

179
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:04,449
She scolded me!

180
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,528
What did I do?

181
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:08,429
Why don't you understand?

182
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:11,129
Do you want Yuan to be the second Young Master

183
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,008
who always lives in hatred?

184
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:17,689
You witnessed Young Master's pain and sorrow.

185
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:21,569
Don't you know the cost of hatred?

186
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:29,170
Did you see how happy she was just now?

187
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,188
Governor and his wife hoped that

188
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:34,809
their daughter could grow up lightheartedly

189
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:38,619
instead of suffering from hatred.

190
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,000
   

191
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:56,519
Princess, the supplies of South Hill are ready.

192
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,479
Princess.

193
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,558
What's the matter?

194
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,319
His Highness went out.

195
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,779
Did he go to South Hill?

196
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,439
Of course not.

197
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,319
He went to the street.

198
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,480
When will he grow up?

199
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:56,980
Well, seeing the miserable condition of the people, he may be touched.

200
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,220
I hope he doesn't make any trouble.

201
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,740
Princess, now you behave more and more like a sister.

202
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,539
 Colored umbrella! 

203
00:13:06,539 --> 00:13:07,479
 Look at these umbrellas! 

204
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:08,559
 Fresh cabbage! 

205
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:09,399
 - Fan! 
 - Look at the fans! 

206
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,379
 Look at the fans! 

207
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:11,679
 Little tiger! 

208
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,598
 Come and have a look! 

209
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:15,299
 All homemade! 

210
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:21,710
Shengxin, since Madam selected you,

211
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,850
you should behave yourself.

212
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,499
 Good! 

213
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:36,639
 Great! 

214
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,478
 Come on! 

215
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:38,519
 Good! 

216
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,399
 - Wrestle! 
 - Move out of my way! 

217
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,538
 - Great! 
 - Wrestle! 

218
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:43,839
 Great! 

219
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,379
 Good! Wrestle! 

220
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:51,958
 Good! Good! 

221
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,279
 Again! 

222
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,258
 Good. Go on! 

223
00:13:54,258 --> 00:13:55,459
 Come on! 

224
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:57,559
 Go on! 

225
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:58,940
 Come on! 

226
00:13:59,599 --> 00:14:00,678
 Wrestle! 

227
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:02,160
 Go on! 

228
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,519
 Go! Bring him down! 

229
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,719
 Good! 

230
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:09,759
Roll logs for us!

231
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,598
 Good! 

232
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,599
 Money! Money! 

233
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,400
 Don't grab! 

234
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,959
 Mine! 

235
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,038
 Don't squeeze! Don't grab! 

236
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:19,279
 - Don't squeeze! 
 - Mine! 

237
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,760
 Don't grab! 

238
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:23,259
 Move out of my way! 

239
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:27,279
 Don't squeeze! 

240
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,780
 Back off! 

241
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,858
 - Back off! 
 - Mine! 

242
00:14:31,858 --> 00:14:33,058
 Don't squeeze! Back off! 

243
00:14:33,058 --> 00:14:34,659
 Beat! 

244
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:38,519
 Don't grab! 

245
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,000
 Don't squeeze! 

246
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:48,119
 Come on. 

247
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,920
 Don't grab! 

248
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,840
It hurts!

249
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,238
- It hurts! 
 - Don't move.

250
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:09,598
Let me apply the ointment to you.

251
00:15:09,599 --> 00:15:11,299
Don't move.

252
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,140
Don't move.

253
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:23,019
- It hurts. 
 - Does it still hurt?

254
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,599
Thank you for saving me.

255
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,599
Tell me your name.

256
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:37,800
I'll give you a reward.

257
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,199
I'll repay you.

258
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,240
You're welcome.

259
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:45,799
- Young Master! 
 - Young Master!

260
00:15:46,459 --> 00:15:47,959
Here you are.

261
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:52,300
Come back! Don't go.

262
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,799
- Young Master, are you all right? 
 - Come back!

263
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,199
Are you all right?

264
00:15:56,719 --> 00:15:58,560
Come back!

265
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,279
Give me a pie.

266
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,880
Here you are.

267
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:21,660
Brother A'Zhun.

268
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,479
Do you like this song?

269
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,580
Lazy bones!

270
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,619
Xu Feng is right.

271
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:53,798
You shouldn't get too close to me.

272
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,800
Why?

273
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,500
Yuan.

274
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:03,839
It's a wolf whistle.

275
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,719
It's our specialty.

276
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,640
I have nothing else to compensate you.

277
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,919
Blow it when you are in need.

278
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,059
I'll protect you on behalf of your parents.

279
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:21,079
In this way?

280
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,580
Very good.

281
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,900
   

282
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:55,839
What am I thinking about?

283
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,298
 New trouble arose as soon as His Highness came here, why? 

284
00:17:59,298 --> 00:18:01,239
His Highness the Crown Prince?

285
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,999
 I'll finish. 

286
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,199
 - More ointment. 
 - Don't touch water. 

287
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,060
 Bear the pain. 

288
00:18:22,939 --> 00:18:24,959
A'Bi! What happened?

289
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:27,238
His Highness the Crown Prince secretly watched juggling and spread money

290
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,438
on the street instead of comforting the refugees after he came to Luoyang.

291
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:33,879
But the street was so crowded that many people were trampled on.

292
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,820
Crown Prince is here?

293
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,200
He never does anything right.

294
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:44,399
My apprentice.

295
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,358
 Let me bandage it for you. 

296
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,999
If you have spare time to care about official affairs,

297
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,820
you'd better work with me in South Hill.

298
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:54,879
Let's go!

299
00:19:03,719 --> 00:19:04,818
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

300
00:19:04,818 --> 00:19:06,799
Young Master Wei, finally you've come!

301
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,669
The people outside seem to be mad.

302
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,579
I want to return to Chang'an! Get the carriage ready!

303
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:12,520
I want to return to Chang'an!

304
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,439
You're injured.

305
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:17,620
How did you protect him?

306
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,338
They're a bunch of thugs!

307
00:19:20,338 --> 00:19:22,039
I spread money to them out of kindness.

308
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,539
But the outcome is terrible.

309
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,358
Some people were trampled to death.

310
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,959
Too terrible!

311
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,559
I want to go back to Chang'an!

312
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,520
What trouble did you make?

313
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:33,519
Sister, I'm injured.

314
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,600
But why don't you care about me?

315
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,279
You show no kindness to me at all!

316
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,980
Let me see.

317
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:42,739
Chengqian!

318
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,118
Brother Shuyu, look around with me.

319
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:46,980
- Go. 
 - Princess.

320
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,099
It's my duty.

321
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:52,860
You keep an eye on His Highness lest he wants to go back to Chang'an.

322
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:56,379
Okay. Thank you.

323
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,300
Move out of my way!

324
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,398
- Commander! 
 - Go!

325
00:20:09,398 --> 00:20:10,259
Be lenient with me!

326
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:11,049
Commander!

327
00:20:11,049 --> 00:20:11,800
- Stand up! 
 - Commander!

328
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,999
Please be lenient with me!

329
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,460
Hurry up!

330
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:20,099
Commander, it's these beggars who made trouble.

331
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:21,499
Commander, please be lenient with me!

332
00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:22,659
We're didn't do it on purpose.

333
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:23,999
We've been hungry for days.

334
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:25,478
A rich man spread money in the street.

335
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:27,159
We just picked several more coppers.

336
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,938
We didn't expect things to go wrong.

337
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:30,619
Commander.

338
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:38,198
 I know very well the people outside. 

339
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:40,319
 They're just too hungry. 

340
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,279
 Some people are kind on the surface, but vicious inside. 

341
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,800
 Some people look indifferent but are warmhearted, like you. 

342
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,198
Take them back and let the magistrate deal with them.

343
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:56,100
- Yes. 
 - Go!

344
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,199
 Commander! Be lenient with me! 

345
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:00,298
 Commander, show mercy on me! 

346
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:01,699
 Hurry up! 

347
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,360
 Slow down. 

348
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,000
Slow down.

349
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,480
Are you feeling better?

350
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,419
Bear the pain.

351
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:21,260
Why are there so many refugees?

352
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:24,540
They used to be ordinary people.

353
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,980
In the face of disaster and war, they became refugees.

354
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,440
As long as society is not stable, there will be more refugees.

355
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,659
Feel uncomfortable at the sight of that?

356
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:39,238
They are more fortunate than those who have no place to live

357
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:41,400
and no food to eat.

358
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,759
Some of those who have not escaped disaster and war

359
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,220
are still wandering and struggling,

360
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,118
while some of them have been buried in the earth

361
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,480
and have no chance to live.

362
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,540
My friend.

363
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,200
You're here, too.

364
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,620
Master.

365
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,660
Master, you're here?

366
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,460
Miss Wu.

367
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,139
Master, who's this sister?

368
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:16,839
Is she new here to cultivate herself?

369
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:20,079
Miss Wu, she's Sister A' Li.

370
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:22,159
She's been cultivating herself in the temple.

371
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,999
I'm busy today.

372
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,919
Can you take her to go outside tomorrow?

373
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,280
My apprentice, aren't you called Li Changge?

374
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,360
When did you change your name?

375
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,660
What I'm called doesn't matter.

376
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,059
Okay. Change your name and restart your life.

377
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,700
   

378
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,839
 Have you found her? 

379
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:07,999
 No. 

380
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,700
 I searched there but in vain. 

381
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,078
 Search in all directions! 

382
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:14,079
 Yes! 

383
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,379
What happened?

384
00:24:17,379 --> 00:24:20,000
Yuan is missing.

385
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,340
Yuan is missing! You're the only one out there.

386
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,618
Didn't you see anyone running out?

387
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,438
Stop!

388
00:24:28,438 --> 00:24:31,139
- Xu Feng. 
 - I'm warning you.

389
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:32,619
If there's anything wrong with Yuan,

390
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:34,819
I'll get even with you for everything.

391
00:24:34,819 --> 00:24:37,860
I'll kill you for the Gongsun family.

392
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,600
First, find her.

393
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,660
Then it's up to you.

394
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:52,019
Where are you going?

395
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,239
Miss Yuan!

396
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,500
Miss Yuan!

397
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,540
- Are you all right? 
 - I'm fine.

398
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,658
Let me take you out. All right?

399
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,819
Come on.

400
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,218
Yuan, why are you here?

401
00:25:43,218 --> 00:25:46,099
Tomorrow is Mom's birthday.

402
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:49,838
I wanted to pick some flowers for her.

403
00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:54,039
I saw flowers on the tree, but I couldn't reach them.

404
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,860
I didn't expect to fall into the pit.

405
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,758
What a good girl! You are filial.

406
00:26:03,758 --> 00:26:10,959
Gongsun's greatest wish is that you can be safe and happy.

407
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:13,939
It's a pity that he can help everyone in his life

408
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:18,440
but can't protect his family.

409
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:23,999
Well, let's go back.

410
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:29,879
Nothing serious.

411
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,340
You can't do this again. Does it hurt?

412
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,338
I will immediately count the number of injured and the registered residence of each household.

413
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:49,160
Please come with me to comfort them and give them subsidies.

414
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:53,020
Young Master Wei, you can do it alone.

415
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,858
Or I wouldn't have brought you here.

416
00:26:54,858 --> 00:26:57,559
How can you talk to Brother Shuyu like that?

417
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,540
It's all your fault.

418
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,179
You should comfort those people.

419
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:04,539
Sister, my kindness is not rewarded. I gave them money but was hurt.

420
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,819
I'm sad. Leave me alone!

421
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:11,879
You're the crown prince. If you don't go, should I go?

422
00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:13,860
So you said you would go.

423
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,359
- I... 
 - You're Princess of Great Tang. You should do that.

424
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:20,290
Last time you comforted

425
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,540
those refugees in person.

426
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,640
Sister, I've already been injured.

427
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,910
Let me have a rest for a few days.

428
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,179
Let me see how long you can be so willful.

429
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,500
Sister.

430
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,500
Forget it.

431
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,498
I'll go on your behalf this time.

432
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,980
But just this once.

433
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,200
Young Master Wei.

434
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,099
Young Master Wei, I dare not go into the street again.

435
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:04,439
Is there anywhere else I can go?

436
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:08,618
I heard that the Ziwei Palace of the Sui Dynasty is here. Can you go with me?

437
00:28:08,618 --> 00:28:12,339
Your Highness, it was built by Emperor Yang. It's a sheer waste of energy and money.

438
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:15,219
I think you'd better go and visit the common people.

439
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:16,919
Anyway, His Majesty appointed you—

440
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,819
Yes. I think you're right.

441
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:23,118
You should watch Luoyang carefully, especially Ziwei Palace.

442
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,018
Emperor Yang was quite extravagant.

443
00:28:25,018 --> 00:28:28,479
I have to see the palace in detail as a reminder.

444
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:31,539
Get the carriage ready!

445
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:39,579
Wound healing unguent. Blood recovering pills.

446
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:42,219
Medicine is ready.

447
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,218
Princess, why not go with Young Master Hao?

448
00:28:45,218 --> 00:28:46,120
   

449
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,039
No need.

450
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,179
It's not the case in Chang'an.

451
00:28:53,179 --> 00:28:56,738
There are many refugees. They came from many different places.

452
00:28:56,738 --> 00:28:59,139
Young Master Wei will take care of His Highness the Crown Prince.

453
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:01,240
So he can't accompany you.

454
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,239
But I'm afraid if Young Master Hao isn't here, either.

455
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:10,019
I'm either in the government office or in South Hill. He'll find me for sure.

456
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:13,800
By the way, it's impossible that he follows me all his life.

457
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,280
We should be able to protect ourselves.

458
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,399
Princess, you really changed a lot.

459
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:21,119
It's better that Young Master Hao doesn't follow you.

460
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:26,619
Sometimes I'm scared at the sight of him.

461
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:27,979
Yes.

462
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:31,480
I was also afraid of him before.

463
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,618
Before? Now you're not afraid of him?

464
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,660
Now...

465
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,460
 Princess! 

466
00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:46,680
 I finally find you! 

467
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:51,160
 Let's go. Let me take you home. 

468
00:29:55,139 --> 00:29:59,898
Yesterday, Master asked me to take you to South Hill today to look around.

469
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,080
Sister A' Li, do you have something on your mind?

470
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,900
You looked sad yesterday.

471
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,078
Why do you live in the temple?

472
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,660
Where's your family?

473
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,080
They all died.

474
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,480
Sister A' Li, here you are.

475
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,499
The candy was given by Master. I haven't had it.

476
00:30:27,499 --> 00:30:29,339
You have it.

477
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,419
You want to give it to me?

478
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,378
Sister A'Li, don't be sad.

479
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:40,719
In fact, my family also died.

480
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:43,559
The people I met yesterday are not your family?

481
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,460
I used to live in Yun State.

482
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,740
When winter is approaching,

483
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,640
people from the grassland will come to loot.

484
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,719
Later, in the year of disaster,

485
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,320
no one could survive.

486
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,860
Our parents took us out.

487
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,560
They said...

488
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,840
They said we could survive in the south.

489
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:14,479
But later, my dad died of disease.

490
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:18,039
Then my mom also fell ill.

491
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:21,399
She said that ordinary people like us

492
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,339
can only depend on Heaven for food.

493
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:27,439
If God wants to take back your life,

494
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:29,799
you can only accept such fate.

495
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,838
It shouldn't be the case.

496
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:36,699
But I can do nothing.

497
00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:38,238
My parents died.

498
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:41,519
I took my little brother all the way to Liuyun Taoist Temple.

499
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:45,980
A few days ago, my brother died, too.

500
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,359
I miss him very much.

501
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:53,079
But I was told that people won't feel pain after death.

502
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:56,840
So he won't suffer anymore.

503
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,359
Is that true, Sister A' Li?

504
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,600
Yes.

505
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:05,439
He won't suffer anymore.

506
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:08,619
Now he's with your parents.

507
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:13,100
But I'm still not happy at all.

508
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,580
Granny Chen told me that

509
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:21,419
my brother won't suffer in a family like ours.

510
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,700
But...

511
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,920
But I'm still sad.

512
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,959
Sister A'Li,

513
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:34,759
what sins have we done?

514
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,819
Why does God just refuse to treat us well?

515
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,858
You have done nothing wrong.

516
00:32:42,858 --> 00:32:45,140
It's the fault of endless war.

517
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,020
I was born in a wealthy family.

518
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,939
We swam in luxury.

519
00:32:49,939 --> 00:32:52,900
We went out by beautiful carriages.

520
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,520
We lived in a fantastic manor.

521
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,979
But everyone wanted more.

522
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:06,580
I have thought that if I were born into a peasant family,

523
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,400
I would have been able to live in peace.

524
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:12,179
But I was wrong.

525
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:17,430
I should understand earlier that in troubled times,

526
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,280
if death can make my wish realized,

527
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,459
that would be much easier.

528
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,139
Here. You have it.

529
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,700
Have a taste.

530
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,860
Let's go.

531
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,499
A'Li, did Miss Wu take you to see anything?

532
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:50,838
Master, could you teach me how to save these refugees?

533
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:54,450
Why do you have that thought?

534
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,550
I hope we can lead a peaceful life.

535
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,930
I go with the flow, like duckweed.

536
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:01,930
You can see Heaven and Earth, and all living creatures in the world.

537
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:05,369
It seems that your heart has been cured.

538
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,050
   

539
00:34:12,249 --> 00:34:15,030
We're in Luoyang now.

540
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,890
Let's settle down here.

541
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,990
Elder Qin, is Changge really in Luoyang?

542
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,589
If you don't believe my intelligence, you'd better find her alone.

543
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:25,810
Xu Feng.

544
00:34:30,689 --> 00:34:34,570
Grandpa Qin, what's wrong with Brother A'Zhun?

545
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,710
Nothing is wrong with him.

546
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,990
He's afraid he won't find your Brother Li.

547
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,930
Thank you for your kindness.

548
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,850
Sister A'Li, you're quite a fast learner.

549
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:18,650
You are more skillful at pounding herbs.

550
00:35:20,529 --> 00:35:22,329
Come here, everyone!

551
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:25,170
Someone donated some medicine to us.

552
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:27,010
Princess.

553
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:31,210
Sister Princess!

554
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,989
Sister Princess!

555
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:44,410
Sister Princess, you've come!

556
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:16,649
Changge, you don't hate me?

557
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:19,170
I was so stubborn that

558
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,529
I always refused you.

559
00:36:21,969 --> 00:36:25,629
Yueyan, can you forgive me?

560
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,669
I've never blamed you.

561
00:36:34,149 --> 00:36:38,370
Thank God, we can meet again.

562
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:42,469
I really thought I'd never see you again.

563
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:45,630
Fate has brought us together again.

564
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,950
Don't cry.

565
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,030
How about you?

566
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,129
Are you all right?

567
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,728
Where did you go after we bade farewell in a hurry in You State?

568
00:36:58,729 --> 00:37:01,129
Did you go directly to Luoyang?

569
00:37:01,129 --> 00:37:05,669
After leaving You State, I went all the way north.

570
00:37:05,669 --> 00:37:08,150
Then I met Taoist Sun.

571
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:12,590
It's a long story.

572
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:17,049
You must have suffered a lot.

573
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:19,770
You went through many difficulties, right?

574
00:37:21,669 --> 00:37:23,189
Let bygones be bygones.

575
00:37:23,189 --> 00:37:25,670
Don't mention it.

576
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:30,930
By the way, we almost met each other before.

577
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,690
What do you mean?

578
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,529
Do you remember the purse I gave you?

579
00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:37,429
I embroidered a new one which was exactly alike.

580
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:39,410
I remember that.

581
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,409
I was confused as to why someone knew

582
00:37:42,409 --> 00:37:44,649
what the purse you gave me was like.

583
00:37:44,649 --> 00:37:46,389
Why didn't you see me?

584
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,469
I went to see you.

585
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:50,969
But Hao Du arrived in advance.

586
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:54,700
Although Hao Du is not a good man,

587
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,100
he can protect you.

588
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,369
By the way, why were you in Yun State then?

589
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,370
Greetings, Commandant.

590
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:23,449
- Where's Princess? 
 - Her Highness is ahead.

591
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:28,009
Princess! Princess!

592
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:31,028
Princess! Young Master Hao is here.

593
00:38:31,028 --> 00:38:32,970
Hao Du?

594
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,930
Changge.

595
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:38,089
Changge, I have a lot to tell you.

596
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,470
Wait for me in the market between 3:00 to 5:00 p.m. Go. Hurry up.

597
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:43,028
- Be careful. 
 - Hurry up!

598
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,310
Hao Du!

599
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,508
I've finished my business. Let's go back.

600
00:38:55,508 --> 00:38:57,189
Wait a minute.

601
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:01,270
What's wrong, Princess?

602
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:03,170
I have a stomachache.

603
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,310
We have doctors here.

604
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:07,689
- Doctor! 
 - No need. It's just my period.

605
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,170
An Rou.

606
00:39:19,669 --> 00:39:22,109
Let me do that. Take it.

607
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:34,728
Hold on. The carriage is over there.

608
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,810
 (3:00 to 5:00 p.m, market.) 

609
00:39:48,049 --> 00:39:51,070
 What happened between them? 

610
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,610
   

611
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:59,750
Just now someone reported that His Highness the Crown Prince came to Luoyang

612
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,289
to inspect the victims affected by the spring drought.

613
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:06,009
There's a lot of trouble in the city.

614
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:07,890
Considering the chaos,

615
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:11,210
I hope that all of you can put aside personal contradictions

616
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,550
and work together.

617
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,810
Elder Qin, we don't need to rely on others.

618
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,050
We can find Young Master on our own.

619
00:40:20,529 --> 00:40:23,310
But why haven't we found Li Changge?

620
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:26,990
Well, the situation in Luoyang is not clear.

621
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:31,230
The sooner we find her, the more reassured we are.

622
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:36,709
Now that we work together, don't always quarrel.

623
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:39,208
Cooperation? I don't want to work with him!

624
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:41,690
I don't know what he is thinking about.

625
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,369
Do you want to fight against me?

626
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,109
Okay.

627
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:48,809
I think all of us have put up with you for a long time.

628
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:53,129
If Elder Qin hadn't stopped me, I would have beat you up!

629
00:40:56,809 --> 00:40:59,989
Okay. Have a try.

630
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:09,149
I'm old.

631
00:41:09,149 --> 00:41:12,349
If the young men want to fight, go outside.

632
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:14,809
Don't tear down the house.

633
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:16,469
Go!

634
00:41:16,469 --> 00:41:18,310
Upstairs!

635
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:22,889
The view upstairs is good.

636
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,430
On the battlefield, I won in an open and aboveboard manner.

637
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,130
If you're not convinced,

638
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,750
defeat me now.

639
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,329
Close the door!

640
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,730
These young men!

641
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,230
I asked them to fight outside.

642
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:16,970
We should compensate the owner here tomorrow.

643
00:42:50,449 --> 00:42:53,610
If you had told them just now, they wouldn't have gotten into a fight.

644
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:58,470
For young people, everything can be settled by a fight.

645
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:01,448
If he can't settle down such a little matter,

646
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:04,769
he can't be a dependable man.

647
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,020
   

648
00:43:18,289 --> 00:43:21,589
This guy is really strong.

649
00:43:22,209 --> 00:43:24,100
Brothers! Go on!

650
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,470
- He's going to the limit! 
 - I'm willing to admit defeat.

651
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:28,169
You win!

652
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:39,110


653
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:44,130
♫  The heart gradually responds,  ♫

654
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:46,410
♫  gradually revives,  ♫

655
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:49,930
♫  gradually swims towards you  ♫

656
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:54,180
♫  Before bidding farewell,  ♫

657
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:58,810
♫  we expect an encounter  ♫

658
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:02,690
♫  As your silhouette weaves  ♫

659
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:08,020
♫  and locks in my nostalgic dream  ♫

660
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,619
♫  Before the daybreak,  ♫

661
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:13,109
♫  through the obsession of love,  ♫

662
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:16,939
♫  the yearning flowing through thoughts  ♫

663
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,309
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

664
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:26,210
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

665
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:29,650
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

666
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:36,269
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

667
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:38,659
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

668
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:40,939
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

669
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:45,509
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

670
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:48,269
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

671
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,309
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

672
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:56,980
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

673
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:04,589
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

674
00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:10,420
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

675
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:13,829
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

676
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:20,440
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

677
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,699
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

678
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:25,170
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

679
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:29,750
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

680
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:32,419
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

681
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:34,419
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

682
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:41,430
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

683
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:50,700
♫  It is sleepless  ♫

684
00:45:57,990 --> 00:46:03,130
