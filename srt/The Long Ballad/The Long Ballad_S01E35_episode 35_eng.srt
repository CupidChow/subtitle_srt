00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,900
♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,960
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,030
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,770
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:24,950
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,719
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

7
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,789
♫   Tears and regrets go hand in hand   ♫

8
00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:34,789
♫  But my heart is still fiery-hot  ♫

9
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:37,739
♫  To the distance  ♫

10
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,709
♫  The miserable past is like a dagger  ♫

11
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:43,519
♫  Though my wings are broken  ♫

12
00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:51,240
♫  I will keep flying  ♫

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,199
♫  Following the direction of the light  ♫

14
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:58,259
♫  I'll forget you  ♫

15
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:04,380
♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

16
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,359
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

17
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,309
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,269
♫  The river of life is under my feet  ♫

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,700
♫  I don't regret my craziness  ♫

20
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:25,730


21
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:32,300
    

22
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,080
   

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,019
You met Changge in Luoyang?

24
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,760
Relax.

25
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,539
I don't want to blame her.

26
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,418
You're willing to pardon Changge?

27
00:01:56,418 --> 00:01:59,039
It isn't my willingness to pardon her,

28
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:04,019
it's Changge's willingness to be pardoned by me.

29
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,119
Maybe, she'll undo the knot in her mind someday.

30
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,199
Forget about it.

31
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,478
Have a look.

32
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,779
These are the dishes you like the most.

33
00:02:19,779 --> 00:02:21,479
Eat more.

34
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:24,440
Look how thin you've become now.

35
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,479
Why don't you eat?

36
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,339
Forgive me, Father.

37
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:33,220
I just...

38
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,479
When I see these delicious dishes,

39
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:38,580
I think of a friend of mine.

40
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,140
His biggest wish was to feast on white rice.

41
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,739
But he never got his wish before he died.

42
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,039
Because at that time,

43
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:53,479
the only food I could give him was a hard and dry pancake.

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,719
You've experienced starvation before?

45
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:57,520
Yes.

46
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,080
And I saw many people starve.

47
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,878
I needed to use my hard work

48
00:03:01,878 --> 00:03:03,999
to earn food outside the palace.

49
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:05,980
Food doesn't come easy.

50
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,100
When I suddenly saw so many delicious dishes on the table,

51
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,900
I still haven't gotten used to it now.

52
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,459
Father, if I hadn't been stranded that time,

53
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:18,100
I wouldn't have known so many difficulties in the world.

54
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:22,459
It's more difficult than what is written on the official notices.

55
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:25,200
You suffered a lot.

56
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,139
I thought you would cry bitterly according to your original personality.

57
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:37,219
I didn't imagine what you remembered was others' difficulties.

58
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:40,559
Yueyan, tell me what you need.

59
00:03:40,559 --> 00:03:43,560
I'll compensate you.

60
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:51,020
I hope people in Great Tang won't starve in the future.

61
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,719
All right.

62
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,259
I promise you.

63
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:58,220
I'll definitely fulfill my promise.

64
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,279
Thank you, Father.

65
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:02,219
All right, all right. Let's not talk about this.

66
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:05,659
Here. Let's have a meal now.

67
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,279
This handkerchief is so old.

68
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:24,500
Why are you still using it?

69
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,218
If it's in the past,

70
00:04:26,218 --> 00:04:30,900
I would change it into a brand new handkerchief without your reminder.

71
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,919
Because in the past,

72
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:36,179
I had nothing to worry about and didn't know how to treasure.

73
00:04:36,179 --> 00:04:38,219
But now I know

74
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:41,260
that the wealth of the royal family depends on the support of the people.

75
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,660
Whether it is dishes on the table,

76
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,979
or the handkerchief in my hand,

77
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:51,140
everything we enjoy comes from people's expectations and hard work.

78
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,679
We can't let them down.

79
00:04:53,679 --> 00:04:57,959
Yueyan, you have grown up.

80
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,678
Although I didn't see it in person,

81
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,980
from what you said and thought,

82
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,580
I can feel you went through a lot on the way.

83
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,319
Father, I met many good people on the way.

84
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,758
When I was in Yun State,

85
00:05:13,758 --> 00:05:17,119
Miss Chai, from the weaving workshop, saved me

86
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:19,438
and taught me a way of living.

87
00:05:19,438 --> 00:05:23,459
If she hadn't taken me in and taught me some skills,

88
00:05:23,459 --> 00:05:25,620
I'm afraid I wouldn't have been able to come back.

89
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,519
Father, I want to ask for a reward for Miss Chai.

90
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,819
What is it?

91
00:05:30,819 --> 00:05:32,759
Father, have a look.

92
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,319
This is the cloth weaved by ladies in the weaving workshop.

93
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,378
Whether the skill or the pattern, it's no worse than the cloth in the palace.

94
00:05:39,378 --> 00:05:42,138
They just live in remote areas and lack a base.

95
00:05:42,138 --> 00:05:44,338
And they don't have a chance to be famous.

96
00:05:44,338 --> 00:05:48,499
So, Father, can you help them?

97
00:05:50,559 --> 00:05:52,640
It's good, indeed.

98
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,340
Just do as you said.

99
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:01,398
I didn't imagine the girl who was shy and didn't dare to talk aloud

100
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:03,740
could recommend talents to me now.

101
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,759
I also sold cloth on the street.

102
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,038
And I did a good job.

103
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:09,700
Miss Chai praised me a lot.

104
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:16,099
Yueyan, you really suffered a lot.

105
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:20,439
Miss Chai taught me independence.

106
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:23,779
Even if life is hard, we can't give up.

107
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:26,400
I earned a living with my own hands.

108
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,100
I didn't feel like it was suffering.

109
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:31,778
I want to ask for another reward.

110
00:06:31,778 --> 00:06:33,779
Just say it.

111
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,919
Please let me leave the palace,

112
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,500
go into the field and get close to the people.

113
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,679
All right.

114
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:54,959
But you need to pick some trustworthy guards.

115
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:57,460
Don't let them lose you again.

116
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,220
Relax, Father.

117
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,779
I won't get lost this time.

118
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,700
I underestimated you before.

119
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,559
Uncle Lei, General Sun asked me to meet Khan.

120
00:07:27,559 --> 00:07:28,779
What do you want to do?

121
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:32,079
Well... General asked me to meet Khan in person.

122
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:34,020
Please don't make it difficult for me.

123
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,219
Of course, I'll let you in.

124
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:39,400
But Khan is not here now.

125
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,480
He's with Khatun.

126
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,279
Please follow me.

127
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,779
Uncle Lei, please tell Khan I'm here.

128
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:08,440
No need.

129
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,079
Great Khan is in the tent.

130
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,919
Just go in yourself.

131
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:14,660
Right.

132
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,399
What's wrong?

133
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,900
Nothing.

134
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:30,080
Eagle Division wants to meet Khan.

135
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,640
Great Khan.

136
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:16,339
Can Ashile Sun read minds?

137
00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:19,420
He knows Khan has been talking about him recently.

138
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,778
So he sent someone to resume their bond as father and son.

139
00:09:22,778 --> 00:09:25,300
Our spy said there's a plague in Eagle Division.

140
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,358
So he was required to ask for medicine here.

141
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:31,359
He asked for death himself.

142
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:33,099
Bury him.

143
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:34,759
Yes, Madam.

144
00:09:40,059 --> 00:09:41,759
Wait.

145
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,200
There's something in his pocket.

146
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,040
   

147
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:03,579
Ashile Sun is suspecting Dingxiang now.

148
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:06,299
How many people of Chini are still in Luoyang?

149
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:08,820
Du Ruhui killed them all.

150
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,420
Jinse also died.

151
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:14,440
Jinse...

152
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,390
What a pity.

153
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:23,460
It seems it's hard to deal with people around Li Shimin.

154
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:28,659
If you trust me, I'm willing to lead Chini.

155
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:32,100
I'll do anything I can to realize your goal.

156
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,540
Can I still trust your loyalty?

157
00:10:40,359 --> 00:10:42,719
You saved my life.

158
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:44,400
Please relax, Princess.

159
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,400
I won't disappoint you.

160
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,800
All right. Don't let me down.

161
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,759
Yes.

162
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:58,678
We can't depend on Yanli now.

163
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:01,259
Chini suffered a heavy loss.

164
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:05,060
Eagle Division will find it out soon.

165
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,478
We can't delay our plan anymore.

166
00:11:06,479 --> 00:11:09,239
What do you mean?

167
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:12,080
We've been laying low for half of our lives.

168
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,640
Success or failure hinges on this one action.

169
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,119
Keep guard. Don't let people with no duty come in.

170
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,660
Yes.

171
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,879
Khan.

172
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,139
Why are you here again?

173
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:48,220
I heard you have a headache again.

174
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:53,140
I'm here to help you relieve it.

175
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,160
Useless idiots.

176
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,440
Any message from Sun?

177
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,719
I asked about it for you.

178
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:10,879
No message from him.

179
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:16,059
Well, Sun hasn't come to see me for a long time.

180
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:21,340
It seems he doesn't regard me as his father now.

181
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,120
I'm sorry to say so, but General Sun left Khan's tent.

182
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,219
He's like a wild horse without reins.

183
00:12:28,219 --> 00:12:30,658
I'm afraid he won't come back.

184
00:12:30,658 --> 00:12:32,359
Shut up!

185
00:12:32,359 --> 00:12:35,379
You have no right to criticize my son!

186
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,600
Khan, I know some traditional medical skills.

187
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,899
So I made this herb soup. Drink it while it's still warm.

188
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:55,299
You'll feel better.

189
00:12:55,299 --> 00:12:57,400
Take it away.

190
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,320
While you're ill, I will take care of you.

191
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,038
I look through medical books day and night.

192
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:06,860
Finally, I found this prescription.

193
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,380
It requires the blood of your closest relative as a guiding drug.

194
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:14,699
I'm willing to have a try.

195
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,060
Luckily,

196
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:24,500
you're willing to cure me.

197
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,220
Khan, please drink the medicine.

198
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:51,379
After you have had the medicine, lie down and have some rest.

199
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,100
Lei Meng.

200
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,880
Princess.

201
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,259
Tell Eagle Division, Ya Luo looked down upon the imperial court and Khan.

202
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,979
Now we've arrested him as a warning.

203
00:14:46,979 --> 00:14:52,180
Princess, why don't we just send Ya Luo's head to Ashile Sun,

204
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,260
so that we can take the edge off him?

205
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,340
No, we can't.

206
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:59,099
The reason why Ashile Sun would be the leader of the Eagle Division

207
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:01,819
is not only his ability and courage.

208
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:05,359
The most important reason is his brotherhood to his soldiers.

209
00:15:05,359 --> 00:15:08,259
So he won their hearts.

210
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:12,560
We can't let Ashile Sun know Ya Luo's death now.

211
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,159
Otherwise, he'll rush to Khan's tent.

212
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:18,980
Then all our previous work will have been wasted.

213
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,380
I still need some time to realize my goal.

214
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,619
Is Ashile Sun that horrible?

215
00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:28,818
All divisions in Ashile Tribe can't wipe out Eagle Division?

216
00:15:28,818 --> 00:15:32,700
It's not your turn to teach me how to deal with business!

217
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,559
Why did I lie low for half of my life?

218
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,980
You did it for Young Khan.

219
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:42,460
If it's not because I want Sher to be the king of the tribe,

220
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,239
why would I suffer such humiliation?

221
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:53,239
Ashile Sun is the biggest barrier for She'er to become the king.

222
00:15:53,239 --> 00:15:55,480
I want him to die every day.

223
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,439
I'm waiting for a chance every day.

224
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:03,979
But I know he is important in Yanli's mind.

225
00:16:03,979 --> 00:16:05,459
Who the hell is he?

226
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,159
How dare he contend with my son!

227
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,060
Yes. I understand now.

228
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:17,478
If Young Khan knows what you have done for him, he must feel moved.

229
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:20,680
He doesn't need to understand me.

230
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:28,190
I only want my son to become the king smoothly.

231
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:31,839
I hope he won't suffer the pain as I did.

232
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:41,379
Khatun.

233
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,140
General Lei.

234
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,119
I'm here to report business to Great Khan.

235
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,840
Khatun, Great Khan's headache is becoming more and more serious.

236
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,158
Grand Witch in Khan's tent doesn't know what to do now.

237
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:57,539
Do you have any solution, Khatun?

238
00:16:57,539 --> 00:17:01,799
I made herb soup with a traditional prescription for Khan.

239
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:04,640
He drank it and fell asleep.

240
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,578
Don't bother him now.

241
00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:09,359
That's great. Thank you, Khatun.

242
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,538
Relax, Khatun. I'll stay here and no one shall bother him.

243
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:36,360
Shixin Sili will be a trouble for us in the future.

244
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,620
I understand.

245
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:43,498
Besides, from now on, change all guards around Khan's tent to our soldiers.

246
00:17:43,498 --> 00:17:45,159
Yes, Madam.

247
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,760
I didn't expect Father would send you to protect me.

248
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,959
Why are you standing there?

249
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,500
Hao Du! Why are you standing so far away?

250
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,260
I'm afraid you don't want to see me.

251
00:19:38,199 --> 00:19:40,160
Then, why did you come?

252
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,290
I can't violate His Majesty's order.

253
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,160
If I'm not happy, will you leave?

254
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:51,259
Hao Du! When did you become so obedient?

255
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,339
Hao Du, I said stop!

256
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:24,879
I'm afraid you'll be angry, but I don't know what to do.

257
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:27,079
All I do is wrong. All I do won't make you happy.

258
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,699
I can only watch you from a distance.

259
00:20:28,699 --> 00:20:31,039
As long as you're safe,

260
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:34,760
I have nothing to worry about.

261
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,360
Wait.

262
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:48,799
I have something to tell you.

263
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,760
Turn around.

264
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,339
I won't eat you.

265
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:01,599
In Liuyun Temple, did you let Changge go on purpose?

266
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:07,299
I don't know.

267
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:11,339
You don't know whether you let Changge go or not?

268
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:13,479
In all, I've killed all the rebels.

269
00:21:13,479 --> 00:21:17,560
So the people you didn't kill are not rebels?

270
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:22,400
People who harm Great Tang are the rebels.

271
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:26,640
Thank you.

272
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,278
It's my duty to protect Great Tang. You don't need to thank me.

273
00:21:33,139 --> 00:21:37,039
Okay. I've gotten the answer.

274
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:42,140
Then... do I have to keep my distance from you?

275
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,839
Of course. I'm a princess.

276
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:49,079
You must protect me well.

277
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,680
All right.

278
00:22:08,579 --> 00:22:10,379
General!

279
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,879
Any news from Ya Luo?

280
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:16,799
It's not Ya Luo, it's Uncle Lei.

281
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,660
What are you doing here?

282
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,260
You chose to leave Khan's tent.

283
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,159
Why are you asking for medicine from Khan's tent now?

284
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:38,880
Great Khan's order, Eagle Division is cursed.

285
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,940
You shall not implicate Khan's tent.

286
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,519
Your soldier acted aggressively in Khan's tent.

287
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,620
Ashile Sun, do you still regard Great Khan as the king?

288
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:48,759
Where's Ya Luo?

289
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,560
He was arrested.

290
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,480
Not killing him is the last mercy Great Khan has for you.

291
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,578
And there's not much gromwell in Khan's tent.

292
00:22:57,578 --> 00:22:59,600
Stop trying to ask for that.

293
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,960
Just face your fate.

294
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:15,479
General, let me lead a troop into Khan's tent and save Ya Luo.

295
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:17,780
Ya Luo is the brother we grew up with.

296
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,399
You know the prison in Khan's tent.

297
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,559
People will suffer a lot once they are put in there.

298
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,959
Besides, Ya Luo is weak now. He can't take it.

299
00:23:23,959 --> 00:23:26,060
- I'm afraid soon he'll— 
 - No.

300
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,699
If we go into Khan's tent now,

301
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,550
I'm afraid we'll fall into their trap.

302
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:31,759
At the time, Eagle Division will be in a more difficult situation.

303
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,478
Then, what about Ya Luo's life?

304
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:37,079
Su Yishe, Changge is right.

305
00:23:37,719 --> 00:23:39,598
If we break into Khan's tent and save him now,

306
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,139
what about Mu Jin and the other brothers?

307
00:23:42,139 --> 00:23:44,439
The gromwell in Khan's tent can't be inadequate.

308
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,060
If we really go to Khan's tent,

309
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,739
they'll know our weakness.

310
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,860
- Then— 
 - I won't give up on Ya Luo.

311
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,380
But now, letting him stay in prison is the best choice.

312
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,780
What do we do now?

313
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,780
 Of course, you should find the gromwell. 

314
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:07,120
Have you all been kicked in the brain by donkeys?

315
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,679
No matter what happened in Khan's tent,

316
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,459
no matter what conflicts you have in Ashile Tribe,

317
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:14,020
time is limited now.

318
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:19,180
Nothing is more important than finding the gromwell to save people.

319
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,219
You're right.

320
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:23,500
It's urgent to find the gromwell now.

321
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,659
Let's put off all the other things.

322
00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:29,220
Everything has to be prioritized.

323
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,458
Okay. Gather all our forces to find gromwell.

324
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:33,920
As for Ya Luo,

325
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,079
I believe Father won't kill him due to our relationship as father and son.

326
00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:40,300
Yes.

327
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,219
I'll listen to your order.

328
00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:44,018
Good. Follow me.

329
00:24:44,018 --> 00:24:47,579
Take some herb to Mu Jin.

330
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,820
Gromwell was originated in Mobei.

331
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,179
I'll lead brothers of Yanxing Sect to set out at night.

332
00:24:57,179 --> 00:24:59,019
We'll arrive in Mobei in three days.

333
00:24:59,019 --> 00:25:01,779
Mobei is remote. Even I haven't been there.

334
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:03,560
How could you go there?

335
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,958
Elder Qin has led Yanxing Sect to many places.

336
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,699
I think he is experienced.

337
00:25:07,699 --> 00:25:09,519
I'll let Situ Langlang take care of Yuan.

338
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,380
Yanxing Sect will follow me.

339
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,519
But...

340
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,220
You don't trust me?

341
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,019
Mu Jin has fallen ill,

342
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:18,139
I can't put you in danger now.

343
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,560
I chose to come here.

344
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,140
Eagle Division is also my home.

345
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,479
To risk my life for you, I'm willing to do so.

346
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,839
And now, we have no other solution.

347
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,320
Changge!

348
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,900
Mimi?

349
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,398
I remember you were taking care of Mu Jin. Why are you here?

350
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:46,919
I've told you I come from Mobei.

351
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,120
You heard it?

352
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,759
Take me there.

353
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,540
I grew up in Mobei when I was young.

354
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:55,060
I know the way to Mobei and I know gromwell.

355
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,360
I have a bigger chance to find gromwell than you.

356
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,300
And only if we can find it as soon as possible,

357
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,939
Mu Jin and the rest of them won't die.

358
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:10,060
General, because of me, Eagle Division has this plague.

359
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:13,499
Please give me a chance to atone, General.

360
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:17,659
Sun, let Mimi go with me.

361
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:24,619
All right.

362
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:37,900
Hao Du, thank you for walking with me all day.

363
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,959
It's my duty.

364
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,620
Eat slowly.

365
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,579
Hao Du.

366
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:52,419
I'm here.

367
00:26:54,439 --> 00:26:56,039
Forget it.

368
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,760
Nothing.

369
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,660
His Majesty asked me to protect you.

370
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,220
If you have anything in mind, just tell me.

371
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:09,639
If...

372
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:14,160
you have liked someone for a long time

373
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,859
and you know he likes someone else,

374
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,099
will you ask him in person?

375
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:28,019
I think I'll ask her in person.

376
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:32,420
- But... 
 - It's okay if she refuses me.

377
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,820
I know what I'm thinking.

378
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,580
If I don't ask her in person,

379
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,780
I won't give up easily.

380
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,739
You're right.

381
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,780
If I don't ask him in person,

382
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,979
it means I betray my heart.

383
00:28:00,699 --> 00:28:02,738
- Princess. 
 - But...

384
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,879
I think I've become brave enough.

385
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,958
But when I think of telling him in person,

386
00:28:08,959 --> 00:28:11,999
I don't have the courage to ask him out,

387
00:28:12,739 --> 00:28:15,039
not to mention telling him.

388
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:24,219
Hao Du, what did you want to say just now?

389
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,100
Nothing.

390
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,760
Let's go back, Princess.

391
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,260
 Here, have some water. 

392
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,500
 Right. 

393
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,380
Mu Jin.

394
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:02,100
I'll leave for a few days.

395
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,979
Promise me.

396
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,820
You'll stay alive.

397
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:11,979
I promise you I'll bring gromwell back.

398
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,560
So...

399
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,660
So...

400
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:30,459
You must stay alive until I'm back. Understand?

401
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,180
You must stay alive,

402
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,739
otherwise...

403
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:43,419
- Elder Qin. 
 - Young Master.

404
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:47,780
I've told Xu Feng and Shiba that we're going to Mobei.

405
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,620
They're waiting to gather with us in front.

406
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,460
As for Yuan,

407
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:56,779
Sun, Mr. Situ, and brothers in Yanxing Sect will take care of her.

408
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:58,780
Relax, Young Master.

409
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:00,260
Okay.

410
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,318
- Let's go now. 
 - All right.

411
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:19,400
♫  As your silhouette weaves  ♫

412
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:24,680
♫  and locks in my nostalgic dream  ♫

413
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,820
♫  Before the daybreak, through the obsession of love  ♫

414
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:33,580
♫  the yearning flowing through thoughts  ♫

415
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:37,100
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

416
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:42,920
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

417
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,400
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

418
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:53,040
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

419
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,679
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

420
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,840
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

421
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,600
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

422
00:32:11,487 --> 00:32:13,387
♫  It is sleepless  ♫

423
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,800
Brother Shuyu, why are you here?

424
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,140
Hao Du told me about it.

425
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,559
You had gotten tired after you went into the fields and talked with the people recently.

426
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,138
What can I do to help you? Just tell me.

427
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,279
Great. Let's go together.

428
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,780
Let's go.

429
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,159
I wonder when the rain will stop.

430
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,920
It's all right. I believe it'll be sunny since you're with me.

431
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,880
Stop there!

432
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:36,499
Brother Shuyu, thank you for your company today.

433
00:33:36,499 --> 00:33:39,799
Yueyan, I think you've changed a little.

434
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:43,710
Tell me what's changed about me.

435
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,958
I'm not sure.

436
00:33:44,959 --> 00:33:47,580
I think you have become braver.

437
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:50,880
Actually, I'm not brave at all.

438
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:58,580
But today, I want to be brave this time.

439
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:16,080
Brother Shuyu,

440
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:20,039
since the day we met in Luoyang,

441
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:22,800
I wanted to ask you a question.

442
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,859
But I didn't know how to ask.

443
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:29,039
It's okay, just ask.

444
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,900
Do you still like Changge?

445
00:34:39,479 --> 00:34:43,139
Changge and I have separated long before.

446
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:45,580
We're not friends anymore.

447
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,599
I should have understood it

448
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,840
when she left Chang'an.

449
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,938
I like you. I like you. I like you. I like you.

450
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,399
 Like you. 

451
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,019
 Like you. 

452
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,710
♫  I have all I had  ♫

453
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:12,020
♫  But I'm heartbroken now  ♫

454
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:15,859
♫  How liberal do I have to be  ♫

455
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:19,158
♫  to proceed without hesitation?  ♫

456
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:21,599
Brother Shuyu,

457
00:35:23,299 --> 00:35:26,136
can I be your companion from now on?

458
00:35:26,136 --> 00:35:29,039
♫  I love her at first sight  ♫

459
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,620
♫  And I will love her for the rest of my life  ♫

460
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:41,880
♫  What is love? People can't avoid it  ♫

461
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,819
You didn't refuse me.

462
00:35:45,819 --> 00:35:47,819
Well, I...

463
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:56,600
♫  As long as you're happy  ♫

464
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:31,039
Taoist.

465
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,960
- Staying up late will harm the liver. 
 - You're right.

466
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,220
What are you thinking?

467
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,520
I'm calculating the time.

468
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,819
Changge...

469
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:53,059
Changge should arrive in Mobei tomorrow.

470
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,678
Bad news.

471
00:36:55,679 --> 00:37:00,020
I'm afraid you have an illness now.

472
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,099
What's that?

473
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:06,620
Of course, it's lovesickness.

474
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,600
 It's interesting. 

475
00:37:24,279 --> 00:37:26,558
Changge, your idea is good.

476
00:37:26,558 --> 00:37:30,019
We went into the town in batches, so the guards wouldn't find it out.

477
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:32,299
Actually, I thought there were so many of us.

478
00:37:32,299 --> 00:37:34,140
And most of us are from Central Plains.

479
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,559
I was afraid the guards would stop us.

480
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,878
It'll be strict when we enter the town.

481
00:37:37,879 --> 00:37:40,460
After we entered the town, there won't be a problem.

482
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,140
Besides, we're acting separately.

483
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,460
It'll be quicker.

484
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,918
Nice bottles!

485
00:37:46,919 --> 00:37:49,319
Here, take it.

486
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:52,860
Mimi, is Mobei always this crowded?

487
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,559
Why is it like a holiday?

488
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:56,058
It's Qihan Festival.

489
00:37:56,058 --> 00:38:00,339
People in Mobei will use gromwell to drive the god of plague and illness away.

490
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:04,859
So there must be gromwell in the medicine shop in Mobei now.

491
00:38:05,639 --> 00:38:08,120
Hurry up! Come on!

492
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,940
What happened?

493
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,220
Come here.

494
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,579
 Come on! 

495
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:14,678
 Hurry up! 

496
00:38:14,679 --> 00:38:15,759
 Go! 

497
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:17,660
 Come here! 

498
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,538
 Come on! 

499
00:38:18,538 --> 00:38:19,559
 Hurry up! 

500
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,958
 Honey! 

501
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:21,878
 What are you doing? 

502
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:23,479
 Honey! 

503
00:38:23,479 --> 00:38:25,360
- Don't look at us! 
 - Go!

504
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,898
- Honey! 
  - Go! 

505
00:38:26,898 --> 00:38:28,960
Why are they conscripting soldiers now?

506
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,438
And they're from Ashile Tribe.

507
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:31,559
 Go! 

508
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,280
 Come on! 

509
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,180
 Just go! 

510
00:38:37,519 --> 00:38:40,919
Mimi, you haven't been back for ten years.

511
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:44,439
Is the city the same as what it was in your memory?

512
00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:48,039
When I left here, there weren't so many people.

513
00:38:48,819 --> 00:38:52,250
I didn't imagine it would become so prosperous now.

514
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,220
It's just...

515
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:57,039
I heard that the King of Mobei is a talented person.

516
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:01,019
Within ten years, he turned Mobei into a business fortress.

517
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:03,958
Now I see it with my own eyes. He really is capable.

518
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:08,059
With a king like him, Mobei won't be bullied again. Right?

519
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:10,559
I hope so.

520
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:12,319
 Have a look. 

521
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:14,439
Let's go and buy gromwell.

522
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,778
Come on! Have a look, everyone!

523
00:39:17,778 --> 00:39:19,599
Look carefully!

524
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,718
An empty bottle.

525
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:21,839
Excuse me.

526
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,180
Have a look, it's empty.

527
00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:28,920
Three, two, one.

528
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,460
 Good! 

529
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,158
Brilliant! It's beautiful.

530
00:39:32,158 --> 00:39:34,718
If you like it, I'll give it to you.

531
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:36,158
 Good! 

532
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:37,299
Give it to me?

533
00:39:37,299 --> 00:39:38,979
Then you don't have one now.

534
00:39:38,979 --> 00:39:41,079
It's easy.

535
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:44,438
 Good! 

536
00:39:44,439 --> 00:39:46,059
- Bravo! 
  - Brilliant! 

537
00:39:46,059 --> 00:39:48,199
Here. Thank you.

538
00:39:48,199 --> 00:39:51,319
Thanks. Thanks.

539
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,940
 Come on! 

540
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,659
Elder Qin, how is it?

541
00:39:57,659 --> 00:39:58,918
I've asked about it.

542
00:39:58,919 --> 00:40:01,279
People said Mobei Imperial Court

543
00:40:01,279 --> 00:40:03,239
prohibited the transaction of gromwell a few days ago.

544
00:40:03,239 --> 00:40:06,639
There is no gromwell in every medicine shop now.

545
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:12,919
It seems it's impossible to get all the gromwell that Eagle Division needs.

546
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:18,838
If we ask for it in the people's residences, it will be more difficult.

547
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:20,959
And we'll alert them.

548
00:40:20,959 --> 00:40:25,760
It'll be bad if we let King of Mobei know we're here.

549
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,220
It's a trap.

550
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,719
They must be doing it on purpose.

551
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:35,619
Khan's tent.

552
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,050
Khan's tent asked them to do it.

553
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,159
Elder Qin, do we have other solutions?

554
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:48,378
I think, even in the clearest place,

555
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:50,319
there'll be a dirty corner.

556
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,359
As long as we're willing to offer a high price,

557
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:54,680
someone will risk their lives to get gromwell for us.

558
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:57,038
Elder Qin, please ask about it.

559
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,478
No matter what they want, I'll agree.

560
00:40:59,479 --> 00:41:01,839
Okay, I'll do it right now.

561
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,838
Wait, Elder Qin. There's another thing.

562
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:08,220
I just saw people from Ashile Tribe conscripting new soldiers here.

563
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,379
Maybe we should let His Majesty know about it.

564
00:41:11,379 --> 00:41:12,759
Relax, Young Master.

565
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,779
I'll tell them about it.

566
00:41:15,779 --> 00:41:17,679
Thank you, Elder Qin.

567
00:41:18,919 --> 00:41:20,738
Follow me, all of you.

568
00:41:20,738 --> 00:41:22,439
 Yes! 

569
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:26,659
Changge...

570
00:41:26,659 --> 00:41:27,779
Relax.

571
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:29,720
Elder Qin and the people of the Yanxing Sect are here.

572
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,999
It's easy to ask about some messages.

573
00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:34,320
Let's have a rest nearby.

574
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,999
Let's go.

575
00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:43,739
Thank you.

576
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:46,718
Young Master, why did you let Shiba look for a place to rest alone?

577
00:41:46,718 --> 00:41:48,019
Why can't I go?

578
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:49,859
Shiba is low-key.

579
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:52,499
Do you mean I often show off?

580
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,679
That's what you said.

581
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:04,158
Boss! Toast more pancakes for me and pack them up.

582
00:42:04,158 --> 00:42:05,359
Please wait.

583
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,418
- There're more, isn't it enough for you? 
  - Toast some more pancakes. 

584
00:42:07,418 --> 00:42:09,839
Well, Shiba didn't eat much just now.

585
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,300
I want to pack some for her, in case she's hungry.

586
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,780
Check the bill!

587
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,479
Coming.

588
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:33,119
Young girl, you had a lot.

589
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:34,799
Will you repudiate the bill?

590
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,999
Of course, I won't.

591
00:42:36,999 --> 00:42:38,419
But I was in a hurry.

592
00:42:38,419 --> 00:42:39,499
So I don't have enough money.

593
00:42:39,499 --> 00:42:41,980
Well, I can leave you a writing pledge.

594
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:43,980
I'll pay the rest of the money a few days later.

595
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:45,338
What do you think?

596
00:42:45,338 --> 00:42:47,498
Young girl, are you kidding me?

597
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:50,419
I'm doing a small business. You can't eat on credit.

598
00:42:50,419 --> 00:42:52,438
I think you should pay me the bill now.

599
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:54,319
I said I would pay you later.

600
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,718
I won't repudiate the bill.

601
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:58,279
I can give you twice as much, three times is also okay.

602
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,038
Young girl, if you don't pay me the bill,

603
00:43:01,038 --> 00:43:04,739
I'll take you to our king now.

604
00:43:04,739 --> 00:43:07,600
Do you really think I have no money to pay you?

605
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,779
This is a handkerchief from the royal family of Central Plains.

606
00:43:10,779 --> 00:43:13,438
Its silk and the embroidery skills are perfect.

607
00:43:13,439 --> 00:43:16,839
This piece is at least worthy of five pearls.

608
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:18,240
Five pearls.

609
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,779
What about using it to pay my bill?

610
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,300
This?

611
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:26,400
This is from the royal family in Central Plains?

612
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,380
Why would I lie to you?

613
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,239
If it were not for I really don't have money to pay you,

614
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:33,360
I won't give you this.

615
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,818
I even didn't ask you to give me some money back.

616
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:39,659
Well, I need to find a person who knows about it.

617
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,200
Sorry to interrupt,

618
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,939
are you from the Central Plains?

619
00:43:46,939 --> 00:43:50,599
Please check this handkerchief for me, Lady.

620
00:43:51,610 --> 00:44:00,800
