23
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,799
Go.

24
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,219
Stop it!

25
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:43,949
Aren't you the new counselor?

26
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,829
What do you want?

27
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,009
You think you can boss us around because General treats you well.

28
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,869
We have our own rules.

29
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,479
Even if it is General, he must obey the rules!

30
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,549
So, you want to meddle in this, too?

31
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,609
How about...

32
00:01:57,609 --> 00:01:59,919
Well. Let's have some drinks.

33
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,809
Leave!

34
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:06,929
Are you deaf?

35
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:08,770
Piss off.

36
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,799
Stay and wait.

37
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,019
- Wait here! 
 - Wait!

38
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,660
I...

39
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,170
Thank you.

40
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,860
Wipe your face a bit, it's a bit dirty.

41
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,110
I'll help you.

42
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,000
You are so beautiful.

43
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,730
Drink some.

44
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,469
I'm Li Shisi.

45
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,170
What's your name?

46
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,269
Mimi Guli.

47
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,719
You look different.

48
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,210
You aren't from the Ashile Tribe?

49
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,680
I am a slave sent to the Ashile Tribe.

50
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,999
I only have clothes for men.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,160
Take them for now.

52
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,270
I'll get changed.

53
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,239
Okay, go ahead.

54
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
I'll wait for you outside.

55
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,560
I'm finished.

56
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,060
What's in your clothes?

57
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,340
I...

58
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,590
I am sorry.

59
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,669
I... I promise I will never steal!

60
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:08,879
I'll never do this again!

61
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,139
Please don't expel me.

62
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,419
I can do a lot of things!

63
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:13,599
You see, I can clean the house,

64
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,649
and I... I can do the laundry and cook.

65
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,389
I can do anything, see!

66
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,670
And I am a fast worker.

67
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,210
Don't steal anything from now on.

68
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,170
I will take care of you.

69
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,030
Have some rest here.

70
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,950
This is my bed.

71
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,999
I'll be off for a while.

72
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:39,550
Don't answer even if someone calls you.

73
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,210
   

74
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,760
Take a thread with the right.

75
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,039
Cross your hands.

76
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,350
Pass from the middle one.

77
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,360
Then take one with the left.

78
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,789
Very good.

79
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,490
Flip it.

80
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,889
You want to play this.

81
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:31,319
Li Yueyan, are you stupid?

82
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,210
Look at the others' work, and tell me what you've done!

83
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,539
You really want to piss me off?

84
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:40,279
I... I just want to unfasten the threads.

85
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,860
If you can't finish, no sleep tonight.

86
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,919
Were you sent by God to ravage and challenge me?

87
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,169
I am so mad. Come on.

88
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:50,060
Anyone, help her!

89
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,109
I am so confused.

90
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,820
You've learned for days, and what have you got?

91
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,400
Who?

92
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,699
What are you doing?

93
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,780
I am doing housework.

94
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,099
You did all these?

95
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:32,859
If you don't like others help you organize your stuff,

96
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:34,709
I won't do it again!

97
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,879
I am sorry.

98
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't throw me out please.

99
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,580
It's her!

100
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,879
Li Shisi, you can't leave this woman here.

101
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,349
What if I insist on keeping her?

102
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,449
Are you going to kill her?

103
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:49,009
It's not necessary.

104
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:50,979
Just throw her out.

105
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:53,069
I beg you. Don't throw me out.

106
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:55,749
If I can't stay here, I will be eaten by wolves.

107
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:57,129
Even if I can manage to escape,

108
00:08:57,129 --> 00:09:00,639
if the Great Khan finds that I'm an escaped slave, I will be killed.

109
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,100
- Please. 
 - You've talked too much nonsense. Go.

110
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,719
No!

111
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,220
You...

112
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,769
Are you a dog?

113
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:11,199
Why did you bite me?

114
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:12,600
You...

115
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,100
Enough.

116
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,390
Sun.

117
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,249
General, could you give me this slave?

118
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,600
You may leave.

119
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,060
According to my rules,

120
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,610
it is bad to have things with ears and a mouth.

121
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,649
Since I am the one who works for General,

122
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:48,759
I will manage my people properly.

123
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,460
You don't trust me?

124
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,279
I'm leaving.

125
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,930
I... I was bitten for nothing.

126
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,339
Are you well?

127
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:11,100
Did you catch a cold?

128
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,709
How about I get you some kumis? 
  (T/N: a fermented dairy product traditionally made from mare's milk) 

129
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,760
Just a second.

130
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,920
Sun.

131
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,539
Though you agreed on Li Shisi to be your counselor,

132
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:30,310
you shouldn't trust him unconditionally.

133
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,779
- Why? 
 - We don't really know him.

134
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:33,809
I do know Shisi.

135
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:36,419
- And he isn't from our region. 
 - Shisi is now.

136
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:39,340
But the people from the Central Plains are full of tricks.

137
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,950
Sun, I don't mean it.

138
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,549
Are you all right?

139
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,839
I'm fine.

140
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,759
Let's have some warm soup.

141
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,640
It's good for health.

142
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,670
Why is the soup only for me?

143
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,469
How about yours?

144
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,489
I'm not hungry yet. Have it now.

145
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,109
You go first.

146
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,879
I don't have an appetite.

147
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,379
When you finish it, get some sleep.

148
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:25,840
The bed is small, just put up with it.

149
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,999
Don't worry.

150
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,209
I'll sleep on the ground.

151
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:33,109
You should go to bed early.

152
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,370
It's good for your recovery.

153
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,330
Whatever.

154
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,210
But you don't have to be alert.

155
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,240
I won't hurt you.

156
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,439
Mother, don't leave me. Mother!

157
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,809
Mother. Mother.

158
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,280
Mother.

159
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,610
Mother.

160
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,490
Mother, please come back.

161
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,860
I'm so cold.

162
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,379
Buzhen, don't move.

163
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:20,980
Buzhen?

164
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,640
Who is Buzhen?

165
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,880
Li Shisi, I'm coming.

166
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,180
Not a good time.

167
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,839
Please wait.

168
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,640
Wait!

169
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,639
Wait!

170
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,759
Stop!

171
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,879
Stop!

172
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,689
Stop! You! I've got something to tell you.

173
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:50,399
I've got things to warn you, too!

174
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,109
Dare you walk around camps again!

175
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,469
Don't go to General Sun's place.

176
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,059
What's wrong with you?

177
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:57,079
Don't come closer.

178
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,789
Are you going to bite me again?

179
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,249
I warn you just to stay there.

180
00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:01,859
Otherwise, I won't be nice.

181
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:03,449
I really have something to tell you.

182
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:06,979
As I am living with Counselor Li, the food isn't enough for us.

183
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,809
You must prepare more for us.

184
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,109
Don't bother me! Go and find your Counselor Li.

185
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:13,139
- Time for a meal! 
 - Right.

186
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,659
- Come on. 
 - Have more to drink.

187
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:16,170
Drink!

188
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,740
Have more, more!

189
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,519
Why are you here?

190
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,839
Counselor Li is ill.

191
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,149
He shared with me the last food we had.

192
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,669
We need something to eat!

193
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,369
For every tent, a food quota is set.

194
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:37,390
You've taken yours.

195
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,339
- No more for you. 
 - Get out of my way.

196
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,680
You...

197
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,080
The mutton will be ready soon.

198
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,990
Have a seat.

199
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:25,009
By the way, do you guys like to use this?

200
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:28,049
I used branches to make a pair.

201
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:30,370
Hope you'll like it.

202
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,049
Do as locals do.

203
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:42,250
I don't use them anymore.

204
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,780
But I like your present.

205
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,190
Thank you.

206
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,009
In return, do you want anything?

207
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:53,610
Me?

208
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,410
Is this Buzhen really from your family?

209
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,200
Do you want to be freed and go back to your family?

210
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,310
My family was invaded by the Ashile Tribe.

211
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,840
People died... or left.

212
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,270
I don't have any family members.

213
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:23,439
So, I'm sincerely grateful for staying with you.

214
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,229
So, the same for you.

215
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,030
The same?

216
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,669
Are your family...?

217
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,630
Yes, they are all dead too.

218
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
They were killed by the enemy.

219
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,639
Let's not talk about the sad memories.

220
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,549
Now that we have met each other, it's true destiny.

221
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,000
From now on, I am your family member.

222
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,180
Here!

223
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,080
Take the big one.

224
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,279
I'm so tired.

225
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,709
Almost done?

226
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,229
How about taking a break?

227
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,830
I agree.

228
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,380
So tired.

229
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,599
- Me too. 
 - Are you tired?

230
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:42,569
Don't you know tomorrow is the due day?

231
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:44,329
Have you finished the work?

232
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:47,620
If you can't finish it, just get out of here!

233
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,080
Go back to your work!

234
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,489
Ms. Zhang?

235
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,390
Don't bother me!

236
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,859
Li Yueyan! Did you do it on purpose?

237
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:02,039
Look what you did!

238
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,429
Get out!

239
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:04,399
Get her out of here!

240
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:06,699
Move! Quick!

241
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,999
 - Get out! 
 - You! Get out! 

242
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,589
Kick her out right now!

243
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,560
Out!

244
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,189
Leave here!

245
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,879
 Do you think Li Yueyan is a real fool? 

246
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,949
 - How can she be so silly? 
 - Right, so much trouble. 

247
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,809
Finally, we finished Young Master Hu's order.

248
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:43,940
Let's get some rest.

249
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,710
 My neck hurts. 

250
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,499
 - Why is she here? 
 - Right, why? 

251
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,509
 - Why didn't you leave? 
 - Why? 

252
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:58,249
Ms. Chai, my sincere apology.

253
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,559
Please give me another chance.

254
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,109
Please!

255
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,519
Little Miss Li, you're so determined.

256
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,420
Here, I do need someone like you!

257
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,760
Well.

258
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,229
Is that what you expected me to say?

259
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,899
Just act nice, then be a free-rider?

260
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:25,890
- You're daydreaming! 
 - Right.

261
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,109
Right.

262
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,589
Later, I will meet with Manager Hu.

263
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,999
I'm begging you.

264
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,569
Just leave.

265
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:34,049
We don't have room for you.

266
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,820
Find another place to bother anyone else.

267
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,399
Why are you crying?

268
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,759
Look at them.

269
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,979
They've worked overnight just because of you.

270
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:47,290
They want to cry, too!

271
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,529
 Yes. 

272
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:50,039
Tears can't give you money.

273
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,929
You need to work hard to make a living.

274
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:56,010
If I were your mother, I would have died already.

275
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,329
Leave here now.

276
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:01,779
You'd better find a tree and get hanged.

277
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:04,569
People like you are nothing good for society.

278
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:06,370
Only a waste of food.

279
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,709
 Well. Well. 

280
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,209
 - Is she all right?  
 - Won't she commit suicide?

281
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:20,159
 Who can tell? 

282
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,899
Why are you looking at me?

283
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:25,289
If she has the courage, it's still a good ending for her.

284
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:26,499
She is a useless person.

285
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:28,800
Good for nothing in the world.

286
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,129
All right, girls! Get some sleep.

287
00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:33,699
Right, so tired!

288
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,300
 Let's go. 

289
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,680
 Go to rest. 

290
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,709
Have you heard it?

291
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,610
The slave of the counselor kicked Mu Jin out of anger.

292
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,619
Really?

293
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:48,330
True!

294
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,320
This slave is bold.

295
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,080
Mu Jin is so weak.

296
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,879
She got something.

297
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,999
Poor Mu Jin.

298
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,170
He was humiliated.

299
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,399
Smell good?

300
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,709
Why does it smell so good?

301
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:04,449
My kid likes it a lot!

302
00:21:04,449 --> 00:21:06,749
Mimi Guli, are you going to wash your man's clothes?

303
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:08,519
Yes.

304
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,630
I...

305
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,109
Well, Mimi Guli.

306
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,559
We've heard you kicked Mu Jin.

307
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,799
He is the counselor.

308
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,540
Hope he hasn't bothered you.

309
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,109
Not at all.

310
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,310
I dare him to bother me!

311
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,519
What a relief.

312
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,879
Go to wash.

313
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,130
Yes, right. See you then.

314
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,619
See you. Take your time.

315
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,069
What's wrong with you?

316
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,019
Pick it up.

317
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:54,619
I won't.

318
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:56,879
You and Li Shisi have humiliated me!

319
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,009
Look at you. Now you seem easy and relaxed.

320
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:00,759
It is because you're weak.

321
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,189
Watch your tongue!

322
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,259
Right, you're so weak!

323
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:04,619
It's you.

324
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:06,109
Dare you say it again!

325
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,359
- Who is weak? 
 - You!

326
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,109
You hurt me.

327
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,910
You're a wench.

328
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,809
No, it's you!

329
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:14,679
You!

330
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,759
You're a shrew!

331
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,660
It's you!

332
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,480
You and Li Shisi are evil-minded.

333
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,229
Who?

334
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,639
You two.

335
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,900
How dare you scold Shisi!

336
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,540
You can't kick me.

337
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,140
Too far.

338
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,460
You can't.

339
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,270
Bastard!

340
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,609
Why did my heart beat so fast?

341
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:14,189
Mu Jin, are you a fool?

342
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,469
She is with Li Shisi.

343
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,020
What are you thinking about?

344
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,920
Changge.

345
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,349
It is said that when people get hanged,

346
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,960
their tongues will become so long.

347
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,560
If I find you in your dreams,

348
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,020
will you be scared?

349
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,779
Saying so much bullshit. Are you still going to commit suicide?

350
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,779
By doing this, you can't be hanged.

351
00:24:19,779 --> 00:24:23,800
What you did can only exercise your neck.

352
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,800
My husband, years ago, though he couldn't take care of our family,

353
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,810
hanged himself to end everything.

354
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,699
Is your life so worthless?

355
00:24:37,699 --> 00:24:40,659
Why are you going to kill yourself just as you were told?

356
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:43,259
If you really want to die, nobody can stop you.

357
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:46,589
But if you want to live, nobody can block you as well!

358
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,939
You should rely on yourself. Get it?

359
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,639
Well, well. It's all right.

360
00:25:03,639 --> 00:25:05,680
All right. It's all right.

361
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,109
My words were a bit harsh.

362
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,820
I am sorry.

363
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,330
Thank you, Ms. Chai.

364
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,980
Manager Hu, check out this new pattern.

365
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,030
Come, come here.

366
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,380
Pattern from the West.

367
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,170
- It's really popular. 
 - Right.

368
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,660
Very nice.

369
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,760
Look at it, this embroidery.

370
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,200
There are golden threads.

371
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,000
Look at the stitches. How tight!

372
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,090
Right.

373
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,969
Good.

374
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:10,620
This is your order.

375
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:18,519
I've heard Ms. Chai's blankets were smooth.

376
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:22,229
Why aren't the stitches for my order smooth at all?

377
00:26:22,229 --> 00:26:25,279
We could have done better if you had given us more time.

378
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,229
Would you take it, please?

379
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,330
Right, please.

380
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,399
Well.

381
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,429
Who made this?

382
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:44,119
- This? 
 - Well... I told you not to follow me.

383
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,949
It's her work.

384
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,589
Manager Hu, it's her work.

385
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,050
Right, Miss Li.

386
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,740
Did you make this?

387
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,159
Yes, it's me.

388
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,809
Perfect. How wonderful!

389
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:01,949
I'll take it.

390
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,879
Miss, could you make more?

391
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:06,910
I'll buy all of them.

392
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,230
With a good price!

393
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:12,670
As long as you do, I'll buy the clothes altogether.

394
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,279
This girl is our embroider.

395
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,760
As for this handkerchief, as long as the price is good,

396
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,500
you can have as many as you want.

397
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,889
Deal! You can name the price.

398
00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:26,050
You're great.

399
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,039
Here, take a date.

400
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,330
Take it.

401
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,390
Take two.

402
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,990
Just take them.

403
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,559
Why did General invite me to have a grilled mutton leg tonight?

404
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,240
Your slave had a fight with Mu Jin because of this.

405
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,999
You're also my counselor.

406
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,900
I hope they feel I've treated you fairly.

407
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,310
Have you grilled mutton legs for Mu Jin?

408
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,349
No.

409
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,350
It's my first time.

410
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,430
When I was a kid, my father grilled it with me once.

411
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,020
I was determined to grill my own.

412
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,210
It ended up a great mess. All were burned.

413
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:24,399
Then for the burned part, my dad ate them all.

414
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,709
Later, I learned how to grill.

415
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,589
I didn't want to fail him again.

416
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,900
I didn't expect there was such a story between you and your father.

417
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,559
When I was little, my father still cared about me.

418
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,760
But afterward...

419
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,950
Let's move on.

420
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,709
Tell me about your father.

421
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,830
I have nothing to share.

422
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,270
He was very busy.

423
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,879
I see.

424
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,460
Because he was the crown prince.

425
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,690
It's normal that he was busy.

426
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,879
How did you know?

427
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,429
In You State, you had access to the Governor Mansion,

428
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,950
I knew you were privileged.

429
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,999
Later, I heard they called you Princess Yongning.

430
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,680
Then, I've realized everything.

431
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,410
Since you knew who I was by then, why didn't you reveal my identity?

432
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:20,300
Is it for taking advantage of me?

433
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,500
Right. I used you.

434
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,310
I suffered a lot because of you.

435
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:34,200
I saved you in Chang'an, You State, and Shuo State as well.

436
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,080
Now we are on the grassland.

437
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,970
I am grilling a mutton leg for a slave like you.

438
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,590
I've made full "use" of you.

439
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,030
What?

440
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,290
Did you forget everything?

441
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,990
No.

442
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,180
Take it.

443
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:04,940
♫   Before the daybreak, through the obsession of love,   ♫

444
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,600
Anyway, I'm regarded as dead in Great Tang.

445
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,029
I have nothing to be afraid of.

446
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:14,210
From now on, I'm not Li Shisi.

447
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,810
My name is Li Changge.

448
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,430
I like this name, Changge.

449
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,530
Changge.

450
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,420
Changge.

451
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,159
♫  Which froze everything between you and me  ♫

452
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,399
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

453
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,720
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

454
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,319
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

455
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,119
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

456
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:43,180
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

457
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:48,110
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

458
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,110
 What's she doing? 

459
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,990
 Does it mean she'll commit herself to me? 

460
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,250
It's already late.

461
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,080
I'm at least a man.

462
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,120
Is it appropriate?

463
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,779
Hey.

464
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:10,349
Changge.

465
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:13,139
Changge? What happened?

466
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,630
 Why are they so close late at night? 

467
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,280
Mr. Shisi, what happened to you?

468
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,099
I have no idea.

469
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:40,500
All of a sudden.

470
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,460
Are you sick?

471
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,820
Get some rest.

472
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:51,009
Blood?

473
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,720
Why is he bleeding?

474
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,440
Mimi.

475
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,510
Let me keep you warm.

476
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,120
What happened to him?

477
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
Did he get hurt?

478
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,149
No, don't worry. He's fine.

479
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:08,390
He... He looks awful.

480
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,390
As I said, he's fine.

481
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,209
But he looks like he's dying. He is hurt!

482
00:32:16,209 --> 00:32:17,600
I told you he's fine.

483
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,770
But he's...

484
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,329
What does it mean?

485
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:26,230
Really?

486
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,409
I told you so.

487
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,129
You're treating her differently.

488
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,719
Did you know that she was a woman?

489
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,259
You're not frank or honest anymore.

490
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:36,539
Changge is weak.

491
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:38,310
We need to treat her with a lamb.

492
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,710
Changge?

493
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,019
Her name.

494
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:44,550
So Mr. Shisi's real name is Changge.

495
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:47,170
How many secrets did you hide from me?

496
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,580
Tell me more.

497
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,040
Sun.

498
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,199
I thought you were a man.

499
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:03,360
I've even decided to marry you.

500
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,809
Why are you laughing? Don't laugh.

501
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:09,720
I'm really upset.

502
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,980
Mimi,

503
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,289
you can still be my family member.

504
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:17,430
There's nothing different.

505
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,200
But still, it's different.

506
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,949
How so?

507
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:24,310
I think it's not because you're good at disguise.

508
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:27,449
You really don't treat yourself as a woman.

509
00:33:27,449 --> 00:33:32,129
In this world, men need to fight and protect their domains and women.

510
00:33:32,129 --> 00:33:34,929
Whereas, women are responsible for fertility

511
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,549
and protecting the senior people and the kids.

512
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:41,430
But you use men's ways to fight with them,

513
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:44,380
while using the body of a woman.

514
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,150
What's in your mind?

515
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,910
I have no ideas as well.

516
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,679
What makes a man?

517
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,259
What makes a woman?

518
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:57,310
I've never really thought of it.

519
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,340
My masters are men.

520
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,369
Manage the country by making policies, and protect it by leading armies.

521
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:05,769
They are big figures with great talents.

522
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,369
But what's the difference between me and them?

523
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,639
My father's wife and concubines are women.

524
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,810
They are in the finest dresses and look so gorgeous.

525
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,669
They are considerate and attentive.

526
00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:24,040
But what does it matter to me?

527
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,379
Anyhow, you should rest at home for these days.

528
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:32,810
Don't suffer with them in the wild.

529
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,750
One more thing.

530
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,669
Since you've lied to me, your name can't be Mr. Shisi.

531
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:41,679
My name is Li Changge.

532
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,780
Li Changge.

533
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:52,270
So, did General Sun know this secret already?

534
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,610
Then he's keeping it for you.

535
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:01,340
Did he fall in love with you?

536
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,229
Nonsense.

537
00:35:04,229 --> 00:35:06,539
He thinks I'm useful for him.

538
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:09,610
So he cares about me a little.

539
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,249
How do you feel now?

540
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,750
You'll feel better if you keep the underbelly warm.

541
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,979
What are you waiting for?

542
00:35:33,979 --> 00:35:35,609
Move it!

543
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:38,880
To carry the wool is the easiest task.

544
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,479
Can you do it?

545
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:45,480
Yes, I can.

546
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,669
What are you waiting for? Come and help me!

547
00:36:00,669 --> 00:36:03,109
 - I'm coming. 
 - Be quick. 

548
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:04,809
 Look at the wool. 

549
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:06,699
It gets everywhere. Take it off!

550
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:08,199
 And here. 

551
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,270
 Look at your head. 

552
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,090
 And here. 

553
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,969
 Wool Yan. Wool Yan. Wool Yan. 

554
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:20,379
You got the wool everywhere.

555
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:22,680
Wool Yan, are you really stupid?

556
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,829
I just asked you to carry the wool. Look at what you've done.

557
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:28,090
Ms. Chai, I...

558
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,580
 Look at your hair. 

559
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,799
 Oh my. Seriously. 

560
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,320
Look at you.

561
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:51,149
This fool knows nothing. How can she live like this?

562
00:36:51,149 --> 00:36:52,920
Right.

563
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,869
Thank you!

564
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:58,689
You're my saviors.

565
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:01,039
Thanks to your help, I can make it through.

566
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:02,559
It's the first time I heard that title.

567
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:05,049
She is not referring to you. Think about your poor salary.

568
00:37:05,049 --> 00:37:07,959
- You're not valuable at all. 
 - Not valuable?

569
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:11,399
Our wool fabrics are for the use of the government offices.

570
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:17,050
They might even become the carpets in the palace.

571
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:21,210
You've worked so hard,

572
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:24,819
but they might not cherish every stitch you made.

573
00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:27,370
Nonsense.

574
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,559
Those in the palace don't bother by food and clothes.

575
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:33,960
They won't know how much hard work is behind them.

576
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,999
God is fair.

577
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:39,509
The royal family is supported by the people.

578
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:41,669
They'll get whatever they want.

579
00:37:41,669 --> 00:37:45,579
So, they need to take the responsibility to protect us.

580
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:49,479
For us, though we're poor, it's fine if we can feed ourselves.

581
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:51,180
- Am I right? 
 - Yes, indeed.

582
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,940
We just mind our own business.

583
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,919
If we can do it, just do it. If we can't, then sleep.

584
00:37:55,919 --> 00:38:00,760
For the royal members, they won't sleep if they fail.

585
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,619
All we want is a little salary every month.

586
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:06,320
Indeed.

587
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,199
Mind your business.

588
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,649
Don't skip this question, Ms. Chai.

589
00:38:11,649 --> 00:38:12,569
 - Right. 
 - Go back to work. 

590
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:15,169
 - When was the last raise? 
 - Stop. Answer me about my salary. 

591
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:17,309
 Let's talk about it? No raise is fine. 

592
00:38:17,309 --> 00:38:19,469
 - But give us some seasame cakes. 
 - She's right. 

593
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:22,419
 - Stop. 
 - Stop there! 

594
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:49,440
 Yueyan, I'll find you! 

595
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:59,299
Mimi, you are a woman.

596
00:38:59,299 --> 00:39:00,679
Don't work so hard.

597
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,809
From now on, you can ask me for help.

598
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:04,649
I'll help you carry the water.

599
00:39:04,649 --> 00:39:07,589
Don't look down upon me. I'm pretty strong.

600
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:12,039
Be careful. My clothes. Don't take...

601
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:14,529
- What's wrong? Too heavy? 
 - No...

602
00:39:14,529 --> 00:39:16,120
My foot.

603
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,410
You're bleeding.

604
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,239
I'm so unlucky.

605
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:28,140
Who left the nail here?

606
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,549
I'm fine. Don't be frightened.

607
00:39:32,549 --> 00:39:35,879
Go back first. Let me take a break.

608
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,029
I'll bring you home. Leave things here.

609
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:45,580
- Be careful. 
 - I'm fine. I mean it.

610
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,220
Take it slow.

611
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,859
You just got a bit better.

612
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:08,890
Don't get sick again.

613
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:14,370
Take it easy. I'm not that weak.

614
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,849
Save it for later when it gets colder.

615
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:20,059
You've done nothing for me so far.

616
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:22,230
I don't bargain with a loss.

617
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:27,729
Be relieved, General. I'll finish your three promises for sure.

618
00:40:27,729 --> 00:40:30,740
Do you have anything to demand today?

619
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,669
I just passed by after patrolling.

620
00:40:32,669 --> 00:40:34,270
Alone?

621
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,050
Where is your slave?

622
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,850
She's washing clothes.

623
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:45,329
She has a good life, as she met a master like you.

624
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:47,299
We aren't master and slave.

625
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:49,940
We are friends who care about each other.

626
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:54,049
In a lifetime, people around will leave one by one.

627
00:40:54,049 --> 00:40:56,959
To trust the new, and farewell to the past.

628
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:59,750
These are difficulties in life.

629
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:04,990
I feel luckier than her.

630
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:09,960
So lucky that I met with someone I care about.

631
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,310
Me too.

632
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:23,449
General, continue patrolling. Otherwise, it'll be too late.

633
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,849
How about joining me?

634
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:28,409
You don't know much about this region.

635
00:41:28,409 --> 00:41:31,759
When the night comes, I'll take you somewhere.

636
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:33,519
But I wonder if you dare.

637
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:35,170
Why not?

Do you like it?

646
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:21,300
It'll be my last time to see fireflies this year.

We can see them again next year.

Who knows where we'll be by then.

649

Will we be available to see fireflies again?

00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,889
♫  through the obsession of love,  ♫

670
00:43:59,889 --> 00:44:03,729
♫  the yearning flowing through thoughts  ♫

671
00:44:03,729 --> 00:44:07,189
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

672
00:44:07,189 --> 00:44:12,989
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

673
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:16,429
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

674
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:23,049
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

675
00:44:23,049 --> 00:44:25,449
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

676
00:44:25,449 --> 00:44:27,729
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

677
00:44:27,729 --> 00:44:32,289
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

678
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:35,149
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

679
00:44:35,149 --> 00:44:37,189
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

680
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:43,770
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

681
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:51,369
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

682
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:57,109
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

683
00:44:57,109 --> 00:45:00,609
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

684
00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:07,129
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

685
00:45:07,129 --> 00:45:09,589
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

686
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,949
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

687
00:45:11,949 --> 00:45:16,429
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

688
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:19,210
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

689
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:21,209
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

690
00:45:21,209 --> 00:45:27,710
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

691
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:36,910
♫  It is sleepless  ♫

692
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:50,130
