1
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,900
♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,959
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,930
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,869
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:24,950
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,819
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

7
00:00:28,819 --> 00:00:31,589
♫   Tears and regrets go hand in hand   ♫

8
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:34,689
♫   But my heart is still fiery-hot   ♫

9
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:37,739
♫  To the distance  ♫

10
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:40,609
♫  The miserable past is like a dagger  ♫

11
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:43,619
♫  Though my wings are broken  ♫

12
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:51,240
♫  I will keep flying  ♫

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,199
♫  Following the direction of the light  ♫

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,359
♫  I'll forget you  ♫

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:04,260
♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,359
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,309
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,370
♫  The river of life is under my feet  ♫

19
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:17,560
♫  I don't regret my craziness  ♫

20
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:25,100


21
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:32,609
   

22
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:36,410
   

23
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,799
Go.

24
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,219
Stop it!

25
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:43,949
Aren't you the new counselor?

26
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,829
What do you want?

27
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,009
You think you can boss us around because General treats you well.

28
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,869
We have our own rules.

29
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,479
Even if it is General, he must obey the rules!

30
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,549
So, you want to meddle in this, too?

31
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,609
How about...

32
00:01:57,609 --> 00:01:59,919
Well. Let's have some drinks.

33
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,809
Leave!

34
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:06,929
Are you deaf?

35
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:08,770
Piss off.

36
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,799
Stay and wait.

37
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,019
- Wait here! 
 - Wait!

38
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,660
I...

39
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,170
Thank you.

40
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:57,860
Wipe your face a bit, it's a bit dirty.

41
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,110
I'll help you.

42
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,000
You are so beautiful.

43
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,730
Drink some.

44
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,469
I'm Li Shisi.

45
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,170
What's your name?

46
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,269
Mimi Guli.

47
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,719
You look different.

48
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,210
You aren't from the Ashile Tribe?

49
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:28,680
I am a slave sent to the Ashile Tribe.

50
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,999
I only have clothes for men.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,160
Take them for now.

52
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,270
I'll get changed.

53
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,239
Okay, go ahead.

54
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
I'll wait for you outside.

55
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,560
I'm finished.

56
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,060
What's in your clothes?

57
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,340
I...

58
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,590
I am sorry.

59
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,669
I... I promise I will never steal!

60
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:08,879
I'll never do this again!

61
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,139
Please don't expel me.

62
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:11,419
I can do a lot of things!

63
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:13,599
You see, I can clean the house,

64
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,649
and I... I can do the laundry and cook.

65
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,389
I can do anything, see!

66
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,670
And I am a fast worker.

67
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,210
Don't steal anything from now on.

68
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,170
I will take care of you.

69
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:32,030
Have some rest here.

70
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,950
This is my bed.

71
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,999
I'll be off for a while.

72
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:39,550
Don't answer even if someone calls you.

73
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:46,210
   

74
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,760
Take a thread with the right.

75
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,039
Cross your hands.

76
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,350
Pass from the middle one.

77
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,360
Then take one with the left.

78
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,789
Very good.

79
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,490
Flip it.

80
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,889
You want to play this.

81
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:31,319
Li Yueyan, are you stupid?

82
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,210
Look at the others' work, and tell me what you've done!

83
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,539
You really want to piss me off?

84
00:07:37,539 --> 00:07:40,279
I... I just want to unfasten the threads.

85
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:42,860
If you can't finish, no sleep tonight.

86
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:46,919
Were you sent by God to ravage and challenge me?

87
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,169
I am so mad. Come on.

88
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:50,060
Anyone, help her!

89
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,109
I am so confused.

90
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,820
You've learned for days, and what have you got?

91
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,400
Who?

92
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,699
What are you doing?

93
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,780
I am doing housework.

94
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,099
You did all these?

95
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:32,859
If you don't like others help you organize your stuff,

96
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:34,709
I won't do it again!

97
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:35,879
I am sorry.

98
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't throw me out please.

99
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,580
It's her!

100
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,879
Li Shisi, you can't leave this woman here.

101
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,349
What if I insist on keeping her?

102
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,449
Are you going to kill her?

103
00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:49,009
It's not necessary.

104
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:50,979
Just throw her out.

105
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:53,069
I beg you. Don't throw me out.

106
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:55,749
If I can't stay here, I will be eaten by wolves.

107
00:08:55,749 --> 00:08:57,129
Even if I can manage to escape,

108
00:08:57,129 --> 00:09:00,639
if the Great Khan finds that I'm an escaped slave, I will be killed.

109
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:03,100
- Please. 
 - You've talked too much nonsense. Go.

110
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,719
No!

111
00:09:04,719 --> 00:09:06,220
You...

112
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,769
Are you a dog?

113
00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:11,199
Why did you bite me?

114
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:12,600
You...

115
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,100
Enough.

116
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,390
Sun.

117
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:30,249
General, could you give me this slave?

118
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,600
You may leave.

119
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,060
According to my rules,

120
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,610
it is bad to have things with ears and a mouth.

121
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,649
Since I am the one who works for General,

122
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:48,759
I will manage my people properly.

123
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,460
You don't trust me?

124
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:57,279
I'm leaving.

125
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,930
I... I was bitten for nothing.

126
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,339
Are you well?

127
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:11,100
Did you catch a cold?

128
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,709
How about I get you some kumis? 
  (T/N: a fermented dairy product traditionally made from mare's milk) 

129
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,760
Just a second.

130
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,920
Sun.

131
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,539
Though you agreed on Li Shisi to be your counselor,

132
00:10:26,539 --> 00:10:30,310
you shouldn't trust him unconditionally.

133
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,779
- Why? 
 - We don't really know him.

134
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:33,809
I do know Shisi.

135
00:10:33,809 --> 00:10:36,419
- And he isn't from our region. 
 - Shisi is now.

136
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:39,340
But the people from the Central Plains are full of tricks.

137
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,950
Sun, I don't mean it.

138
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,549
Are you all right?

139
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,839
I'm fine.

140
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,759
Let's have some warm soup.

141
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,640
It's good for health.

142
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,670
Why is the soup only for me?

143
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,469
How about yours?

144
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,489
I'm not hungry yet. Have it now.

145
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,109
You go first.

146
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,879
I don't have an appetite.

147
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,379
When you finish it, get some sleep.

148
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:25,840
The bed is small, just put up with it.

149
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,999
Don't worry.

150
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,209
I'll sleep on the ground.

151
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:33,109
You should go to bed early.

152
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,370
It's good for your recovery.

153
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,330
Whatever.

154
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,210
But you don't have to be alert.

155
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,240
I won't hurt you.

156
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,439
Mother, don't leave me. Mother!

157
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,809
Mother. Mother.

158
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,280
Mother.

159
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,610
Mother.

160
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:30,490
Mother, please come back.

161
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,860
I'm so cold.

162
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,379
Buzhen, don't move.

163
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:20,980
Buzhen?

164
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,640
Who is Buzhen?

165
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,880
Li Shisi, I'm coming.

166
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,180
Not a good time.

167
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,839
Please wait.

168
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,640
Wait!

169
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,639
Wait!

170
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,759
Stop!

171
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,879
Stop!

172
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,689
Stop! You! I've got something to tell you.

173
00:13:48,689 --> 00:13:50,399
I've got things to warn you, too!

174
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,109
Dare you walk around camps again!

175
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:54,469
Don't go to General Sun's place.

176
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,059
What's wrong with you?

177
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:57,079
Don't come closer.

178
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,789
Are you going to bite me again?

179
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,249
I warn you just to stay there.

180
00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:01,859
Otherwise, I won't be nice.

181
00:14:01,859 --> 00:14:03,449
I really have something to tell you.

182
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:06,979
As I am living with Counselor Li, the food isn't enough for us.

183
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,809
You must prepare more for us.

184
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,109
Don't bother me! Go and find your Counselor Li.

185
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:13,139
- Time for a meal! 
 - Right.

186
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:14,659
- Come on. 
 - Have more to drink.

187
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:16,170
Drink!

188
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,740
Have more, more!

189
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,519
Why are you here?

190
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,839
Counselor Li is ill.

191
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,149
He shared with me the last food we had.

192
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,669
We need something to eat!

193
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,369
For every tent, a food quota is set.

194
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:37,390
You've taken yours.

195
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,339
- No more for you. 
 - Get out of my way.

196
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,680
You...

197
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,080
The mutton will be ready soon.

198
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,990
Have a seat.

199
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:25,009
By the way, do you guys like to use this?

200
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:28,049
I used branches to make a pair.

201
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:30,370
Hope you'll like it.

202
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,049
Do as locals do.

203
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:42,250
I don't use them anymore.

204
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,780
But I like your present.

205
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,190
Thank you.

206
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,009
In return, do you want anything?

207
00:15:52,009 --> 00:15:53,610
Me?

208
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,410
Is this Buzhen really from your family?

209
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,200
Do you want to be freed and go back to your family?

210
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,310
My family was invaded by the Ashile Tribe.

211
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,840
People died... or left.

212
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,270
I don't have any family members.

213
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:23,439
So, I'm sincerely grateful for staying with you.

214
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,229
So, the same for you.

215
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:27,030
The same?

216
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,669
Are your family...?

217
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,630
Yes, they are all dead too.

218
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
They were killed by the enemy.

219
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,639
Let's not talk about the sad memories.

220
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:45,549
Now that we have met each other, it's true destiny.

221
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:49,000
From now on, I am your family member.

222
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,180
Here!

223
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,080
Take the big one.

224
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,279
I'm so tired.

225
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,709
Almost done?

226
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,229
How about taking a break?

227
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,830
I agree.

228
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,380
So tired.

229
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:40,599
- Me too. 
 - Are you tired?

230
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:42,569
Don't you know tomorrow is the due day?

231
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:44,329
Have you finished the work?

232
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:47,620
If you can't finish it, just get out of here!

233
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,080
Go back to your work!

234
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,489
Ms. Zhang?

235
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,390
Don't bother me!

236
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,859
Li Yueyan! Did you do it on purpose?

237
00:18:00,859 --> 00:18:02,039
Look what you did!

238
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,429
Get out!

239
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:04,399
Get her out of here!

240
00:18:04,399 --> 00:18:06,699
Move! Quick!

241
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,999
 - Get out! 
 - You! Get out! 

242
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,589
Kick her out right now!

243
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,560
Out!

244
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,189
Leave here!

245
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,879
 Do you think Li Yueyan is a real fool? 

246
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,949
 - How can she be so silly? 
 - Right, so much trouble. 

247
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,809
Finally, we finished Young Master Hu's order.

248
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:43,940
Let's get some rest.

249
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,710
 My neck hurts. 

250
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,499
 - Why is she here? 
 - Right, why? 

251
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,509
 - Why didn't you leave? 
 - Why? 

252
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:58,249
Ms. Chai, my sincere apology.

253
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,559
Please give me another chance.

254
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,109
Please!

255
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,519
Little Miss Li, you're so determined.

256
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,420
Here, I do need someone like you!

257
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,760
Well.

258
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,229
Is that what you expected me to say?

259
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,899
Just act nice, then be a free-rider?

260
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:25,890
- You're daydreaming! 
 - Right.

261
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:27,109
Right.

262
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,589
Later, I will meet with Manager Hu.

263
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,999
I'm begging you.

264
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,569
Just leave.

265
00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:34,049
We don't have room for you.

266
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,820
Find another place to bother anyone else.

267
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,399
Why are you crying?

268
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,759
Look at them.

269
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,979
They've worked overnight just because of you.

270
00:19:45,979 --> 00:19:47,290
They want to cry, too!

271
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,529
 Yes. 

272
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:50,039
Tears can't give you money.

273
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,929
You need to work hard to make a living.

274
00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:56,010
If I were your mother, I would have died already.

275
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,329
Leave here now.

276
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:01,779
You'd better find a tree and get hanged.

277
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:04,569
People like you are nothing good for society.

278
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:06,370
Only a waste of food.

279
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,709
 Well. Well. 

280
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,209
 - Is she all right?  
 - Won't she commit suicide?

281
00:20:19,209 --> 00:20:20,159
 Who can tell? 

282
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,899
Why are you looking at me?

283
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:25,289
If she has the courage, it's still a good ending for her.

284
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:26,499
She is a useless person.

285
00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:28,800
Good for nothing in the world.

286
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,129
All right, girls! Get some sleep.

287
00:20:32,129 --> 00:20:33,699
Right, so tired!

288
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,300
 Let's go. 

289
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,680
 Go to rest. 

290
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,709
Have you heard it?

291
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:45,610
The slave of the counselor kicked Mu Jin out of anger.

292
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,619
Really?

293
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:48,330
True!

294
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,320
This slave is bold.

295
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,080
Mu Jin is so weak.

296
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,879
She got something.

297
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,999
Poor Mu Jin.

298
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,170
He was humiliated.

299
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,399
Smell good?

300
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,709
Why does it smell so good?

301
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:04,449
My kid likes it a lot!

302
00:21:04,449 --> 00:21:06,749
Mimi Guli, are you going to wash your man's clothes?

303
00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:08,519
Yes.

304
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,630
I...

305
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,109
Well, Mimi Guli.

306
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,559
We've heard you kicked Mu Jin.

307
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,799
He is the counselor.

308
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,540
Hope he hasn't bothered you.

309
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,109
Not at all.

310
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,310
I dare him to bother me!

311
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,519
What a relief.

312
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,879
Go to wash.

313
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,130
Yes, right. See you then.

314
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,619
See you. Take your time.

315
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,069
What's wrong with you?

316
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,019
Pick it up.

317
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:54,619
I won't.

318
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:56,879
You and Li Shisi have humiliated me!

319
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,009
Look at you. Now you seem easy and relaxed.

320
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:00,759
It is because you're weak.

321
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,189
Watch your tongue!

322
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,259
Right, you're so weak!

323
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:04,619
It's you.

324
00:22:04,619 --> 00:22:06,109
Dare you say it again!

325
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,359
- Who is weak? 
 - You!

326
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:10,109
You hurt me.

327
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:11,910
You're a wench.

328
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,809
No, it's you!

329
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:14,679
You!

330
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,759
You're a shrew!

331
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:17,660
It's you!

332
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:22,480
You and Li Shisi are evil-minded.

333
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,229
Who?

334
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,639
You two.

335
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,900
How dare you scold Shisi!

336
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,540
You can't kick me.

337
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,140
Too far.

338
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,460
You can't.

339
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:57,270
Bastard!

340
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,609
Why did my heart beat so fast?

341
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:14,189
Mu Jin, are you a fool?

342
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,469
She is with Li Shisi.

343
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:19,020
What are you thinking about?

344
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,920
Changge.

345
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,349
It is said that when people get hanged,

346
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:55,960
their tongues will become so long.

347
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,560
If I find you in your dreams,

348
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:02,020
will you be scared?

349
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:08,779
Saying so much bullshit. Are you still going to commit suicide?

350
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,779
By doing this, you can't be hanged.

351
00:24:19,779 --> 00:24:23,800
What you did can only exercise your neck.

352
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,800
My husband, years ago, though he couldn't take care of our family,

353
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,810
hanged himself to end everything.

354
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:37,699
Is your life so worthless?

355
00:24:37,699 --> 00:24:40,659
Why are you going to kill yourself just as you were told?

356
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:43,259
If you really want to die, nobody can stop you.

357
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:46,589
But if you want to live, nobody can block you as well!

358
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,939
You should rely on yourself. Get it?

359
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,639
Well, well. It's all right.

360
00:25:03,639 --> 00:25:05,680
All right. It's all right.

361
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,109
My words were a bit harsh.

362
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,820
I am sorry.

363
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,330
Thank you, Ms. Chai.

364
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,980
Manager Hu, check out this new pattern.

365
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,030
Come, come here.

366
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,380
Pattern from the West.

367
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,170
- It's really popular. 
 - Right.

368
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,660
Very nice.

369
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:58,760
Look at it, this embroidery.

370
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,200
There are golden threads.

371
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,000
Look at the stitches. How tight!

372
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,090
Right.

373
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,969
Good.

374
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:10,620
This is your order.

375
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:18,519
I've heard Ms. Chai's blankets were smooth.

376
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:22,229
Why aren't the stitches for my order smooth at all?

377
00:26:22,229 --> 00:26:25,279
We could have done better if you had given us more time.

378
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,229
Would you take it, please?

379
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,330
Right, please.

380
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,399
Well.

381
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,429
Who made this?

382
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:44,119
- This? 
 - Well... I told you not to follow me.

383
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:45,949
It's her work.

384
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,589
Manager Hu, it's her work.

385
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:51,050
Right, Miss Li.

386
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,740
Did you make this?

387
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,159
Yes, it's me.

388
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,809
Perfect. How wonderful!

389
00:27:00,809 --> 00:27:01,949
I'll take it.

390
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,879
Miss, could you make more?

391
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:06,910
I'll buy all of them.

392
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,230
With a good price!

393
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:12,670
As long as you do, I'll buy the clothes altogether.

394
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,279
This girl is our embroider.

395
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,760
As for this handkerchief, as long as the price is good,

396
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,500
you can have as many as you want.

397
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,889
Deal! You can name the price.

398
00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:26,050
You're great.

399
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,039
Here, take a date.

400
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,330
Take it.

401
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:29,390
Take two.

402
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,990
Just take them.

403
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,559
Why did General invite me to have a grilled mutton leg tonight?

404
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:53,240
Your slave had a fight with Mu Jin because of this.

405
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,999
You're also my counselor.

406
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,900
I hope they feel I've treated you fairly.

407
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,310
Have you grilled mutton legs for Mu Jin?

408
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,349
No.

409
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,350
It's my first time.

410
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,430
When I was a kid, my father grilled it with me once.

411
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,020
I was determined to grill my own.

412
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:20,210
It ended up a great mess. All were burned.

413
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:24,399
Then for the burned part, my dad ate them all.

414
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,709
Later, I learned how to grill.

415
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:28,589
I didn't want to fail him again.

416
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,900
I didn't expect there was such a story between you and your father.

417
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,559
When I was little, my father still cared about me.

418
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,760
But afterward...

419
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,950
Let's move on.

420
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,709
Tell me about your father.

421
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,830
I have nothing to share.

422
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,270
He was very busy.

423
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,879
I see.

424
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,460
Because he was the crown prince.

425
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,690
It's normal that he was busy.

426
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,879
How did you know?

427
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,429
In You State, you had access to the Governor Mansion,

428
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,950
I knew you were privileged.

429
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,999
Later, I heard they called you Princess Yongning.

430
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,680
Then, I've realized everything.

431
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,410
Since you knew who I was by then, why didn't you reveal my identity?

432
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:20,300
Is it for taking advantage of me?

433
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,500
Right. I used you.

434
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,310
I suffered a lot because of you.

435
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:34,200
I saved you in Chang'an, You State, and Shuo State as well.

436
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,080
Now we are on the grassland.

437
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,970
I am grilling a mutton leg for a slave like you.

438
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,590
I've made full "use" of you.

439
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,030
What?

440
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:54,290
Did you forget everything?

441
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,990
No.

442
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,180
Take it.

443
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:04,940
♫   Before the daybreak, through the obsession of love,   ♫

444
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,600
Anyway, I'm regarded as dead in Great Tang.

445
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,029
I have nothing to be afraid of.

446
00:30:12,029 --> 00:30:14,210
From now on, I'm not Li Shisi.

447
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,810
My name is Li Changge.

448
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,430
I like this name, Changge.

449
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,530
Changge.

450
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,420
Changge.

451
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:28,159
♫  Which froze everything between you and me  ♫

452
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,399
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

453
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,720
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

454
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,319
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

455
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,119
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

456
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:43,180
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

457
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:48,110
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

458
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,110
 What's she doing? 

459
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,990
 Does it mean she'll commit herself to me? 

460
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,250
It's already late.

461
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:59,080
I'm at least a man.

462
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,120
Is it appropriate?

463
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,779
Hey.

464
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:10,349
Changge.

465
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:13,139
Changge? What happened?

466
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:25,630
 Why are they so close late at night? 

467
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,280
Mr. Shisi, what happened to you?

468
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,099
I have no idea.

469
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:40,500
All of a sudden.

470
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,460
Are you sick?

471
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,820
Get some rest.

472
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:51,009
Blood?

473
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,720
Why is he bleeding?

474
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,440
Mimi.

475
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,510
Let me keep you warm.

476
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,120
What happened to him?

477
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
Did he get hurt?

478
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,149
No, don't worry. He's fine.

479
00:32:07,149 --> 00:32:08,390
He... He looks awful.

480
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,390
As I said, he's fine.

481
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:16,209
But he looks like he's dying. He is hurt!

482
00:32:16,209 --> 00:32:17,600
I told you he's fine.

483
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,770
But he's...

484
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,329
What does it mean?

485
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:26,230
Really?

486
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,409
I told you so.

487
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:30,129
You're treating her differently.

488
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,719
Did you know that she was a woman?

489
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,259
You're not frank or honest anymore.

490
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:36,539
Changge is weak.

491
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:38,310
We need to treat her with a lamb.

492
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,710
Changge?

493
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,019
Her name.

494
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:44,550
So Mr. Shisi's real name is Changge.

495
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:47,170
How many secrets did you hide from me?

496
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,580
Tell me more.

497
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,040
Sun.

498
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:59,199
I thought you were a man.

499
00:32:59,199 --> 00:33:03,360
I've even decided to marry you.

500
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,809
Why are you laughing? Don't laugh.

501
00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:09,720
I'm really upset.

502
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:12,980
Mimi,

503
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,289
you can still be my family member.

504
00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:17,430
There's nothing different.

505
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,200
But still, it's different.

506
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,949
How so?

507
00:33:20,949 --> 00:33:24,310
I think it's not because you're good at disguise.

508
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:27,449
You really don't treat yourself as a woman.

509
00:33:27,449 --> 00:33:32,129
In this world, men need to fight and protect their domains and women.

510
00:33:32,129 --> 00:33:34,929
Whereas, women are responsible for fertility

511
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,549
and protecting the senior people and the kids.

512
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:41,430
But you use men's ways to fight with them,

513
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:44,380
while using the body of a woman.

514
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,150
What's in your mind?

515
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,910
I have no ideas as well.

516
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:52,679
What makes a man?

517
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,259
What makes a woman?

518
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:57,310
I've never really thought of it.

519
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,340
My masters are men.

520
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,369
Manage the country by making policies, and protect it by leading armies.

521
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:05,769
They are big figures with great talents.

522
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:08,369
But what's the difference between me and them?

523
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,639
My father's wife and concubines are women.

524
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:14,810
They are in the finest dresses and look so gorgeous.

525
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:18,669
They are considerate and attentive.

526
00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:24,040
But what does it matter to me?

527
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,379
Anyhow, you should rest at home for these days.

528
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:32,810
Don't suffer with them in the wild.

529
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,750
One more thing.

530
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:39,669
Since you've lied to me, your name can't be Mr. Shisi.

531
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:41,679
My name is Li Changge.

532
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,780
Li Changge.

533
00:34:47,010 --> 00:34:52,270
So, did General Sun know this secret already?

534
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,610
Then he's keeping it for you.

535
00:34:56,610 --> 00:35:01,340
Did he fall in love with you?

536
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,229
Nonsense.

537
00:35:04,229 --> 00:35:06,539
He thinks I'm useful for him.

538
00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:09,610
So he cares about me a little.

539
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:14,249
How do you feel now?

540
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,750
You'll feel better if you keep the underbelly warm.

541
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,979
What are you waiting for?

542
00:35:33,979 --> 00:35:35,609
Move it!

543
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:38,880
To carry the wool is the easiest task.

544
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,479
Can you do it?

545
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:45,480
Yes, I can.

546
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,669
What are you waiting for? Come and help me!

547
00:36:00,669 --> 00:36:03,109
 - I'm coming. 
 - Be quick. 

548
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:04,809
 Look at the wool. 

549
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:06,699
It gets everywhere. Take it off!

550
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:08,199
 And here. 

551
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,270
 Look at your head. 

552
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,090
 And here. 

553
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,969
 Wool Yan. Wool Yan. Wool Yan. 

554
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:20,379
You got the wool everywhere.

555
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:22,680
Wool Yan, are you really stupid?

556
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,829
I just asked you to carry the wool. Look at what you've done.

557
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:28,090
Ms. Chai, I...

558
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,580
 Look at your hair. 

559
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,799
 Oh my. Seriously. 

560
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,320
Look at you.

561
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:51,149
This fool knows nothing. How can she live like this?

562
00:36:51,149 --> 00:36:52,920
Right.

563
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,869
Thank you!

564
00:36:55,869 --> 00:36:58,689
You're my saviors.

565
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:01,039
Thanks to your help, I can make it through.

566
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:02,559
It's the first time I heard that title.

567
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:05,049
She is not referring to you. Think about your poor salary.

568
00:37:05,049 --> 00:37:07,959
- You're not valuable at all. 
 - Not valuable?

569
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:11,399
Our wool fabrics are for the use of the government offices.

570
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:17,050
They might even become the carpets in the palace.

571
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:21,210
You've worked so hard,

572
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:24,819
but they might not cherish every stitch you made.

573
00:37:24,819 --> 00:37:27,370
Nonsense.

574
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,559
Those in the palace don't bother by food and clothes.

575
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:33,960
They won't know how much hard work is behind them.

576
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,999
God is fair.

577
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:39,509
The royal family is supported by the people.

578
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:41,669
They'll get whatever they want.

579
00:37:41,669 --> 00:37:45,579
So, they need to take the responsibility to protect us.

580
00:37:45,579 --> 00:37:49,479
For us, though we're poor, it's fine if we can feed ourselves.

581
00:37:49,479 --> 00:37:51,180
- Am I right? 
 - Yes, indeed.

582
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,940
We just mind our own business.

583
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,919
If we can do it, just do it. If we can't, then sleep.

584
00:37:55,919 --> 00:38:00,760
For the royal members, they won't sleep if they fail.

585
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:04,619
All we want is a little salary every month.

586
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:06,320
Indeed.

587
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,199
Mind your business.

588
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,649
Don't skip this question, Ms. Chai.

589
00:38:11,649 --> 00:38:12,569
 - Right. 
 - Go back to work. 

590
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:15,169
 - When was the last raise? 
 - Stop. Answer me about my salary. 

591
00:38:15,169 --> 00:38:17,309
 Let's talk about it? No raise is fine. 

592
00:38:17,309 --> 00:38:19,469
 - But give us some seasame cakes. 
 - She's right. 

593
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:22,419
 - Stop. 
 - Stop there! 

594
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:49,440
 Yueyan, I'll find you! 

595
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:59,299
Mimi, you are a woman.

596
00:38:59,299 --> 00:39:00,679
Don't work so hard.

597
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:02,809
From now on, you can ask me for help.

598
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:04,649
I'll help you carry the water.

599
00:39:04,649 --> 00:39:07,589
Don't look down upon me. I'm pretty strong.

600
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:12,039
Be careful. My clothes. Don't take...

601
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:14,529
- What's wrong? Too heavy? 
 - No...

602
00:39:14,529 --> 00:39:16,120
My foot.

603
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,410
You're bleeding.

604
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,239
I'm so unlucky.

605
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:28,140
Who left the nail here?

606
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,549
I'm fine. Don't be frightened.

607
00:39:32,549 --> 00:39:35,879
Go back first. Let me take a break.

608
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,029
I'll bring you home. Leave things here.

609
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:45,580
- Be careful. 
 - I'm fine. I mean it.

610
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,220
Take it slow.

611
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,859
You just got a bit better.

612
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:08,890
Don't get sick again.

613
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:14,370
Take it easy. I'm not that weak.

614
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,849
Save it for later when it gets colder.

615
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:20,059
You've done nothing for me so far.

616
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:22,230
I don't bargain with a loss.

617
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:27,729
Be relieved, General. I'll finish your three promises for sure.

618
00:40:27,729 --> 00:40:30,740
Do you have anything to demand today?

619
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,669
I just passed by after patrolling.

620
00:40:32,669 --> 00:40:34,270
Alone?

621
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:39,050
Where is your slave?

622
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:41,850
She's washing clothes.

623
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:45,329
She has a good life, as she met a master like you.

624
00:40:45,329 --> 00:40:47,299
We aren't master and slave.

625
00:40:47,299 --> 00:40:49,940
We are friends who care about each other.

626
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:54,049
In a lifetime, people around will leave one by one.

627
00:40:54,049 --> 00:40:56,959
To trust the new, and farewell to the past.

628
00:40:56,959 --> 00:40:59,750
These are difficulties in life.

629
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:04,990
I feel luckier than her.

630
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:09,960
So lucky that I met with someone I care about.

631
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,310
Me too.

632
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:23,449
General, continue patrolling. Otherwise, it'll be too late.

633
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,849
How about joining me?

634
00:41:25,849 --> 00:41:28,409
You don't know much about this region.

635
00:41:28,409 --> 00:41:31,759
When the night comes, I'll take you somewhere.

636
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:33,519
But I wonder if you dare.

637
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:35,170
Why not?

638
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:49,369
♫  The heart gradually responds,  ♫

639
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:51,649

How beautiful!

644
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,160
I found it when patrolling.

645
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,930
Do you like it?

646
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:21,300
It'll be my last time to see fireflies this year.

647
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,460
We can see them again next year.

648
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,850
Who knows where we'll be by then.

649
00:42:27,850 --> 00:42:30,920
Will we be available to see fireflies again?

650
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,120
If you want to see them next year,

651
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:37,080
just tell me and that's it.

652
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,950
Wherever I am, I'll keep my promise.

I don't think I can make it.

657
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:59,949
Besides, like fireflies, such wonderful creatures are ephemeral.

658
00:42:59,949 --> 00:43:02,280
Why shall we expect them?

659

670
00:43:59,889 --> 00:44:03,729
♫  the yearning flowing through thoughts  ♫

671
00:44:03,729 --> 00:44:07,189
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

672
00:44:07,189 --> 00:44:12,989
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

673
00:44:12,989 --> 00:44:16,429
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

674
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:23,049
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

675
00:44:23,049 --> 00:44:25,449
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

676
00:44:25,449 --> 00:44:27,729
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

677
00:44:27,729 --> 00:44:32,289
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

678
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:35,149
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

679
00:44:35,149 --> 00:44:37,189
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

680
00:44:37,190 --> 00:44:43,770
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

681
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:51,369
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

682
00:44:51,369 --> 00:44:57,109
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

683
00:44:57,109 --> 00:45:00,609
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

684
00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:07,129
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

685
00:45:07,129 --> 00:45:09,589
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

686
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:11,949
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

687
00:45:11,949 --> 00:45:16,429
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

688
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:19,210
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

689
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:21,209
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

690
00:45:21,209 --> 00:45:27,710
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

691
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:36,910
♫  It is sleepless  ♫

692
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:50,130
