22
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,318
I'll ask some people to tie her up

23
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:41,600
and send her to your Eagle Division.

24
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:46,040
No need.

25
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,840
I'm fed up with this slave.

26
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:57,480
Just let her take care of She'er.

27
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,220
I think they...

28
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,180
make a perfect match.

29
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:10,120
Okay.

30
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,239
I'll do as you want.

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,680
What else do you want?

32
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,700
I'll give them to you.

33
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:23,139
I heard Monan pay a jar of good wine as a tribute to Kurultai.

34
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:27,699
I want to drink a cup of that wine.

35
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:31,319
The whole jar is here. You can drink as you want.

36
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:35,220
Let's drink together.

37
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,660
More.

38
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,240
Good!

39
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,159
Men in our tribe should be as bold as you.

40
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,500
You'll show your heroic posture at tomorrow's hunting.

41
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,600
I'm injured.

42
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,659
If I can't hunt as many prey as last year tomorrow,

43
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,639
I choose to be absent.

44
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,278
Sun, that doesn't sound like you.

45
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:47,539
I won enough cheers in today's battle.

46
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,079
Let's give She'er a chance to win cheers tomorrow.

47
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,519
My injury today is more serious than yours.

48
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,400
I'm afraid you want to see me lose face again.

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,080
Uncle Khan, no matter how serious my injury is,

50
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,980
I want to win my honor back from Ashile Sun.

51
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,819
If he doesn't go hunting, even if I win, so what?

52
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:14,800
Look at you two brothers.

53
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,820
As an old saying goes in Central Plains,

54
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,360
why does destiny make Zhou Yu confront Zhuge Liang?

55
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,418
Okay. You can stay here

56
00:04:25,418 --> 00:04:29,440
and cure your injury in tomorrow's hunting.

57
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:32,179
Thank you, Father Khan.

58
00:04:32,179 --> 00:04:33,920
Thank you, Uncle Khan.

59
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:37,039
Then I shall leave now.

60
00:05:02,559 --> 00:05:05,640
What are Ashile Sun and you conspiring?

61
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,199
You misunderstand me.

62
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,740
I simply don't want to go back to Eagle Division.

63
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,379
You think I'll believe you?

64
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:13,379
He suddenly said he wouldn't go hunting.

65
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,679
This is not like him.

66
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,659
What do you want?

67
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:21,159
I don't care whether you believe me.

68
00:05:21,159 --> 00:05:24,220
I refused Ashile Sun in front of Great Khan, that's true.

69
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,958
About what he is thinking, you can go and ask him.

70
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,779
How would I know?

71
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,039
I don't know what you are doing.

72
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,300
If you don't want to go with him, why didn't you say that earlier?

73
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,840
You don't want to go with him, but maybe Mimi would like to go with me.

74
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,160
So you're anxious now.

75
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,939
You don't need to feel regretful.

76
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:47,980
I can guarantee Mimi would rather die than come back.

77
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,400
Sun,

78
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,739
I'm sorry.

79
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,580
You abandoned the chance and trapped yourself here.

80
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,539
How do you want to save Luo Yi?

81
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,040
How do you know that?

82
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:20,159
I've promised someone.

83
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:21,479
I can't tell you.

84
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,120
Who did you promise?

85
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:27,120
Princess Yicheng?

86
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:32,839
You can't save Luo Yi, neither can Yicheng.

87
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,759
Stop overestimating your ability, okay?

88
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,860
Why didn't you go hunting?

89
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:43,039
She'er has noticed there's something wrong with you.

90
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,420
I don't care what your plan is.

91
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,120
I hope you won't hinder my action.

92
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,100
How's your injury?

93
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:00,179
I won't die.

94
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,860
Sun, thank you so much.

95
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,059
If you really want to thank me,

96
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,199
listen to me this time.

97
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,959
Okay?

98
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,559
Just go.

99
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,840
Don't get involved in it.

100
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,380
Go back to Eagle Division. I want to cure my injury.

101
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,559
General, how did you...

102
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:22,579
Arrange a few people to guard here.

103
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:24,030
What do you want to do?

104
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,720
No matter what happened in Khan's tent, report to me immediately.

105
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,259
Especially, the news about Luo Yi.

106
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:31,739
Yes.

107
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:36,299
Make sure She'er knows I have gone back to Eagle Division.

108
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,299
I understand.

109
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,019
Xiao Wu.

110
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:12,918
Let's set off early so that we can arrive at Luoyang early.

111
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:17,220
When we arrive there, I'll find you a physician to cure your sickness.

112
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,759
I have no sickness.

113
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,300
I just want to have more sleep.

114
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:29,939
Our food is running out.

115
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,559
It's okay. We're getting closer to Luoyang.

116
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,478
Didn't you notice it?

117
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:40,600
The villagers in near villages are fleeing from famine.

118
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,759
If we keep going, I'm afraid we can't ask for food anymore.

119
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,560
Xiao Wu, there is always a way out.

120
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,280
We can make it to Luoyang.

121
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,599
Xiao Wu.

122
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,899
Xiao Wu, I thought you have been become thinner recently.

123
00:11:02,899 --> 00:11:05,199
Well, I feel bloated.

124
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,038
I have had no appetite these days.

125
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,619
You can eat the two pancakes for today.

126
00:11:12,219 --> 00:11:15,479
Sister, you really don't know how to lie.

127
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:18,919
How could you survive in this world?

128
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:32,859
Right, there's some way out.

129
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,518
I'm here. I won't let you starve to death.

130
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,879
Khan, the division leaders who will go hunting are waiting for you outside.

131
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,779
Let's go.

132
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,459
Let's go!

133
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:04,159
<i>Yes, Khan!</i>

134
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,378
Young Khan, Ashile Sun went back to cure his injury.

135
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:31,750
Until Great Khan led a team to go hunting just now, he hasn't been back.

136
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:35,158
Maybe you thought too much this time.

137
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:37,019
Think too much?

138
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:39,639
His action is always beyond my imagination.

139
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,338
Keep an eye on him.

140
00:12:41,338 --> 00:12:42,458
Yes, sir.

141
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,679
- Report, Young Khan.
- What's wrong?

142
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:47,179
Great Khan's Ferghana horse ran out somehow.

143
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:49,819
The guards are trying to catch it.

144
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:51,619
It happened after Great Khan has left?

145
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:55,318
Right. Maybe it noticed Great Khan left, so it wanted to go with him.

146
00:12:55,318 --> 00:12:59,158
That's not right. What a coincidence.

147
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:00,559
Tuluk, let's go.

148
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:03,599
Go to the slave camp and check if Li Changge is there.

149
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:23,479
Where's that new slave?

150
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:26,299
Commander, he worked with us this morning.

151
00:13:26,299 --> 00:13:28,520
But he's left later.

152
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:32,799
She's not here.

153
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,120
I knew she did it.

154
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,399
When did she disappear?

155
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,540
They said she worked with them in the morning.

156
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,659
Did she sneak away when the guards didn't notice her?

157
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:44,978
It's not right. What on earth happened?

158
00:13:44,978 --> 00:13:48,680
What will they do when Great Khan is not here?

159
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,859
All soldiers are guarding...

160
00:13:51,859 --> 00:13:53,219
Luo Yi.

161
00:13:53,219 --> 00:13:55,739
Hurry up! Go to Luo Yi's prison.

162
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,200
Aunt A'Yi'er.

163
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,218
A'Yi'er, why are you going to fetch water so soon?

164
00:14:15,218 --> 00:14:17,219
Khatun just fetched water two days ago.

165
00:14:17,219 --> 00:14:19,299
Did you use it all up so soon?

166
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,240
Toruch.

167
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,240
Greetings, Khatun.

168
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,060
Stand up.

169
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,939
Thank you, Khatun.

170
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,799
I don't like the soda water in Khan's Tent.

171
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,640
So I always ask Alir to fetch river water for me.

172
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,660
You know this.

173
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,980
I took a shower for yesterday's Kurultai.

174
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,879
So I used up all the water.

175
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,199
Did I cause you any trouble?

176
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,459
Not at all.

177
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:20,699
If you want water, I can just let A'Yi'er go.

178
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,839
Go ahead.

179
00:15:31,219 --> 00:15:36,419
Well, I heard you had a baby girl recently.

180
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,158
I made a pair of shoes for the baby.

181
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:41,500
When you are off-duty, come and fetch them.

182
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,559
And take some cheese back. Hand it out to our brothers.

183
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,080
Thank you so much.

184
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,219
You are so generous.

185
00:15:48,219 --> 00:15:50,558
You treat our brothers so nicely.

186
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:52,959
It's just a gift for you.

187
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,900
Just as we expected.

188
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,680
Li Changge.

189
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,560
If no one helps her, she can't take that old man away.

190
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,018
Besides, that old man is seriously injured.

191
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,100
They can't go far.

192
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,599
Tuluk, ask the guards to search Luo Yi now instead of the horse.

193
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:32,159
Yes, sir.

194
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,519
Wait!

195
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,079
Ask a team of Wolf Division to come here.

196
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,619
What's wrong, Young Khan?

197
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:39,619
I think they haven't gone far.

198
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:41,260
Let's separate to chase them.

199
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,740
Yes, sir.

200
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,939
I didn't imagine I can escape there.

201
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:25,320
Even if I die today, I won't regret it!

202
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,899
Come on.

203
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:35,039
Elder Luo, your leg is bleeding again.

204
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,720
It's okay.

205
00:17:54,719 --> 00:17:56,280
A'Yi'er.

206
00:17:57,439 --> 00:18:03,130
Thank you for what you've done for us regardless of the risk of life.

207
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:07,479
Madam, thank you so much.

208
00:18:17,939 --> 00:18:19,699
Thank you.

209
00:18:39,579 --> 00:18:43,139
Changge, did you contact Luo Shiba?

210
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:46,760
Last night, I played that ballad as you said.

211
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,479
Okay. She should be around here.

212
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:05,780
Elder Luo, I'll help you walk.

213
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,280
Okay.

214
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,359
General, you were right.

215
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:33,659
Luo Yi escaped. All the guards in the capital went to chase him.

216
00:19:33,659 --> 00:19:34,938
Where's She'er?

217
00:19:34,938 --> 00:19:36,479
He's also chasing them.

218
00:19:36,479 --> 00:19:38,478
Lead a team and follow me.

219
00:19:38,478 --> 00:19:40,039
Yes, sir.

220
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,080
What are you doing?

221
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,399
Is Luo Yi's escape related to you?

222
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,999
It wasn't. But it is related to me now.

223
00:19:51,999 --> 00:19:54,418
Sun, you can't go.

224
00:19:54,418 --> 00:19:56,078
He is Great Khan's most hated person.

225
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,460
He's also a General of Great Tang.

226
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,260
If you get involved in this, it'll be hard to explain.

227
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:17,039
Wait.

228
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:01,039
Why is there blood?

229
00:21:04,199 --> 00:21:05,600
Take her away.

230
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,100
Yes, Sir.

231
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,399
Go!

232
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,738
Young Khan, when A'Yi'er came back just now,

233
00:21:56,738 --> 00:21:59,439
Uncle Lei found blood on her water cart.

234
00:21:59,439 --> 00:22:02,039
A'Yi'er has already been arrested by them.

235
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:04,200
<i>It's A'Yi'er?</i>

236
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,920
<i>Did Mother...</i>

237
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,078
Take A'Yi'er to my tent. Don't let others know it.

238
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:10,059
Yes, Sir.

239
00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:11,380
Which way did Luo Yi escape?

240
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,399
They went east along the desert poplar forest.

241
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,459
Uncle Lei went to chase them along the track.

242
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:22,058
Follow me! Let's stop them from the south.

243
00:22:22,058 --> 00:22:23,400
<i>Yes, Sir!</i>

244
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,679
Nice horse.

245
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,859
I spent my whole life on the battlefield.

246
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:54,439
I won't regret it since I can tame the horse.

247
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:57,259
General Luo, I'll give you a swift horse.

248
00:22:57,259 --> 00:22:58,779
Okay.

249
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,799
Luo Shiba.

250
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,779
Changge, what did I say just now?

251
00:23:11,779 --> 00:23:13,719
Shiba, good girl.

252
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:15,480
Stand up.

253
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:18,239
Let's go.

254
00:23:28,499 --> 00:23:30,039
What a huge team!

255
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,080
They think so much of me.

256
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,339
Shiba, take General Luo away.

257
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:04,879
I'll draw their attention.

258
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,899
Someone must have helped us in this rescue.

259
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:10,439
You're only one person, you won't be able to distract them.

260
00:24:10,439 --> 00:24:13,020
It's a bad idea.

261
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,100
Then I'll leave with Shiba. After we've drawn them away, we'll pick you up.

262
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:20,900
No need. It seems to be God's will.

263
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,780
I may die here today.

264
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,619
For the Great Tang, I'm a rebel.

265
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:38,519
For tribes, I'm an enemy that should be killed hundreds of times.

266
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,238
Where can I escape to?

267
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:44,160
Maybe I'll die today.

268
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,358
- I choose here to die.
- You won't.

269
00:24:46,358 --> 00:24:50,078
General, no matter what happened, I'll save you.

270
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,619
How lucky I am!

271
00:24:56,619 --> 00:24:58,680
I survived until today.

272
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,700
And I got a chance to atone.

273
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,020
Even if we die here today, we won't leave you here and run away.

274
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,630
Luo Shiba, listen to my order.

275
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:13,899
From now on, Li Changge will be your new master.

276
00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:16,740
Why don't you kneel down to her?

277
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:19,579
Do you want to betray my order?

278
00:25:31,719 --> 00:25:33,660
Stop.

279
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,698
General Luo, what are you doing?

280
00:25:42,698 --> 00:25:48,218
Princess Yongning, Luo Shiba will work for you from now on.

281
00:25:48,218 --> 00:25:51,020
Eighteen Cavalrymen of Yanyun have risked their lives with me.

282
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,539
Now there's only Shiba left.

283
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:55,639
I watched her grow up.

284
00:25:55,639 --> 00:25:58,500
Instead of master and servant, we're more like father and daughter.

285
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:05,260
Today, I'll entrust my daughter to you.

286
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,899
General.

287
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,439
You're still young.

288
00:26:18,439 --> 00:26:20,920
Don't die for me.

289
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,459
I spent my whole life fighting.

290
00:26:23,459 --> 00:26:28,319
If I can die on the battlefield as I wish, I would be very happy.

291
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,239
Luo Shiba, this is my last order for you.

292
00:26:33,239 --> 00:26:35,440
Take Changge away.

293
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,700
General.

294
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,760
Go!

295
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,720
Stop them.

296
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,440
Chase them!

297
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,399
I didn't imagine you had some ability.

298
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:43,200
You can take a disabled man out of the capital which is full of guards.

299
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,159
Shiba, your martial arts are better than mine.

300
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,680
Once you get the chance, just escape.

301
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,460
Escape?

302
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,239
No one can escape. I want to catch you alive.

303
00:28:53,239 --> 00:28:55,419
Catch them!

304
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,880
They're my people. I want to take them away.

305
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,939
Why do you think you're qualified to talk to me like that?

306
00:29:46,579 --> 00:29:49,398
General Sun, calm down.

307
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,960
She'er, you'll never know what fighting for guard is.

308
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,698
I like destroying the things you like most.

309
00:30:04,698 --> 00:30:08,019
I want you to have a taste of a beloved one being taken away.

310
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:10,919
You're just a coward that doesn't want to grow up.

311
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,260
Say that again.

312
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,879
Coward!

313
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:18,100
You should understand.

314
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,579
It's something between us.

315
00:30:20,579 --> 00:30:23,179
It has nothing to do with them.

316
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:32,039
General Sun, the Wolf Division can let Li Changge go.

317
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,559
Let's take a step back, okay?

318
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:45,059
Let's go.

319
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,478
Young Khan, don't chase them.

320
00:31:00,479 --> 00:31:02,079
Let me go!

321
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:10,739
Didn't you hear what that bastard said to me?

322
00:31:10,739 --> 00:31:12,760
Calm down, Young Khan.

323
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:16,860
Maybe this time, we can inflict heavy losses on the Eagle Division.

324
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,079
In Great Khan's opinion, that servant is yours.

325
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:24,140
She let Luo Yi go. It means she is a spy colluding with the Eagle Division.

326
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,539
It also means she shot the arrow at Weihe River to save Li Shimin on purpose.

327
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:31,820
But now, this spy was saved by Ashile Sun.

328
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:36,380
Only if you let her go, you won't get involved in it.

329
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:39,039
And we can get the Eagle Division involved.

330
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,159
You can't get a better bargain.

331
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,760
Bargain?

332
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,059
I don't want to take advantage of Ashile Sun.

333
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:47,959
He's my prey.

334
00:31:47,959 --> 00:31:49,579
I want to win over him.

335
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:52,519
I want all divisions to admit I'm better than him.

336
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,939
Have you ever thought about the princess?

337
00:31:54,939 --> 00:31:58,020
It's my duty to help you get the kingship in all divisions.

338
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,859
As long as we can wipe out the Eagle Division for the princess,

339
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:04,400
I'll do whatever it takes.

340
00:32:20,619 --> 00:32:23,759
Sun. Stop.

341
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:25,460
Sun!

342
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,900
What do you want now?

343
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,119
Sh'eer has seen Eagle Division pick me up.

344
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,298
What can we do then?

345
00:32:38,298 --> 00:32:40,360
I'll consider it.

346
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,999
You don't need to care about it.

347
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,580
Mu Jin?

348
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,619
Sun, I finally found you.

349
00:32:53,619 --> 00:32:55,320
Why are you here?

350
00:32:56,179 --> 00:32:57,779
You saved her?

351
00:32:57,779 --> 00:32:59,480
Yes.

352
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:03,919
A letter was delivered by pigeon. Have a look.

353
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,419
What happened?

354
00:33:18,239 --> 00:33:20,360
Take her away.

355
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,880
- What happened?
- Don't ask so much.

356
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:24,338
Take her away.

357
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:27,199
No. If I leave, what about you?

358
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:30,338
It's my own business.

359
00:33:30,338 --> 00:33:31,760
You don't need to care about it.

360
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,659
But if I leave now, everyone has seen you save me,

361
00:33:35,659 --> 00:33:37,438
how will you explain it?

362
00:33:37,438 --> 00:33:39,038
One should answer for what he did.

363
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:40,418
I won't leave like this.

364
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:42,310
If I leave, people in the Eagle Division will—

365
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,240
Shut up!

366
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,999
Who do you think you are? What do you think you can do?

367
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:48,720
You never belonged here.

368
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,160
No matter what happens in the Eagle Division, it's none of your business!

369
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,740
Ashile Sun, don't think you can solve everything by yourself.

370
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,639
If you knew things would go like this, why did you save him?

371
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:00,458
Did you save Luo Yi?

372
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:02,179
What did I tell you?

373
00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:06,559
Now Luo Yi died, and you sacrificed the Eagle Division and yourself!

374
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:16,439
Li Changge, this is the result of your self-approbation.

375
00:34:16,439 --> 00:34:18,258
I won't leave now.

376
00:34:18,258 --> 00:34:20,780
You have caused me enough trouble.

377
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,819
From now on, you have nothing to do with the Eagle Division.

378
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:28,020
Go back to Central Plain.

379
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,400
Go away!

380
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:39,339

00:34:46,138 --> 00:34:47,480

386
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,020
I can leave on my own.

393

Follow her and send her back to Central Plain!

397
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,500
Shiba, just go.

398
00:36:40,439 --> 00:36:42,320
Stand up.

399
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,660
No matter what General Luo said, it won't work.

400
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,079
You don't need to regard me as your master. You—

401
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:53,738
Yanyun Cavalrymen's rule, after following one master, we'll die rather than betray.

402
00:36:53,738 --> 00:36:55,159
You can talk?

403
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:56,659
I can.

404
00:36:56,659 --> 00:36:58,920
Then, why didn't you talk before?

405
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,099
Because it was not necessary.

406
00:37:02,579 --> 00:37:06,839
In all, you don't need to regard anyone as your master now.

407
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,958
You can leave now.

408
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:10,738
Leave? Where can I go?

409
00:37:10,738 --> 00:37:12,720
You can go wherever you want.

410
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,759
Do whatever you want to do.

411
00:37:14,759 --> 00:37:16,039
You're free now.

412
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,579
No one can restrain you now.

413
00:37:18,579 --> 00:37:20,179
Free?

414
00:37:23,479 --> 00:37:25,079
Go!

415
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,900
Why are you here?

416
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,739
Are you afraid I won't leave?

417
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:41,159
According to Sun, he is afraid of this.

418
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,279
Did you see the letter?

419
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,980
What?

420
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:48,319
Where did you get that letter?

421
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,620
It's from Khan's tent. There's some pigeon blood on it.

422
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:52,279
It means it's urgent.

423
00:37:52,279 --> 00:37:56,199
I didn't see the letter. But there's something in it.

424
00:37:57,399 --> 00:37:59,239
I saw it.

425
00:38:02,959 --> 00:38:04,740
It's a pair of earrings.

426
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,119
Earrings?

427
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,299
Is any woman related to Sun in Khan's tent?

428
00:38:11,299 --> 00:38:13,780
- His mother!
- His mother?

429
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,520
Isn't he an orphan?

430
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,979
She's his foster mother, called A'Yi'er.

431
00:38:18,979 --> 00:38:22,799
If A'Yi'er didn't pick him and bring him up when he was young,

432
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,759
he would have died.

433
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,200
For all these years, Great Khan has been asking A'Yi'er to work in his tent.

434
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,159
He wants Sun to be loyal to him.

435
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:34,120
No wonder Sun listens to Great Khan.

436
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,800
It's because of A'Yi'er.

437
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:44,339
- Where're you going?
- Mu Jin, it's a trap.

438
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:48,059
If Sun goes back alone, he'll be in danger.

439
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,019
Now, something must have happened to A'Yi'er.

440
00:38:52,019 --> 00:38:53,940
Let's go quickly!

441
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:57,559
Why are you here?

442
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,298
You said it. I can go wherever I want.

443
00:38:59,298 --> 00:39:01,420
I want to save A'Yi'er.

444
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:05,960
Call Eagle Division. If we can't save her, we can just grab her.

445
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,000
She'er!

446
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,239
You're finally here.

447
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:46,939
She'er, it's just something between us.

448
00:39:46,939 --> 00:39:48,678
Don't let innocent people get involved.

449
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:50,179
Okay.

450
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,660
As long as you kneel down and apologize to me,

451
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:55,080
maybe I won't kill her.

452
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,079
She'er, how dare you!

453
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,059
Of course, I dare.

454
00:40:12,499 --> 00:40:14,959
Now her life is depending on you.

455
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:17,420
Kneel or not, make your choice.

456
00:40:24,879 --> 00:40:27,439
It seems you need some help.

457
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,659
You threaten me with a woman.

458
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:51,278
She'er, you're a coward!

459
00:40:51,278 --> 00:40:52,438
You!

460
00:40:52,439 --> 00:40:55,860
If you're a real man, come and fight with me.

461
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,140
Don't let me look down on you!

462
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,840
General Sun, a wise man submits to fate.

463
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,060
You're not qualified to negotiate with Young Khan now.

464
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,900
Kneel or not?

465
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,520
Let my mother go.

466
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,799
Since you have kneeled down, what about having a kowtow?

467
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,040
Entertain us.

468
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,720
What?

469
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,959
Your dignity is more important than your mother's life?

♫ <i>The cocoon in the dark night</i> ♫

490
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:32,239
♫ <i>There's always a moment</i> ♫

491
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:38,069
♫ <i>where the wilderness burns in my heart</i> ♫

492
00:44:38,069 --> 00:44:41,579
♫ <i>There's always solicitude</i> ♫

493
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:48,090
♫ <i>which froze everything between you and me</i> ♫

494
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:50,449
♫ <i>Meet each other in different time</i> ♫

495
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:52,819
♫ <i>Encourage each other in different worlds</i> ♫

496
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:57,399
♫ <i>My longings become a cocoon</i> ♫

497
00:44:57,399 --> 00:45:00,270
♫ <i>Layer after layer</i> ♫

498
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:02,169
♫ <i>It turns into an eternity</i> ♫

499
00:45:02,169 --> 00:45:09,580
♫ <i>The cocoon in the dark night</i> ♫

500
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,150
♫ <i>It is sleepless</i> ♫
