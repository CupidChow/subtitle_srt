22
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,120
General, the water is ready.

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,818
Su Yishe and Nu'er are exploring the way ahead.

24
00:01:42,818 --> 00:01:46,839
And found substitutes for us to head for the grassland through the pass.

25
00:01:46,839 --> 00:01:49,159
But according to our speed now,

26
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,120
it will take us half a month to get to Youzhou.

27
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,599
Half a month?

28
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,199
Half a month will be too long.

29
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:58,098
- We have to hurry up.
- Yes.

30
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,740
That is...

31
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,899
How could there be a dead body?

32
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,420
Why is it him again?

33
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,378
General, what's wrong?

34
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:48,158
Ya Luo, find a place to stay.

35
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:49,639
Yes.

36
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:55,438
- General, let me carry him.
- No.

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,339
When did he change to a busybody?

38
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:01,819
Hold him as if it's a treasure.

39
00:03:13,179 --> 00:03:14,999
Search carefully!

40
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:17,259
Dead or alive, we must find the body!

41
00:03:17,259 --> 00:03:19,060
<i>Yes!</i>

42
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:28,859
Wei Shuyu, congratulations!

43
00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:30,739
For what?

44
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:32,719
You intercepted Li Changge yourself.

45
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,959
And then you took the first place to shoot her.

46
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,020
You made great contributions to clearing the leftover traitor.

47
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:42,799
Of course, I should tell His Highness to publicize your contribution.

48
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,038
Hao Du, you are so ruthless. Are you not?

49
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:48,319
Aren't you clear whether Changge is guilty or not?

50
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,219
It's not important what I am thinking.

51
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:54,939
I just follow Father's order. What he orders is what I think.

52
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:57,620
But, Wei Shuyu, I also have some advice for you.

53
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,120
We cannot have it both ways in this world.

54
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,318
If you want your family, be obedient and follow my order.

55
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,719
General, this is where hunters take a rest.

56
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,100
Few people will come.

57
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,238
Take the wine bottle and medicine, and a set of clothes.

58
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,639
Yes.

59
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,560
Shameless!

60
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,958
Why did you hit me?

61
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,938
- What are you doing?
- Can't you see what I am doing?

62
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:39,000
What did you see?

63
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,038
You are a man. What can I see?

64
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:44,120
Then, why are you covering your eyes?

65
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,079
I don't like blood.

66
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,300
I don't want to see your wound.

67
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,100
Since you are so marvelous, then do it yourself.

68
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,359
I didn't ask you for help.

69
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,720
Aliqi.

70
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,958
- What does it mean?
- Spirit Wine from the West.

71
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:51,819
Much better. Thanks!

72
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:53,879
Are you foolish?

73
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,439
Bear it!

74
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,199
You are a real man.

75
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,939
Give him the medicine.

76
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,460
Don't touch me!

77
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,278
Don't cry aloud like a woman!

78
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,798
We don't have to wait till now if we want to hurt you.

79
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:20,799
Leave him alone. He's really ungrateful.

80
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:22,320
Go.

81
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:55,858
Father, what's wrong?

82
00:07:55,858 --> 00:08:00,280
Prince Qin was here just now and I scolded him.

83
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,759
I think he will send someone here soon,

84
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,400
and put me to death.

85
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:10,098
Father, I'll prepare for the carriage now.

86
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:12,219
Please escape to our hometown of Quyang first.

87
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:13,639
I'll find Mr. Du now.

88
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,440
Shuyu, your father is not a coward.

89
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:22,800
But...

90
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,010
sorry for getting you involved.

91
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:40,259
Father, it's my fault.

92
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:46,059
I'm not strong enough to protect my father, nor my family.

93
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:53,300
Stand up.

94
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,119
What I did has nothing to do with you.

95
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:01,079
Today, Prince Qin came to our house,

96
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:05,500
so he is really a broad-minded man.

97
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,780
If you want to work for Prince Qin,

98
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,180
I won't stop you.

99
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:18,778
Father, I don't know whether it is the right choice or not.

100
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:28,680
<i>[Quite Calm to Move Forward]</i>

101
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:49,998
Mr. Wei, this is what His Highness asked me to deliver to you.

102
00:09:49,998 --> 00:09:52,218
Father. No!

103
00:09:52,218 --> 00:09:54,610
I'll plead to his Highness and Mr. Du.

104
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,390
- Shuyu.
- Father!

105
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,540
Accept it.

106
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,280
Mr. Wei, please enjoy.

107
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:22,839
Father. Father, no!

108
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:26,239
I'll plead to His Highness and Mr. Du.

109
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:32,159
What have I taught you since you were young?

110
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:34,579
Take off your hands.

111
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,340
Vinegar celery.

112
00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:56,079
<i>Advisor Fang always says that Mr. Wei loves vinegar celery.</i>

113
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,840
<i>Crown Princess Zhangsun made it with five flavors in person.</i>

114
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,259
<i>Just to show my gratitude.</i>

115
00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:04,018
<i>Today it was my fault.</i>

116
00:11:04,018 --> 00:11:07,099
<i>Please forgive me.</i>

117
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,739
F-Father.

118
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:13,960
Father!

119
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,759
Father! No!

120
00:11:19,159 --> 00:11:20,659
Fa...

121
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,379
I was too narrow-minded.

122
00:11:35,379 --> 00:11:39,880
But Prince Qin knows when to yield and when not.

123
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,979
Although we are from different sides,

124
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:46,180
I never say it out, but I am clear in mind.

125
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,860
Prince Qin is benevolent and generous,

126
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:52,879
but also resolute in his decisions.

127
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,919
No one can stop this mishap.

128
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:00,118
As for my loyalty to my master,

129
00:12:00,118 --> 00:12:03,859
I can decline him for my whole life.

130
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:08,379
But the lands we are in still belong to Great Tang.

131
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:14,060
People here are still people of Great Tang.

132
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:22,159
My long-cherished wish is just for repaying Great Tang.

133
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,199
Father, I know.

134
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,900
For my whole life, I'm convinced by only a few people.

135
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,980
This vinegar celery...

136
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,780
has convinced me!

137
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:24,539
Thanks.

138
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:26,759
I misunderstood you earlier.

139
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:31,359
- You saved my life, I will—
- No need for it.

140
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,058
You don't owe me anything. There's nothing between us.

141
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:39,559
That would be good.

142
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,780
Well... Can I have a sip of this wine?

143
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,840
Yes,

144
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,060
but I never suffer any loss in business.

145
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,259
Why not make an exchange? I can give you the wine.

146
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:58,439
You need to answer my questions. What do you think?

147
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,678
It is impolite not to reciprocate.

148
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:03,599
Then let's play a game. Do you dare?

149
00:14:03,599 --> 00:14:05,880
Of course.

150
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,299
We ask each other questions in turn.

151
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:13,219
If one can not answer, then one should drink as a forfeit.

152
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,759
Okay.

153
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,959
Go ahead.

154
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,579
Where did you get the wound on your shoulder?

155
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,680
Soldiers from the court shot me.

156
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,299
You are so straightforward.

157
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:38,939
Since it's an exchange, no one is allowed to lie.

158
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:41,000
My turn.

159
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,358
What's your name?

160
00:14:43,359 --> 00:14:46,239
Surname, Qin. Zhun.

161
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:48,100
You can call me A'Zhun.

162
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,800
A'Zhun...

163
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,440
You?

164
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,579
Surname, Li. I was the 14th child in the family.

165
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:56,019
Call me Shisi.

166
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:59,379
Why did you want my dagger?

167
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:02,379
I just wanted to embarrass you.

168
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,699
I knew you were a bad guy.

169
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,999
A'Zhun, where are you from?

170
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm from the central plains; born beyond the Great Wall.

171
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,539
- Then, where's your home?
- That's another question.

172
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,520
Next,

173
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:19,000
where are you planning to go?

174
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
To take revenge.

175
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,780
Then, what about you?

176
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:31,799
To the north. Revenge for what?

177
00:15:42,479 --> 00:15:46,220
- What to do in the north?
- A huge business.

178
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,819
Since you have answered it, why did you take a drink?

179
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:56,939
Because you will ask me about the business,

180
00:15:56,939 --> 00:15:58,680
and I cannot answer.

181
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,740
I will be drunk if I keep drinking.

182
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,180
Then the last question.

183
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:16,800
Are you really called A'Zhun?

184
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,399
Then, Shisi,

185
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,599
are you really Shisi?

186
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,398
<i>- Good! Cheers!
- Come on!</i>

187
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,599
<i>- Again!
- Drink!</i>

188
00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:45,920
What is General talking with him?

189
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,299
I've not heard a laugh like that from him in a long time.

190
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,479
General has been leading Eagle Division for years,

191
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:52,419
but Great Khan is always suspicious of him.

192
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:55,158
And he always got impeded by that deadly foe.

193
00:16:55,159 --> 00:16:57,079
Under such a situation,

194
00:16:57,079 --> 00:16:59,939
if it were you, could you laugh?

195
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,959
Yes, you are right.

196
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:06,219
But never mind that, don't be upset by that.

197
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:12,059
But I haven't seen him caring about anyone so much.

198
00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:17,750
<i>[Game of Go]</i>

199
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,360
Your Highness,

200
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,900
Princess Yongning has nothing to do with the rumor.

201
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,719
It seems that it was done by others.

202
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:42,758
As for Princess Yongning, it was my fault to let her escape.

203
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,600
Fine.

204
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,900
These days, massive forces have already yielded surrender.

205
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,119
Even if she has any movement, it won't cause big trouble.

206
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:56,199
Just pay more attention to her.

207
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:57,819
Yes.

208
00:17:58,479 --> 00:18:00,779
Keming.

209
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,439
Do you need anything else, Your Highness?

210
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,340
What Changge took away with her,

211
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,660
is an important item of the court.

212
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,000
No matter what,

213
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,900
no one can keep it.

214
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,940
I understand.

215
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,659
<i>Wei Zheng was right.</i>

00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:55,019
<i>I'm the most ruthless person in this world.</i>

217
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,359
- Princess.
- Mr. Du.

218
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:11,619
His Highness is in there. You can go in.

219
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,020
General.

220
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,700
Let's set off.

221
00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:55,798
- Where is that boy?
- He's gone.

222
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:57,539
Gone?

223
00:19:58,439 --> 00:20:00,699
Why didn't he say anything and just left?

224
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,160
Su Yishe, send a scout back to the Eagle Division.

225
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,839
Ask them to prepare these, and wait for me outside You State,

226
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:10,800
and hand this to Great Khan.

227
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,819
Don't worry, General.

228
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:13,319
Go.

229
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:24,600
General, what should we do after we get You State?

230
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:29,259
I've already asked Su Yishe to prepare the road stone.

231
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,760
<i>[Bring Forth Harmony and Peace]</i>

232
00:20:41,739 --> 00:20:45,260
Greetings, Father.

233
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,680
It's hard for you to see me yourself.

234
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,480
Did anything happen?

235
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,200
Nothing.

236
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,379
I just want to come to see you.

237
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:55,999
That's so considerate of you.

238
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:58,879
If nothing is wrong, just go back and have some rest.

239
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,920
I still have some business to handle.

240
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:14,020
I want to ask you... about Changge.

241
00:21:16,879 --> 00:21:19,120
Please don't harm her.

242
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,238
Changge just has a bad temper.

243
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,039
- But she—
- Yan'er.

244
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:36,759
Yan'er,

245
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,720
forget that Changge exists in this world.

246
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,219
It's good for both you and her.

247
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:49,099
Father!

248
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:51,879
Your Highness, the court sent someone here.

249
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,879
He is here to see the princess.

250
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,119
His Majesty heard that the princess harbors great righteousness in mind,

251
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,459
and would love to marry into the grassland.

252
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:06,079
I am here to send rewards and the imperial edict.

253
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:08,800
Please accept it, Princess.

254
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:25,338
Crown Prince's daughter, young and quiet,

255
00:22:25,338 --> 00:22:26,858
as one of the members of the royal family,

256
00:22:26,858 --> 00:22:30,239
all your reward is according to the regime.

257
00:22:30,239 --> 00:22:32,179
Now you are Royal Princess Yongan,

258
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:33,879
you can get the rewards of 3,000 households,

259
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,660
and this is executed at once.

260
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:48,018
Noble Princess Yongan, hurry and accept it!

261
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,980
I accept it with pleasure.

262
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,339
Thanks to Your Majesty!

263
00:23:22,199 --> 00:23:26,800
I still have to marry into the grassland, right?

264
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,940
<i>[Du Mansion]</i>

265
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:56,939
Father, you have been upset since you came back from Hongyi Palace.

266
00:23:56,939 --> 00:24:00,600
Is that because His Highness is still concerned about Li Changge?

267
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,879
If she is still alive,

268
00:24:04,879 --> 00:24:07,598
then she'll be big trouble.

269
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:09,619
I can't understand.

270
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:12,999
Why can Li Changge make Crown Prince, Princess,

271
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,660
and the Wei family protect and defend her?

272
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,519
His Highness the Crown Prince is very affectionate towards her.

273
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,260
Princess is her good friend.

274
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,500
As for Young Master Wei,

275
00:24:32,739 --> 00:24:34,920
if Li Changge is alive,

276
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,260
she must go and find Wei Shuyu.

277
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,340
Keep an eye on Wei Shuyu.

278
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,199
Find the seal of the crown prince. And kill her.

279
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:45,159
I understand.

280
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:49,779
Hao Du, remember.

281
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:53,160
Never mind the trivial things when doing something important.

282
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:57,960
Never be tied by any affections.

283
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,880
Yes.

Nothing.

I've been here waiting for a whole day.

294
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,999
Since I know Master will head north,

295
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,899
then you must pass these boundary tablets on your way.

296
00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:54,999
Master, I've been with you for some days.

Am I making any progress?

But if you didn't show up,

299
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,800
I would doubt myself if I was wrong.

300
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:04,959
A'Dou,

301
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,159
I still have no idea where my future is.

302
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:11,779
You have a bright future.

303
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,578
Although you can't stay at Pinxiang Store,

304
00:26:14,578 --> 00:26:16,358
you have many other choices.

305
00:26:16,358 --> 00:26:17,780
Why must you follow me?

306
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,078
Master, you are my future.

307
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,879
I will be with you no matter alive or dead!

308
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,200
I said that and I won't be wrong.

309
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,058
My master must be a big hero!

310
00:26:26,058 --> 00:26:28,279
Which hero has no general with him?

311
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,079
I am my master's general!

312
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:36,339

Since you take me as your master, we have to obey the ritual.

00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,599
Master, please accept your apprentice's bow!

318
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:10,679
From now on, you are my apprentice.

319
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,860
We will never betray each other.

320
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,539
Okay.

321
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:18,419

My father's soldiers and horses are there.

Li Yuan, the Governor of You State, is my father's good friend.

Besides, if we can persuade him to help us,

there will be hope for us.

Far from that!

But...

333
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:32,780
My house is not good enough for you.

334
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,080
I am here to say sorry.

335
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,180
Mr. Wei was right.

336
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:44,979
I scolded you so much. Which one do you mean?

337
00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:16,179
This is for that plate of vinegar celery.

338
00:29:20,199 --> 00:29:23,779
Mr. Wei is also a father.

339
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:26,340
When you were risking it for Jiancheng,

340
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,459
did you think about Shuyu?

341
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:33,820
Don't worry. I have some farmlands at home,

342
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,078
it's enough for my boys.

343
00:29:36,078 --> 00:29:41,819
So a man like Mr. Wei also worries about his sons.

344
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:45,638
Your Highness, what do you want to say?

345
00:29:45,638 --> 00:29:48,500
Just a chat.

346
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,899
I also have kids and always worry about them.

347
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:54,860
I have read a lot.

348
00:29:54,860 --> 00:30:00,319
But I have no idea how to protect them as their parent.

349
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,020
I'm a father,

350
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,520
I can feel your love for your kids.

351
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,860
I heard about the marriage of Princess Yongan.

352
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,880
If you're worried about it,

353
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,959
then I may give you a suggestion.

354
00:30:21,639 --> 00:30:23,839
Please.

355
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,359
What? I suffer a strange disease?

356
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,300
Yes.

357
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,718
Remember. This strange disease can not be cured so quickly,

358
00:30:31,718 --> 00:30:34,380
and you have to go to Luoyang to get medical treatment.

359
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,579
Luoyang?

360
00:30:35,579 --> 00:30:36,819
Yes.

361
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:39,299
I have already arranged for you.

362
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:42,020
Start your trip as soon as possible.

363
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,720
Go!

364
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,358
You always cry.

365
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:01,659
How could you be a princess if you are so weak?

366
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,199
You should learn from Changge!

367
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,740
Yan'er, because you suffer from this,

368
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,679
for the time being, you can't marry so far.

369
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,399
Understand?

370
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,939
Stay in Luoyang for treatment.

371
00:31:31,939 --> 00:31:36,719
I will send someone to take you back as soon as you are recovered.

372

I know you get on well with Young Master Wei.

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,120
I have asked him to escort you to Luoyang.

Yes.

448

Okay, have some rest first.

449
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,760
And I will prepare the hot water for you.

450
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,718
I will explore around Governor Manor. You stay here.

453
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,279
Master, just endure it.

454
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,398
It is good enough for the boss to provide us with the warehouse.

455
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:03,600
I will clean it up.

456
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,999
And make it a cozy place for you to have a rest.

457
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,198
A'Dou, don't be too tired.

458
00:37:08,199 --> 00:37:09,519
I'm okay with that.

459
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,199
I'm not tired, Master. Have some rest now! Rest now!

460
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,239

You are just a little boy, it'd be strange for you to go with me.

463
00:37:18,859 --> 00:37:21,659
Sleep early. I'll bring you some food.

Brother Shuyu, am I going to leave tomorrow?

468
00:38:03,238 --> 00:38:05,119
The view of Luoyang palace is very splendid.

469
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,579
Those servants will be by your side.

470
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:17,579
Those days when we could play together are just like a dream.

471
00:38:18,399 --> 00:38:21,919
We three were so good together,

472
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:25,919
but now we have to be separated remotely.

473
00:38:25,919 --> 00:38:27,478
And head to different places.

474
00:38:27,479 --> 00:38:29,880
All good things must come to an end.

475
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,659
No one can stay with each other for their whole life.

Brother Shuyu, I understand.

477
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,539
I have to wake up.

478
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,579
We have grown up.

479
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,920
Brother Shuyu, could you...

480
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,900
could you write to me when you are free?

481
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:58,739
As soon as you get news about Changge, tell me.

482
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:02,279
I promise you. I will find her.

I never thought that you could be so quick.

485
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,280
I can catch up with you until you are almost at Luoyang.

486
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:46,060

487
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,479
A decree from Crown Prince.

488
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:53,299
Wei Shuyu is assigned as the special envoy of Chang'an.

489
00:39:53,299 --> 00:39:55,180
No need to go back to Chang'an.

490
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,738
Go with Hao Du to You State.

491

Please tell me. Do you have news about her?

00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,500
You hope it's a yes, or a no?

494
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:16,839
No matter what, you have to go with me.

495
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:20,558
Besides, you just need to issue the decree.

496
00:40:20,558 --> 00:40:24,319
As for others, stay away from it.

497
