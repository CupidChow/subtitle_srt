♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

00:00:06,949 --> 00:00:09,909
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:14,680
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,819
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,819 --> 00:00:24,700
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,869
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

7

20
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:25,680


21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,230
   

22
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:37,129
   

23
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,789
That's a lot to ask.

24
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:43,849
I can promise you to cure Mu Jin.

25
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,648
As for your father, when the Eagle Division wins the war for me,

26
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:51,888
I'll let you see him.

27
00:01:51,888 --> 00:01:54,190
You finally admit it.

28
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,188
It is you who got my father ill.

29
00:01:56,188 --> 00:02:00,769
Now you tell me this, does it make sense?

30
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,190
He deserved it.

31
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:15,268
I killed many people for his throne.

32
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:20,229
You mean you killed Khan Shule, too?

33
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:23,379
I married to a faraway place.

34
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:27,659
I didn't have many options.

35
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,838
You killed She'er's father.

36
00:02:31,838 --> 00:02:33,559
Have you ever thought about him?

37
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:36,439
When did you start to care about him?

38
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:39,759
He's my son. You don't need to worry.

39
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,160
Mother!

40
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:18,179
Mother.

41
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:23,939
You told me my father died of a sudden illness.

42
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,039
What are you doing here?

43
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:36,200
You told me if I sincerely pray to Sirius,

44
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,369
he wouldn't take Father away.

45
00:03:39,369 --> 00:03:40,968
I knelt along the river every day

46
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:45,768
to secretly pray to Sirius for his recovery,

47
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:48,389
and for him not to leave us.

48
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,219
Mother, answer me.

49
00:03:55,279 --> 00:04:00,079
I remember when I was young, Father always told me we are men,

50
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,378
we should protect you, and give all the best to you.

51
00:04:03,378 --> 00:04:06,699
Even if you wanted the stars, he would fly to the sky and pick them for you.

52
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,400
Mother.

53
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,600
Why?

54
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,900
Because if your father was alive,

55
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:22,690
if Khan Yanli's alive,

56
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,230
I can never go back to my homeland alive,

57
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,469
and I would never revive Sui.

58
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:35,258
But the grasslands are also your home.

59
00:04:35,258 --> 00:04:36,799
Sui Dynasty is gone.

60
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:38,658
Shut up!

61
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:42,299
To me, the grasslands are only a cage.

62
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,600
I'm the daughter of the Sui Dynasty.

63
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,080
Once I live in this world, it can never perish.

64
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:56,650
I've been on this way for so long, so far.

65
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:03,170
The Sui Dynasty shall rise again.

66
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,820
It won't take long!

67
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,000
You're insane.

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,259
You're crazy!

69
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,200
Crazy.

70
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,060
You've been lying to me for so long.

71
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:21,658
- Why? 
 - Guards!

72
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,859
Yes.

73
00:05:24,859 --> 00:05:29,379
Send Young Khan to his palace and take care of him.

74
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,808
Are you deaf? Do it now.

75
00:05:32,808 --> 00:05:34,509
 Yes! 

76
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,830
   

77
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,029
Prince Consort Du, congratulations!

78
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:15,209
You're welcome.

79
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:16,889
- Hao Du is fine. 
 - Okay.

80
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:18,889
Hao Du, where's Noble Princess?

81
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,749
Brother Shuyu.

82
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,838
Why are you here?

83
00:06:23,838 --> 00:06:25,558
I thought it would be Changge.

84
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:28,339
I bring something from her to you.

85
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,278
Changge embroidered this fan herself around the clock.

86
00:06:47,278 --> 00:06:50,500
It's a wedding gift for you and Prince Consort.

87
00:06:51,299 --> 00:06:53,299
Where is she?

88
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,559
She's gone.

89
00:06:56,559 --> 00:06:59,019
She was afraid of saying goodbye, especially to you.

90
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,139
So she asked me to give it to you.

91
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,458
She told me you'd always be a little rabbit deep down her heart.

92
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:07,260
You must be happy.

93
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,048
The couple of mandarin ducks is my blessing.

94
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:24,043
Hao Du, Yueyan will be my little sister forever.

95
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,667
You can't bully her.

96
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:29,800
If she's not happy, I'll take her away.

97
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,182
Take it easy. You'll never get the chance.

98
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:51,060
Hao Du, I'm afraid I will not be able to see Changge again in my lifetime.

99
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,319
Don't worry. I've checked it out.

100
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,165
Your father asked Li Jing to go to Dingxiang with troops.

101
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:59,319
My father recommended him a lot.

102
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:03,359
Changge's very smart. They'll be fine.

103
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:08,859
Yueyan...

104
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:13,888
I have a little favor to ask you.

105
00:08:13,888 --> 00:08:17,430
Do you need to ask me now?

106
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,489
My father is getting sicker day by day.

107
00:08:21,489 --> 00:08:25,669
His biggest wish is to see our wedding.

108
00:08:25,669 --> 00:08:28,050
But I'm afraid he can't get there.

109
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:35,609
I know. We can have a small wedding ceremony in the Du Manor.

110
00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:37,029
No royalty and nobles.

111
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:40,430
Only you, me and...

112
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,390
and Father.

113
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,929
But I don't want you to be treated wrongly.

114
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:49,429
No, it's not.

115
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,529
We can fulfill his wish.

116
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:53,950
It's worth it.

117
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:08,210
Li Shimin has appointed Li Jing, the Minister of War,

118
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,090
as the military chief of Dingxiang Division,

119
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,289
Li Ji, governor of Bing State, as military chief of Tonghan Division,

120
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:16,649
Chai Shao, governor of Hua State, as military chief of Jinhe Division,

121
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:18,249
Xue Wanche, the governor of Ling State,

122
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:20,028
as military chief of Changwu Division.

123
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:21,690
All of them follow the command of Li Jing.

124
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,728
They arrived at Eyangling Mountain yesterday.

125
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:25,009
How many people are together?

126
00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:27,010
More than 100 thousand.

127
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:30,809
Ashile Tribe has many subordinates.

128
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:35,609
If we get them together, we'll not necessarily lose to Li Jing.

129
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,528
How's the west line?

130
00:09:37,528 --> 00:09:41,588
Yesterday, Ashile Yugu was defeated by Pusa, the leader of Mobei.

131
00:09:41,588 --> 00:09:44,068
Monan's leader Yinan has united forces in the desert.

132
00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:46,868
They have defeated four divisions of the Ashile Tribe

133
00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:48,948
and captured four generals.

134
00:09:48,949 --> 00:09:53,229
Many tribes promised to dispatch but still haven't moved till now.

135
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,909
I guess...

136
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,510
Guess what?

137
00:09:57,309 --> 00:09:59,470
They've been bought off.

138
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,918
How's Mu Jin?

139
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:07,558
As you commanded, Mu Jin has only skin trauma.

140
00:10:07,558 --> 00:10:09,599
He's fine now. He can get out of bed.

141
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:13,500
All right. The master can meet his servant.

142
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,099
Bring Ashile Sun here.

143
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:20,539
Before seeing Mu Jin, he can see his Yanli.

144
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,378
Princess, considering Yanli's condition now,

145
00:10:23,378 --> 00:10:26,158
will it be bad for Ashile Sun to meet him?

146
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:29,279
In Dingxiang, there're two men Ashile Sun cares about most.

147
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,219
One is Mu Jin, the other one is Yanli.

148
00:10:32,219 --> 00:10:37,899
If he doesn't see them both, how can he help me without worry?

149
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:39,039
It's all right.

150
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:46,039
Just let him know how his father is controlled by me.

151
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:47,680
Yes.

152
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:23,200
Father, I'm late.

153
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,440
Father.

154
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:51,840
It's me, Sun.

155
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:33,619
Father, wait for me.

156
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,718
That's enough?

157
00:12:46,718 --> 00:12:51,419
Don't worry. I won't kill him.

158
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,250
Remember your word.

159
00:12:55,948 --> 00:13:01,148
Otherwise, I'll destroy Dingxiang with Eagle Division.

160
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:06,540
Now, please write a military order and send it to Mu Jin.

161
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,499
You have five days.

162
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:11,199
After that, I want to see elite troops of Eagle Division

163
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,698
gathering and waiting for my order at the Chengqi Gate of the palace.

164
00:13:14,698 --> 00:13:19,239
At that time, your father will be fine.

165
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:12,939
Be careful.

166
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:15,340
Sun.

167
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,358
I knew it was you.

168
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:19,060
Mu Jin,

169
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,760
I'm late.

170
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:27,358
How can they treat you like this?

171
00:14:27,359 --> 00:14:29,559
It's not important now.

172
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:31,679
You're alive. That's all.

173
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:35,320
He asked Lei Meng to supervise you.

174
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:37,699
You've suffered a lot for me.

175
00:14:37,699 --> 00:14:40,379
As brothers, don't say that.

176
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:43,119
Sun, why did you come here?

177
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:47,229
You and Father are in Dingxiang, how can I stay in Tang alone?

178
00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:48,489
Where's Mimi?

179
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:49,930
She came here, too.

180
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,130
But she can't see us now.

181
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:56,749
I've met Buzhen.

182
00:14:57,729 --> 00:15:02,189
Ashile Sun, Khatun didn't send you here for a greeting.

183
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,048
Mu Jin, I wrote this military order.

184
00:15:10,729 --> 00:15:13,668
Take it. Gather the Eagle Division.

185
00:15:13,668 --> 00:15:15,329
What?

186
00:15:28,713 --> 00:15:30,854
She'er.

187
00:15:40,209 --> 00:15:43,549
It's late now. Why come here for me?

188
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:45,540
Am I...

189
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,270
the stupidest idiot in this world?

190
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:53,730
You drank a lot. I'll send you back.

191
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:57,629
- You... 
 - Tell me.

192
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:01,109
Am I the stupidest idiot in this world?

193
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,769
My mother killed my father.

194
00:16:08,479 --> 00:16:13,178
Uncle Khan killed my wolf on purpose to drive a wedge between me and Sun.

195
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,918
Now she poisoned Uncle Khan.

196
00:16:18,918 --> 00:16:23,100
And I just got to know all of— What?

197
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,180
They dared to do that, but fear my words?

198
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,420
Liar...

199
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:45,570
All of you.

200
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,840
Everyone lied to me.

201
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,359
Take care.

202
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:13,839
Just go.

203
00:17:53,959 --> 00:17:55,759
You woke up?

204
00:17:57,319 --> 00:17:59,719
Why am I here?

205
00:17:59,719 --> 00:18:02,019
You drunk a lot last night.

206
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,100
Drink some water.

207
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,779
Thank you.

208
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:20,040
Why are you looking at me?

209
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,380
You... You're so kind.

210
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:28,379
She'er, I know you treat me as a friend.

211
00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:30,639
But we're different.

212
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,680
If Khatun knows you slept here last night,

213
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,620
I'll get scolded.

214
00:18:37,479 --> 00:18:41,279
Sorry. I'll go now.

215
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,759
I don't know why I came to you last night.

216
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,939
Maybe I think it's safe here. So...

217
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:59,518
If you're upset, just come to me.

218
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:02,000
Thank you.

219
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,900
Do you remember I told you I'd marry you the day I become Great Khan?

220
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,359
She'er.

221
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,219
But now I don't want to be Great Khan anymore.

222
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,940
   

223
00:19:49,297 --> 00:19:52,879
Are you afraid that I'll die?

224
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,198
No. You'll have a peaceful life with good fortune. 
    

225
00:19:56,198 --> 00:19:58,359
You're getting worse.

226
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,459
You can decide everything, can't you?

227
00:20:00,459 --> 00:20:03,136
You bring the ceremony forward in a hurry,

228
00:20:03,136 --> 00:20:06,118
won't the Noble Princess be aggrieved?

229
00:20:06,118 --> 00:20:08,869
She said she won't.

230
00:20:08,869 --> 00:20:10,749
I've confessed to His Majesty.

231
00:20:10,749 --> 00:20:13,768
His Majesty approved to make it simple.

232
00:20:13,768 --> 00:20:16,638
She doesn't want you to be embarrassed.

233
00:20:16,638 --> 00:20:20,179
You have a considerate wife.

234
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:22,360
How lucky you are.

235
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,009
Yes. I'll treat her well and devote my soul to His Majesty.

236
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,600
Father, how many friends do you want to invite?

237
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:35,348
You want a simple one. 
    

238
00:20:35,349 --> 00:20:38,569
Our family is enough. 
    

239
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:40,849
I'm sick now. 
    

240
00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:44,050
Don't let them worry.

241
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,449
That's it.

242
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:48,848
Father, you'll be fine.

243
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,589
I know my condition.

244
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:53,368
I worry about you.

245
00:20:53,368 --> 00:20:56,049
It's a great chance to make a contribution

246
00:20:56,049 --> 00:20:59,029
if you follow Li Jing to attack Dingxiang.

247
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:02,029
But you gave it up for me.

248
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,009
I know it all.

249
00:21:04,009 --> 00:21:07,850
Chances are everywhere, but I have only one father.

250
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,690
I don't want to have any regrets.

251
00:21:11,477 --> 00:21:14,036
Not afraid of my death, eh?

252
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:22,589
I heard Li Changge went to Dingxiang, too.

253
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,468
Yes.

254
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:30,349
Once the ceremony ends, set out to Dingxiang.

255
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:46,469
If Li Changge dies, you'll break your promise to Noble Princess.

256
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:51,829
But your condition...

257
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:53,508
Don't care about me.

258
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:57,508
You've fulfilled your filial piety to me with an advanced wedding.

259
00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:00,709
It's a critical moment.

260
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:03,629
You should be loyal to His Majesty,

261
00:22:03,629 --> 00:22:07,409
and also protect the person Noble Princess cares about.

262
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:11,329
That's what a husband should do.

263
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:15,929
I know, Father.

264
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:28,510
Father, you have to wait for me.

265
00:22:29,189 --> 00:22:33,929
I won't leave you before the battle of Dingxiang ends.

266
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,540
   

267
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:03,990
You never thought of me leading the army out.

268
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:07,069
You just used me to assemble the Eagle Division.

269
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,759
Good tactics, Khatun.

270
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:11,858
War allows deceit.

271
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:14,559
You live in wars.

272
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:16,899
I guess you know it well.

273
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:22,438
When the war ends, I'll allow you to greet your Eagle Division.

274
00:23:22,438 --> 00:23:26,939
If you were a man, people would fear you.

275
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,800
Listen.

276
00:23:33,699 --> 00:23:35,520
Eagle Division is coming.

277
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,280
They're gathering at the gate.

278
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,979
Guess who will issue the order?

279
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,900
Because of you, Father's too sick to say a word.

280
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,119
How can he issue the order?

281
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:49,740
If he's here, it's all right.

282
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,839
I can do it on his behalf.

283
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:02,059
Why is General Sun not here?

284
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,390
   

285
00:24:15,139 --> 00:24:16,519
What happened to the Great Khan?

286
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:19,219
Only Khatun knows.

287
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,119
You stick with the plan later.

288
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,720
Use the fire.

289
00:25:13,239 --> 00:25:15,478
 Rescue Khan and turn to Li Jing. 

290
00:25:15,478 --> 00:25:17,279
 Don't worry about me. 

291
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:42,040
Where do we go when we're out?

292
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,398
Go meet the Tang army.

293
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,019
Princess.

294
00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:07,738
Why so noisy out there? What happened?

295
00:26:07,738 --> 00:26:09,919
The Eagle Division betrayed us and hijacked the Great Khan.

296
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,499
They're out of the city now.

297
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,300
What?

298
00:26:19,699 --> 00:26:22,999
Ashile Sun, it was you.

299
00:26:25,528 --> 00:26:28,249
War allows deceit.

300
00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:32,827
You made all the plans, but the eagle pecked at your eyes.

301
00:26:32,827 --> 00:26:37,418
You pretended to be deceived so you could rescue Yanli.

302
00:26:37,418 --> 00:26:38,838
You're not a man.

303
00:26:38,838 --> 00:26:40,899
You can't issue the order.

304
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,478
You won't allow She'er to do that, me neither.

305
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:47,779
So the Great Khan is your only choice.

306
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:50,118
Ashile Sun, you're great.

307
00:26:50,118 --> 00:26:52,438
You aren't afraid of dying, are you?

308
00:26:52,438 --> 00:26:56,780
If I hadn't done this, you wouldn't let me go, would you?

309
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,060
Lei Meng.

310
00:26:59,060 --> 00:26:59,839
Yes.

311
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:02,220
My order to all divisions in the grasslands.

312
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,379
The Eagle Division turned traitor and hijacked the Great Khan.

313
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,958
Dingxiang's cavalry failed to catch them.

314
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:07,958
The Great Khan has been killed by the Eagle Division.

315
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:11,099
I have his token and exercise the power.

316
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,899
Yes.

317
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,579
Not enough. Inform commanders of the Ashile Tribe.

318
00:27:14,579 --> 00:27:16,599
Set off to Dingxiang right now.

319
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:19,659
Three days later, at noon, I'll show an example of betrayal.

320
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:21,160
As you command.

321
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,500
Show an example of betrayal.

322
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:32,239
But I've never thought I could leave here alive after I came to Dingxiang.

323
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:37,079
Being smeared and killed is totally better than being your stooge.

324
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,379
Don't worry. Your death will be useful.

325
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:49,400
Every division will know clearly what betrayal means.

326
00:28:04,479 --> 00:28:12,779
 Changge, if only I could be with you forever. 

327
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:18,239
 But I can't keep my words. 

328
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
   

329
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,300
Xibi Division comes.

330
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,919
Shixin comes, too.

331
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,158
Young Master, why are you hitting me when we just met?

332
00:28:40,158 --> 00:28:41,379
Why are you here?

333
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:43,659
I informed him.

334
00:28:43,659 --> 00:28:45,259
Don't scold me.

335
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:50,378
If you didn't leave without notice, I wouldn't have done that.

336
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:52,659
I thought of it, I still worry about you.

337
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:55,059
So I told him to come.

338
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:56,618
Princess Tujia was right.

339
00:28:56,618 --> 00:28:59,338
Young Master, why come here alone? It's dangerous.

340
00:28:59,338 --> 00:29:00,939
I was worried about you when I knew it.

341
00:29:00,939 --> 00:29:03,859
My men in Yanxing Sect have taken the lead.

342
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,580
Shiba and Situ Langlang are going to be here soon.

343
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,839
Shuyu.

344
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:14,598
General Li and I pleaded to help you.

345
00:29:14,598 --> 00:29:17,538
We met your friends and knew you were here.

346
00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:21,178
Thank God. We can do it together again.

347
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:23,979
He's right. Friends should share the good and the bad.

348
00:29:23,979 --> 00:29:26,459
Don't worry. We're all standing by your side.

349
00:29:26,459 --> 00:29:29,319
We'll help you to rescue your Mr. Right.

350
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,118
Thank you all.

351
00:29:33,118 --> 00:29:35,860
Then... What should we do now?

352
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,819
Enter the gate first. We're a group.

353
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,539
We must find a better way to go inside.

354
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:56,799
Get into the city? I can do that.

355
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,218
Look. 
    

356
00:29:59,219 --> 00:29:59,899
   

357
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,698
All tribes controlled by the Ashile Tribe have this token.

358
00:30:03,699 --> 00:30:04,659
It's a sign of loyalty.

359
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,979
You can even go into Khan's tent with it.

360
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,099
You stole your father's token?

361
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:11,519
We can't get inside without it.

362
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:15,039
Anyway, I took it from my father. It's not stealing it.

363
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,719
I just borrowed it for a while.

364
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:18,159
It'll be useless in the future.

365
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,960
Just trash.

366
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,719
Let's go, okay?

367
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,530
   

368
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,290
   

369
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,879
♫  Life is stubborn  ♫

370
00:30:59,879 --> 00:31:03,320
♫  so I choose to go ahead alone  ♫

371
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,119

383

384
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:29,139

387
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:39,400
First bow.

388
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,299
♫  I fall in love at first sight  ♫

389

♫  What's love?  It's in daily life  ♫

392

Third bow.

393
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,639
Kowtow.

394
00:32:56,639 --> 00:32:58,020
♫  Not afraid to be exiled from loneliness  ♫

395

♫  I'm flying in the sky  ♫

396
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,698
Get up, please.

397
00:33:03,699 --> 00:33:04,619
Rise.

398
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:09,520
♫  My only wish is your happiness  ♫

399

♫  My only wish is your happiness  ♫

405
00:34:19,819 --> 00:34:21,219
I...

406
00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:24,039
Now, I...

407
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:28,979
I think it's like a dream.

408
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:31,740
I can't believe it's real.

409
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:39,618
From now on, I'm your wife.

410
00:34:39,618 --> 00:34:43,398
We will never leave or abandon each other.

411
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:45,459
We'll be together till the end.

412
00:34:45,459 --> 00:34:48,959
Dear Wife, I swear to you...

413
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,258
It's the wedding night.

414
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:56,040
Don't say anything ominous.

415
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:02,759
I believe in you.

416
00:35:06,259 --> 00:35:11,279
But I have to leave for Dingxiang tomorrow.

417
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:13,338
You must go.

418
00:35:13,338 --> 00:35:19,839
But promise me, Dear, take care of yourself, protect Changge,

419
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,800
and help Li Jing put down the rebellion.

420
00:35:24,819 --> 00:35:27,720
Father and I, we will be waiting for you.

421
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,260
I will.

422
00:35:30,499 --> 00:35:32,500
I'll do everything you want.

423
00:36:01,779 --> 00:36:04,379
- Where's Xu Feng? 
 - He's getting information.

424
00:36:04,379 --> 00:36:06,798
He can play his strengths everywhere.

425
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:09,699
I need you to do something urgent and important. Only you can do that.

426
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:11,099
What?

427
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:14,999
Buy some flour, nuts, and yuk butter. All materials for moon cakes.

428
00:36:14,999 --> 00:36:16,760
And sky lanterns.

429
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,800
It's urgent and important?

430
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,179
Changge, what are you going to do?

431
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,980
Call our people inside.

432
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,398
Young Master. I know why tribe commanders were summoned to the city.

433
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,139
Mimi.

434
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,040
- She'er. 
 - Why are you here?

435
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,219
Bad news. Khatun summoned tribe commanders to the city.

436
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,279
Tomorrow, at noon, they'll behead Ashile Sun.

437
00:36:41,279 --> 00:36:43,498
His head will be passed around tribes as a warning.

438
00:36:43,499 --> 00:36:44,999
What?

439
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,619
No. It can't happen.

440
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,738
What are you planning?

441
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:54,338
You know Khatun well, don't you?

442
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:57,499
No one can change her decision.

443
00:37:03,299 --> 00:37:04,258
Bad luck gets together.

444
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:07,179
Who lights sky lanterns today? It's not a holiday.

445
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,160
Mimi.

446
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:13,959
She'er, do you want to eat moon cakes?

447
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:15,460
What?

448
00:37:20,299 --> 00:37:22,538
I entrust Great Khan to you, General.

449
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:23,619
Take it easy.

450
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,859
I have a gentlemen's covenant with Elder Qin.

451
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,538
He'll be safe with me.

452
00:37:28,539 --> 00:37:30,039
Thank you very much.

453
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,000
You're not staying. Where are going to?

454
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,878
Mission's completed. I have something private to do.

455
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:53,560
You...

456
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,600
Mu Jin, I know it.

457
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,700
We're brothers. Why are you leaving us alone?

458
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:02,219
What? Only you can take responsibility to rescue General?

459
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,099
Right!

460
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,819
You don't trust us, do you?

461
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:14,339
Follow me!

462
00:38:33,259 --> 00:38:36,179
We've received orders. No one gets out.

463
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:39,419
Gentlemen, I'm the servant of Young Khan.

464
00:38:39,419 --> 00:38:43,459
He has been having a bad appetite recently and is wanting to eat some moon cakes.

465
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:47,000
Could you please buy some moon cakes for me?

466
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,679
It's not Mid-Autumn Festival.

467
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:50,058
Where can I find moon cakes?

468
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:53,159
Go and you can find them.

469
00:38:55,979 --> 00:39:00,279
If Young Khan can eat moon cakes, Khatun will feel better.

470
00:39:00,279 --> 00:39:04,800
Keep the change for some drinks.

471
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,018
Okay, I'll go find it when I take a break.

472
00:39:08,018 --> 00:39:11,441
But if I can't find it, please don't blame me.

473
00:39:11,441 --> 00:39:13,441
Thank you very much.

474
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,539
Try another one, please.

475
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:20,520
This kettle is fine.

476
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,838
Moon cake with mixed nuts.

477
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:26,759
Fresh moon cakes here.

478
00:39:26,759 --> 00:39:29,240
Moon cake. Mixed nuts.

479
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,460
   

480
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,720
Moon cake.

481
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,739
Moon cake with mixed nuts.

482
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,068
I want these two.

483
00:39:38,068 --> 00:39:39,769
Sure, sir.

484
00:39:40,810 --> 00:39:42,710
Please take it.

485
00:39:53,929 --> 00:39:56,129
Master.

486
00:39:56,129 --> 00:39:59,849
I'm quicker than you thought, right?

487
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:02,548
Luo Shiba and I galloped day and night.

488
00:40:02,549 --> 00:40:05,009
Several horses died on the way.

489
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:09,379
And you, how stupid you are.

490
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,610
Do you really think you're invulnerable?

491
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,868
How can you come to Dingxiang alone?

492
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,869
Master.

493
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:18,889
Luo Shiba has met our guys at the inn.

494
00:40:18,889 --> 00:40:20,548
What should I do?

495
00:40:20,548 --> 00:40:21,949
Tell me now.

496
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:24,228
It's less than six hours before noon.

497
00:40:24,229 --> 00:40:26,788
Take some people and find Wei Shuyu.

498
00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:29,670
We have a plan.

499
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,510
Take care of yourself.

500
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:43,988
Think about it again. We can leave right now.

501
00:40:43,988 --> 00:40:46,689
- You can pretend to be innocent. 
 - Where's Li Changge's letter? Give it to me now.

502
00:40:46,689 --> 00:40:49,010
There's not much time left for Sun.

503
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:54,169
Have you really decided to go against your mother?

504
00:40:54,169 --> 00:40:57,568
No. She's my mother forever.

505
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:01,429
I just want to mitigate her crime.

506
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:26,370
She'er.

507
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:30,250
   

508
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:34,089
I'll do that.

509
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:37,708
I'm the Young Khan. It's not difficult for me.

510
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:48,750
She'er... thank you.

511
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,320
I said I'm mitigating a crime for my mother.

512
00:41:53,259 --> 00:41:56,260
I don't want to see Sun dying in front of me.

513
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:15,559
Young Master, what are you waiting for?

514
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:17,860
Ashile Sun will be beheaded in a minute.

515
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,678
We're waiting for a map, telling us where the execution platform is,

516
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:28,019
where the Prince of Sui, Empress Xiao, and Mimi live, paths to escape,

517
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:30,678
and gates with weak defense.

518
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:33,398
We need them before action.

519
00:42:33,399 --> 00:42:35,199
How can it be that accurate?

520
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,439
Unless... you have a spy in the palace.

521
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:43,578
It can't be Mimi.

522
00:42:43,578 --> 00:42:44,959
Stop saying that.

523
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,879
Really? It's Mimi?

524
00:42:48,879 --> 00:42:51,862
So... I was wrong about her.

525
00:42:51,862 --> 00:42:54,823
Yicheng's been threatening Mimi for so long.

526
00:42:54,823 --> 00:42:57,133
But she didn't give in.

527
00:42:57,133 --> 00:42:59,639
And she's been helping us secretly.

528
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:12,370


529
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:16,039
♫  The heart gradually responds,  ♫

530
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:18,319
♫  gradually revives,  ♫

531
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:21,839
♫  gradually swims towards you  ♫

532
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:25,990
♫  Before bidding farewell,  ♫

533
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:29,120
♫  we expect an encounter  ♫

534
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:34,699
♫  As your silhouette weaves  ♫

535
00:43:34,699 --> 00:43:40,049
♫  and locks in my nostalgic dream  ♫

536
00:43:40,049 --> 00:43:42,729
♫  Before the daybreak,  ♫

537
00:43:42,729 --> 00:43:45,119
♫  through the obsession of love,  ♫

538
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,049
♫  the yearning flowing through thoughts  ♫

539
00:43:49,049 --> 00:43:52,419
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

540
00:43:52,419 --> 00:43:58,320
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

541
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,759
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

542
00:44:01,759 --> 00:44:08,279
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

543
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:10,669
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

544
00:44:10,669 --> 00:44:13,049
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

545
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:17,619
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

546
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:20,379
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

547
00:44:20,379 --> 00:44:22,419
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

548
00:44:22,419 --> 00:44:28,890
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

549
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,599
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

550
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:42,429
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

551
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:45,939
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

552
00:44:45,939 --> 00:44:52,449
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

553
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:54,810
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

554
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:57,179
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

555
00:44:57,179 --> 00:45:01,759
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

559
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,310
♫  It is sleepless  ♫

560
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:35,640
