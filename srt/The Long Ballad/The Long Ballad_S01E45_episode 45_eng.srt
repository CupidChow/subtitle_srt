1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,100
♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,859
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:15,030
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,770
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:24,950
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,719
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

7
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,689
♫   Tears and regrets go hand in hand   ♫

8
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:34,789
♫   But my heart is still fiery-hot   ♫

9
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,740
♫  To the distance  ♫

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,709
♫  The miserable past is like a dagger  ♫

11
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:43,619
♫  Though my wings are broken  ♫

12
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:51,140
♫  I will keep flying  ♫

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,199
♫  Following the direction of the light  ♫

14
00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:58,460
♫  I'll forget you  ♫

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,360
♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,359
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,309
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,470
♫  The river of life is under my feet  ♫

19
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:17,950
♫  I don't regret my craziness  ♫

20
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:25,860


21
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,899
   

22
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,724
   

23
00:01:36,724 --> 00:01:40,158
But for what I saw and heard in person,

24
00:01:40,158 --> 00:01:41,939
I can't believe all this.

25
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:44,979
I remained unexposed just to see

26
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:49,700
how many skeletons the Ashile Tribe had in their cupboard.

27
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,490
Unexpectedly, they even spread fake news of launching an attack.

28
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:58,388
I can't stand it, so I came as a witness.

29
00:01:58,389 --> 00:02:03,869
Once Zhixi was dead, Chihe stood out to stop the alliance.

30
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:05,769
Why don't you all think back?

31
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:08,289
Who was the first to spread the news

32
00:02:08,289 --> 00:02:11,968
of the Ashile Tribe's attack on deserts at Sifang Pavilion?

33
00:02:11,968 --> 00:02:14,600
 - Who? 
 - It was the Tiele Tribe. 

34
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,134
That's it.

35
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:17,818
It was exactly the Tiele Tribe.

36
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,038
 Hurry and eat. 

37
00:03:15,038 --> 00:03:20,019
 Even if you fast, Father won't allow you to be by your mother's side. 

38
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:26,148
 If it's known by your mother, she'll be broken-hearted. 

39
00:03:26,148 --> 00:03:28,289
 I can't see Mother anymore. 

40
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,850
 Only you are by my side. 

41
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,400
 No one can separate us. 

42
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:54,179
You're so quiet today.

43
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:57,691
I thought you'd complain to me as you did in your childhood.

44
00:03:57,691 --> 00:04:00,079
Don't flatter yourself.

45
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,398
Did you quarrel with Yicheng?

46
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:03,499
She's my mother!

47
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:06,860
Don't call her by her name.

48
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,020
You finally got reunited with your mother,

49
00:04:11,972 --> 00:04:14,132
but quarreled with her again.

50
00:04:15,559 --> 00:04:17,099
There you go.

51
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:19,799
Don't be hypocritical.

52
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,798
You used Mimi to get information,

53
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:24,800
but are now pretending to be hypocritical.

54
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,679
I really look down on you.

55
00:04:27,679 --> 00:04:30,400
I can do anything for Changge.

56
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,600
What kind of girl is Li Changge

57
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,899
who can make you and Mimi risk your lives for her?

58
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:45,247
You don't need to understand.

59
00:04:45,247 --> 00:04:48,287
I'm just curious about,

60
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:52,499
and even a bit... envious of her.

61
00:04:54,855 --> 00:05:02,456
Ashile Sun, can you really cast aside Ashile Tribe for Li Changge?

62
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:04,898
Today, you were voluntarily put into jail.

63
00:05:04,898 --> 00:05:07,799
Didn't you cast aside Ashile Tribe as well?

64
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,879
I don't know whether Mother'll hate me.

65
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,359
 After so long, this day has finally arrived. 

66
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:26,180
 At the moment, I'll never give up. 

67
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,900
She'er,

68
00:05:30,675 --> 00:05:36,994
you'll be back by my side one day.

69
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,899
So exciting!

70
00:05:42,899 --> 00:05:46,418
What a splendid tactic Zhixi's playing dead was!

71
00:05:46,418 --> 00:05:48,939
Changge, how did you come up with it?

72
00:05:48,939 --> 00:05:53,719
I intended to find who was behind it in its own game.

73
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:56,759
This way we can not threaten Yicheng,

74
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,860
but likely harm Chihe's family.

75
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,467
What do you mean?

76
00:06:01,467 --> 00:06:06,629
It's customary for Yicheng to threaten others with their families in other tribes.

77
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:09,970
Yicheng's so evil.

78
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,269
So we can't let down our guard.

79
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,788
Maybe she has some other plans.

80
00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:19,709
Chini may still be hidden in Chang'an.

81
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:22,628
Hao Du, I need your help.

82
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,130
Don't move.

83
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,967
Thank you very much today.

84
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:35,988
It's our duty to guard our country.

85
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,939
Wait, there's one missing.

86
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,568
- You mean the one by Yicheng's side. 
 - Yes.

87
00:06:50,568 --> 00:06:52,209
He's Yang Cheng.

88
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:54,210
But today we dispatched men personally,

89
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,329
so we can't ask him from Yicheng.

90
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:57,949
What shall we do? Though Chihe admitted where Chini was,

91
00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:01,009
it's not a success if the head of Chini got away.

92
00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:02,930
Take them back first.

93
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,769
We must let Yueyan report it to the royal court before the morning attendance.

94
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:08,403
Okay.

95
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,049
   

96
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:13,648
Go.

97
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:15,720
Behave yourself.

98
00:07:16,409 --> 00:07:17,950
Yueyan.

99
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:36,808
   

100
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:38,409
Go.

101
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,899
- Yueyan! 
 - Yueyan!

102
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:58,200
Don't move.

103
00:08:02,977 --> 00:08:05,516
Give me the Fish Token.

104
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:08,319
Hao Du, he just wants to save Chini's men.

105
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,759
He won't hurt Yueyan.

106
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,419
Princess, you're so clever.

107
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:14,640
Okay, deal.

108
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,879
Hao Du, you can't.

109
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,799
I'll count to three.

110
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:23,340
It's up to your decision.

111
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,468
Li Changge, give me the Fish Token.

112
00:08:26,468 --> 00:08:27,968
Exchange it with him.

113
00:08:27,968 --> 00:08:30,069
Hao Du!

114
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:32,050
One.

115
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:39,509
Two.

116
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,230
Li Changge!

117
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:46,068
Okay, I'll let them go.

118
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:47,369
Changge!

119
00:08:47,369 --> 00:08:49,109
I'll take you there.

120
00:08:49,109 --> 00:08:51,208
Then they'll obey my order and let go of them.

121
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,508
But she's the beloved daughter of the emperor.

122
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:57,068
If you dare hurt her, you'll never escape alive.

123
00:08:57,068 --> 00:08:58,948
Bullshit!

124
00:08:58,948 --> 00:09:00,949
Throw me the Fish Token.

125
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,088
Your so-called reviving Sui Dynasty is doomed.

126
00:09:33,088 --> 00:09:34,930
Cut the crap.

127
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:42,529
Now that I'm in your hand, kill or cut me as you like.

128
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:51,969
I'm almost done.

129
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:07,388
- What's up? Have Chini's men all confessed their crimes? 
 - They've confessed.

130
00:10:07,388 --> 00:10:10,049
At tomorrow's morning attendance, I'll report it to His Majesty.

131
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:12,279
Just as planned.

132
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:17,259
Then I'll reveal Yicheng's plot in front of envoys from all tribes to help form an alliance.

133
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,369
- Come on. 
 - I'll do it.

134
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,750
Does it hurt?

135
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:37,580
If it does, just cry.

136
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,362
Don't hold it in.

137
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,490
I'm still here.

138
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:45,930
Can't you restrain yourselves a bit?

139
00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:52,709
Well, this time Hao Du did a marvelous job.

140
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,409
His Majesty will grant you a marriage.

141
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,789
I'll...

142
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,489
By the way, she's not seriously injured.

143
00:11:02,489 --> 00:11:04,790
You won't be hampered by it.

144
00:11:06,429 --> 00:11:08,429
I'll go now.

145
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:39,773
 Sun, are you okay in jail? 

146
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:49,769
Young Master, you're finally back.

147
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:52,069
Master kept waiting for you all night.

148
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:01,370
Foster Father.

149
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:04,589
Did you dispatch a troop without permission?

150
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:11,010
Foster father, it was too urgent for me to report it to you.

151
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,288
You acted as you saw fit.

152
00:12:14,288 --> 00:12:17,569
That's what my son should be like.

153
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:21,487
The remnants of Sui Dynasty must be rooted out.

154
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:22,987
Yes.

155
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,880
Follow me.

156
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,571
Kneel down.

157
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,620
   

158
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,436
Kneel down here.

159
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,039
Over here.

160
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,080
Kowtow.

161
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,719
Sprinkle liquor.

162
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,399
Foster father, it's inappropriate.

163
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,238
From now on, you're one of our Du family.

164
00:14:11,239 --> 00:14:14,340
Your name will be included in our family tree.

165
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:19,200
You're my son now.

166
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,578
Foster Father.

167
00:14:20,578 --> 00:14:24,458
I know you think highly of yourself,

168
00:14:24,458 --> 00:14:28,458
eager to climb up the social ladder.

169
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:33,238
But if you want to be the consort prince,

170
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:38,860
I, as your father, have to pave the way for you.

171
00:15:31,455 --> 00:15:33,508
Foster Father.

172
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:35,188
What you call me is wrong.

173
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:40,230
Now you're my son, understand?

174
00:15:43,329 --> 00:15:45,270
Father!

175
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:50,168
Great.

176
00:15:50,168 --> 00:15:55,548
Child, accompany me to the court and report to His Majesty.

177
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:57,249
Okay.

178
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:10,499
Your Majesty, Yang Cheng's a collateral offspring of Emperor Yang of Sui.

179
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:17,239
Since the end of the Sui Dynasty, he has assembled all remnants of Sui...

180
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:23,549
You seem unwell.

181
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:26,110
Let Hao Du speak.

182
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:38,249
Your Majesty, the group of people have all given up their identities and now are

183
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:40,709
existing in the world like ghosts.

184
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,809
They're called Chini, loyal to Princess Yicheng.

185
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:46,690
Though they confessed the crime of spreading rumors,

186
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,528
it's a pity that only Yang Cheng contacted Yicheng.

187
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:52,330
But Yang Cheng refused to betray Yicheng,

188
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,308
and even tried to commit suicide,

189
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:58,569
so I'm afraid we can't arrest Yicheng this time.

190
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:02,949
There is no rush.

191
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:08,137
How can a poorly-fledged person fly far away?

192
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,630
Yes, Your Majesty.

193
00:17:21,418 --> 00:17:26,641
Everybody, this is Yang Cheng working for Yicheng.

194
00:17:26,641 --> 00:17:30,273
He's the mastermind of Chihe and one of the remnants of Sui.

195
00:17:30,273 --> 00:17:33,922
Chihe thought by Yang Cheng's reviving Sui Dynasty

196
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:38,630
allied with the desert, Tiele Tribe would naturally thrive,

197
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:41,550
and then replace the Ashile Tribe.

198
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:48,229
Don't panic.

199
00:17:48,229 --> 00:17:51,769
Since marriage, Yicheng has schemed on the grasslands for years.

200
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:56,929
Yang Cheng heads Chini's remnants, so no one except a few people

201
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:00,209
who are loyal to and can identify Yicheng has seen her.

202
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:02,729
Yang Cheng's one of them.

203
00:18:02,729 --> 00:18:04,648
It's all Yicheng's plan.

204
00:18:04,649 --> 00:18:08,310
How glib-tongued Princess of Mobei is! 
    

205
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:16,989
You let them suspect me within several words, aiming at me.

206
00:18:16,989 --> 00:18:24,309
How can I, a weak woman married far away, be the boss behind it?

207
00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:29,569
It's said by you, not us.

208
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,229
Khatun, rest assured.

209
00:18:31,229 --> 00:18:34,910
Yang Cheng said nothing in the interrogation, but only wanted to die.

210
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:38,929
We had no sooner saved his life than interrogated him.

211
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:41,288
Besides, Yang Cheng's so loyal.

212
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:43,969
How can he betray you?

213
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:47,930
Your glance silenced all the people here.

214
00:18:49,272 --> 00:18:51,690
How dare I slander you?

215
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,169
If you know it's slander, the meeting can be over.

216
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:59,010
Why bother gathering here?

217
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,169
 Here comes the Envoy of the Ministry of Rites! 
   

218
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:18,770
Everyone, this is the promise made by His Majesty of our country to all of you.

219
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,679
All in all, if any tribe is attacked,

220
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:25,459
our Tang Dynasty'll fight side by side

221
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,790
and share a common future with you for sure.

222
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,469
In aspects of public education, food, and clothing,

223
00:19:32,469 --> 00:19:35,189
reclamation and plantation, and business trade,

224
00:19:35,189 --> 00:19:38,609
we'll favor you whenever you're in need.

225
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:45,589
If we attempt to enslave other tribes, our alliance will be dissolved.

226
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,138
Okay.

227
00:19:48,138 --> 00:19:53,380
On behalf of my father, I decide to sign the treaty first.

228
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,658
 - So we... 
 - We may sign as well. 

229
00:19:55,658 --> 00:19:57,179
 Shall we sign or not?' 

230
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:58,598
Let's ally with Great Tang.

231
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,699
We can sign it.

232
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:05,238
 - Sounds reasonable. 
 - That's right. 

233
00:20:05,239 --> 00:20:07,740
 It's quite fair. 

234
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,338
 It benefits all. 

235
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,439
Wait!

236
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:26,659
Hao Du, though you did a good job of rooting out Chini's remnants,

237
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:30,260
you dispatched a troop without permission by mistake.

238
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,260
I'm sorry.

239
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:38,219
Father, it was my idea.

240
00:20:38,219 --> 00:20:40,039
It has nothing to do with Hao Du.

241
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:44,499
So I'll make you consort prince as a punishment.

242
00:20:44,499 --> 00:20:46,899
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

243
00:20:46,899 --> 00:20:48,700
I just don't want to alert them.

244
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,019
It's a matter...

245
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:51,820
Princess.

246
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,120
Consort Prince.

247
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,759
Father.

248
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,739
You've really grown up.

249
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,960
Hao Du, no, Young Mister Du.

250
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:20,580
I'll entrust Yan'er to you.

251
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,919
You've to take good care of her.

252
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,719
If you think my daughter's a drag on your future promotion,

253
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:30,438
or your affection loses with her beauty withering away,

254
00:21:30,439 --> 00:21:37,819
I won't blame you, but you must return her intact to me.

255
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:41,600
Thank you, Your Majesty.

256
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,057
Please rest assured.

257
00:21:53,057 --> 00:21:57,358
I'm bound to take good care of Princess, not because she's a princess,

258
00:21:57,358 --> 00:22:01,580
but because she's Yueyan.

259
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,748
Great.

260
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:08,387
After Young Mister Wei brings the Treaty of Alliance back,

261
00:22:08,387 --> 00:22:10,958
select a date to get married.

262
00:22:10,959 --> 00:22:13,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

263
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,219
You can't sign the treaty.

264
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:34,459
I can't see you being trapped by a fake princess.

265
00:22:34,459 --> 00:22:36,378
Mimi.

266
00:22:36,378 --> 00:22:38,579
Fake?

267
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,560
She's not the Princess of Mobei at all.

268
00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:47,560
She's the daughter

269
00:22:48,928 --> 00:22:54,110
of the former crown prince whose family was killed.

270
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,139
She's Li Changge.

271
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,900
 It's her! 

272
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:01,859
 Is she a fake princess? 

273
00:23:01,859 --> 00:23:03,559
 What the heck? Unexpectedly. 

274
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:06,218
 - She's the daughter of the former crown prince. 
 - Really? 

275
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,419
 How is it possible? 

276
00:23:15,219 --> 00:23:20,119
Mimi Guli, I won't allow you to sabotage Princess's plan.

277
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:24,059
It's...

278
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:40,880
She's the mastermind of the Chini instead. 
    

279
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,280
The alliance is an excuse for her to get all the tribes involved in a war.

280
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,819
She only wants the Emperor of Tang to fight a war himself

281
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:55,000
so that the troops can be exhausted in the expedition.

282
00:23:56,399 --> 00:23:58,090
This way,

283
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:02,200
she can avenge her father on the emperor.

284
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,959
 If Li Changge has other plans, 

285
00:24:08,959 --> 00:24:12,999
 reveal her real identity in front of all tribes, 

286
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,399
 or your brother Buzhen and Mu Jin... 

287
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,779
  - Mu Jin! 
 - You think I don't know Mu Jin has sneaked into Dingxiang? 

288
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:26,718
 Maybe at the moment, he's being tortured in Lei Meng's hand. 

289
00:24:26,719 --> 00:24:28,659
 I'll do whatever you want. 

290
00:24:28,659 --> 00:24:30,438
 Khatun, please. 

291
00:24:30,438 --> 00:24:32,879
 Please spare Buzhen and Mu Jin's lives. 

292
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,039
 I'll do whatever you want. 

293
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,400
 I'll listen to you. 

294
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,039
 It depends on your performance. 

295
00:24:44,439 --> 00:24:48,359
To avenge her father, as a person from Tang,

296
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:53,219
she can even collide with Chini, a group of Sui remnants.

297
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,679
She cares nothing about the battles 
    

298
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:00,200
among the three forces or people's sufferings.

299
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,640
The alliance is none other than a plot of hers.

300
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,059
 It's her plot. 

301
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:09,319
 She's so hard to read. 

302
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,620
 That's it. 

303
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,439
 We can't be reckless. 

304
00:25:13,439 --> 00:25:14,639
 Let's think over it. 

305
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:16,640
 That's it. 

306
00:25:23,199 --> 00:25:25,318
Arrest Li Changge.

307
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:28,120
I'll report and wait for His Majesty's decision.

308
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,620
 Yes. 

309
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:40,260
Changge! 
    

310
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,779
 I never thought it'd be like this. 

311
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,859
Father.

312
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,860
Changge...

313
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,300
Since when did Yicheng know Changge's identity?

314
00:26:25,301 --> 00:26:27,301
I don't know.

315
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:36,900
Now envoys of all tribes can't wait to see me kill Changge to show my sincerity.

316
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,760
- Father. 
 - Your Majesty,

317
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,138
they're afraid of our country instead of Li Changge.

318
00:26:42,138 --> 00:26:46,140
So you mean they don't trust me.

319
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,760
I don't mean it.

320
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,000
I think it's no use killing Li Changge.

321
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:56,819
So what do you think we should do?

322
00:26:56,819 --> 00:26:59,179
Sorry, I dare not say.

323
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,399
Father, you said you'd pardon

324
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:10,839
the relatives of Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji.

325
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:14,058
Now, Changge's identity as Jiancheng's daughter has been exposed.

326
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:16,418
She ought to be well-placed.

327
00:27:16,419 --> 00:27:18,619
If Your Majesty goes back on your words,

328
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:22,180
I'll keep persuading you at the risk of my death.

329
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:30,670
Father.

330
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:34,469
Young Mister Wei, go visit Yicheng tomorrow.

331
00:27:34,469 --> 00:27:39,809
She did so just to let me release Young Khan.

332
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,809
Whatever she wants tomorrow,

333
00:27:42,810 --> 00:27:47,111
tell her I only want prisoners from all tribes

334
00:27:47,111 --> 00:27:50,391
in the hands of Ashile Tribe.

335
00:27:50,391 --> 00:27:52,770
Yes, Your Majesty.

336
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:05,130
Father, no one will harm Changge, right?

337
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:08,230
Yan'er, you may rise.

338
00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:19,730
Yan'er, remember, fighting fire with fire is never a proper way.

339
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:28,929
Facing either strong forces or schemes and intrigues,

340
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,550
just respond squarely.

341
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:34,610
Our Tang Dynasty will never give in.

342
00:28:50,601 --> 00:28:52,821
Time to eat.

343
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,390
Yours.

344
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:01,965
You, nothing.

345
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,950
Your mother did pay a lot.

346
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,008
I'm not hungry.

347
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:10,849
Eat mine as a present to you.

348
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,049
No, thanks.

349
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:17,209
You may eat, or you'll starve to death.

350
00:29:18,789 --> 00:29:20,989
I believe we can get out.

351
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:25,970
Are you confident in the Emperor Tang or your mother?

352
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:29,189
I'm confident in your Li Changge.

353
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:34,389
If she's reliable, she won't let you die here.

354
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:38,230
I hope she won't get involved in this again.

355
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,410
She'er,

356
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,950
if we can leave alive this time,

357
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:49,570
I'll go on fighting against your mother till my death.

358
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:56,269
Ashile Tribe, Tang Dynasty, and former Sui Dynasty.

359
00:29:57,454 --> 00:30:00,353
Do these really matter?

360
00:30:00,353 --> 00:30:02,569
Why must you be involved?

361
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:06,089
Can't you live happily with Li Changge in some tranquil place?

362
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,008
Isn't it great?

363
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:09,549
Of course, it's great.

364
00:30:09,549 --> 00:30:14,350
Only when the world is in peace can people live happily indeed.

365
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:27,350
   

366
00:30:29,373 --> 00:30:30,973
Khatun.

367
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:36,388
Your Emperor only sent you to see me.

368
00:30:36,389 --> 00:30:39,229
The General of Eagle Division schemed against East Palace,

369
00:30:39,229 --> 00:30:42,548
and said you and Young Khan were the masterminds.

370
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,930
For such a major case,

371
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:47,250
His Majesty'll solve the case himself, so he can't see you in person.

372
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:53,429
You came straight to the point, so I won't beat around the bush.

373
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,809
Let go of my son.

374
00:30:55,810 --> 00:31:01,648
I promise not to cross swords with your country within five years.

375
00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:03,910
We intended to sign the treaty,

376
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:09,789
but tribes quit signing it for the leader is Li Jiancheng's daughter.

377
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:15,810
An alliance can be quit so easily, let alone your so-called promise.

378
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:24,509
So what does your emperor want?

379
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:26,310
I heard there're lots of prisoners

380
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:29,310
from all tribes in Ashile Tribe's hands.

381
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:35,269
He wants too many.

382
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,990
Khatun, now people are in a panic.

383
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:40,689
To let envoys of all tribes remain calm,

384
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:45,609
the best way of showing our prestige is to punish Young Khan.

385
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:50,190
You want to see me, which means you possibly know it.

386
00:32:02,239 --> 00:32:06,460
I'm sorry, I can't help you this time.

387
00:32:08,579 --> 00:32:10,099
Did we fail to sign the treaty?

388
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:12,739
90% of them are unwilling to sign.

389
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:19,000
It means we can fight for the rest of the 10%.

390
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,920
The rest of the 10% are packing up to set out for the desert tomorrow.

391
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,200
What about Sun?

392
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:32,299
Ashile Sun and Ashile She'er have special identities.

393
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:33,620
They're in respective cells.

394
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,319
No one is allowed to visit them.

395
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:39,119
They won't fight with each other in their respective cells.

396
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:43,279
Changge, to reveal Yicheng's crimes,

397
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,839
Ashile Sun didn't hesitate to expose his identity.

398
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:50,432
He did so maybe because of your narrow squeak.

399
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:56,060
He saved me many times.

400
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:02,259
Without him, I'd have been dead when I fell off the cliff.

401
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:04,500
You've known each other since then.

402
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,119
It was he who saved you.

403
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,259
If Ashile Sun can survive you this time,

404
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:18,219
as your brother, I can entrust you to him.

405
00:33:18,219 --> 00:33:20,559
Before I met him,

406
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,279
I never thought we'd go through thick and thin with one another.

407
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:26,599
After I met him,

408
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,280
I never thought I would spend the rest of my life with anyone else.

409
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,579
- Your Majesty. 
 - Did Yicheng agree?

410
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:50,980
Yes.

411
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,459
Ashile Tribe will go back to Dingxiang tomorrow.

412
00:33:53,459 --> 00:33:58,399
She wants Young Khan to leave with her in front of all tribes.

413
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,700
There she goes.

414
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:03,719
As she wishes.

415
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:08,459
Your Majesty, she even wants Ashile Sun.

416
00:34:19,214 --> 00:34:21,395
The fourth day.

417
00:34:21,395 --> 00:34:24,939
It's the first time I've been in jail for so long.

418
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,919
Things are getting hot.

419
00:34:34,019 --> 00:34:36,739
So do you fear death?

420
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:39,500
Warriors on the grasslands never fear death.

421
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,140
If you died in a setup this time,

422
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,379
I'd feel sorry for you.

423
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:47,399
Did I hear it right?

424
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:50,299
You can even apologize.

425
00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:55,314
Is it that men speak kindly in the presence of death?

426
00:34:55,314 --> 00:34:57,819
If I can't make it clear now,

427
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,839
I'll have no chance later.

428
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:06,210
She'er, if you want to blame something, blame that you are Young Khan.

429
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,279
No chance?

430
00:35:09,259 --> 00:35:11,179
I don't think so.

431
00:35:11,779 --> 00:35:14,579
I won't die so easily.

432
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:17,700
I won't die in their country's jail.

433
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:22,180
You brat,

434
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,810
if we can leave alive,

435
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,619
apologize to me and treat me to a drink.

436
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:33,119
Maybe I can forgive you.

437
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,960
Forgive?

438
00:35:35,619 --> 00:35:38,180
As long as you're Yicheng's son

439
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,940
and I'm Khan's adopted son,

440
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,139
it's impossible for us to forgive each other.

441
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,679
She'er, forgive?

442
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,519
In the next life.

443
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,840
Do you really think you're going to die?

444
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,600
You never said anything discouraging like that.

445
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:02,300
Let me ask you. If we survive, what would you want to do?

446
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,119
I don't know,

447
00:36:06,379 --> 00:36:08,859
but I'll never leave the grasslands.

448
00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:10,579
How wonderful the grasslands are!

449
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:13,640
Vast and charming.

450
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:16,850
I don't need too many soldiers

451
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,020
or men under me.

452
00:36:19,639 --> 00:36:22,960
I just want to hunt on a horse, herd cattle, and sheep

453
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,160
with my beloved.

454
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,719
That's also what I want.

455
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:33,460
Come on, please don't.

456
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,080
What are you doing?

457
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:05,700
Ashile Sun, you can't go with them.

458
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:12,426
Catch the ringleader first.

459
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,600
- Thanks for reminding them. 
 - You're welcome.

460
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,639
Take him away.

461
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:31,700
I won't prevent you from killing him as long as I'm safe, but...

462
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,460
Crown Prince?

463
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,979
How dare you!

464
00:37:39,979 --> 00:37:42,500
How dare you hit me?

465
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,460
I did so by mistake.

466
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,579
You don't have to kill me.

467
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,910
I intended not to kill you in jail

468
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:53,019
for fear of leaving a trace,

469
00:37:53,019 --> 00:37:57,539
but I've been exposed by your hit.

470
00:37:57,539 --> 00:38:02,930
Then... if you are going to start it, you need to finish it.

471
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:10,240
I can finally avenge my friend!

472
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,199
You!

473
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:19,119
How dare you!

474
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:23,100
Your Highness, why must you kill Ashile Sun?

475
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,840
Because he killed Sheng Xin.

476
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,660
People on earth all despise Sheng Xin

477
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:31,539
and think there's no need to get even for his death.

478
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:36,039
If I can't avenge him, he would have died in vain!

479
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,579
Sheng Xin is the one who lurked by your side maliciously.

480
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:41,120
Bullshit!

481
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:43,319
Hao Du has got Chini's remnants all in one draft.

482
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,859
They confessed as early as in Luoyang,

483
00:38:45,859 --> 00:38:49,559
Sheng Xin was sent to lurk by Your Highness's side to confuse you

484
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,940
and make trouble by taking advantage of you.

485
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:55,299
They signed the confession and are now in jail.

486
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:59,099
If you don't believe it, go interrogate them.

487
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,719
His Majesty wants to meet you.

488
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:32,330
Don't you want to pay respect to the Emperor of Great Tang?

489
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,160
Of course.

490
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:38,099
What's more, as Li Changge's man,

491
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:40,900
I won't yield to her second uncle.

492
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:49,730
Let me see what you can do for my niece.

493
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,260
   

494
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,520
There're two ways in front of you.

495
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:03,179
You've seen the box before where Changge's identity certificate is placed.

496
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:06,878
I made one for you as well.

497
00:40:06,879 --> 00:40:11,919
From now on, change your name, stay with Changge in Chang'an,

498
00:40:11,919 --> 00:40:14,240
and no longer get on with Ashile Tribe.

499
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,478
I will grant you a safe life.

500
00:40:17,479 --> 00:40:21,750
Changge has already rejected this path.

501
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:24,940
So I leave this to you.

502
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:29,719
You don't want her to live in danger, do you?

503
00:40:30,339 --> 00:40:32,820
I just want her to do what she likes.

504
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:37,860
Besides, I can't cast our Ashile Tribe aside.

505
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:48,879
Then the second way is not that easy to go.

506
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,480
So do you get what I mean?

507
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,359
Yes.

508
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,678
Do you dare to you risk your life for Changge?

509
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:05,719
That's what I want.

510
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,840
Before leaving Chang'an,

511
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:12,600
you need to meet someone.

512
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,930
   

513
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,420
I thought...

514
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,290
he was my friend.

515
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,460
Why did you all cheat me?

516
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:51,878
Because I'm a fool?

517
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:53,819
Certainly not.

518
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:57,759
You're just too kind and credulous.

519
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,219
Don't console me.

520
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:02,260
I know Father...

521
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,720
also thinks I'm not promising.

522
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:10,250
This is the first time

523
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:13,620
I wanted to fight for, justify and avenge someone,

524
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,460
but in the end,

525
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,859
it turned out to be a joke.

526
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,639
You did that bravely for your friend,

527
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:35,398
but your friendship turned out to be false.

528
00:42:35,399 --> 00:42:37,600
Do you regret?

529
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,440
Yes, I do.

530
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:43,180
So in the future,

531
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,900
will you still utterly trust others?

532
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,400
I will,

533
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:54,740
but I won't trust them so blindly.

534
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,600
Isn't it a good thing?

535
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,790
You've grown up.

536
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,799
What about you?

537
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,740
Have you tried to make up for your regrets?

538
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:11,220
Your Highness.

539
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:14,756
It's water under the bridge.

540
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,700
We need to move on.

541
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:33,790


542
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:38,419
♫  The heart gradually responds,  ♫

543
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,720
♫  gradually revives,  ♫

544
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,139
♫  gradually swims towards you  ♫

545
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:48,360
♫  Before bidding farewell,  ♫

546
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,760
♫  we expect an encounter  ♫

547
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:57,100
♫  As your silhouette weaves  ♫

548
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:02,320
♫  and locks in my nostalgic dream  ♫

549
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,120
♫  Before the daybreak,  ♫

550
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,540
♫  through the obsession of love,  ♫

551
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:11,260
♫  the yearning flowing through thoughts  ♫

552
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,870
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

553
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:20,480
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

554
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,050
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

555
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:30,560
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

556
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,000
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

557
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,339
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

558
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:39,920
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

559
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,639
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

560
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,440
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

561
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:51,320
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

562
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:58,980
♫  There's always a moment  ♫

563
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:04,699
♫  where the wilderness burns in my heart  ♫

564
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,979
♫  There's always solicitude  ♫

565
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:14,739
♫  which froze everything between you and me  ♫

566
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:17,040
♫  Meet each other in different time  ♫

567
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,500
♫  Encourage each other in different worlds  ♫

568
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:24,019
♫  My longings become a cocoon  ♫

569
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,649
♫  Layer after layer  ♫

570
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:28,679
♫  It turns into an eternity  ♫

571
00:45:28,679 --> 00:45:35,800
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

572
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,740
♫  It is sleepless  ♫

573
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:58,040
