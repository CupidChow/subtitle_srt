What happened?

23
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,310
We are afraid of you now.

24
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,910
So we are here to give you some presents, and make peace.

25
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,950
My King pays his respect to you, General Sun.

26
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,248
Is this from Pusa?

27
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,369
Yes. Mobei was obtrusive and ignorant, which led to public wrath.

28
00:02:06,369 --> 00:02:07,868
My king is really sorry for that.

29
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:10,189
So he is asking for forgiveness from Ashile Tribe.

30
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:11,590
These are our gifts.

31
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:16,029
Please say some good words for Mobei to Great Khan.

32
00:02:16,029 --> 00:02:19,530
As long as it is done, more valuable gifts will be here.

33
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,389
Of course.

34
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,149
It's priceless. Please cherish it, General Sun.

35
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:36,348
Let me have a look. What so priceless?

36
00:02:36,348 --> 00:02:40,310
No worries, General. Our King would never make a fish of one and flesh of another.

37
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,290
Why is mine so small?

38
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,109
This is good! So big!

39
00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:50,909
I never saw such a big one before.

40
00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:53,010
Who wants your stone?

41
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,310
- Send these to my place later.
- Yes.

42
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,330
I will divide. I am the most impartial one here.

43
00:02:59,809 --> 00:03:01,409
Let's go!

44
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,510
<i>[Meet me at Wild Wolf Hill at midnight]</i>

45
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:36,910
So you are just going to have a date after all this?

46
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,708
She must have something important to tell me.

47
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:41,850
I will go to see her tonight. You guard here for me.

48
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,030
<i>[Got it...]</i>

49

<i>[Got it. Be there or be square]</i>

50
00:03:54,788 --> 00:03:57,688
- What?
- Just this?

51
00:03:57,689 --> 00:03:59,689
Any problem?

52
00:03:59,689 --> 00:04:01,369
She is asking for a date.

53
00:04:01,369 --> 00:04:02,628
Sun!

54
00:04:02,628 --> 00:04:06,870
Did you ever hear the phrase, "Express your love through words"?

55
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,448
We know each other, so we don't need this.

56
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,889
So you don't have to write anything more?

57
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,770
Then what should I write?

58
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,128
What?

59
00:04:17,128 --> 00:04:18,808
Should I teach you this?

60
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:22,430
You can write anything you want to say to her.

61
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,670
Fine, I won't look.

62
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:40,989
Just write it down.

63
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:50,909
Don't peep!

64
00:04:50,909 --> 00:04:52,208
Fine, fine.

65
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,490
Keep writing. I won't peep.

68

Don't you need to write more?

69
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:12,590
It's not necessary.

70
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:17,330
Don't peep!

71
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,930
Okay, fine! I know.

72
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:29,989
General Sun said that he would be there on time tonight.

73
00:05:29,989 --> 00:05:31,229
This is...?

74
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:35,028
I have no idea. He just asked me to send this back to you.

75
00:05:35,028 --> 00:05:36,690
Thanks.

76
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,750
My King.

77
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:56,908
Already checked the box?

78
00:05:56,908 --> 00:05:58,850
Anything private?

79
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,288
What a surprise!

80
00:06:05,288 --> 00:06:10,389
This famous Ashile Sun is such a tender man!

- You used face powder today?

Smell good?

105
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,590
It seems her taste is not so good.

Why is Eagle Division here?

109
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:37,810
Because of military orders.

110
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,589
Asking those who just recovered from the plague to fight...

111
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:43,629
It seems that Khan's tent just wants to wipe out Eagle Division.

112
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:49,429
Changge, you know that I never want to think bad of him.

113
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:51,870
But that's the fact!

114
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,250
If you are asking me to betray Ashile Tribe

115
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,789
and Great Khan, then I can't.

116
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,950
I owe him for raising me.

117
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:05,070
I can't break faith with him.

118
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,428
What about Eagle Division? What can it do?

119
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:10,890
I have no choice.

120
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,510
You do.

121
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,789
I asked you to meet me here tonight because I just want to tell you,

122
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:19,989
you have a third choice apart from betrayal and hibernation.

123
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:23,469
Did he agree?

124
00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:25,870
He will reply in two days.

125
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,169
I warn you.

126
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:30,788
If I don't get the reply I want in two days,

127
00:09:30,788 --> 00:09:33,950
you will not live to the third day.

128
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:52,270
Sun, Bear Division is asking for us.

129
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,308
They have something important to discuss.

130
00:09:54,308 --> 00:09:56,009
Go.

131
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,548
Why do you look so terrible?

132
00:10:03,548 --> 00:10:06,069
Did you stay up late?

133
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:08,949
Let me in! I have to see Mu Jin and General Sun.

134
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:10,428
Let me in! I'm here for important business!

135
00:10:10,428 --> 00:10:11,669
Mimi?

136
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:13,690
Let her in.

137
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:19,469
You can't trust Bear Division.

138
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:21,250
You will die!

<i>[Mobei City]</i>

140
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:40,590
Sun, I've checked.

141
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:44,899
Just like Mimi said, the bolts and slings should have been aimed at the desert,

142
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:46,698
but the angle is lowered now.

143
00:10:46,698 --> 00:10:48,800
It can't be such a big mistake.

144
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,620
Obviously, they are aiming at us.

145
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,658
It's an urgent situation. Say something!

146
00:10:55,658 --> 00:10:56,819
Let me think about it.

147
00:10:56,819 --> 00:10:58,339
What is there to think about?

148
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:00,879
In the past days, did Tu Kashe dare to do that?

149
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,399
He must be instigated by someone else.

150
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,100
Shut up!

151
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,280
Even if we win this time and we survive the war,

152
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,058
and he lets us go, what about the next time?

153
00:11:13,058 --> 00:11:15,240
And in the future?

154
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,740
<i>Only if Eagle Division vanishes, could they stop their attack on us.</i>

155
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,620
You guys leave for a moment.

156
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,460
I need to be alone now.

157
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,040
Let's go, Mimi.

158
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:37,239
Mimi, I have a question.

159
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:38,798
I know your question.

160
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,799
I have something to tell you later.

161
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,980
The reason why I know this

162
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,939
is that I am a spy sent by Khan's Tent.

163
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:03,360
- And?
- And...

164
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:07,400
the boy who infected Eagle Division

165
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,619
looks so much like my brother Buzhen,

166
00:12:10,619 --> 00:12:12,899
so she knew that I would definitely save him.

167
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:15,640
- So...
- You have a brother?

168
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,420
He is still in their hands as a hostage.

169
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:26,020
They even asked me to destroy the gromwell,

170
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,520
or they would kill him.

171
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,319
You saved Eagle Division and you are our benefactor.

172
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:45,379
I promise... I will find ways to help your brother out.

173
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:52,180
I don't even know if he is still alive.

174
00:12:56,219 --> 00:12:58,479
No matter if he is alive or dead,

175
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:01,440
I will do it for you.

176
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,900
Sun and I will go to see Tu Kashe first.

177
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,059
Don't worry.

178
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:10,840
You will always be our family,

179
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,900
you will always be my Mimi.

180
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,600
Mu Jin! Follow me.

181
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,559
I have to leave now.

182
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,899
You're here.

183
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,758
Just this amount of food?

184
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:49,979
I'm afraid that these are just enough for three days.

185
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:54,519
Just for those weak soldiers in Mobei, isn't it enough?

186
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:56,820
Mobei asked for peace and gave us gifts.

187
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,860
What do you think of it?

188
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:01,519
We will accept the gifts and also fight against them.

189
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,239
General is quite a trustworthy man.

190
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,780
I will start the fight tomorrow.

191
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,578
I will use my 10,000 men to wipe out 5,000 cavalrymen of Mobei.

192
00:14:12,578 --> 00:14:16,740
And then take the chance to besiege Mobei.

193
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:20,679
What do you think of it, General Sun?

194
00:14:22,479 --> 00:14:24,079
Okay.

195
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,499
But that's not enough.

196
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:27,938
So your opinion?

197
00:14:27,938 --> 00:14:30,040
You start the fight tomorrow,

198
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,560
and they will have a whole night for preparation.

199
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,940
If they store up energy and strength,

200
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,679
and get into a fight tomorrow,

201
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,919
your odds to win would not be high.

202
00:14:39,699 --> 00:14:43,680
- So your plan is...
- We can tell them the battle is tomorrow,

203
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,478
but we will secretly start the battle tonight.

204
00:14:47,478 --> 00:14:48,759
Sneak attack?

205
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:52,220
Taking advantage of their slackness and unpreparedness,

206
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,860
we will make a surprise attack on them.

207
00:14:55,699 --> 00:14:58,679
Okay. As you say.

208
00:15:10,239 --> 00:15:11,579
Young Khan.

209
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:14,439
Let me in. I have to see Uncle Khan.

210
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:16,279
Forgive me please, Young Khan.

211
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,979
Great Khan is getting some rest now.

212
00:15:17,979 --> 00:15:19,859
He ordered no one to disturb him.

213
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:21,759
I'm here to pay for a visit, can't I?

214
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,220
Don't put me in a hard position, please, Young Khan.

215
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,519
She'er.

216
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,680
Mother.

217
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:37,099
Wait.

218
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,810
Mother, Uncle Khan said we shouldn't meet privately.

219
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,859
Now, this order is invalid.

220
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:50,439
What? When?

221
00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:51,779
Why did no one tell me about it?

222
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:55,599
Great Khan just told me in person.

223
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:02,079
What happened?

224
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,879
No. I...

225
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:06,940
I just can't accept it at once.

226
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,880
You will get used to it.

227
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,698
You are my son.

228
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:14,979
We should not be separated actually.

229
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:18,460
But why... why did Uncle Khan permit it?

230
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:26,099
Maybe... your Uncle Khan didn't feel the importance of kinship until he fell ill.

231
00:16:26,099 --> 00:16:27,798
Then it's been a long time since I've left him,

232
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:29,340
I should visit him now.

233
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,258
Besides, I have something to ask him.

234
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:35,258
Your Uncle Khan just drank his medicine, he is asleep now.

235
00:16:35,258 --> 00:16:39,399
You can ask me anything, it's the same.

236
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,640
Go ahead.

237
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,439
Uncle Khan dispatched Eagle and Bear Division to fight Mobei.

238
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:53,859
What about my Wolf Division?

239
00:16:53,859 --> 00:16:56,180
So what?

240
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,379
This chance should be my Wolf Division.

241
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:01,780
In the battle in Weishui, Wolf Division had no distribution.

242
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:04,779
This has been a joke in the other two tribes.

243
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:07,940
Now we need a battle to prove ourselves.

244
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:11,038
This time, I will ask for a fight to Uncle Khan.

245
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:13,860
I will successively attack Mobei for Uncle Khan.

246
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:20,518
She'er, do you remember what I told you when you were young?

247
00:17:20,518 --> 00:17:23,600
Lack of forbearance in small matters upsets great plans.

248
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,698
The most important thing for you is to save power.

249
00:17:26,698 --> 00:17:29,919
As long as you have strength and hold up to the last second,

250
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,059
you will have a chance to win.

251
00:17:32,059 --> 00:17:35,280
Uncle Khan sent me out immediately this time,

252
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,980
to go on an expedition at the border.

253
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:39,338
As soon as I come back, I have to prepare for the move of the court.

254
00:17:39,338 --> 00:17:41,099
And I have to clear up the desert.

255
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:43,199
These are all too fast!

256
00:17:43,199 --> 00:17:45,839
It's not like the style of Uncle Khan.

257
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:50,259
Let me show you something.

258
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:04,839
The Great Seal!

259
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:11,520
Khan is badly ill, he has asked me to keep this.

260
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,479
From now on, the whole Khan's Tent will be under my control.

261
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:25,559
What? Do you think your mother isn't competent to do it?

262
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,460
No.

263
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,519
It's just...

264
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,299
She'er, you should feel happy for me.

265
00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:36,039
From now on, I don't need to endure the humiliation.

266
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,019
You can see me whenever you want.

267
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:40,298
You can go anywhere you want.

268
00:18:40,298 --> 00:18:42,539
Isn't it great?

269
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,880
Your Uncle Khan is seriously ill, so he can't be working anymore.

270
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,380
From now on, maybe this Great Seal,

271
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,799
the whole Khan's tent,

272
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:04,920
and this grassland would all be controlled by you.

273
00:19:05,439 --> 00:19:08,560
You have to be prepared.

274
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,600
Okay, go back to get some rest.

275
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,780
Don't think too much.

276
00:19:57,619 --> 00:19:59,659
Are you ready?

277
00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:03,980
General Sun, yes we are!

278
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:07,759
Tonight will be a hard time for Eagle Division,

279
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,258
we will cooperate well with you.

280
00:20:09,258 --> 00:20:11,539
I will lead Eagle Division to attack from the north

281
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:13,338
and Bear Division from the south.

282
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,179
We will attack from both sides.

283
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:16,599
Wonderful.

284
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:18,440
Great!

285
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,279
Eagle Division!

286
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,278
<i>- Yes!</i>
- Follow me!

287
00:20:24,278 --> 00:20:26,039
<i>Yes!</i>

288
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,879
Will Tu Kashe fall into the trap?

289
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,499
Will we succeed?

290
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:56,200
No worries.

291
00:20:57,459 --> 00:21:00,219
Everything is under control.

292
00:21:00,219 --> 00:21:02,719
Today is coming to an end.

293
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,700
Do you think you can be alive tomorrow?

294
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,460
The sunset is so beautiful.

295
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,840
Please, don't spoil my good mood, Commander.

296
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,100
<i>Report!</i>

297
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,018
<i>Commander! The man from Eagle Division is here.</i>

298
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:16,379
- Bring him in.
- Yes!

299
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,499
Mimi?

300
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:24,300
Changge.

301
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,599
Mimi, why is it you?

302
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:27,938
Long story.

303
00:21:27,938 --> 00:21:29,399
I just saw General Sun.

304
00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:32,899
He asked you to pass some words to the two kings.

305
00:21:35,399 --> 00:21:37,240
Go ahead. What is it?

306
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,140
Help Eagle Division fake death.

307
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,740
He would like to give a chance of success in the desert tonight.

308
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:46,238
What are you talking about?

309
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:49,800
Ask Yinan here. Or should I do it myself?

310
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:56,198
General, when shall we start?

311
00:21:56,198 --> 00:21:58,759
Just wait.

312
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:05,279
The more they are consumed, the easier for us to clear them up.

313
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,818
Bear Division!

314
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:24,119
Yes!

315
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,418
Follow me!

316
00:22:25,418 --> 00:22:29,018
Go!

317
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,580
<i>Stop.</i>

318
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,960
<i>Where is Eagle Division?</i>

319
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,640
<i>Where is Eagle Division?</i>

320
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:44,459
<i>Ambush!</i>

321
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:45,999
<i>We are trapped!</i>

322
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:48,218
<i>Why are they the armies of Monan and Mobei?</i>

323
00:22:48,218 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>It's bad! We are trapped!</i>

324
00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:55,880
<i>Retreat! Retreat!</i>

325
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,739
<i>Report!</i>

326
00:22:59,939 --> 00:23:01,739
Come on in!

327
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,699
- How is it?
- Ashile's Bear Division has already been trapped.

328
00:23:05,699 --> 00:23:07,938
The two kings from Monan and Mobei led the armies to attack from both sides,

329
00:23:07,938 --> 00:23:09,879
Bear Division has been defeated.

330
00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:11,859
What about Eagle Division?

331
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:14,999
Eagle Division faked their fight on the battlefield according to the plan,

332
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:18,440
they have all retreated, no one got injured.

333
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:32,620
They were able to draw such an elaborate layout in just three to four hours.

334
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,678
The desert is so talented!

335
00:23:34,678 --> 00:23:37,239
This is a strategy from the Central Plains.

336
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:39,039
Pusa and Yinan have no idea about it.

337
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,379
Her idea again?

338
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,179
So scary!

339
00:23:44,179 --> 00:23:47,118
Sun! Don't you need to think twice about it?

340
00:23:47,118 --> 00:23:49,118
This woman is so awful.

341
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:50,779
I'm afraid that you will be betrayed by her.

342
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:52,580
Boring...

343
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:55,959
General, it's urgent!

344
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:59,638
Tu Kashe was covered by soldiers of Bear Division, he rushed out of the circle.

345
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:01,619
He can't escape.

346
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:30,159
Who is it?

347
00:24:46,459 --> 00:24:50,159
Sun! What do you mean?

348
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,438
Are you going to betray Great Khan?

349
00:24:52,438 --> 00:24:54,120
I just want to live.

350
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,480
I also hope Eagle Division can survive, too.

351
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,039
Do you deserve it?

352
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:01,598
You are just a low-priced nobody! You are just a slave.

353
00:25:01,598 --> 00:25:04,779
If it was not for Great Khan, could you have lived till today?

354
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:08,319
I would never forget his grace in raising me.

355
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:13,660
But in the future, I will return to him in my way.

356
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,380
Piece of Trash! Just in this way?

357
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,279
You from Eagle Division are all bad men!

358
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,680
And you, Mu Jin!

359
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,519
You are shameless!

360
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:25,180
You guys won't live till tomorrow!

361
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,519
I will report everything to Great Khan.

362
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:30,519
You have no chance to live till tomorrow!

363
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:33,300
Don't talk big.

364
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:35,900
It doesn't matter.

365
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,920
Tu Kashe, you can't leave here tonight.

366
00:26:23,259 --> 00:26:26,478
His Highness asked me to report to you that we succeeded.

367
00:26:26,478 --> 00:26:29,299
Just wait for Eagle Division to come back.

368
00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:31,019
Thanks.

369
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:39,379
Since our plan has succeeded,

370
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,858
it's time for me to go back.

371
00:26:41,858 --> 00:26:44,519
Back to where?

372
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,979
Eagle Division or Khan's tent?

373
00:26:55,119 --> 00:27:00,519
Mimi, actually, I wanted to ask you why you knew

374
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:02,900
that Bear Division was going to attack Eagle Division.

375
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:05,999
You are a kind girl.

376
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:09,000
Or you wouldn't have said that.

377
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,139
If you have any problem, you can tell me.

378
00:27:12,139 --> 00:27:14,860
We can find ways together to solve it.

379
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,259
I told you.

380
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:20,738
I have a brother.

381
00:27:20,738 --> 00:27:25,280
Yes, you told me that it was Ashile Tribe who killed your family.

382
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,600
Your brother is dead.

383
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:31,820
He is alive?

384
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,120
You mean... he is at Khan's tent now?

385
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,220
No, in Dingxiang.

386
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,699
It's Yi Cheng...

387
00:27:42,699 --> 00:27:46,100
She threatened me with my brother's life.

388
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,259
And forced me to stay in Eagle Division.

389
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:51,379
Changge,

390
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:55,039
I had no choice.

391
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,159
I prefer to die.

392
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:03,419
Mimi, you never harmed Eagle Division but helped it instead.

393
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:06,780
Now it no longer exists, you are free too.

394
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,959
How could I be free?

395
00:28:07,959 --> 00:28:11,699
If my brother is still alive, he must be waiting for me to save him.

396
00:28:11,699 --> 00:28:16,200
Mimi, we will discuss your brother together when they come back.

397
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:20,300
Just remember, Eagle Division was annihilated, you are dead too.

398
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,740
Nothing can threaten you now.

399
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:26,500
Forget all the things in the past.

400
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:30,779
From now on, let's start a new life.

401
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:33,339
A new life...

402
00:28:34,239 --> 00:28:37,160
Can I start a new life?

403
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,900
The Mimi from the past is dead,

404
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,819
you will be a brand new Mimi in the future.

405
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:49,479
You can do anything you want freely.

406
00:28:49,479 --> 00:28:51,058
Wait for them to be back,

407
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:54,820
and we will find a way together to help your brother out.

408
00:29:07,499 --> 00:29:10,199
Sun! Wait.

409
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,480
Hand me your helmet.

410
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,818
Eagle and Bear Division were both annihilated here.

411
00:29:16,818 --> 00:29:18,358
I need a piece of physical evidence.

412
00:29:18,358 --> 00:29:21,659
Mu Jin, it's not necessary.

413
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,979
Sun, someone has to go back to report.

414
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:27,078
We have never been separated from each other.

415
00:29:27,078 --> 00:29:30,438
Only if I go back alone and tell them you are dead,

416
00:29:30,438 --> 00:29:32,539
can they believe it.

417
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,939
You have to be safe.

418
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:47,760
No worries. Even the plague didn't take my life, I can't die that easily.

419
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,339
In this way, you can't see Mimi for a long time.

420
00:29:54,939 --> 00:29:56,539
It's okay.

421
00:29:56,539 --> 00:29:59,959
I also have some selfish motives this time to go back.

422
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,180
Take care.

423
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,180
Mimi!

424
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,459
Where are you going?

425
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,700
You see?

426
00:30:46,339 --> 00:30:49,839
When I go back, I will trick those in Khan's tent.

427
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,239
You can't go!

428
00:30:51,239 --> 00:30:54,059
They won't let you go this time!

429
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:58,279
Mimi, believe me.

430
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:00,139
I will come back.

431
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:04,720
I promised you that I would find a way to help your brother out.

432
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:11,399
But Dingxiang is strictly guarded, you are alone.

433
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:13,620
How can you do that?

434
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:21,039
Take me with you, okay?

435
00:31:27,639 --> 00:31:31,439
Mimi, I am a man.

436
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:34,640
A man should do his job.

437
00:31:35,579 --> 00:31:39,939
You promise me, be safe.

438
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,960
And wait for me.

439

I'm here to take you back.

463
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,259
I've been worried since last night.

464
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,398
I was afraid that the plan would be changed.

465
00:33:59,398 --> 00:34:00,798
I was afraid that Tu Kashe would discover your plan.

466
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:03,459
I was afraid that you would be in danger.

467
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:05,899
But thanks, Sun.

468
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:07,798
You are back safely with a great victory.

469
00:34:07,798 --> 00:34:09,699
I'm back.

470
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,079
Later,

471
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,600
Eagle Division will not exist anymore.

472
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:20,180
Neither does the General of Eagle Division.

473
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,480
Do you regret it?

474
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,919
This is the best result.

475
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:27,759
Eagle Division will never be disturbed by those interests or disputes,

476
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:30,879
nor will it be manipulated by others as a slayer.

477
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:36,599
Although Eagle Division doesn't exist now, you can't repudiate a debt.

478
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,520
What debt?

479
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,058
When you recommended yourself as my military counselor,

480
00:34:43,058 --> 00:34:45,800
you promised me three things.

481
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,439
Are you going to deny it?

482
00:34:49,439 --> 00:34:51,660
I thought that you had forgotten it.

483
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:55,099
I'm Li Changge. I never break my promises.

484
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:59,540
Since you have brought it up, you already have your idea, go ahead.

485
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,058
I am not sure yet.

486
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:04,979
But, first, I have thought about it for a while.

487
00:35:05,819 --> 00:35:11,479
Could you be more girlish in the future?

488
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,460
You mean... I lack femininity?

489
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,538
No, no.

490
00:35:18,539 --> 00:35:20,339
How could it be? I...

491
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:23,060
I am worried about you.

492
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,419
I am worried that you always fight regardless of your own life

493
00:35:25,419 --> 00:35:27,578
and plan it effortlessly.

494
00:35:27,578 --> 00:35:31,179
Little Counselor, give me a chance

495
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:33,200
and let me be your man.

496
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,660
I will protect you in the future.

497
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,740
But I know you are like a wild horse.

498
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,660
You have your own world. I respect you.

499
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,979
I would never stop you from anything you want to do.

500
00:35:44,979 --> 00:35:47,740
But no matter in what situation,

501
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,920
you can't risk your life,

502
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,560
nor can you leave without telling me.

503
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,420
No matter what happens, we will face it together.

504
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,579
No matter if it's wind or storm, swords or arrows,

505
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:01,199
me, Ashile Sun, will fend against it.

506
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,080
Clear?

507
00:36:05,139 --> 00:36:07,059
This...

508
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,900
I'll go and see.

509
00:36:20,299 --> 00:36:23,499
Sun! Sun!

510
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,038
Sun! Sun!

511
00:36:30,038 --> 00:36:32,439
Sun! Don't scare me! Sun!

512
00:36:32,439 --> 00:36:33,720
Help!

513
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,260
Please! Help!

514
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:38,559
Sun! Sun!

515
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,540
Who are you?

516
00:37:28,959 --> 00:37:33,800
Eagle Division and Bear Division were completely annihilated.

517
00:38:00,439 --> 00:38:02,839
<i>Why are they dismantling tents?</i>

518
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,279
<i>Are they going to migrate?</i>

519
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:10,239
<i>What happened?</i>

520
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:14,799
Two main forces!

521
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:17,460
How could they be annihilated?

522
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,079
Ashile Sun! What is he planning?

523
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,119
What can a dead man plan?

524
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,619
Sun is dead, I have no reason to live.

525
00:38:30,619 --> 00:38:35,320
You can kill me whenever you want.

526
00:38:39,739 --> 00:38:42,680
Sun is the god of war on the grasslands.

527
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,940
No one can kill him!

528
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,780
What can valiancy do?

529
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,420
He can't escape from being backstabbed!

530
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:54,059
So many people here want him to die!

531
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:59,140
Even so, Sun asked me to go back with his last breath,

532
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:04,099
he asked me to report to Khan that the desert tribes have united.

533
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:07,339
Ashile Tribe must pay attention to this.

534
00:39:11,979 --> 00:39:14,659
The desert...

535
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:16,940
Good!

536
00:39:18,259 --> 00:39:21,900
I will make them pay for Ashile Sun's death!

537
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,999
- Khatun.
- Stand up.

538
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:48,060
What a pity about what happened to Eagle and Bear Division!

539
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:51,778
I'm afraid if Khan can't accept his son's death,

540
00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:54,639
his situation would become worse.

541
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:58,199
So after he is better, I will tell him about it.

542
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:00,900
Great Khan is ill?

543
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,660
For a few days now.

544
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:07,598
Now he even can't talk.

545
00:40:07,598 --> 00:40:09,199
What disease?

546
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:11,518
I don't know what he is suffering from.

547
00:40:11,518 --> 00:40:14,379
Grand Witches are helping him effortlessly.

548
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:16,599
What a pity!

549
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:20,860
I had't told General Sun about it,

550
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:25,999
they have been separated into two worlds.

551
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,659
By the way,

552
00:40:29,659 --> 00:40:35,479
you just said that there's a secret in General Sun's death?

553
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,920
Don't be afraid.

554
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,759
If there's really a secret in it,

555
00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:45,600
Great Khan will be on General Sun and Eagle Division's side.

556
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:51,679
Khatun, there is a traitor in Eagle Division.

557
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:54,840
All the people are dead because of her.

558
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,099
I am to blame.

559
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,760
I was obsessed with her.

560
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,638
I shouldn't have taken her to the battlefield.

561
00:40:59,638 --> 00:41:02,159
She backstabbed Sun!

562
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,020
Who is she?

563
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,140
I have no idea.

564
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:10,199
When I decided to ask her, she killed herself with her sword.

565
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:16,259
Till now, no one knows who sent her there.

566
00:41:16,259 --> 00:41:20,759
I'll tell this to the women and children of Eagle Division.

567
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,399
Please pass this on to Great Khan.

568
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,640
The desert tribes rebelled,

569
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,859
Khan sent Eagle and Bear Division to encircle and suppress them.

570
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:09,679
But unfortunately, they fell into an ambush.

571
00:42:10,879 --> 00:42:13,820
What a pity!

572
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:20,599
Isn't it familiar to you, Khan?

573
00:42:21,579 --> 00:42:25,820
Would you want to look at it carefully?

574
00:42:33,779 --> 00:42:37,419
It seems that you are not seriously ill.

575
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:42,339
You still can see that it's Ashile Sun's helmet.

576
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:55,139
I've been thinking about him day and night.

577
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:59,859
Now he can stay beside you.
