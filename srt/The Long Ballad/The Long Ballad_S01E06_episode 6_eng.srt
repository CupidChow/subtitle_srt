00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:06,999
♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:06,999 --> 00:00:09,859
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,859 --> 00:00:14,830
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,769
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:24,650
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,719
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

7
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:31,689
♫   Tears and regrets go hand in hand   ♫

8
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:34,789
♫  But my heart is still fiery-hot  ♫

9
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,639
♫  To the distance  ♫

10
00:00:37,639 --> 00:00:40,609
♫  The miserable past is like a dagger  ♫

11
00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:43,619
♫  Though my wings are broken  ♫

12
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:50,940
♫  I will keep flying  ♫

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,199
♫  Following the direction of the light  ♫

14
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,359
♫  I'll forget you  ♫

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:04,380
♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

16
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,359
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,309
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,370
♫  The river of life is under my feet  ♫

19
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,760
♫  I don't regret my craziness  ♫

20
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,510
   

21
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,460
   

22
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:40,880
   

23
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,399
 Sir, your dishes. Enjoy. 

24
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:59,419
 Here's the wine. 

25
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,440
 Enjoy your food. 

26
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,939
Sir, what would you like?

27
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,078
- A plate of mutton. 
 - Okay.

28
00:02:14,839 --> 00:02:17,320
Generals, it's my treat.

29
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,679
It's considerate of you. Where are you from?

30
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:22,118
Honestly,

31
00:02:22,119 --> 00:02:25,878
I have a cousin called Niu Awu who serves in the army in You State.

32
00:02:25,878 --> 00:02:29,100
Do you know him?

33
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,060
Do you fellows know him?

34
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,638
There are indeed several brothers in the camp with the surname Niu.

35
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:35,620
But I'm not sure whether he's in the troop.

36
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,319
Considering your filial piety,

37
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,359
I want you to dissuade him from serving in the army here.

38
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,900
Look for another way out.

39
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,398
Why?

40
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:46,339
You're inexperienced.

41
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:51,358
If you serve in the army here, maybe you'll lose your life soon.

42
00:02:51,358 --> 00:02:54,899
Mind your words! Don't talk nonsense when drunk.

43
00:02:54,899 --> 00:02:58,659
If someone eavesdrops, you'll be killed.

44
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,620
Thank you for saving me.

45
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,079
But You State is a very important city in our country.

46
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,839
Everything is in order here.

47
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:09,319
Why do you consider it bad?

48
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:12,858
Since the incident on the 4th day, Governor Li hasn't come out yet.

49
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:16,478
Other generals are in a hurry to show congratulations and report on work in the capital.

50
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,780
But our general shows respect to no one and won't go out.

51
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,940
Seven days have passed.

52
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,699
- If His Highness blames him... 
 - He doesn't come out.

53
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:29,090
...Prince of Lujiang will be killed.

54
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,440
We, the defending troops in You State, will also be killed.

55
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,019
General Wang and Prince of Lujiang are related by marriage.

56
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:37,599
They're two grasshoppers on a rope.

57
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,700
Perhaps General Wang will be killed, too.

58
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,758
Just muddle along.

59
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,839
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

60
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:48,998
 I didn't expect that Li Yuan would be affectionate, righteous, and courageous. 

61
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:50,700
 So there's nothing. 

62
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,720
Thank you for enlightening me.

63
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,578
Have a good meal. See you.

64
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,278
 Have the food. Come on! 

65
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:13,959
You and I are in the same position.

66
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,398
I've always been tolerant of you.

67
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:16,950
But you've always bothered me.

68
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,350
No need to do that.

69
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:20,639
You are from a well-known family in Shandong.

70
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,360
You have a bright future.

71
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,819
I'm just a warrior.

72
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:25,958
How dare I have a comparable position with you?

73
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,778
I don't want to be your enemy.

74
00:04:27,778 --> 00:04:30,440
You don't have to be sarcastic all the time.

75
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:35,979
These are the gifts from the imperial court.

76
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:37,699
The roads are bumpy. Be more careful.

77
00:04:37,699 --> 00:04:40,479
- Go! 
  - Yes! 

78
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,700
Brother Shuyu!

79
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,420
Where did you get the iron ore?

80
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:16,378
General, we got this iron ore by accident from selling goods in the north.

81
00:05:16,378 --> 00:05:22,039
Our master said we can earn a lot by selling the ore to the blacksmith shop.

82
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:26,739
If you impound the goods, I'll lose my life when I get back, General.

83
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:36,379
It's too wasteful to smelt such excellent iron ore into ordinary farm tools.

84
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,459
Little Brother, can you get more iron ore?

85
00:05:41,459 --> 00:05:42,859
I...

86
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,540
Smuggling iron ore is a felony.

87
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,460
Drag him out and kill him!

88
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,698
No, no, no! I can!

89
00:05:53,698 --> 00:05:56,019
I can!

90
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:01,198
General, how much do you want?

91
00:06:01,198 --> 00:06:03,520
I want as much as you can get.

92
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,499
Well... I have to discuss this with my master.

93
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:15,199
Little brother, remember. I want 2,000 dan.

94
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,280
Let me know when the goods are ready tonight.

95
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,219
In front of the thatched cottage outside the city; no goods, no payment.

96
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:25,339
Okay.

97
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,420
Don't play tricks on me.

98
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:37,020
Or you and your fellows will die.

99
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,679
General.

100
00:06:38,679 --> 00:06:40,839
General, don't worry.

101
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:43,319
Don't worry.

102
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,520
- Go. 
 - Let's go.

103
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,978
Send a team of bowmen to ambush near the thatched cottage.

104
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:02,379
Both the guys and goods will be captured.

105
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:03,879
Yes!

106
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:09,000
   

107
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:33,680
Why are you here?

108
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,079
Do you love me so much that you followed me all the way?

109
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:41,279
You think too much.

110
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,300
Why not tell me you were coming to You State for business?

111
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,100
You didn't ask me.

112
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,280
What do you want to do here?

113
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,519
Just private matters.

114
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:55,100
Deal with private matters at the Governor's manor?

115
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,839
It seems that you're rich or a dignitary.

116
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,479
Don't talk nonsense! I'm new here. Can't I hang around?

117
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,700
I'm going back to the inn.

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,759
Coincidence. I also want to go back.

119
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,880
Shall we walk together?

120
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,079
A'Zhun, take care.

121
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:51,580
See you next time.

122
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,139
- Please. 
 - Please.

123
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,238
It turns out that there's a strong connection between us.

124
00:09:08,238 --> 00:09:10,540
We have to walk together further.

125
00:09:11,699 --> 00:09:13,960
What a coincidence!

126
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,700
 Look at the fans. Have a look. 

127
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,500
   

128
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:25,740
You live here?

129
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,139
You also live here?

130
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,060
Young Master Shisi, why not go back to your room?

131
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,159
You first.

132
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:58,499
Do you think we live in the same room?

133
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:23,539
General, you're back!

134
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,400
General, why are you so happy?

135
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,338
- Am I? 
 - Yes.

136
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:41,599
You seldom smile.

137
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,719
How is everything going?

138
00:10:46,719 --> 00:10:51,279
General, I wouldn't have been angry if you didn't mention him.

139
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,479
Considering your task, I didn't beat General Wang.

140
00:10:55,479 --> 00:10:59,039
Guess what? He asked us for 2,000 dan of iron ore.

141
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,919
So greedy!

142
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:05,440
We don't have that amount.

143
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,959
General, what should we do?

144
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,559
- Refuse. 
 - Refuse?

145
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:13,139
General, I don't know what you mean.

146
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:17,719
Tonight, let's go and see General Wang.

147
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,600
R-Really?

148
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,998
Master! Why did you come back so early?

149
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,659
Did Li Yuan agree?

150
00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:32,279
I didn't see him.

151
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,559
But I have some achievements.

152
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:38,380
A' Dou, look for paper and ink.

153
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,220
I want to write a letter about a visit.

154
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,670
Okay.

155
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,819
 Hope this time my guess is right. 

156
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,680
Yueyan?

157
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,300
Brother Shuyu.

158
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,980
Princess?

159
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,719
Why hide in the carriage? Get off right now.

160
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,059
Come on.

161
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,660
Why are you following us?

162
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,099
Brother Shuyu, in fact, I just worry about you.

163
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,499
So I followed you in secret.

164
00:13:22,499 --> 00:13:25,679
You don't have to worry about me. Don't be willful next time.

165
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,240
I'll arrange for my men to send Princess back to Luoyang immediately.

166
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,239
No, I don't want to return to Luoyang alone.

167
00:13:32,239 --> 00:13:36,080
Men! Let Princess mount the horse.

168
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,380
Brother Shuyu!

169
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,379
Brother Hao, why are you in a rush to send her away?

170
00:13:41,379 --> 00:13:44,200
I'm worried about her safety.

171
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,218
Brother Shuyu, he's untrustworthy.

172
00:13:53,218 --> 00:13:56,080
Can you take me back?

173
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,059
But I'm busy with my official business.

174
00:13:58,059 --> 00:14:00,778
Or shall I follow you?

175
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:03,559
I won't make any trouble.

176
00:14:06,119 --> 00:14:09,958
Brother Hao, You State's affair is urgent. It can't be delayed.

177
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:11,678
It's all right to go back a few days later.

178
00:14:11,678 --> 00:14:16,278
If there's any trouble with her on the way, can you take responsibility?

179
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:20,420
I will be fully responsible for her safety.

180
00:14:28,119 --> 00:14:30,979
Yueyan, you'll have to share a horse with me later.

181
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:34,120
At the next station, I'll find you a carriage.

182
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,039
Brother Shuyu, this bad guy said

183
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,018
that he would not only kill Changge but also you.

184
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,840
Put things in order. Ready to go.

185
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,319
 Yes! 

186
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:49,258
Don't worry. I got it.

187
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,700
General Wang, thanks for waiting.

188
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,340
Yes!

189
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,920
Are you the master of those merchants?

190
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,150
How long have you been in business?

191
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,019
For years.

192
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,649
General, nothing is on the cart!

193
00:16:44,359 --> 00:16:46,299
How dare you play tricks on me?

194
00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:48,200
Wang Junkuo,

195
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,360
I haven't seen you for years.

196
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,480
Can't you recognize me?

197
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,200
You're...

198
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,580
You're the General of Eagle Division of the Ashile Tribe!

199
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:05,499
Ashile Sun! You have some guts!

200
00:17:05,499 --> 00:17:08,860
You bite the hook.

201
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,538
If my memory isn't wrong, it's you who invited me to You State.

202
00:17:12,538 --> 00:17:15,020
I figured out earlier that there was a trick.

203
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,700
But compared with what I want,

204
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,359
I'd better take your head to Chang'an.

205
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,838
That's more valuable.

206
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:27,579
If you go to Chang'an, I'm afraid you'll never return.

207
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,760
I've come here to give you a way to survive.

208
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,879
But you refuse.

209
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:48,299
Master, your handwriting is beautiful.

210
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:51,339
Master, what are you writing?

211
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:55,180
- A way to survive. 
 - A way to survive?

212
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,339
Secrets of martial arts!

213
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,700
You can understand it like that.

214
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,679
I'll see whether Li Yuan accepts it or not.

215
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,180
Maste, what's this?

216
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,220
The the seal of the crown prince.

217
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,339
- The seal of the crown prince? 
 - Lower your voice!

218
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:27,199
Master, you...

219
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,360
   

220
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,719
 From now on, 

221
00:18:36,719 --> 00:18:39,000
 I'm afraid of nothing. 

222
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,620
Have a seat.

223
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:47,299
What? Are you afraid?

224
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,439
What do you want to say?

225
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:52,218
Prince Qin has entered East Palace.

226
00:18:52,218 --> 00:18:53,979
You State is in a state of emergency.

227
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:56,820
You're more clear about the situation.

228
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,379
Instead of waiting for death,

229
00:18:58,379 --> 00:19:02,898
you might as well use the favorable terrain of You State to find your own way out.

230
00:19:02,898 --> 00:19:05,699
I am loyal to my country.

231
00:19:05,699 --> 00:19:08,480
Stop talking nonsense!

232
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,959
You say you're loyal to your country.

233
00:19:10,959 --> 00:19:13,980
Why are you secretly searching for iron ore?

234
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,699
You want to forge weapons in case of rebellion.

235
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:26,480
Are you going to tell me that you are going to pay tribute to the new crown prince?

236
00:19:27,339 --> 00:19:32,639
Your mind is not perturbed because the deal is not that worthy.

237
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:37,678
If Khan wants to help you, iron ore is a piece of cake.

238
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,920
What do you mean?

239
00:20:48,199 --> 00:20:50,600
A Western warhorse!

240
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,419
Calm down.

241
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:54,759
If you want this deal,

242
00:20:54,759 --> 00:21:01,259
the Ashile Tribe will endlessly provide You State such warhorses and weapons.

243
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,760
What benefits can you get by providing us with such aid?

244
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,160
You're quite clear about Prince Qin's strength.

245
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,799
Though You State is important,

246
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:23,178
you can't resist for long after rebellion even if you win for the time being.

247
00:21:23,178 --> 00:21:27,160
Why not submit to Ashile Tribe and rely on our support?

248
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:33,400
You can resist Prince Qin, or even fill his shoes.

249
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,938
It's impossible for me to listen to Yanli, who is quite disgusting.

250
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,040
Stop daydreaming.

251
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,840
Now that you refuse,

252
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,480
goodbye.

253
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,120
Go.

254
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:04,420
General, shall we shoot arrows?

255
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,079
Follow them. Find out where they're stationed.

256
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,600
Yes!

257
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,459
Go back and tell your general that our general doesn't like his behavior.

258
00:22:31,459 --> 00:22:34,240
One more step, your head will be on the ground.

259
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,899
If you understand, tie a white towel outside the cottage.

260
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:40,900
Then someone will contact you.

261
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,879
Who is it?

262
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,979
I'm Su Yishe, a warrior of General Sun.

263
00:22:48,979 --> 00:22:51,880
There's critical intelligence for Great Khan.

264
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,379
Eagle Tribe. Go!

265
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,680
Young Khan!

266
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,098
What are you doing? Stop!

267
00:23:17,098 --> 00:23:18,720
It's my intelligence for Great Khan.

268
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,460
You shouldn't read it. Give it back to me!

269
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,058
Why are you alone? Where is Sun?

270
00:23:23,058 --> 00:23:25,418
Did he die before I took action?

271
00:23:25,418 --> 00:23:28,319
Stop daydreaming! There's nothing wrong with him!

272
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:30,799
Let me go! I want to see Great Khan!

273
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,118
Take it easy. He's quite busy.

274
00:23:34,699 --> 00:23:37,479
Let me read it on his behalf.

275
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,950
   

276
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,700
No wonder I can't get his information. He went to You State.

277
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,579
I'll give it to Great Khan.

278
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,280
Go back to Eagle Tribe as soon as possible!

279
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:21,199
 Mother, are you doing well in Heaven? 

280
00:24:22,199 --> 00:24:24,399
 I miss you very much. 

281
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,599
 I'll do something important tomorrow. 

282
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:31,380
 I can't predict success or failure. 

283
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,839
 But I have no other choice. 

284
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:37,460
 Even the Wei family have turned to Li Shimin. 

285
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,960
 I have no one to rely on. 

286
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,620
 I can only take risks. 

287
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:45,219
 The seal of the crown prince belonged to Father. 

288
00:24:45,219 --> 00:24:48,260
 I want to contact Father's former troops by it 

289
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,419
 to revenge East Palace. 

290
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:53,780
 But if you were alive, 

291
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,460
 you would have blamed me for my impulsion. 

292
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,279
 Don't worry. 

293
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:01,040
 I'll take care of the seal of the crown prince. 

294
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,000
 I won't let villains get it. 

295
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,119
You look upset.

296
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,500
What are you thinking about?

297
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,679
Nothing.

298
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:40,519
I'm watching the moon.

299
00:25:41,219 --> 00:25:42,719
Really?

300
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:47,839
I thought you're upset because you failed to enter Governor Manor.

301
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:51,419
You're joking.

302
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:54,280
I just passed by.

303
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,280
I'm just a nobody.

304
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,479
I dare not make friends with the Governor Manor.

305
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:03,160
A nobody?

306
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:05,900
I remember that when we met for the first time,

307
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,979
 you were full of high spirit. 

308
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:11,799
Are you really a nobody?

309
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,620
A'Zhun,

310
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,400
you're used to trusting no one. Right?

311
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,839
You'll be tired of suspecting others.

312
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:26,220
I won't ask where you're from,

313
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:29,480
and you don't ask where I'm from. All right?

314
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,959
No.

315
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:34,419
Then there's nothing to talk about.

316
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,000
You're so stubborn.

317
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,360
If you don't want to tell me, I won't ask you.

318
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,640
Is your wound any better?

319
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:51,780
It's nothing for a man to get hurt.

320
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,600
Man?

321
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:56,139
Man?

322
00:26:56,139 --> 00:27:01,280
Don't you feel strange that we watch the moon together?

323
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,879
The moon itself is a symbol of reunion.

324
00:27:03,879 --> 00:27:08,660
Seeing the moon in a foreign land, I'll think of my hometown.

325
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,880
That's nothing strange.

326
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,239
I think moonlight in the central plains

327
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:16,099
is not better than that of the grasslands.

328
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,180
Have you been to the grasslands?

329
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:23,239
I just passed by in business.

330
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,520
Yes.

331
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,118
Merchants like you must have been to many places

332
00:27:29,118 --> 00:27:31,659
and seen a lot of beautiful scenery.

333
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:35,579
No wonder you look down upon the moonlight in You State.

334
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,340
I hope I can go to the grasslands

335
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:43,840
and see whether the night sky there is as beautiful as you have said.

336
00:27:45,499 --> 00:27:47,500
You want to see the grasslands?

337
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:53,640
Maybe I'll never have such opportunities.

338
00:27:54,819 --> 00:27:58,419
By the way, what's your business in You State?

339
00:27:58,419 --> 00:27:59,759
Is it hard to do?

340
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:02,819
It depends on fate.

341
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,640
I don't believe in fate.

342
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,920
I only believe in human effort.

343
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:16,020
I didn't expect that a man like you should believe in fate.

344
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:18,280
Human effort is the decisive factor?

345
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,740
Interesting.

346
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,800
You're right.

347
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,939
I made a slip of the tongue.

348
00:28:26,939 --> 00:28:29,020
But as a merchant,

349
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:33,299
you're interested in horsemanship and archery, and are strong and vigorous.

350
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:35,820
Who's your master?

351
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,619
I learned on my own.

352
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:40,640
I've been bereaved since childhood.

353
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,319
I've learned these skills just for survival.

354
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,079
You're quite gifted.

355
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:51,739
Unlike me, I've learned from...

356
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,359
 If you're tired, get some rest. 

357
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:12,058
 No! I can! 

358
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:14,039
♫   Thoughts can turn into scars, with eyes seeing hostility   ♫

359
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,419
 Stand straight! 

360
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:20,300
♫   Remembering our past trying to forget ourselves   ♫

361
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,299
♫   The long ballad is silent; Wielding a double-edge 
 sword without victory  ♫

362
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,999
♫   Longing to live without life   ♫

363
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,519
♫   Why should I continue to have hope?   ♫

364
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,239
 Stand up! 

365
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:31,540
 Again! 

366
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:35,670
♫   No delusions and no dust; There is no sign of it   ♫

367
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,840
   

368
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,999
 I don't know how to repay you. 

369
00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:43,659
 Now that the dagger is won by myself, I should give it to you. 

370
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:46,530
 Xiao Yongning, you've grown up. 

371
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,120
   

372
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,120
 One day, 

373
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,159
 I'll kill my mother's murderer with this dagger. 

374
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:59,350
♫   The dark side of the world turns to frost   ♫

375
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:05,450
♫   What if persistence disappears like fleeting glory?; 
It's okay to forget   ♫

376
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:13,339
If you're done looking, return it to the rightful owner.

377
00:30:17,199 --> 00:30:19,480
You sound petty.

378
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,520
You talk like a woman.

379
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,020
Not going to look anymore. Boring.

380
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:23,959
You should eat more meat.

381
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:25,400
You're too slim.

382
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
None of your business.

383
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,680
Master, why haven't you...

384
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:33,979
I saw nothing. Go on.

385
00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:43,660
Thank you for accompanying me.

386
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,779
Master, why is the merchant also here?

387
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:56,400
None of your business. Go to bed.

388
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:11,619
 Young Master Shisi, in fact, the moonlight on the grasslands 

389
00:32:11,619 --> 00:32:14,119
 is not as beautiful as you think. 

390
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,879
Your Highness, since you asked me to come at midnight,

391
00:32:29,879 --> 00:32:31,820
what can I do for you?

392
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,800
Do you have any information on Changge?

393
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:40,319
Someone saw Princess Yongning on the official road to You State.

394
00:32:50,499 --> 00:32:56,160
It seems that she is determined to fight me to the end.

395
00:32:56,839 --> 00:33:02,260
Your Highness, the men I sent will be in You State soon.

396
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,359
Don't hurt her.

397
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:06,820
You treat Princess Yongning as your own daughter.

398
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,059
You've been teaching her carefully these years.

399
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:10,660
I witnessed that.

400
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,260
And I understand your kindness.

401
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:17,500
But the seal of the crown prince is out of the ordinary.

402
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:21,279
Great Tang Dynasty has just been established. All kinds of forces are covetous.

403
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,869
Princess Yongning is still young. She's seen little of the world.

404
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:27,358
Can she really distinguish between good and evil

405
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,539
and deal with them properly when surrounded by so many forces?

406
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:37,100
If one day she is bewitched

407
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:41,679
and uses the seal to do something harmful to our country,

408
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,539
the consequences would be unimaginable.

409
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:49,639
Keming.

410
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,900
I'm tired.

411
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,280
You shall leave.

412
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:01,920
You know the pros and cons clearly.

413
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,900
Things have never been perfect since ancient times.

414
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,919
I hope you can be decisive.

415
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,000
I shall leave.

416
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:29,798
A'Dou, this time, I don't know whether I can come back smoothly.

417
00:34:29,798 --> 00:34:35,120
If I haven't come back at dusk, take the seal with you and ask A'Zhun to take you away.

418
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:38,559
That merchant? Why?

419
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,599
I don't know.

420
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,638
I think he's trustworthy.

421
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,120
- But... 
 - It's my order.

422
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,819
 I hope I won't run into you. 

423
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,700
Any information from Chang'an?

424
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:42,678
Don't worry, Governor. Anyway, I'll guarantee your safety.

425
00:35:42,678 --> 00:35:44,400
 Report! 

426
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,659
Governor, someone is outside.

427
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:51,439
He said he's your old friend. He wants to see you.

428
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:54,360
And he asked me to give it to you.

429
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,000
   

430
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:16,160
Governor, why are you frightened?

431
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:19,000
He's from East Palace.

432
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,600
What?

433
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:37,950
   

434
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:55,159
As former subordinates of the prince, this is your hospitality?

435
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:58,499
A coup happened in the East Palace. We've long been subordinated to the court.

436
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:00,919
I won't allow you to act wildly here.

437
00:37:01,879 --> 00:37:06,359
Since you're from East Palace, you'd better fold your hands for capture.

438
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:07,599
I'm here to see the Prince of Lujiang.

439
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,699
You have no right to see him.

440
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:12,979
I'm here to give him a way to survive.

441
00:37:12,979 --> 00:37:16,140
Let me listen first.

442
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,479
You State is abandoned and in danger.

443
00:37:19,479 --> 00:37:21,239
If he doesn't lead the troops to fight against the rebels,

444
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,958
will he await his doom?

445
00:37:22,958 --> 00:37:24,860
Nonsense!

446
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,500
Wait!

447
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:40,418
Be careful. He may be a spy of the court.

448
00:37:40,418 --> 00:37:42,379
So my guess is right.

449
00:37:42,379 --> 00:37:45,980
You're so nervous because you're preparing to rebel.

450
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,680
Right?

451
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,140
Since you've figured it out, I have to kill you.

452
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,320
Since you want to kill me, Yongning will die with no pity.

453
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,700
Yongning?

454
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,660
You're Xiao Yongning?

455
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,840
Brother Shuyu.

456
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:27,879
You shall leave.

457
00:38:27,879 --> 00:38:29,860
Yes.

458
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,620
We're in You State.

459
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,520
Here's what I think.

460
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:39,579
Shall I first take Princess to the inn and then meet you in Governor Manor?

461
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:42,180
You're the envoy from Chang'an.

462
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,940
It's unsuitable for me to do that.

463
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:49,979
But I'm afraid that you are doing that, not for protecting her,

464
00:38:49,979 --> 00:38:53,780
but keeping her away from me so that you can go and see that Princess.

465
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:57,259
Why do you frame me with no evidence?

466
00:38:57,259 --> 00:39:00,059
If I don't protect her, will you?

467
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:02,660
It doesn't matter.

468
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,800
Since you offer to protect me, I order you to protect me at all times,

469
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,460
and don't go away any further.

470
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,519
Do you agree, Envoy Wei?

471
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,120
All right.

472
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,300
Since it's the order of Princess, that's all.

473
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,700
By the way, write a letter to Chang'an

474
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:37,459
to tell His Highness where Princess is so as not to make him worried.

475
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:40,919
At this time tomorrow, we will meet at the east gate of the city.

476
00:39:40,919 --> 00:39:45,479
Shut up. Take away all these guards for the sake of security.

477
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:48,540
People can easily find that they're in the army.

478
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:53,900
If I take them... they'll be noticed.

479
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,700
Let me take you to the inn to have a rest.

480
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,040
But you have to ride the horse on your own.

481
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,579
 I must stall for time. 

482
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:43,239
Considering your speed, you won't arrive at the inn until nightfall.

483
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:46,178
I'm the princess, you must listen to me.

484
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:49,798
All right. Just hang around on your own.

485
00:40:49,798 --> 00:40:51,600
Go!

486
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,900
Hao Du!

487
00:40:57,959 --> 00:41:00,339
Why don't you wait for me?

488
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:09,259
Princess, hold on!

489
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:12,519
Or if you tumble off, I won't take responsibility. Go!

490
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:15,139
Go!

491
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,239
   

492
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:24,260
God is fair. You escaped this calamity.

493
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,759
It's a pity that I couldn't resist the enemy with the crown prince in Chang'an.

494
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:32,100
Now I live on in degradation.

495
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,900
Yongning, since you can turn the bad into good,

496
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,220
Crown Prince can be comforted in Heaven.

497
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:43,799
Uncle, Yongning is a name that is gone from now on.

498
00:41:43,799 --> 00:41:45,940
Just call me Changge.

499
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,260
I'm very sorry.

500
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:54,199
Forget it, General Wang. Stand up.

501
00:41:56,059 --> 00:41:58,180
I heard that General Wang is alert and brave.

502
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,339
It turns out that he's a tiger-like general.

503
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,018
Yongning, don't be afraid.

504
00:42:05,018 --> 00:42:09,199
Although Crown Prince died, I'll protect you.

505
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:12,518
- Tomorrow, I'll ask men to take you to– 
 - Uncle,

506
00:42:12,518 --> 00:42:17,399
I'm here not for shelter but to help you.
