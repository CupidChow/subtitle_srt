1
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,099
♫   Nowhere to escape   ♫

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,960
♫   No one to rely on   ♫

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,130
♫   Withdrawing smiles   ♫

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,770
♫   Never give in   ♫

5
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:24,050
♫   Forget about one's youth   ♫

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,820
♫   I've never been afraid of loneliness when 
 embarking on this journey   ♫

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,690
♫   Tears and regrets go hand in hand   ♫

8
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:34,790
♫  But my heart is still fiery-hot  ♫

9
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:37,740
♫  To the distance  ♫

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,710
♫  The miserable past is like a dagger  ♫

11
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,520
♫  Though my wings are broken  ♫

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,940
♫  I will keep flying  ♫

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,299
♫  Following the direction of the light  ♫

14
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,459
♫  I'll forget you  ♫

15
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,259
♫  The memory shaped my stubbornness  ♫

16
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,360
♫  By virtue of the light in the dark night  ♫

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,310
♫  I'll return it with a long ballad  ♫

18
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,369
 ♫ The river of life is under my feet ♫ 

19
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:16,860
♫  I don't regret my craziness  ♫

20
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:32,400
   

21
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,058
   

22
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:38,920
She's no longer here now.

23
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,859
I want to fulfill her last wish

24
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,839
and visit the world at large.

25
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:49,738
If you can find someone suitable to take over the Eagle Division,

26
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:52,298
please let him take good care of it.

27
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:57,338
Sun, on this grassland, apart from my son Sun'er,

28
00:01:57,339 --> 00:02:00,259
no one is qualified to be the General of Eagle Division.

29
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:04,759
No matter where I go, Ashile Tribe will be in my heart forever.

30
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,428
Please let me go, Father!

31
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:11,730
Sun, you know,

32
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,910
Father has cultivated you so hard since you were young.

33
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,309
I placed great hope on you.

34
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,389
Why are you flinching now, Sun?

35
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,629
I have been thinking that as long as I was strong enough,

36
00:02:27,729 --> 00:02:29,788
I could protect everyone.

37
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:32,669
But now, I can hardly protect my own mother.

38
00:02:33,718 --> 00:02:36,978
Maybe I am not the hero on this grassland.

39
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,760
Please let your son go.

40
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:43,138
I don't want to compete with anyone.

41
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:45,539
Why do you improperly belittle yourself?

42
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,960
I have done my best.

43
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,900
If I knew this, I shouldn't have done those things.

44
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,500
Let me leave.

45
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,500
Then I will let you go.

46
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,299
But you have to remember,

47
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:18,320
no matter where you are,

48
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:21,160
your father loves you forever.

49
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,440
 Sun, I don't expect you to forgive me. 

50
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,540
 I just hope that after I leave, you will get rid of a burden. 

51
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,279
 Don't suffer for me. 

52
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:43,899
Come on.

53
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,099
This girl is in some kind of trouble.

54
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,979
Everyone has his or her own difficulty.

55
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,360
Since she doesn't want to tell you, why bother to ask her?

56
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,499
That makes sense.

57
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:03,459
But, Elder, can we change a horse when we get to the next town?

58
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,018
Look at this donkey, Little Gourd is about to give birth.

59
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,260
How can she drag us three?

60
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,078
It's too slow. When can we arrive?

61
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,339
The donkey is good enough.

62
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,338
You, young people, have so much time left, why are you in such a hurry?

63
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,279
Drink tea.

64
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,779
Fine.

65
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,959
Do you know that, due to your impulsion,

66
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:28,980
A Yi'er died. What would the consequence be like?

67
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,419
I was wrong.

68
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,419
Please punish me, Uncle Khan.

69
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:32,819
Punish?

70
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:38,399
If I punish you, can A Yi'er come back to life?

71
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:44,378
Do you know that A Yi'er is the only one Sun cares about in his life?

72
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:47,699
The biggest advantage of Sun is not his ability to lead troops,

73
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,938
but he has the hearts of all the people in Eagle Division.

74
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:54,799
But from now on, I can never control Eagle Division.

75
00:04:54,799 --> 00:05:00,139
Now Ashile Tribe is in disorder and I lost my Eagle Division,

76
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:05,120
When can I get my strength back and fight the south?

77
00:05:06,459 --> 00:05:08,359
Nonsense!

78
00:05:08,359 --> 00:05:10,440
Just a bunch of good-for-nothings!

79
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,058
The root cause of her disease is not just a wound,

80
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:27,419
but a mental trauma.

81
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,259
According to her pulse condition, she is dispirited,

82
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,618
with no hope for life.

83
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:40,280
She doesn't want to live, even the gods can't help her.

84
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,938
Why are you looking at me?

85
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:49,059
I can only save her. I can't heal her.

86
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:50,160
Nonsense.

87
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,419
Save, save.

88
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,539
You have to bring her back to life so that it can be called save.

89
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,559
If she can't be brought to life, how can you say you've saved her?

90
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,880
I can just save her, but not cure her.

91
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,419
You have to make her move again now.

92
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,499
Move... Move...

93
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:14,979
Since you two ask for no return, then I will leave now.

94
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:17,379
- No, no! You can't... 
 - Where are you going?

95
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:19,618
- Chase her back. 
 - Where are you going?

96
00:06:19,619 --> 00:06:22,399
A patient like her is hard to find.

97
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:29,279
Not bad, not bad! Looks like a soft girl, but act fast and violently when being attacked,

98
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,579
A good student!

99
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:31,539
What are you doing?

100
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,419
Since you don't want to live, then I can slay you.

101
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,218
Why did you save me?

102
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:38,819
Right!  Why would I save you?

103
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,799
Then I should slay you.

104
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,539
Elder, she... she is moving.

105
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,480
But she spitted blood...

106
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,980
Is that serious?

107
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:15,880
This way to arouse her desire for survival is a strong pill to soothe her depression.

108
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,040
You've found a snap course!

109
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:24,378
Since it works, then I have something to do on this way.

110
00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:25,938
What?

111
00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:28,760
Elder, I...

112
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,039
will be a master soon.

113
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,739
The famous General of Eagle Division is resigning.

114
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,819
You said I was a coward.

115
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,139
I think you are more suitable for this title.

116
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,299
This is the best chance for you to put me to death.

117
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,399
Why did you help me?

118
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,820
Believe it or not, I've never wanted to put you to death.

119
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:23,020
I see you as my biggest rival, indeed.

120
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,799
But we were also brothers, weren't we?

121
00:08:25,799 --> 00:08:28,199
I didn't hate you at the beginning.

122
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,218
I've tried my best since young.

123
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,658
I really worked hard on battlefields, I fought for Uncle Khan,

124
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:38,739
I tried my best to achieve success and earn the recognition of the whole grassland.

125
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,379
But no matter how hard I tried and how well I behaved,

126
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,658
you were always ahead of me.

127
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:46,520
Every time you surpassed me in some aspects.

128
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,859
More and more people are talking behind my back,

129
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,830
they were saying that you were better than me.

130
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:55,819
It seemed like all my efforts were like a joke.

131
00:08:57,219 --> 00:09:00,179
So the more they supported you, the more I hated you,

132
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,539
the more I wanted to compete with you.

133
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,980
But after all these things, I found out that

134
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:07,100
actually I didn't hate you,

135
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,800
but myself that was not as good as you.

136
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,979
It was my obsessiveness that led to the situation now.

137
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,599
I admit that it's my fault.

138
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,898
So this is why you saved me?

139
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:23,658
If I really lost you, how boring would it be?

140
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:25,619
Don't expect my forgiveness.

141
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,658
I will never forget my mother's death.

142
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:30,039
Then stay and retaliate against me.

143
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:33,580
I said that, if it worked, you would have been dead now.

144
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:39,979
Are you leaving the Eagle Division for Li Changge?

145
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:43,799
The whole Eagle Division is no match for Li Changge?

146
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:46,578
As long as I am the General of Eagle Division,

147
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:48,379
I will be responsible for it.

148
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:53,500
But Li Changge, she is the one

149
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,839
who I will protect with my life as Ashile Sun.

150
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,999
As soon as I settle Eagle Division down,

151
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,200
I will find her even if she is at the end of the world.

152
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:06,969
I think I know why I always lost to you.

153
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,710
She'er!

154
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,170
Where is Changge?

155
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:20,188
Tell me now! Where is she?

156
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:28,030
- Please tell me where she is! 
 - Mimi, stand up!

157
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,369
Please! Tell me where she is.

158
00:10:30,369 --> 00:10:32,429
- Stand up. 
 - You were the last one who saw her.

159
00:10:32,429 --> 00:10:34,029
You must know it.

160
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,430
I...

161
00:10:36,829 --> 00:10:39,329
Mimi! Don't ask him.

162
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:42,570
He doesn't deserve it! He won't tell you.

163
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:46,330
She'er... I know who you are.

164
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,508
If you have any grudge, just vent it on me!

165
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:50,989
Changge is innocent.

166
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,849
She was in the south,

167
00:10:58,849 --> 00:11:01,669
and was saved by a man seemingly from the Central Plains.

168
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,469
I have no idea if she is alive or not.

169
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,429
Are you lying to me?

170
00:11:06,169 --> 00:11:08,029
I would never lie to you.

171
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,868
This is what she left when she got saved.

172
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:22,469
Here you are.

173
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,490
This is Changge's wooden hairpin.

174
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:39,408
Send Su Yishe to search along the way to the south. Don't miss any man from the Central Plains.

175
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:41,809
- Yes. 
 - Go quickly!

176
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:53,070
 Changge! Wait for me! 

177
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:16,108
Khatun. Aunt A Yi'er's remains have been packed up.

178
00:12:16,108 --> 00:12:18,450
How should we deal with it?

179
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,668
Burn it up.

180
00:12:20,668 --> 00:12:22,569
Yes.

181
00:12:31,169 --> 00:12:34,568
Khatun, are you missing the Central Plains?

182
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:39,289
"The willows dance in the breeze in spring,

183
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,609
fireflies fly in the summer's night,

184
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:49,049
red autumnal leaves drifting along the stream,

185
00:12:49,049 --> 00:12:58,530
the white snow covers the lantern and glass."

186
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:06,748
The central plain in my memories always has four distinctive seasons.

187
00:13:06,748 --> 00:13:12,450
But in the south, even if it's in winter,

188
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:20,509
green grasses and trees are always on the lush mountains.

189
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:24,009
 Just because of your longings for your homeland, 

190
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:27,768
you gave birth to this trouble-making son.

191
00:13:27,768 --> 00:13:32,088
Your boy is so foolish that he killed A Yi'er!

192
00:13:32,088 --> 00:13:33,589
Fine.

193
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,329
Now no one can keep Sun here. He wants nothing here!

194
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:37,748
And he is leaving me.

195
00:13:37,748 --> 00:13:41,488
I put A Yi'er in your tent, why didn't you take good care of her?

196
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:47,010
Now you two are unforgivable for making such big trouble!

197
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:48,728
Please calm down, Khan!

198
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:54,188
Khan... I... I can die for my fault, but She'er...

199
00:13:54,188 --> 00:13:57,329
She'er is always loyal to you and to the prairie.

200
00:13:57,329 --> 00:13:59,889
Maybe he is not good enough now.

201
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:03,068
But if you give him some time, and wait till he makes progress,

202
00:14:03,068 --> 00:14:05,868
he can take the important missions of the grassland.

203
00:14:05,868 --> 00:14:08,329
Please give him another chance, Khan.

204
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:10,249
Another chance?

205
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:15,489
Don't think that if Sun leaves, I could pass all the things to your silly son!

206
00:14:15,489 --> 00:14:18,748
A loser can never be the king of the grassland.

207
00:14:18,748 --> 00:14:23,030
The glory of Khan always belongs to a powerful man!

208
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,889
The sad face again!

209
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:31,470
I hate you being like this!

210
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,408
From now on, you are grounded for a month.

211
00:14:34,408 --> 00:14:38,509
Together with your silly boy, reflect on your faults deeply!

212
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:57,509
Remember, from now on, don't let me see these things again!

213
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:08,168
General, good news.

214
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,388
We found the people from the Central Plains at the boundary of the grasslands.

215
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:12,009
The guard once inquired a donkey cart,

216
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:15,049
with two men, a young and an old, as well as a young lady in there.

217
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:18,070
The old man said that they were the doctors going to the south.

218
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,670
It must be Changge.

219
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:25,329
Su Yishe, find some more details.

220
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:26,930
Yes.

221
00:16:28,969 --> 00:16:30,769
That's so great!

222
00:16:35,609 --> 00:16:37,970
Mu Jin, stay at Eagle Division.

223
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,349
Just as always, report to me as soon as you get news.

224
00:16:41,349 --> 00:16:43,649
Sun, I want to go with you.

225
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:45,848
I want to take Mimi with us, too.

226
00:16:45,848 --> 00:16:48,729
Many hands make light work.

227
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,889
No.

228
00:16:50,889 --> 00:16:53,168
I need to do it on my own.

229
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:56,848
The big trouble made by Changge has just been eliminated.

230
00:16:56,848 --> 00:17:00,449
If Khan finds out about our actions, we will be in trouble.

231
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:04,110
You and Mimi will be better to stay here.

232
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:06,808
Sun, what about your wound?

233
00:17:06,808 --> 00:17:10,850
I'm quite clear about how my wound is now.

234
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:16,209
Mu Jin, you are the only one I can rely on about Eagle Division.

235
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:17,768
Fine.

236
00:17:17,768 --> 00:17:19,629
You won't listen to me anyway.

237
00:17:19,629 --> 00:17:21,709
I must owe you something in my last life.

238
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:24,669
Find her back quickly. Take care of yourself.

239
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:28,029
By the way, where is Luo Shiba, who was brought here by Changge?

240
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,008
She has left since the day you came back from the court.

241
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,128
She believed that Changge was alive, and said that she had to find her.

242
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:35,809
She was right.

243
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:37,549
Good.

244
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,649
The more concern there is,

245
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:41,869
the more hope there will be.

246
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:44,129
Sun.

247
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:49,509
Have you really fallen for Changge?

248
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:57,489
If you don't want to say it, forget it.

249
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,450
Yes.

250
00:18:01,529 --> 00:18:05,229
I'm saying, yes.

251
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,150
I like her.

252
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,449
Then did you tell her?

253
00:18:11,449 --> 00:18:13,488
Does she know it?

254
00:18:13,488 --> 00:18:17,248
Is it necessary to tell her if you like someone?

255
00:18:17,248 --> 00:18:18,789
Is it unnecessary?

256
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,109
What you do matters.

257
00:18:21,109 --> 00:18:24,850
I think she will know it.

258
00:18:32,629 --> 00:18:35,308
 What nice fur! The leather is of excellent quality. 

259
00:18:35,308 --> 00:18:37,908
 Give me another blanket. Okay. 

260
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:50,108
- Have you seen her? 
 - No. No.

261
00:18:50,108 --> 00:18:52,589
Have you seen her?

262
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,349
You are so funny!

263
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,469
Have you seen her?

264
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,090
What kind of drawing is that? No.

265
00:19:04,629 --> 00:19:07,629
- Have you seen her? 
 - No.

266
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,489
- Have you seen her? 
 - No.

267
00:19:12,489 --> 00:19:15,129
- Have you seen her? 
 - No.

268
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,189
 - Please enjoy it. 
 - Okay. 

269
00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:23,949
Miss, are you looking for someone? Let me have a look.

270
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:25,789
Have you seen her?

271
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,849
Is it a man or a woman?

272
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:35,368
Woman.

273
00:19:35,368 --> 00:19:37,128
Can't you see it?

274
00:19:37,128 --> 00:19:38,489
Yes, I can.

275
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:41,430
Your drawing is quite good.

276
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,688
It's a bit familiar. Could you tell me how old she is?

277
00:19:45,688 --> 00:19:48,309
I don't know. The same with me, perhaps.

278
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:51,269
You are not friends? Then, why are you looking for her?

279
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:53,069
Does she owe you money?

280
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,749
No.

281
00:19:54,749 --> 00:19:57,408
Then, are you in a deep relationship?

282
00:19:57,408 --> 00:19:59,049
No.

283
00:19:59,049 --> 00:20:01,669
What's her name? You should know this.

284
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:03,888
Then I can't tell you if I know her.

285
00:20:03,888 --> 00:20:06,350
Her name is Li Changge.

286
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:08,628
Wait... I saw her.

287
00:20:08,628 --> 00:20:10,729
Where is she?

288
00:20:10,729 --> 00:20:12,530
Follow me.

289
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:29,689
Where is she?

290
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:31,429
Just ahead of us.

291
00:20:31,429 --> 00:20:33,489
There, we are almost there.

292
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,528
Go ahead. Just at the front.

293
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:42,670
Pass that door and we will see her.

294
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,790
Tell me the truth. Who is your boss? Who asked you to find Li Changge?

295
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:50,369
Are you from Chang'an?

296
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:01,028
Liar!

297
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:03,069
Lady... no, no... Swordswoman! Don't be angry.

298
00:21:03,069 --> 00:21:04,648
Just a misunderstanding.

299
00:21:04,648 --> 00:21:07,568
- Was she killed by you? 
 - No, no. I am her friend.

300
00:21:07,568 --> 00:21:09,890
How could I kill her?

301
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,788
- Friend? 
 - Yes, yes.

302
00:21:11,788 --> 00:21:14,290
We were in the same camp.

303
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:16,289
What is a friend?

304
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:26,668
That's it. Then I don't know what happened next.

305
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:33,169
I never thought that Young Master would have gone through this.

306
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:35,628
Young Master had good luck!

307
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:39,128
She was captured by Ashile Tribe. She could even make them into such a mess.

308
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:40,788
Maybe not.

309
00:21:40,788 --> 00:21:43,089
What do you mean?

310
00:21:43,089 --> 00:21:47,109
We don't know if she is alive or not, so we don't know if she has good luck.

311
00:21:49,129 --> 00:21:50,468
Believe me, Miss Luo.

312
00:21:50,468 --> 00:21:53,849
People of Yanxing Sect have been looking for her, too.

313
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:56,209
We will finally find a way out.

314
00:21:56,209 --> 00:21:58,349
Yanxing Sect?

315
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:04,128
We were the staff of the former governor of Shuo State, Gongsun Heng.

316
00:22:04,128 --> 00:22:09,969
We are now following your master, and we are called Yanxing Sect.

317
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:13,368
We pretend to be a trade caravan.

318
00:22:13,368 --> 00:22:16,249
You should believe us.

319
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:22,569
More people will be of more power.

320
00:22:22,569 --> 00:22:28,430
It will be hard for you to find her only by this drawing.

321
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,730
Why?

322
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:39,350
Anyway, we will look for her with you together.

323
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,549
Miss Luo, since we are for the same goal,

324
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,988
we have to exchange our messages,

325
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:48,189
so that we can work together to find Young Master.

326
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,909
No matter who gets the message first,

327
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:56,009
we have to contact each other through these codes on this paper.

328
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,990
Is that clear?

329
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,190
Take this, too.

330
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,408
Miss, you'll be in danger if you go alone.

331
00:23:27,408 --> 00:23:29,670
Do you need my protection?

332
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:41,889
Okay. Never mind.

333
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,808
Situ Langlang! Is that enough?

334
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,649
No! Not enough! Far away!

335
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:56,969
Taoist Sun is my creditor. He asked me to train you to cure you.

336
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,408
I have to listen to him.

337
00:23:58,408 --> 00:24:00,629
Cure? You call this a cure?

338
00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:03,428
Watch it! If you get hurt, it won't be good.

339
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,888
Situ! Your apprentice is quite good!

340
00:24:11,888 --> 00:24:13,729
Stop! Stop!

341
00:24:13,729 --> 00:24:15,449
What... what apprentice?

342
00:24:15,449 --> 00:24:19,209
You take a long weapon, bullying a girl with no weapon.

343
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:22,569
- How could you say you are a swordsman? 
 - Bully you?

344
00:24:23,409 --> 00:24:25,408
Since you have to counter with me every day,

345
00:24:25,408 --> 00:24:28,810
why not give me your weapon?

346
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,989
Of course, I can.

347
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,750
So what?

348
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:56,189
- Why you... 
 - Again!

349
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:09,029
How is it? Am I superior?

350
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:14,849
Little girl, would you like to be my apprentice?

351
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:19,168
We are of the same age. I won't take you as my master.

352
00:25:19,168 --> 00:25:20,569
Don't say it.

353
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:22,789
It's been hard for me to find an apprentice.

354
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:26,688
Think about it. Yue Maiden's Swordsmanship has to be inherited.

355
00:25:26,688 --> 00:25:30,729
If I learn it, can I conquer all enemies,

356
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,029
and kill all the enemies on the battlefield?

357
00:25:33,029 --> 00:25:35,029
Of course, so easy.

358
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,929
If it's true, if you can help me with my revenge,

359
00:25:38,929 --> 00:25:41,290
then I would like to take you as my master.

360
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:49,449
Forget it. I won't do it. You didn't hear it.

361
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:50,609
Wait!

362
00:25:50,609 --> 00:25:52,528
You haven't taught me. How do you know that I can't?

363
00:25:52,528 --> 00:25:54,829
I've heard what you said.

364
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:57,128
We are in a different world, you can't learn it.

365
00:25:57,128 --> 00:25:59,568
- Don't waste our time. 
 - I don't believe it.

366
00:25:59,568 --> 00:26:02,248
You are so stubborn.

367
00:26:02,248 --> 00:26:05,569
Fine, I'll teach you.

368
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:09,068
But you know what, you can't learn it.

369
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:12,769
I'm Li Changge. Thanks for teaching me swordsmanship, Situ.

370
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,750
Fine.

371
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:22,108
She just recovered, so don't make her too tired.

372
00:26:22,108 --> 00:26:27,349
Elder... I also worked hard, why don't you care about me?

373
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:32,368
Little girl, I have a student. He was asking me for a diagnosis.

374
00:26:32,368 --> 00:26:35,330
Would you come with us to Luoyang?

375
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,830
Luoyang?

376
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:40,689
I said you should leave first.

377
00:26:40,689 --> 00:26:42,729
If you didn't have to take care of me,

378
00:26:42,729 --> 00:26:45,129
you would already be in Luoyang.

379
00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:50,469
If I didn't have you, I would have already died.

380
00:26:50,469 --> 00:26:53,628
Don't say that. We will soon arrive in Luoyang.

381
00:26:53,628 --> 00:26:56,950
As soon as we arrive, I will find you a good physician.

382
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:01,749
Don't brag. It's said the physician in Luoyang is very expensive...

383
00:27:01,749 --> 00:27:04,929
Xiao Wu! I'll carry you.

384
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:06,549
- Come on. 
 - No, no.

385
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:08,768
I am a strong man.

386
00:27:08,768 --> 00:27:10,849
How could I let a girl carry me?

387
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:12,329
Where can I put my dignity as a man?

388
00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:13,489
- Come on. 
 - No. 
   - Help! 

389
00:27:13,489 --> 00:27:16,948
Help! Help! Help!

390
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:23,709
Don't beat him! Don't beat him!

391
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,690
You are also refugees from the north?

392
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,788
Don't be afraid. He is not a good man.

393
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,768
Just a bad official in the government.

394
00:27:38,768 --> 00:27:40,549
You're lucky to meet us.

395
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,668
Go! Let's divide our grains!

396
00:27:42,668 --> 00:27:44,210
Go!

397
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,608
Let's go. Follow them and have a look.

398
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,308
 - We have food, folks! 
 - We have food! 

399
00:28:08,308 --> 00:28:09,988
 Mine! Mine! 

400
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:13,049
 Don't grab mine! Don't grab mine! 

401
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:15,109
 I want it! 

402
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:20,029
Folks! Look at this bad official!

403
00:28:20,029 --> 00:28:23,288
He was transferring so many grains but refused to give us any.

404
00:28:23,288 --> 00:28:25,589
How could he do that?

405
00:28:25,589 --> 00:28:27,969
Since he wants to starve us to death,

406
00:28:27,969 --> 00:28:31,829
then it's not wrong for us to grab this!

407
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:34,009
 - Yes, we were right! 
 - We did a right thing! 

408
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:37,788
Do you know why they refused to give us food?

409
00:28:37,788 --> 00:28:39,529
 - Why? 
 - Why? 

410
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:43,410
Now the distinguished are in power, we normal folks have no way to go.

411
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:48,209
Now we are in such a disaster, so many innocent people are in trouble.

412
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:51,868
Those nobles and officials in Luoyang even feed their dogs with meat,

413
00:28:51,868 --> 00:28:53,849
instead of sharing food with poor people.

414
00:28:53,849 --> 00:28:58,888
So even death would not expiate the crimes of these men.

415
00:28:58,888 --> 00:29:00,388
 Yes! Yes! 

416
00:29:00,388 --> 00:29:02,489
You're wrong!

417
00:29:05,129 --> 00:29:06,929
What's wrong?

418
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:09,468
We have no food now because of the natural disaster.

419
00:29:09,468 --> 00:29:12,969
It's been desolate soil along the way here. No food can be produced.

420
00:29:12,969 --> 00:29:15,728
We can't avoid natural disasters, while man-made calamity is inevitable.

421
00:29:15,728 --> 00:29:17,828
Now you grab these grains,

422
00:29:17,828 --> 00:29:21,589
those who are waiting for it would be starved to death.

423
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:25,509
If not, we would be starved to death.

424
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:27,468
 - Yes, yes! 
 - We would die! 

425
00:29:27,468 --> 00:29:28,948
Yes! It would be us instead.

426
00:29:28,948 --> 00:29:32,229
But you should not kill them.

427
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:36,709
They just transferred these grains as asked from afar to earn their wages.

428
00:29:36,709 --> 00:29:38,888
He might need to support a whole family.

429
00:29:38,888 --> 00:29:42,408
They are also the friends, families, and brothers of others.

430
00:29:42,408 --> 00:29:45,489
They also have families waiting for him to go back.

431
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,248
What a miserable wretch!

432
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:55,128
She is speaking up for the government even in this situation.

433
00:29:55,128 --> 00:29:57,969
If you don't want to eat it, then don't!

434
00:29:57,969 --> 00:30:00,149
- Piss off! Go away! 
 - Go away!

435
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:01,189
 Go away! Don't stay here! 

436
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,549
 - Piss off! 
 - Go! Go! 

437
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:04,828
 - Piss off! 
 - Piss off! 

438
00:30:04,828 --> 00:30:08,509
 - Come on, distribute the grains. 
 - Come on, come on. 

439
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,530
Stop.

440
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,450
Elder, have you ever seen her?

441
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:30,648
What happened these days?

442
00:30:30,648 --> 00:30:34,569
Someone asked me with a painting, too.

443
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:36,189
What a coincidence!

444
00:30:36,189 --> 00:30:38,969
You are looking for the same person.

445
00:30:38,969 --> 00:30:40,870
Where did he go?

446
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,450
Who are you?

447
00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:12,729
It has been a long time since we met.

448
00:31:12,729 --> 00:31:14,530
It's you.

449
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:45,310
 Since you have made it to Yun State, please hold on. 

450
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:47,430
 I will find you. 

451
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:57,248
It's been a tough time for you. You haven't even had any water.

452
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:00,708
Hold on. We will find the princess.

453
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:30,288
Your Majesty, Hao Du sent a message,

454
00:32:30,288 --> 00:32:33,529
Princess Yongan once appeared in Yun State.

455
00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:37,769
It's said that she went to Luoyang with a refugee.

456
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,150
Okay.

457
00:32:47,369 --> 00:32:52,349
I knew that Yan'er would be all right.

458
00:32:52,349 --> 00:32:54,209
Mr. Du, please stand up!

459
00:32:54,209 --> 00:32:55,730
Pass my order.

460
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:59,008
Dispatch more people to find Yan in Yun State and Luoyang.

461
00:32:59,008 --> 00:33:00,709
She has to be found quickly!

462
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:04,268
Send her back safely to me!

463
00:33:04,268 --> 00:33:06,128
No worries, Your Majesty!

464
00:33:06,128 --> 00:33:09,329
I had already arranged this as soon as I got the message.

465
00:33:09,329 --> 00:33:12,408
Princess Yongan can turn ill luck into good.

466
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:15,868
Don't be too anxious about it, Your Majesty.

467
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:21,210
How can I calm down under such a situation?

468
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:24,110
The disaster is getting worse and worse.

469
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,429
More and more refugees are coming out.

470
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:29,888
It's fairly good here in Chang'an,

471
00:33:29,888 --> 00:33:33,368
but Luoyang is full of refugees and starved bodies now.

472
00:33:33,368 --> 00:33:37,128
It's too wretched to hear such a situation.

473
00:33:37,128 --> 00:33:42,009
Now the most important thing is to calm down the refugees.

474
00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:46,480
All the people of Tang are my subjects,

475
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,689
I am so worried.

476
00:33:49,689 --> 00:33:51,930
But I have no time for them.

477
00:33:52,388 --> 00:33:56,900
Mr. Du, would it be good to arrange my prince

478
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:00,040
to calm refugees in Luoyang for me?

479
00:34:00,049 --> 00:34:02,729
Your Majesty loves people deeply.

480
00:34:02,729 --> 00:34:04,488
If you dispatch prince to do that,

481
00:34:04,488 --> 00:34:10,089
I believe people in Luoyang would feel your sincerity.

482
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:14,750
But Crown Prince is too mischievous, I can't rely upon him.

483
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:20,230
I have to dispatch someone to go with him and take care of him.

484
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:26,928
Send Young Master Wei to go with him. He is a careful and prudent man.

485
00:34:26,928 --> 00:34:31,688
Crown Prince can't be too outrageous with him by his side.

486
00:34:31,688 --> 00:34:36,540
Yes. Your Majesty, after I finish my work,

487
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,420
I will head to Luoyang, too.

488
00:34:40,428 --> 00:34:42,388
What are you going to do in Luoyang?

489
00:34:42,388 --> 00:34:45,208
Although Ashile Tribe has already retreated,

490
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,288
but the peace can't last long.

491
00:34:47,288 --> 00:34:50,149
We will have a fight sooner or later.

492
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,889
I think I am not good enough for this issue,

493
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:56,169
and I am not feeling good recently.

494
00:34:56,169 --> 00:35:00,628
I want to head to Luoyang and

495
00:35:00,628 --> 00:35:03,949
find someone more suitable for the position of Minister of War.

496
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:05,449
Who is it?

497
00:35:05,449 --> 00:35:07,129
The abandoned talent of the Sui Dynasty.

498
00:35:07,129 --> 00:35:09,650
Li Jing, Li Yaoshi.

499
00:35:20,349 --> 00:35:23,670
Sister, have some rest.

500
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,248
No, I'm okay.

501
00:35:27,248 --> 00:35:29,348
You can't even tell lies.

502
00:35:29,348 --> 00:35:31,789
You are already sweating.

503
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:35,348
- Xiao Wu. 
 - Sister.

504
00:35:35,348 --> 00:35:37,010
Xiao Wu.

505
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,608
Forget it. You're tired.

506
00:35:41,608 --> 00:35:43,929
- Xiao Wu. 
 - Let me walk.

507
00:35:43,929 --> 00:35:46,748
Don't say that. We are almost there in Luoyang.

508
00:35:46,748 --> 00:35:48,629
Just ahead of...

509
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,688
Xiao Wu!

510
00:35:53,688 --> 00:35:55,768
Xiao Wu, don't sleep. Xiao Wu!

511
00:35:55,768 --> 00:35:57,989
Xiao Wu, don't sleep. Xiao Wu!

512
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,649
Xiao Wu, wake up! It's my order, don't sleep!

513
00:36:00,649 --> 00:36:02,049
Xiao Wu!

514
00:36:02,049 --> 00:36:05,188
Sister... you...

515
00:36:05,188 --> 00:36:08,789
Are you really a princess?

516
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:11,008
Yes, I am.

517
00:36:11,008 --> 00:36:14,288
When we arrive at Luoyang, you can have anything you want.

518
00:36:14,288 --> 00:36:17,689
Think about what you want most now. Don't sleep!

519
00:36:18,529 --> 00:36:20,729
I...

520
00:36:20,729 --> 00:36:25,609
I want you to reward me with a lot of rice.

521
00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:29,230
I haven't eaten rice...

522
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:33,089
Okay.

523
00:36:33,089 --> 00:36:34,570
I will reward you with a cart of rice.

524
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:37,150
I would let you have as much as you want, okay?

525
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:39,728
Okay.

526
00:36:39,728 --> 00:36:42,169
If you really are a princess,

527
00:36:42,169 --> 00:36:47,470
you must be the best princess in this world.

528
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:52,008
Good Xiao Wu, we are arriving at Luoyang, Luoyang is just ahead of us.

529
00:36:52,008 --> 00:36:54,969
Everything will be okay when we arrive.

530
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:59,010
Come on.

531
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,890
   

532
00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:37,149
Wei Shuyu is here to welcome Your Highness.

533
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:39,569
Wei Shuyu!

534
00:37:39,569 --> 00:37:42,129
Which Crown Prince in this world goes out like this?

535
00:37:42,129 --> 00:37:44,189
Look. Look at this.

536
00:37:44,189 --> 00:37:47,288
No flags, no servants, no vigor.

537
00:37:47,288 --> 00:37:49,028
Isn't it a humiliation for me?

538
00:37:49,029 --> 00:37:51,008
Please calm down, Your Highness.

539
00:37:51,008 --> 00:37:53,649
His Majesty always refrains from extravagance strictly.

540
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:57,029
You are on this inspection tour for your father, you should also be frugal.

541
00:37:57,029 --> 00:37:58,588
Now the disaster in Luoyang is urgent.

542
00:37:58,589 --> 00:38:00,548
If you could set a good example,

543
00:38:00,549 --> 00:38:02,809
and show your determination of tiding over the difficulties with the people,

544
00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:06,750
the people will extol your merits and virtues.

545
00:38:07,929 --> 00:38:10,189
But should I be frugal to this extent?

546
00:38:10,189 --> 00:38:13,449
You see. This carriage is going to fall apart.

547
00:38:13,449 --> 00:38:15,889
Why not ask me to ride to Luoyang?

548
00:38:15,889 --> 00:38:18,409
It can't fall apart. Even if it does,

549
00:38:18,409 --> 00:38:20,169
we can change to a new one at the courier station.

550
00:38:20,169 --> 00:38:21,928
Please set off quickly.

551
00:38:21,928 --> 00:38:25,769
The earlier you start, the earlier you can send your father's bounties to refugees.

552
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:28,828
So that Your Highness and His Majesty can show your concern to refugees.

553
00:38:28,828 --> 00:38:30,588
But I am not the Dragon King.

554
00:38:30,588 --> 00:38:33,609
Would it rain as soon as I arrive?

555
00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:37,408
I've already prepared to go traveling. Now I can't.

556
00:38:37,408 --> 00:38:39,049
What good timing!

557
00:38:39,049 --> 00:38:41,369
Why was my father in such a hurry?

558
00:38:41,369 --> 00:38:43,269
He drove me away so anxiously.

559
00:38:43,269 --> 00:38:46,369
I even had no time to take my toys!

560
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:49,288
Your Highness! Please!

561
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,640
   

562
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:11,208
I must be the poorest crown prince in this world!

563
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:13,850
I must be!

564
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:36,350
Sister, are we in Luoyang now?

565
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:40,389
Almost there, Xiao Wu. Luoyang is ahead of us.

566
00:39:42,249 --> 00:39:45,968
Sister, did you hear it?

567
00:39:45,968 --> 00:39:48,669
Mother was calling me.

568
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:54,489
Xiao Wu, ask your mother to wait for you.

569
00:39:54,489 --> 00:39:56,828
Don't find your mother now.

570
00:39:56,829 --> 00:39:59,950
I'm taking you to Luoyang.

571
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:09,449
Xiao Wu, do you see?

572
00:40:09,449 --> 00:40:11,008
See that pass? 
    

573
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,609
As long as we pass it, we will arrive at Luoyang.

574
00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:17,990
Then I will take you to eat rice.

575
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:24,110
Sister, it's so good to have you.

576
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:29,710
Rice... so delicious!

577
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,599
♫   Gone away, scatter away   ♫

578
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,200
♫   Like the sand falling between fingers   ♫

579
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:00,528
Xiao Wu, I'll take you there.

580
00:41:00,528 --> 00:41:02,649
I'll let you eat rice soon.

581
00:41:02,649 --> 00:41:05,809
♫  Those years  ♫

582
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:07,129
Stop.

583
00:41:07,129 --> 00:41:12,068
The magistrate has an order. Dead people can't come in, for the prevention of the plague.

584
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,409
No dead man is here.

585
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:17,610
The boy on your back is dead.

586
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:20,650
You can pass, not him.

587
00:41:21,489 --> 00:41:23,689
He is alive.

588
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,369
Take him off!

589
00:41:25,369 --> 00:41:27,409
What are you doing? What are you doing?

590
00:41:27,409 --> 00:41:30,009
Let me go! Xiao Wu!

591
00:41:30,009 --> 00:41:32,489
Xiao Wu! Leave me alone!

592
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:34,089
Xiao Wu!

593
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:37,229
Xiao Wu! Xiao Wu...

594
00:41:37,229 --> 00:41:40,189
What? You dare to fight with officials!

595
00:41:40,909 --> 00:41:44,009
Xiao Wu... Open your eyes!

596
00:41:44,009 --> 00:41:46,628
- Piss off! 
 - Yes!

597
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:50,628
Look at me! Xiao Wu...

598
00:41:58,689 --> 00:42:01,849
Princess, I finally find you!

599
00:42:01,849 --> 00:42:04,109
Hao Du.

600
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:07,089
Go. I'll take you home.

601
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:08,688
Why... Why?

602
00:42:08,688 --> 00:42:11,610
Why am I so useless?

603
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:14,100
If I was a bit faster,

604
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,440
if I worked harder,

605
00:42:16,448 --> 00:42:19,609
Xiao Wu could have survived.

606
00:42:19,609 --> 00:42:23,228

00:44:56,949 --> 00:45:03,590
♫  The cocoon in the dark night  ♫

646
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,950
♫  It is sleepless  ♫

647
00:45:20,730 --> 00:45:26,050
The Long Ballad
