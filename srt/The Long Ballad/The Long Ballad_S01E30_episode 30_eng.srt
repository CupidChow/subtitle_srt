24
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,839
Let me see. Which brat dares to crash into Liuyun Taoist Temple?

25
00:02:01,839 --> 00:02:04,479
Boy. Come out!

26
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,619
For a hundred years, you are the first one

27
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:16,399
who has broken into the Liuyun Taoist Temple without permission.

28
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:18,079
Don't you think it is not good for a man

29
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,938
to break into a temple full of nuns?

30
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:25,339
Sorry, I just want to look for an old friend.

31
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,919
I told you that nobody here is called Li Changge or Li Shisi.

32
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,339
 My name is Li Changge. 

33
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,800
 Master Situ, thank you for teaching me the swordsmanship. 

34
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,179
You're too arrogant.

35
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,339
Come and leave as you like?

36
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,498
I told you that I didn't mean to provoke you here.

37
00:02:47,499 --> 00:02:49,539
I'm just looking for someone.

38
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,938
Do you want to fight with me?

39
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,500
Do you think you can win?

40
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,578
You can have a try.

41
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:56,880
Both of you should stop.

42
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,459
The temple is a quiet and peaceful place.

43
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,298
Don't disturb the rest of the Taoists.

44
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:02,738
Mister Situ, don't irritate him.

45
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:05,160
Let him get out of here quickly.

46
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:09,559
Boring.

47
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:11,259
My apologies.

48
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,378
I want to find my friend so much.

49
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:15,360
I'm so eager that...

50
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,678
I've already told you that Taoist Sun saved countless girls.

51
00:03:18,678 --> 00:03:20,759
You'd better leave soon.

52
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,960
Excuse me.

53
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,960
   

54
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:41,960
Does my apprentice Li Changge have another name called Li Shisi?

55
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,729
Doesn't she feel troubled to have so many names?

56
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,760
But things get more interesting when she meets her friend.

57
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:09,900
   

58
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,800
Li Changge,

59
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:26,559
where are you?

60
00:04:35,499 --> 00:04:37,299
Let's take a break and drink a cup of tea.

61
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,800
Okay.

62
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,739
- Ladies, what do you want to drink? 
 - Tea, thank you.

63
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:49,580
Okay, please wait a minute.

64
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,639
It's said that there will be a heavy fire in Luoyang within three days.

65
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,079
The drought has been serious recently.

66
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,458
We don't have even enough water to drink. If it is true,

67
00:04:57,459 --> 00:04:59,160
where should we get the water to put out the fire?

68
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,160
What should we do?

69
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,720
What are you worrying about?

70
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,400
I've heard that the fire won't be here.

71
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,840
Why?

72
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,218
Liu, do you have a secret?

73
00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:13,739
Say it.

74
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,119
Luoyang suffers from both drought and fire.

75
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:19,020
Just wait.

76
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,500
Heaven will let us know

77
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,040
who has brought disaster to Luoyang in two days.

78
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,300
A'Li?

79
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,670
Enjoy the tea.

80
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,460
Look at you!  What are you thinking about?

81
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,360
The tea is not ready.

82
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,178
Enjoy your tea.

83
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:44,979
Bye.

84
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,320
You didn't finish your talk!

85
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,100
- You just talk about half of it. 
 - I'm going to buy something.

86
00:05:52,299 --> 00:05:53,658
 Sachets on sale! 

87
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:55,600
 Have a look! 

88
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,899
Where did you go?

89
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:40,058
Why are you so improper and impolite?

90
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:42,139
At least we are taking action together now.

91
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,420
But you ignore our Yanxing Sect's rules.

92
00:06:49,899 --> 00:06:51,879
Tell us. What's wrong?

93
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,600
I went to Liuyun Taoist Temple that harbors refugees.

94
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,369
Sun Simiao has saved too many girls.

95
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,670
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

96
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,139
I even went in to search in person.

97
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,840
If she's there, she won't refuse to come out.

98
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,720
I was wrong.

99
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,939
You didn't finish.

100
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:15,699
Come on.

101
00:07:15,699 --> 00:07:17,520
Don't be anxious.

102
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,559
We can definitely find our young master.

103
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:25,879
Xu Feng was right just now.

104
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:29,799
We'd better inform each other before taking any action

105
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:31,819
in case of any trouble.

106
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,239
Besides, Young Master Qin's identity is special.

107
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:38,119
You should be more careful before taking any action.

108
00:07:38,119 --> 00:07:44,079
As far as I think, you should let us search for the young master.

109
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:00,790
Finally, you're back.

110
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:03,218
You know what? Shortly after your leaving,

111
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:06,859
a gentleman rushed in and said he was looking for someone.

112
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,859
He kept messing up.

113
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,110
It is Mister Situ that drove him away finally.

114
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:11,519
What?

115
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,480
If I were here, I'd scold him bitterly.

116
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,240
How can we allow him to do that in Liuyun Taoist Temple?

117
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,480
By the way, A'Li, he's been to your room.

118
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,519
Go and check if you have lost anything.

119
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:26,318
It's okay. I have nothing important.

120
00:08:26,318 --> 00:08:30,279
 Luoyang suffers from both drought and fire. Just wait. 

121
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:33,579
 Heaven will let us know 

122
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:37,499
 who has brought disasters to Luoyang in two days. 

123
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,099
 The rumor about the fire in Luoyang is not that simple. 

124
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,239
 Who did that man want to indicate? 

125
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,420
Prince and Princess, do you know

126
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,640
that the rumor about Luoyang is spreading out?

127
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,980
It is said that Luoyang must catch fire within three days.

128
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:59,100
Princess Yongan, your appearance shows

129
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,679
that you must have known it before.

130
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:05,599
But Hao Du heard another rumor in the liquor shop today.

131
00:09:05,599 --> 00:09:07,960
They said the crown prince never showed up

132
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,200
because he's addicted to having fun.

133
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,880
What's more, the candles are always lit in the Ziwei Palace,

134
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,500
which seems to be the hidden danger of the fire.

135
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,840
Sister, I didn't.

136
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,880
It's not true.

137
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,759
Who spread this nonsense first?

138
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,660
Hao Du, where did you hear this?

139
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,100
Capture all these villains who spread rumors to deceive the people.

140
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,220
The rumors usually come from whorehouses.

141
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:41,479
But now it is discussed even in the normal shops of liquor.

142
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:45,259
It seems hard to stop it now.

143
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,419
What to do then?

144
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,600
Put out the candles and pick up an auspicious day.

145
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,620
Dress in formal clothes with the crown to pray for happiness to Heaven.

146
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,579
Your Highness, you also should visit the refugees' shelters in person,

147
00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:01,960
wearing plain clothes without golden belts.

148
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,940
Therefore, Your Highness's sincerity can be seen.

149
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
   

150
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,479
 Minister Du, please wait. 

151
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,699
Minister Du,

152
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:30,880
the rumor just said that there would be a heavy fire in Luoyang.

153
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,059
But I think someone must bring this gossip

154
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:36,479
and the crown prince together on purpose.

155
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:40,939
Your Highness, I see you in a totally new light after a few days.

156
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,138
What you said is absolutely right.

157
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:44,640
But, Your Highness, please be assured,

158
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,400
I will definitely deal with it properly.

159
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,699
Good job, Minister Du.

160
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:59,380
   

161
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,430
Chunfeng,

162
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:24,660
have you leaked the news about the abnormal astronomical phenomena to others?

163
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,000
Your Majesty, the armillary sphere shows

164
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,338
that there might be a disaster of fire in Luoyang within three days

165
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:34,119
and the crown prince is in Luoyang.

166
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:38,860
I just told these facts to Minister Du objectively.

167
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,659
I asked him to take good care of His Highness.

168
00:11:43,659 --> 00:11:45,619
Look at my unfilial son.

169
00:11:45,619 --> 00:11:48,059
I'll punish him when he's back.

170
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,099
Do you know what Du said in the letter?

171
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,458
I let him investigate the situation of the disaster in Luoyang

172
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:57,640
while he kept having fun in the Ziwei Palace.

173
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,100
None of his action is like a crown prince.

174
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:06,419
But to my delight, Du told me that Yan kept helping this brat

175
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,778
resettle the refugees in Luoyang.

176
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:14,900
She's got the spirit of a princess of our great Tang.

177
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:19,519
I realize Yan'er has grown up by her change.

178
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,039
But the price of growing up is always suffering.

179
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,338
This daughter of mine...

180
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:34,679
makes me take pity on her but feel happy at the same time.

181
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:37,780
Her Highness considers the sorrow of the people,

182
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:40,080
which is the bliss of Great Tang.

183
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,459
The crown prince is still young.

184
00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:44,360
I believe he can share the burden and problems

185
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,619
for Your Majesty after abundant experiences.

186
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,918
Chunfeng, you don't need to speak for him,

187
00:12:49,918 --> 00:12:52,569
he should learn his lessons.

188
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,440
He might be soberer in this way.

189
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,640
Your Majesty.

190
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:16,459
This is Hexagram Shi, which means success after danger.

191
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:20,939
The story in Luoyang might be very interesting.

192
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,579
 Hold on. 

193
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,719
 Have patience. 

194
00:13:42,719 --> 00:13:45,498
It's not serious.

195
00:13:45,498 --> 00:13:47,138
The muscles and bones are not injured.

196
00:13:47,139 --> 00:13:52,479
But do not get in touch with filthy water when you're back.

197
00:13:52,479 --> 00:13:53,619
Understood?

198
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,279
Okay? Bind up over there.

199
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,800
Thank you.

200
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,379
Do not get in touch with the water these days.

201
00:14:08,379 --> 00:14:09,979
Okay.

202
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,159
Why are you here?

203
00:14:27,159 --> 00:14:29,059
I'm worried about you.

204
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:32,300
Just in case, you'd better hide outside the city.

205
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,299
Both Minister Du and Hao Du are in Luoyang now.

206
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,340
What if...

207
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,160
I'm done.  You can get your medicine.

208
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,540
Thank you.

209
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,140
 Thanks. 

210
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,340
Didn't you say that His Majesty would not kill me?

211
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,200
His Majesty's favor is grand so he didn't mind it long before.

212
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,400
But you're afraid that Du Ruhui will disobey the order.

213
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:07,400
Wei Shuyu, why are you still vacillating?

214
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,559
After enduring great danger several times,

215
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:11,200
I'm not fearful of these anymore.

216
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,359
I'm not faltering.

217
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:16,620
I dare not to make you take risks anymore.

218
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,139
You don't fear death.

219
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:20,459
But I'm afraid of your death.

220
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,960
These days are the peak season of the Liuyun Taoist Temple.

221
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,640
I won't be able to leave nor do I want to leave.

222
00:15:32,619 --> 00:15:33,640
Let me help you.

223
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,340
Thank you.

224
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,770
   

225
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,458
Father, you never believe in God or Buddha,

226
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:08,459
why do you come to this temple today?

227
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:10,358
It's not I don't believe.

228
00:16:10,358 --> 00:16:13,540
I'm just not persistent or superstitious.

229
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,039
One day before we set off from Chang'an,

230
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:20,039
Li Chunfeng gave me a bag with a tip.

231
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:24,159
It's written that I have to come here when I arrive in Luoyang.

232
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,059
 Hurry. 

233
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,439
 I see your head is dim while the feet are cold. 

234
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,458
 It seems that you can't live longer than a year. 

235
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:38,559
 You are dying within this period. 

236
00:16:39,359 --> 00:16:41,260
 I know it clearly. 

237
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:43,159
 I observed your fortune just now. 

238
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,018
 The result is positive. 

239
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:46,400
 Take this tip. 

240
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,080
 Open it after you arrive in Luoyang. 

241
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,080
 Go there on the seventh day of the lunar calendar. 

242
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,880
 Probably, you will encounter some chances there. 

243
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,960
This fortune teller always indicates something behind his words.

244
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:05,700
Now that we're in Luoyang, why not come and have a look?

245
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,780
Gentlemen, it seems that you aren't visiting Taoist Sun for your disease.

246
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,520
May I know what your purpose is?

247
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,359
Is Taoist Sun called Sun Simiao?

248
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,978
Sure. Can anyone else called Taoist Sun

249
00:17:34,978 --> 00:17:37,599
treat so many patients for free in this world?

250
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,139
Assistant Minister Li asked you to come here

251
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,959
so that Taoist Sun can treat your disease.

252
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,560
Taoist lady, please help to report

253
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,959
that Minister of War, Du Ruhui, wants to see Taoist Sun.

254
00:17:47,959 --> 00:17:49,479
How can you see him as you like?

255
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:51,239
How do I know if you are telling the truth?

256
00:17:51,239 --> 00:17:53,240
Someone just messed up in Liuyun Taoist Temple yesterday.

257
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,960
All kinds of people can be here now, right?

258
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,140
Look at this clearly.

259
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,599
Anyway, I don't know what this is.

260
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:05,719
But no matter if you are the Minister of War or World,

261
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:08,260
the sole rule of Liuyun Taoist Temple is first-come, first-served.

262
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:11,490
Please follow the rule and wait in line.

263
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,280
Changge, it is about your safety.

264
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,619
We can't take it randomly.

265
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:31,219
A'Li.

266
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,200
Yes?

267
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,980
Go and get ten cicada sloughs from the pharmacy outside now.

268
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:41,520
Okay, wait for me for a few minutes.

269
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,260
Taoist Sun, there are two people in decent clothes outside,

270
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,880
called the ministers of something.

271
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,540
They are asking to see you.

272
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:50,079
Ministry of what? War? World?

273
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:51,719
Forget it, let them wait outside in line.

274
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:53,319
Okay.

275
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:00,259
Gentlemen, please wait in line.

276
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:01,959
Thank you.

277
00:19:13,439 --> 00:19:15,139
Wei Shuyu, what...

278
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,599
What are you looking at?

279
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:28,619
Father, I think I've seen an old friend.

280
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,640
I'll be back soon.

281
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,040
Okay.

282
00:19:45,479 --> 00:19:49,619
Sir, are you interested in the pharmacy of our Taoist temple?

283
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm sorry.

284
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,880
I just saw someone sneak into the pharmacy.

285
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,479
Sneak?

286
00:20:00,479 --> 00:20:02,580
Liuyun Taoist Temple is an open and upright place,

287
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,100
 we save people and benefit society. 

288
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,460
 How could there be any sneaky person here? 

289
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,060
 You must be Minister Du. 

290
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,540
Hello, Taoist.

291
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,379
This young gentleman entered Liuyun Taoist Temple

292
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,359
and went straight towards my pharmacy.

293
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:17,880
May I know if there is anything wrong with my pharmacy?

294
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,660
Nowadays, the refugees are everywhere in Luoyang, mixed up with nice and evil people.

295
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:24,119
Hao Du is afraid that some hostile people are taking a chance to carry on misdeeds.

296
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:26,818
That would disturb you and the Taoist priests.

297
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:28,178
Thanks for being concerned.

298
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:31,259
However, Liuyun Taoist Temple is pure and poor as water.

299
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,239
It's unnecessary for gangsters to consider us.

300
00:20:33,239 --> 00:20:37,019
You might have seen it wrong.

301
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:41,119
Please.

302
00:20:55,239 --> 00:20:57,880
Why is Du Ruhui here?

303
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,079
Changge, it is too dangerous here.

304
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:02,079
You'd better leave with me.

305
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,920
Leave with you?

306
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,599
And then?

307
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,920
I'll manage ways to protect you.

308
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,058
Changge, I really want to keep you safe.

309
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:15,200
Can you trust me for the last time?

310
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,280
I don't distrust you.

311
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,578
But if I had any other idea, I wouldn't stay here now.

312
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:27,080
What's more, I haven't got the answer I want.

313
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,060
What's that?

314
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:34,379
Shuyu, I believe that you must have your own business in Luoyang Office.

315
00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:35,599
Just go.

316
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,420
I don't really fear them.

317
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,199
I just have no time to deal with them.

318
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,058
So I'll manage to avoid them.

319
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:43,359
Just be assured.

320
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:46,839
Changge. Changge!

321
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:14,760
Since you were introduced by Chunfeng, I'll be straightforward.

322
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,799
Minister Du, the rest of your life is limited.

323
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,719
If you want to extend your life,

324
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:30,099
the only way is to retire at the peak of your career.

325
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,159
But as far as I can see,

326
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,739
you're reluctant to give up your current business.

327
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:44,480
At present, I can't,

328
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,839
dare not, and also don't want to give up.

329
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:54,379
If you have got no way to cure my disease, let's just forget it.

330
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,520
If you're so worried about it.

331
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,360
I can just extend your life

332
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,590
for three years within my power.

333
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,238
But, after this,

334
00:23:08,238 --> 00:23:11,830
you may be quite miserable

335
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,400
when you meet your death in the future.

336
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,358
Three years are enough for me.

337
00:23:19,358 --> 00:23:21,469
Taoist priest, please help me.

338
00:23:21,469 --> 00:23:22,978
Are you sure it is worth it?

339
00:23:22,978 --> 00:23:26,779
Taoist priests, when you two help the poor and miserable in Liuyun Taoist Temple,

340
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:30,130
have you ever thought about where poverty and sorrow come from?

341
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,289
Heaven and Earth are ruthless while everything has its fate.

342
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,300
These are their doomed disaster.

343
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,580
Taoist priest, you are the hermit,

344
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:41,419
but there are millions of people bothered by human society.

345
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,338
 They have nowhere to hide and can only struggle for survival. 

346
00:23:45,339 --> 00:23:48,538
I read many books and work for the emperor.

347
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:51,319
So I don't want to watch it without doing anything.

348
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:53,880
His Majesty aims to build a prosperous society,

349
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,760
how can I make His Majesty go alone on this road?

350
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,699
Three years are enough.

351
00:24:01,699 --> 00:24:05,559
I'm willing to spare no effort to assist His Majesty.

352
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:10,580
Let's see if we can create a peaceful and prosperous era.

353
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,218
Sister, what are they doing?

354
00:24:26,218 --> 00:24:28,899
Minister Du has said that tomorrow is the right time.

355
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:32,300
Your Highness should take people to pray in White Horse Temple.

356
00:24:33,339 --> 00:24:34,799
Tomorrow?

357
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,398
What's wrong?

358
00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:38,879
Nothing.

359
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:44,318
Brother, from now on, you can't be childlike anymore.

360
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:46,519
Our father is the emperor of the country now.

361
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:49,338
So you can't be a good-for-nothing idler.

362
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:51,459
- From today... 
 - Sister.

363
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:53,680
What's wrong with you?

364
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:57,299
After you got lost last time, you have become verbose now.

365
00:24:57,299 --> 00:24:58,999
You loved me the best.

366
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,219
But why do you stand for the people like Minister Du?

367
00:25:02,219 --> 00:25:04,358
No matter how reluctant you are,

368
00:25:04,358 --> 00:25:07,958
you must follow the principle and show up tomorrow.

369
00:25:07,958 --> 00:25:10,199
I will play with you when it is finished.

370
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,578
Taoist Priest, thank you for helping me.

371
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:25,099
I knew you went out to stop Minister Du on purpose.

372
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,879
But I didn't get...

373
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,520
It's a pity for you two to fight against each other.

374
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,318
You know who I am?

375
00:25:37,318 --> 00:25:41,839
If you are not willing to say it, I won't ask more.

376
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:47,039
But do you know what Minister Du's Dao is?

377
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:52,139
He's not afraid of burning the candle at both ends,

378
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,999
but he's worried that he can't see the prosperous Great Tang.

379
00:25:55,999 --> 00:25:58,559
 His Majesty aims to build a prosperous society, 

380
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,418
 how can I make His Majesty go alone on this road? 

381
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,218
 Three years are enough. 

382
00:26:05,219 --> 00:26:09,058
 I'm willing to spare no effort to assist His Majesty. 

383
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:13,779
 Let's see if we can create a peaceful and prosperous era. 

384
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,890
Maybe you two have got a similar Dao,

385
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:21,330
but different strategies.

386
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:24,438
Do you know what my Dao is?

387
00:26:24,438 --> 00:26:26,919
I can't say I know it.

388
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,569
However, I think your intention is about governing,

389
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:35,900
but I heard the method you selected tends to wreak havoc.

390
00:26:36,579 --> 00:26:41,499
What if I disobey the instruction and take my own way?

391
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,899
For a river,

392
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,938
roes, deer, tigers, or wolves drinking the water makes no difference.

393
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,099
What's more, the tigers and wolves have their own Dao.

394
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,358
The ones who should terminate them are the hunters.

395
00:26:53,358 --> 00:26:56,019
What are they to the river?

396
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,560
Don't breach the natural Dao.

397
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,940
Go with the flow.

398
00:27:03,439 --> 00:27:08,058
Just like the refugees in Luoyang, once they get an acre of farmland,

399
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,779
they can live their life through self-reliance and build their new homes.

400
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:16,058
They want a peaceful and steady life instead of endless killings.

401
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:18,198
You've got a strong power of understanding.

402
00:27:18,198 --> 00:27:20,938
I want you to stay in our temple now.

403
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:24,958
Master, where can the heavenly Dao be found?

404
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:28,899
Nature created everything, the human is just one of them.

405
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,059
You finding even your true intention,

406
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:34,640
not to mention finding the Heavenly Dao.

407
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,600
I see.

408
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:43,779
Now, can you tell me what your true intention is?

409
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:48,140
I thought I could recapture what I lost.

410
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:52,580
But I didn't realize what I was withstanding until just now.

411
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:55,660
I'm not willing to give up,

412
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,919
but I don't want to wait, either.

413
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,899
I want to see the prosperous Great Tang in my lifetime.

414
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:08,958
I will end the troubled times by myself and counterattack brutally.

415
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:11,499
Are you clear about what you are saying?

416
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,440
Don't breach the original intention.

417
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,139
Right. I misjudged.

418
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,899
How could you be content with living a peaceful life?

419
00:28:51,699 --> 00:28:54,859
Madam, Sheng Xin has arranged well.

420
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:58,859
Is Du Ruhui responsible for the security of Luoyang?

421
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,818
Yes.

422
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:01,698
But for the ceremony in White Horse Temple tomorrow,

423
00:29:01,699 --> 00:29:06,178
Du Ruhui has called up some of his people from the Ziwei Palace to the eastern suburb.

424
00:29:06,178 --> 00:29:09,178
Our people will watch their movement at all times.

425
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:13,299
Watch out for another person for me as well.

426
00:29:14,539 --> 00:29:17,640
The one who destroyed Liang of Xiao,

427
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,019
Li Jing.

428
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,618
 Have a look here! 

429
00:29:24,618 --> 00:29:26,679
 Baubles. 

430
00:29:26,679 --> 00:29:28,400
 Come and have a look! 

431
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:31,399
 Attention please. 

432
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,659
Wait, wait.

433
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:56,260
I think you should select this move called "relieving a state by besieging the other" to win.

434
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:02,160
Do you know "a real master won't speak when seeing the game"? 
    

435
00:30:02,939 --> 00:30:05,358
I helped you with kindness win a game doomed to lose,

436
00:30:05,358 --> 00:30:06,818
but you don't accept it.

437
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:07,929
Come on.

438
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,220
 Just play by himself if he's capable. 

439
00:30:16,199 --> 00:30:18,559
Where is this chilly wind from?

440
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,040
Honey?

441
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,358
Honey, why are you here?

442
00:30:25,358 --> 00:30:27,338
Darling, you worked so hard.

443
00:30:27,339 --> 00:30:29,019
An important guest came to visit us

444
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,139
while you have no time to receive him.

445
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,199
You were playing a chess game here.

446
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,518
What a fun day for you!

447
00:30:35,518 --> 00:30:41,139
I'm just afraid that you may be tired so I'm here to have a look.

448
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,739
No, I'm not tired.

449
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,340
I'm not.

450
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,859
Yes, right.

451
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,409
I'm very tired.

452
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,438
I will go back home with you right now.

453
00:30:50,438 --> 00:30:52,120
Please, my honey.

454
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:58,619
Honey, is the important guest at our home that person again?

455
00:30:59,299 --> 00:31:01,099
Duke Du came to our home again.

456
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,138
He wanted you to take over the Ministry of War for him.

457
00:31:04,138 --> 00:31:06,139
I have refused for you.

458
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:11,919
Having a considerate wife like you is my best luck.

459
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,599
Got it.

460
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,578
I'll wash my hands, burn the incense, and kneel down tamely.

461
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:20,220
Practice on my knees.

462
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,718
 You know what? 

463
00:31:23,718 --> 00:31:26,779
 Because the crown prince is immoral, Luoyang will suffer from heavy fire. 

464
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,238
 Really? 

465
00:31:28,238 --> 00:31:29,899
 Absolutely. 

466
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,779
 - Think about it, who brought us the current bitter life? 
 - Right. 

467
00:31:33,779 --> 00:31:34,659
 - Yes. 
 - That's right. 

468
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,279
 That's right. 

469
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,019
 - It's the crown prince's misconduct. 
 - That's right. 

470
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,659
 Or else, we wouldn't be like this. 

471
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,819
 - Right. 
 - Can't agree more. 

472
00:31:39,819 --> 00:31:42,578
 Nowadays, even Heaven can't bear him. 

473
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:44,299
 He will receive his consequences! 

474
00:31:44,299 --> 00:31:46,019
 Perfect! 

475
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,638
 - Great! 
 - Nice. 

476
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:50,260
 Good, so nice! 

477
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:56,609
Don't miss dinner,

478
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,729
or you have to be on your knees for two hours more.

479
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,130
Okay.

480
00:32:57,249 --> 00:32:59,068
Don't move.

481
00:32:59,068 --> 00:33:00,749
Who are you?

482
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:03,329
You brat.

483
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,488
How dare you spread flour at me?

484
00:33:05,489 --> 00:33:06,879
I'm warning you.

485
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,049
You'd better be honest.

486
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,049
Or you will be killed here, I'm serious.

487
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,279
Who on earth are you?

488
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,989
You tailed after me and want me to speak by myself?

489
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,159
What should I say?

490
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,820
- Who asked you to spread the rumor? 
 - Where is that person?

491
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:24,010
You know who spread the rumor?

492
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:26,570
Who are you?

493
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,808
Tell us the truth. Where is she?

494
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:01,450
He is a man of sacrifice.

495
00:34:02,129 --> 00:34:03,909
It's not her arrangement.

496
00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:06,190
Wait!

497
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:09,029
Who is it?

498
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,430
   

499
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:41,830
You often visit our home during mealtime, don't you?

500
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:46,030
What a pity, my husband is not at home again.

501
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:55,388
Duke Du, my husband has said many times

502
00:34:55,388 --> 00:34:57,769
that he has no intention to go to Chang'an.

503
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,348
Sorry to bother you, Madam Li.

504
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:05,788
But I still hope to have a talk with Young Master Li before I give up.

505
00:35:05,788 --> 00:35:08,229
It's up to you.

506
00:35:08,229 --> 00:35:09,970
Please enjoy it.

507
00:35:24,449 --> 00:35:26,809
He missed dinner again.

508
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:30,089
What's worse, he left me to deal with those boring men.

509
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:31,688
Nice.

510
00:35:31,689 --> 00:35:34,989
A'Ning, prepare more washboards.

511
00:35:34,989 --> 00:35:36,390
Yes.

512
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,770
   

513
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,170
Changge.

514
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,219
Changge, my brother promised me to be obedient

515
00:35:56,219 --> 00:35:58,909
and attend the prayer ceremony tomorrow.

516
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:03,969
But the rumor said there would be a disaster of fire tonight.

517
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,569
I still feel upset.

518
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,768
Don't be worried.

519
00:36:06,769 --> 00:36:10,388
The rumor will collapse without explaining tomorrow.

520
00:36:10,388 --> 00:36:14,488
By the way, have you found anything strange in the Ziwei Palace?

521
00:36:14,489 --> 00:36:16,429
Strange?

522
00:36:17,249 --> 00:36:19,369
He's just addicted to having fun.

523
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:22,528
Nothing strange can be found.

524
00:36:22,529 --> 00:36:25,750
Can you find a way to bring me into the Ziwei Palace?

525
00:36:32,969 --> 00:36:36,068
Your Highness, it's better to try the garment for the ceremony.

526
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:38,089
If there is anything you are unsatisfied with,

527
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,688
it would be too late to adjust before the prayer ceremony tomorrow.

528
00:36:40,689 --> 00:36:44,849
I'm unsatisfied with everything especially you!

529
00:36:44,849 --> 00:36:46,509
I told you.

530
00:36:46,509 --> 00:36:49,759
The old-school Minister Du is not here.

531
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,129
Why don't you listen to the Hu-music and visit the markets and communities with me?

532
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,188
If you don't want to go with me,

533
00:36:56,188 --> 00:36:58,429
why did you tell me the fun in the Xunfang Pavilion?

534
00:36:58,429 --> 00:37:01,329
You made me so anxious and curious.

535
00:37:01,329 --> 00:37:02,989
It's all my fault.

536
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,928
Once Your Highness can be obedient tonight,

537
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:08,870
I swear I will manage to sneak out with you later.

538
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,748
Fine. You may leave now.

539
00:37:11,748 --> 00:37:13,129
Yes.

540
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:42,129
Don't be nervous.

541
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:46,628
Remember, I'm a Taoist priest who prays and tells fortunes with you.

542
00:37:46,628 --> 00:37:50,009
I won't be found once we stay calm.

543
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,609
Move faster. Tie Li Chengqian up.

544
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,110
Over there!

545
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:02,310
So, Young Master Qin, you're looking for an old friend.

546
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:05,889
Even though you are not his companion,

547
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,809
you are not here for some kind purpose.

548
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,889
It's a past story long before.

549
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:13,809
My friend would not have arranged the man of sacrifice,

550
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,788
so I believe she didn't get involved in this case.

551
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:19,068
Who is this friend of yours?

552
00:39:19,068 --> 00:39:22,889
Why did you think she spread the negative news about the crown prince?

553
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:25,369
Do she and the crown prince know each other?

554
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:27,409
I'm willing to drink tea with you

555
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,768
just because I think you're a gentleman as well.

556
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:32,509
Please don't ask too much about others' privacy.

557
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:40,348
My friend will never do harm to Great Tang.

558
00:39:40,348 --> 00:39:43,569
If you persist in investigating, I have to say goodbye.

559
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:44,849
Fine.

560
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,789
I won't ask more.

561
00:39:47,789 --> 00:39:50,889
Do you know the Ziwei Palace?

562
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,008
The Ziwei Palace?

563
00:39:52,009 --> 00:39:55,469
If your friend is acquainted with the crown prince,

564
00:39:55,469 --> 00:39:59,329
it is very likely to meet your old friend there.

565
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,769
 Fire! 

566
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:01,788
 The fire is really here! 

567
00:40:01,788 --> 00:40:03,768
 - Did it catch on fire? 
 - The fire disaster has come. 

568
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:05,769
 - The Ziwei Palace. 
 - The Ziwei Palace really caught fire. 

569
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:07,290
 It's on fire! 

570
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:08,869
 The fire disaster has come. It has come true! 

571
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:10,208
 Fire! 

572
00:40:10,209 --> 00:40:12,089
 Come and put out the fire! 

573
00:40:12,089 --> 00:40:14,289
 - Put out the fire! 
 - Hurry, water! 

574
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:15,549
 Quickly! 

575
00:40:15,549 --> 00:40:17,150
 Help! 

576
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,890
 The fire is too big! 

577
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:27,149
 The prediction about the fire has come true. 

578
00:40:27,149 --> 00:40:28,970
 Such a heavy fire! 

579
00:40:31,249 --> 00:40:32,928
What's going on?

580
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:35,669
Your Highness, Ziwei Palace has caught fire.

581
00:40:35,669 --> 00:40:37,889
Where is the crown prince? How is he?

582
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:39,548
Well... I don't know.

583
00:40:39,548 --> 00:40:41,488
Get into the palace and save the people there.

584
00:40:41,489 --> 00:40:43,289
- Hurry. 
 - Yes.

585
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,009
Go.

586
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,708
- Why are you following me? 
 - Go and save the people.

587
00:40:53,708 --> 00:40:55,089
You are not allowed to go there.

588
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:57,099
The more people, the more we can do.

589
00:40:57,099 --> 00:40:58,908
You want to look for your old friend?

590
00:40:58,908 --> 00:41:01,550
Right, but I want to save them as well.

591
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,768
Fine, I'll trust you for now.

592
00:41:03,769 --> 00:41:07,008
But you must follow me or I won't show mercy.

593
00:41:07,009 --> 00:41:08,989
Let's go by the shortcut.

594
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,850
Where is the crown prince?

595
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,329
Has the crown prince been saved?

596
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,868
Your Highness, His Highness should still be inside.

597
00:41:51,868 --> 00:41:55,469
Our people are searching but haven't found him.

598
00:41:55,469 --> 00:41:57,108
Stop!

599
00:41:57,108 --> 00:41:59,109
Your Highness. Your Highness, don't go.

600
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:09,910
Let's go.

601
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:42,990
Changge, have you found my brother?

602
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:46,210
No. But I saw a jackstraw in the crown prince's garment.

603
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:47,248
What?

604
00:42:47,249 --> 00:42:48,999
He'll attend the prayer ceremony tomorrow.

605
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,628
He wouldn't leave his room.

606
00:42:50,628 --> 00:42:51,768
No idea.

607
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:54,448
This seems like a well-planned movement.

608
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:56,370
Yueyan, someone saw me.

609
00:42:56,370 --> 00:42:58,109
I can't be here for long. I'm going back.

610
00:42:58,109 --> 00:42:59,569
Find me in Liuyun Temple at any time if necessary.

611
00:42:59,569 --> 00:43:01,169
Okay, be careful.

612
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:02,670
You too.
