Hurry!

24
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:58,319
Go and get her!

25
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:02,679
Have you found her?

26
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,380
Not yet.

27
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,198
That way.

28
00:02:07,199 --> 00:02:08,799
Hurry!

29
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,539
Master, you really escaped alive.

30
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:28,979
Why are you here?

31
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:31,778
If you wanted revenge, you'll come to Hongyi Palace.

32
00:02:31,778 --> 00:02:33,219
The Hongyi Palace is heavily guarded.

33
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:34,830
I was worried you'd be in trouble,

34
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:36,558
so I've been guarding here round the clock for two days.

35
00:02:36,559 --> 00:02:38,620
See, I'm still of some use.

36
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,478
What's more, no one knows the corners of Chang'an better than me.

37
00:02:42,478 --> 00:02:45,839
Master, keep me by your side.

38
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,700
Master, wait for me.

39
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,860
Master, what's this?

40
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,198
Not a good thing.

41
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:55,899
Save your questions.

42
00:02:56,839 --> 00:03:00,359
As you said, I won't ask again.

43
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:01,700
See, I'm so obedient.

44
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,019
Master, can you keep me by your side?

45
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,650
You'll die if you follow me. Go back.

46
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,019
All men will die,

47
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:15,399
but I think it's worth following my heart to be with you.

48
00:03:15,399 --> 00:03:17,439
Aren't you afraid of death?

49
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,659
Yes, I am.

50
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:21,000
So, why are you still following me?

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,759
But... to live in infamy is more terrible than to die.

52
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,800
Master, you can even smile.

53
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:34,179
Your smile is so charming.

54
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:37,640
Since you ask for death, don't blame me.

55
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,198
So you agree to take me as your apprentice?

56
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,079
Hurry up.

57
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,759
What? He ran away?

58
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,559
That's right. Unexpectedly, he ran away so fast.

59
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:54,519
I'm more interested in him.

60
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:57,480
General, it's not that easy to deal with him.

61
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,399
Su Yishe, does Li Jiancheng have any son or general in exile?

62
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:03,159
Not that I know of.

63
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,758
None of his five sons survived.

64
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,739
All his men have surrendered.

65
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:11,320
That guy may be a nobody in the East Palace.

66
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,540
It seems it's not just us worrying about how to leave Chang'an.

67
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:23,040
It's my fault. I'm to blame.

68
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,259
Your Highness, please allow me to deploy our men
<i>[Bring Forth Harmony and Peace]</i>

69
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:26,958
to search the city for three days.

70
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,740
I'm sure I'll catch Princess...

71
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,839
...the escaped criminal to get the treasure back.

72
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:38,778
Fang Yi, you've served Your Highness for years.

73
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:41,640
Why are you still talking nonsense?

74
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,078
Commander Fang is arresting the criminal.

75
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,439
Why do you think he's talking nonsense?

76
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,600
How can you say it's nonsense?

77
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,439
Though Your Highness has granted a general amnesty,

78
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:55,398
except for Feng Li and Xie Shufang, etc.,

79
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,870
all those involved with Li Jiancheng,

80
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,540
including military generals and dignitaries in the royal court, take a seesaw policy

81
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,459
for fear the amnesty is a lure for them to be exposed.

82
00:05:04,459 --> 00:05:09,599
If you deploy men to search the city, without knowing whom to arrest,

83
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:14,340
they'll all squeeze their way to run away.

84
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,798
Keming, fury isn't good for your health.

85
00:05:18,798 --> 00:05:22,319
It's said nothing forcibly done is going to be agreeable.

86
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,740
Have a try if you don't believe me.

87
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,440
Give it a try.

88
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:30,259
Princess Yongan was born to be timid and fragile.

89
00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:32,358
How can she be capricious?

90
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:38,019
With no one backing her up, how dare she?

91
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:39,698
Why're you looking at me?

92
00:05:39,698 --> 00:05:42,118
The two princesses are childhood friends.

93
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:44,720
It's reasonable for them to call on one another.

94
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,240
Is it reasonable for her to steal the seal of the crown prince?

95
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,398
Here you go again.

96
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:57,720
Princess Yongning is braver than I thought.

97
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,159
Are you praising her for it?

98
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,159
Don't just casually accused me!

99
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,960
It has nothing to do with me.

100
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,320
I won't support her to steal the seal of the crown prince.

101
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:11,819
Enough!

102
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:14,879
Yueyan's in the wrong.

103
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,460
I've shut her up for pondering over her misdeeds.

104
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,100
As for Changge, as I ordered,

105
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,191
deploy a fraction of our men in plain clothes to make inquiries secretly.

106
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:27,300
Don't arouse a sensation in the city.

107
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,739
Remember, bring her back alive.

108
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:34,360
Your Highness, Princess Yongning's highly skilled in martial arts.

109
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,880
- If she resists being arrested...
- I want her alive.

110
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,380
Don't let me repeat it.

111
00:06:41,559 --> 00:06:43,480
It's a big deal.

112
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,999
Don't leak it out.

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,139
Yes, Your Highness.

114
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,090
<i>[Bring Forth Harmony and Peace]</i>

115
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:00,359
Advisor Fang, you said dignitaries in the royal court took a seesaw policy.

116
00:07:00,359 --> 00:07:02,260
Do you have any suggestions?

117
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:05,500
Do you know the allusion

118
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,519
that, to carry out the reform, Shang Yang set up a log outside the south gate,

119
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,999
and promised anyone who can

120
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:14,598
move the log to the north gate 200 taels of gold?

121
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:17,739
Someone gave it a shot and did get the gold,

122
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:19,380
so that people believed

123
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,039
the royal court would keep its word.

124
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:24,399
Those words are easy to say.

125
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,559
But where to get the log?

126
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:33,600
There's one available in the Yongxing region.

127
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,900
Wei Zheng.

128
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:42,959
Father.

129
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:55,179
Father, what happened?

130
00:07:55,179 --> 00:07:58,620
Your Highness is too merciful.

131
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,580
I worry he'll fall victim to his own deeds.

132
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,340
You mean Princess Yongning?

133
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:08,740
Princess Yongning used to be close to Your Highness.

134
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,501
It's not a secret their relationship's closer than that of their fathers.

135
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:14,278
It's natural for him not to kill her.

136
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,879
Idiot!

137
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,179
Li Changge has been educated with civil and military skills

138
00:08:20,179 --> 00:08:25,000
as a prince since childhood, and has been domineering.

139
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,679
She was just out of danger.

140
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:29,459
Ordinary people must be in shock,

141
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:33,799
but she committed the crime of attempting the assassination of the crown prince.

142
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:41,020
These days I've been thinking maybe it was she who spread rumors in the army.

143
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,780
If we can't root her out,

144
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:49,038
it'll be too late to make up for the fault.

145
00:08:49,038 --> 00:08:52,819
But Your Highness has ordered us to not harm her.

146
00:08:52,819 --> 00:08:56,480
Just keep Your Highness's good reputation.

147
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,860
I don't care about mine.

148
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,460
To ensure the stability of our Great Tang,

149
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,360
I dare remove more obstacles,

150
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,419
let alone Li Changge.

151
00:09:08,419 --> 00:09:10,719
You mean...

152
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,479
I can only entrust you with this task.

153
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,299
Will you let me down?

154
00:09:23,299 --> 00:09:26,319
I won't let you down for sure.

155
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:31,739
By the way, go ask Chang He how the rumor-spreading case is going.

156
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:35,959
If there's no progress, let him make room for others.

157
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,499
Yes.

158
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,500
Commander Hao, Father asked me to inquire about the case.

159
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,159
It's under investigation.

160
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:52,798
Please tell Mr. Du that

161
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,319
I'll report to him in person once there's any progress.

162
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,040
If you go on like this, you won't solve the case till next year.

163
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,319
You!

164
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,499
Show me the note.

165
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,120
<i>[Law Favors Honesty and Generosity]</i>

166
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,348
<i>[Crown Prince and Prince Qi were killed. Their remnants were annihilated.]</i>

167
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:17,200
<i>Why is there a fishy smell?</i>

168
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,578
Officer, I'm just an ordinary fishmonger

169
00:10:21,578 --> 00:10:23,100
running a small business.

170
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,400
Did I...

171
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,940
Did I do something wrong?

172
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,740
Cut the crap. Tell me!

173
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:32,218
Who told you to put the note in the fish's stomach?

174
00:10:32,218 --> 00:10:34,760
I don't understand.

175
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:39,159
Tell me the truth, or you won't go back.

176
00:10:39,159 --> 00:10:39,980
Spare my life.

177
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,610
I was given some money

178
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,180
to put the note into the fish's stomach.

179
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,478
I don't know who it was.

180
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,179
I can't even read.

181
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,479
You must know whether it's a male or female, fat or thin.

182
00:10:48,479 --> 00:10:50,858
I know. It's a male. Male!

183
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,299
Was it a handsome youngster with a mole near his eye?

184
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:55,540
No, it was a tall guy of few words.

185
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,518
That's all. There's no other feature.

186
00:10:57,518 --> 00:10:59,079
All I said is true. Spare my life, Officer.

187
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,359
Spare my life, Officer.

188
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,339
Master, let's go south after the meal.

189
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:10,950
The inspection there isn't as strict as it is here.

190
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,340
If you thought of it, they would haven't done the same.

191
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,880
Stop eating. Let's go.

192
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,259
Okay.

193
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,079
Don't look around. They're Prince Qin's men.

194
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:41,098
Let's run separately, and meet at the tavern in the Yining region.

195
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:50,879
Yong...

196
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:53,051
- Run!
- Follow her!

197
00:11:56,119 --> 00:11:58,019
Stop!

198
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:00,979
Step aside!

199
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,360
Stop!

200
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,758
<i>That's right. Don't know what's up.</i>

201
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:09,919
<i>He's quite honest.</i>

202
00:12:11,179 --> 00:12:13,219
<i>What's happened?</i>

203
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:16,759
<i>He runs a small business.</i>

204
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,239
<i>Yes. He dares not kill people.</i>

205
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,190
- What's up?
- A fishmonger is publicly exposed.

206
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,660
Let's go have a look.

207
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,560
Fishmonger?

208
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:47,459
General.

209
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:50,018
General, bad news.

210
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:51,520
The fishmonger was caught,

211
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,739
and is tied up at the intersection of Zhuque Street.

212
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:55,239
That fishmonger met Su Yishe.

213
00:12:55,239 --> 00:12:57,860
Will he expose us?

214
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,880
Ask all our men to leave at once. Now!

215
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,759
Why?

216
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:02,899
You've been exposed.

217
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:04,614
How come? It's impossible.

218
00:13:04,614 --> 00:13:07,241
If they've got the clue, why bother tying him up publicly?

219
00:13:07,241 --> 00:13:10,058
They're doing so for they haven't gotten any useful clues.

220
00:13:10,058 --> 00:13:12,579
That's why they're observing spectators' reactions.

221
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,639
You should have been followed

222
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,158
when coming back from the street.

223
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,840
General, I'm sorry.

224
00:13:25,819 --> 00:13:27,180
It's too late.

225
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,620
They're already here.

226
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,420
What shall we do?

227
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,800
Follow him!

228
00:13:50,619 --> 00:13:52,119
Step aside!

229
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,560
Step aside! Move aside!

230
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,900
Move aside!

231
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,218
How can I always meet you in such a big Chang'an City?

232
00:14:21,218 --> 00:14:23,039
You followed me, too?

233
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,760
You're just in time.

234
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,398
Thanks. Go.

235
00:14:31,398 --> 00:14:33,059
You!

236
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,800
Go.

237
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,220
<i>Chang He, why is he chasing me instead?</i>

238
00:15:18,599 --> 00:15:20,099
Follow her!

239
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,571
- Come on! Go up and have a look.
- Yes.

240
00:15:41,571 --> 00:15:42,718
Commander Fang.

241
00:15:42,719 --> 00:15:44,219
General Chang,

242
00:15:44,219 --> 00:15:47,179
are you also chasing Princess Yongning?

243
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,180
Princess Yongning?

244
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:51,619
Nobody's here.

245
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,698
I just saw her running onto this road.

246
00:15:54,698 --> 00:15:57,259
General Chang, did you see her or not?

247
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:59,540
We've been chasing her for long in vain.

248
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,119
Princess Yongning? I didn't see her.

249
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,120
Go over there.

250
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:24,229
General, thanks to you this time. I'll be more cautious next time.

251
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,030
It's great you're fine.

252
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,700
Thank Sirius Star for his protection.

253
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,699
Are you silly?

254
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,199
All right.

255
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,500
Su Yishe, have you found a way to get out of the city?

256
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,398
General, don't worry. I've found one.

How can you mess up a sure thing?

00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:13,579
That fellow's good at martial arts and horsemanship.

261
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:15,140
He shook us off.

262
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,099
But I found this.

263
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,219
Fang Yi was chasing Princess Yongning.

264
00:17:24,219 --> 00:17:27,879
If I got it right, the Fish Token

265
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:30,620
is what fell off her.

266
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,899
Unexpectedly, losing on one side

267
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:36,420
while gaining on the other.

You must know her well.

Do you want me to arrest Li Changge?

276
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,519
Please tell Mr. Du, there's room for discussion on everything

except for this one.

278
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,319
You know the Fish Token she used to sneak into Hongyi Palace is yours?

279
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:24,239
What punishment does an accessory deserve for stealing the seal and assassinating the crown prince?

280
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,610
The crown prince's seal is missing?

281
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:28,350
Nine generations of your family will be killed for it.

All right.

A'Dou, is there a way for you to forge ID cards?

290
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,000
Forge ID cards?

291
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,400
Master, I don't know how to forge ID cards,

292
00:19:10,401 --> 00:19:12,199
but I know how to be dressed up as Hu merchants.

293

In Chang'an City, there're so many unknown Hu merchants.

who'll be beheaded when caught.

00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,919
You're unable to stay in Chang'an any longer?

329
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,598
As we have shared the same future,

330
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,979
please do me a favor.

331
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:06,862
Have you thought about it or not?

332
00:21:06,862 --> 00:21:08,478
If you're recognized,

333
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:11,639
all men in my caravan will be involved.

334
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:13,980
You're not my friend as well.

335
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,079
Why must I help you?

336
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:21,449
There're so many carriages and goods. They won't check them closely.

337
00:21:21,449 --> 00:21:23,520
Just give me a place to hide myself.

338
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,879
If they do find me,

339
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,140
I'll say I mingled with your men myself.

340
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,919
You're innocent.

341
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,919
If you were polite when borrowing my horse yesterday,

342
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:38,919
I might have agreed.

343
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,079
I had something urgent at that time.

344
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,078
I beg your pardon.

345
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,559
It's no use for a verbal apology.

346
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,719
If you really want to apologize,

347
00:21:46,719 --> 00:21:48,418
just give me something.

348
00:21:48,418 --> 00:21:51,560
I have nothing to trade with you.

349
00:21:53,059 --> 00:21:55,180
I think your dagger is good.

350
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,819
It's an exception.

351
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:01,359
Then no way. Go.

352
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:04,399
Master, get out first.

353
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:07,538
After getting out, we can find chances to get it back.

354
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:16,480
Okay. I agree.

355
00:22:16,498 --> 00:22:19,139
But you have to wait until I get out of the city.

356
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:20,799
Deal.

357
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,838
A'Dou, don't risk your life with me.

358
00:22:24,839 --> 00:22:26,238
You won't be checked.

359
00:22:26,239 --> 00:22:28,279
Await for me at Shili Pavilion outside.

360
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,559
If I don't arrive in three days,

361
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,039
it must be our fate.

362
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,680
But, Master, you're alone...

363
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,450
If I'm your master, then why won't you listen to me?

364
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:38,004
I... All right.

365
00:22:38,004 --> 00:22:40,499
Master, you must be careful.

366
00:22:40,499 --> 00:22:42,299
Hurry and go.

367
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:59,179
Don't you think General becomes talkative when meeting that guy?

368
00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:02,660
General said the enemy of our enemy is our friend.

369
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,118
Now that he's our friend,

370
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,759
it's natural for him to talk more.

371
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,180
Sounds reasonable.

372
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,759
O-Officers.

373
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,078
This is...

374
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:23,139
Has this person come to find a way out of the city?

375
00:23:23,139 --> 00:23:24,070
You must be kidding.

376
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,451
- We're decent businessmen.
- Look closely.

377
00:23:29,639 --> 00:23:31,480
Yes, he has.

378
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,118
When a caravan passed by,

379
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:35,119
he followed that caravan.

380
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,679
Go find her.

381
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,760
<i>Wait!</i>

382
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,360
<i>Officer, here is our passport.</i>

383
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,438
Checked. It's identical with the goods registered.

384
00:24:23,439 --> 00:24:24,839
Go!

385
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,299
Thanks, Officer.

386
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,518
- Go.
- Wait!

387
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,359
Show me the passport.

388
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,519
Commander, I checked the goods just now.

389
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,759
There's no problem.

390
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,279
Yes, they've been checked.

391
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,980
No problem.

392
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:33,660
These are common medicines, fabric, and so on.

393
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,120
<i>[Tonghua Gate]</i>

394
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,978
To some extent, smuggling is a tacit understanding for businessmen.

395
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,639
Why must you hamper us?

396
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,040
Can we go now?

397
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:52,459
Okay, let's go.

398
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:53,960
Go!

399
00:27:22,219 --> 00:27:24,379
Commander, I've searched all over but still can't find her.

400
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,959
Maybe she has already left the city. What shall we do?

401
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:29,859
No matter how she gets out,

402
00:27:29,859 --> 00:27:32,039
if she wants to travel long,

403
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,559
she's bound to pass the Shili Pavilion.

404
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,779
Deploy men to block her with me.

405
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,958
Call Wei Shuyu to see me.

406
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:38,359
Yes!

407
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,039
I'm guilty.

408
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,459
What for?

409
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:55,999
Your Highness, I'm sorry to let you down, Your Highness.

410
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:02,280
I'm guilty of conniving Changge's treason.

411
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,859
No one is more cunning than you.

412
00:28:06,859 --> 00:28:10,659
No wonder Keming is unable to deal with you.

413
00:28:11,459 --> 00:28:15,198
It was me who asked you to shoulder the responsibility.

414
00:28:15,199 --> 00:28:19,579
Now that Changge ran away, I'm also to blame.

415
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:24,919
Are you satirizing me for being a victim of my deeds?

416
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:26,379
I dare not.

417
00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:28,999
It's all my fault.

418
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,838
Come on! You may rise.

419
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,438
Stop pretending and putting on an act.

420
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:34,339
I don't blame you.

421
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:38,779
I didn't expect a girl to be so stubborn.

422
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:42,360
Your Highness, the seal of the crown prince matters.

423
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,440
This time Changge really caused big trouble.

424
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:52,979
So much for that.

425
00:28:52,979 --> 00:28:54,620
Show me the way.

426
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,600
Someone is awaiting us.

427
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,599
Yes.

428
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,200
I'll go get everything ready.

429
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,560
What kind of medicine do you have?

430
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:40,618
Why's it put with abdomen wraps?

431
00:29:40,618 --> 00:29:42,219
Persian aphrodisiac.

432
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,720
What? You!

433
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,140
I told you before you got in.

434
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,999
At your own risk.

435
00:29:56,459 --> 00:29:57,958
<i>Want to hide in this box?</i>

436
00:29:57,959 --> 00:29:59,098
<i>No.</i>

437
00:29:59,098 --> 00:30:03,238
<i>They'll especially check the goods instead of the animal skins.</i>

438
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:06,280
<i>At that time, just wrap me up in the fur and put me</i>

439
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,240
<i>in the middle of two humps.</i>

440
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,058
<i>I know a better place to hide you.</i>

441
00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:12,519
<i>You'll never be found.</i>

442
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,600
<i>You may have a try, but it's at your own risk.</i>

443
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,479
Why's your reaction like of a girl?

444
00:30:22,479 --> 00:30:24,159
Want to buy some?

445
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,039
I can give you a discount.

446
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:27,358
What?

447
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:29,580
You pervert!

448
00:30:37,366 --> 00:30:39,159
Your symptoms are relieved now.

449
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,960
No need to say thank you.

450
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:45,118
According to our agreement, you've gotten out with our caravan.

451
00:30:45,118 --> 00:30:47,658
Your dagger is mine now.

452
00:30:47,658 --> 00:30:49,059
Wait!

453
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:50,619
How do I address you?

454
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:53,859
We just met by chance, and will never meet again.

455
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:56,580
I entrust you with my dagger for the time being,

456
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,499
and will retrieve it back later.

457
00:30:58,499 --> 00:31:01,939
Are you afraid so that you won't tell me your name?

458
00:31:01,939 --> 00:31:03,820
Su Yishe,

459
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,519
give him a horse.

460
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,498
Well, we are losing another horse.

461
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,118
It's a far sweeter deal for you.

462
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:13,719
Don't bother me anymore.

463
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,420
Let's go.

464
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,420
Thanks for your horse,

465
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:34,220
but I'll retrieve my dagger back.

466

I'm here again.

469
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,239
I'm sick and can't meet guests.

470
00:32:01,239 --> 00:32:02,700
Get out.

471
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,780
Are you still angry with me?

472
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:12,318
I failed to taste your tea last time.

473
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:15,159
Today, I'll finally make up for it.

474
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,919
Your tea is really bitter.

475
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,740
Well, today I've brought someone

476
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,580
who will cure you for sure.

477
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,580
Your Highness.

478
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,020
Mr. Wei, you've been sick for a long time.

479
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,900
I'm here especially to visit you.

480
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:36,159
Li Changge, what a coincidence.

481
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:56,158
- It's you who are chasing me with him.
- Changge...

482
00:33:56,158 --> 00:33:59,338
Wei Shuyu, you're the princess's friend indeed.

483
00:33:59,338 --> 00:34:01,860
You knew she would pass by here.

484
00:34:04,059 --> 00:34:06,340
Thanks for informing me in time.

485
00:34:18,019 --> 00:34:19,519
Go.

Li Changge, you've no way out.

487
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:35,679
Go back with me and take your punishment.

488
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,600
What's the matter?

489
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,379
Heartbroken?

490
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,039
Don't act like I'm utilizing you.

491
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,880
Now that you're here,

492
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,307
you've made your choice.

493
00:38:42,307 --> 00:38:43,960
I've no time to stand here waiting for you.

494

Want to find her body? Hurry and fetch the body.

495
00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:59,679
Changge, I'm sorry.

496
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:24,239
I'm here to invite you to be my adviser.

497
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:30,720
I'm relentless.

498
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:35,000
Prince Qin, please go back.

499
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:41,239
Do you want to follow Zhuge Liang's example

500
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:44,009
to establish my reputation of visiting you three times?

501
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:47,900
Then I must thank you in advance.

502
00:39:50,739 --> 00:39:56,280
Your deeds will be recorded in history.

503
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,899
The crown prince didn't listen to me.

504
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:03,600
That's why he failed.

505
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:08,020
I heard you suggested Jiancheng send me out of Chang'an.

506
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,139
You alienated me from my brother.

507
00:40:09,139 --> 00:40:12,540
- Why?
- Don't call him your brother!

508
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:18,300
I regret not persuading

509
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,880
the crown prince to root you out.

510
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,759
Get out!

511
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,279
<i>Get out!</i>

512
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:41,659
You have slaughtered many lives.

513
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,678
Mine won't be an exception.

514
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:46,179
You!

515
00:40:46,919 --> 00:40:49,339
Your Highness, it's getting late.

516
00:40:49,339 --> 00:40:51,460
It's time to go back.

517
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:55,678
Your Highness, Wei Zheng is always willful.

518
00:40:55,678 --> 00:40:58,820
Please forgive him.

519
00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:06,738
I'm here waiting for you, Prince Qin.

520
00:41:06,738 --> 00:41:08,039
You...

521
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,799
Don't cover up my mouth.

522
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,298
Don't stop me! Get out!

523
00:41:12,298 --> 00:41:15,479
Loyal men tend to die worthy deaths.

524
00:41:15,479 --> 00:41:19,020
I'm here waiting for you!

525
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:38,840
General, I got enough water.

526
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,538
Su Yishe and Nu'er went ahead to explore the way,

527
00:41:40,538 --> 00:41:44,629
and found substitutes for us to head for the grassland through the pass.

528
00:41:44,629 --> 00:41:46,978
But at our current speed,

529
00:41:46,978 --> 00:41:49,239
it'll take us half a month to reach You State.

530
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:51,119
Half a month?

531
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,920
Half a month is too long.

532
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,719
- We've to speed up.
- Yes.
