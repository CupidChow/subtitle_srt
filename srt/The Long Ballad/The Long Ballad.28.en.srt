An Rou, is the carriage ready?

23
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,360
Young Master Hao has been waiting here for a long time.

24
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,400
Forget it. I'd better go on my own.

25
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,579
You should stay here.

26
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,338
If His Highness really feels uncomfortable,

27
00:01:55,339 --> 00:01:57,518
look for doctors as soon as possible.

28
00:01:57,518 --> 00:02:01,019
Princess, don't you need me with you?

29
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:04,680
Since Young Master Hao is with me, you shouldn't be worried.

30
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,159
Stay here and look after Crown Prince.

31
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:10,040
You must trust Young Master Hao a great deal.

32
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,459
No kidding at this moment.

33
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,519
Yes.

34
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:15,020
Go.

35
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,339
Don't take away my little brother!

36
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,739
Miss Wu!

37
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,218
Don't take away my little brother!

38
00:02:33,219 --> 00:02:35,159
- He's still alive!
- Ms. Wu!

39
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:38,439
Don't cremate him!

40
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:40,578
- Don't cremate him!
- Miss Wu!

41
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,059
He's my younger brother!

42
00:02:42,059 --> 00:02:44,399
Don't cremate him!

43
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:47,140
- What are you doing? Let her go!
- Save him!

44
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,018
They want to cremate my brother!

45
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,859
- He'll die!
- He has the plague.

46
00:02:51,859 --> 00:02:53,099
My brother!

47
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,179
Miss Wu!

48
00:02:54,179 --> 00:02:55,339
Stop her!

49
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,719
My brother!

50
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:57,899
Don't cremate him!

51
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,499
He's really my younger brother!

52
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:00,899
Miss, Young Master.

53
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,439
One by one, people die of the plague.

54
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:03,779
The corpses must be cremated.

55
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:05,339
It can't be delayed.

56
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,640
Princess.

57
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,198
- Brother!
- Miss Wu!

58
00:03:09,198 --> 00:03:11,319
Miss Wu! I know.

59
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,159
Don't cremate him.

60
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,660
I know you can't believe it.

61
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:18,040
But your brother was seriously ill.

62
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,719
Don't chase him.

63
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:24,479
Now, he's no longer in pain.

64
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:38,979
Last night, I hummed a ditty to put him to sleep.

65
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:43,000
Suddenly, he had a high fever

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,680
and black spots on his skin.

67
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,480
Then his body became cold.

68
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,920
Slowly.

69
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,539
I rubbed his hands, feet, and face.

70
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,119
But he became totally cold.

71
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,279
I'm useless.

72
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,339
He died.

73
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,840
Miss Wu, your brother became bereaved after birth.

74
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,419
It was already hard for you to raise him up.

75
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:19,359
It's lucky that you're sister and brother.

76
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,319
Granny.

77
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:29,480
He's not had enough rice and steamed buns.

78
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,200
<i>He came to this world</i>

79
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,278
<i>but left as if he had never existed. Why?</i>

80
00:04:35,278 --> 00:04:38,059
<i>When we arrive in Luoyang, I can give you anything you want.</i>

81
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:43,240
<i>I want you to give me a lot of rice.</i>

82
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,259
<i>I've never tasted white rice.</i>

83
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,140
I know your brother

84
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,470
went to see your parents in the netherworld.

85
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,940
Let him go.

86
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,439
I hope he won't be born into a family like ours in the next life.

87
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:08,999
He went to see our parents.

88
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,639
But I'm not happy at all.

89
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,779
I don't want him to see our parents.

90
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:19,600
I know.

91
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,920
Miss Wu,

92
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,919
you can miss him.

93
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,579
You can feel sad.

94
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,579
But you should continue your life.

95
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:36,599
Lead a good life with the hope of your brother.

96
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:33,020
<i>[Non-interference]</i>

97
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:40,339
Sun.

98
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:46,959
A'Li, you had a nightmare.

99
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,739
You repeatedly called Sun.

100
00:06:49,739 --> 00:06:51,900
Who is he?

101
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,898
Nothing.

102
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:56,539
You shouldn't shut yourself up in your room every day.

103
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:59,138
One will think too much if staying alone for a long time.

104
00:06:59,138 --> 00:07:03,000
What you dream about at night reflects what you think about in the day.

105
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,920
A'Bi, thank you.

106
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,019
You're welcome.

107
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,558
I don't read many books.

108
00:07:08,558 --> 00:07:12,099
Thanks to Miss Quan, I have very basic knowledge.

109
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,018
But when I was little, my mom always told me that

110
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:16,138
one can always lead a good life

111
00:07:16,138 --> 00:07:19,558
if one combs one's hair, brushes their teeth, cleans one's face with tissues,

112
00:07:19,558 --> 00:07:22,579
and has three full meals every day.

113
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,539
I think Master is right.

114
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,560
You're so clever that you always think too much.

115
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:33,559
What you just said reflects real wisdom.

116
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,039
Yes.

117
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,100
Master always says my vague manner conceals a brilliant mind.

118
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,498
By the way, did you call the man, Sun?

119
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:45,359
Or is it a monkey you raise?

120
00:07:45,359 --> 00:07:47,379
It's Sun.

121
00:07:47,379 --> 00:07:48,658
Sun?

122
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,919
So it's a bird you raise?

123
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:53,500
He's my former companion.

124
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,879
Since he's your companion, why doesn't he look for you?

125
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,299
I don't think that's right.

126
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,900
I did something that hurt him.

127
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:05,480
If he doesn't look for and hate me,

128
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:09,459
I'll feel a bit relieved.

129
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:30,259
Any information on Changge?

130
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,219
Elder Qin, I have some news.

131
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:34,118
We found a person similar to Young Master.

132
00:08:34,118 --> 00:08:37,880
She went to Luoyang with a doctor and a young man in a donkey cart.

133
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,218
Who are the doctor and the man?

134
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,979
Is Changge safe with them?

135
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:44,940
Stop pretending to care about her.

136
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,539
We'll find Commander Li.

137
00:08:46,539 --> 00:08:47,739
None of your business!

138
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,140
Xu Feng!

139
00:08:49,819 --> 00:08:51,439
He's impetuous.

140
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:53,238
He never cares about what he says.

141
00:08:53,238 --> 00:08:55,478
But he has always been loyal to Young Master.

142
00:08:55,478 --> 00:08:57,480
Don't think too much.

143
00:08:58,459 --> 00:09:03,790
So we should speed up and arrive in Luoyang

144
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:06,810
as soon as possible.

145
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,779
Since we're all here for Young Master's good,

146
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:19,039
why do you always embarrass him?

147
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:24,759
During these days, haven't you found that he really cares about Young Master?

148
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,119
Even if he really cares about Young Master,

149
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:36,179
I'll never forget the hatred in Shuo State.

150
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:38,580
I know how you're feeling.

151
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,319
Since we are consistent in our goals, we should work together.

152
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,379
No need to quarrel with him without thinking twice.

153
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,458
All right.

154
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:50,099
Don't think too much.

155
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,279
Brother A'Zhun, water.

156
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,999
Have a rest.

157
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:57,039
Set out early tomorrow.

158
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,180
Hug me.

159
00:10:03,219 --> 00:10:04,619
Come here.

160
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:07,779
Brother A'Zhun, throw me high.

161
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:09,840
One more time.

162
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,340
Stop!

163
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,399
Yuan is naive. Are you naive, too?

164
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,299
It's too dangerous! What's your purpose?

165
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,458
You frightened her.

166
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:22,459
Yuan, don't play with him.

167
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,040
Play with me.

168
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,419
No.

169
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,798
Miss Yuan, you can play with any other person,

170
00:10:28,798 --> 00:10:30,739
except him.

171
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,058
He's not called Zhun. He's Ashile Sun.

172
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:35,479
- He put your parents—
- Xu Feng!

173
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,299
A'Zhun, it's late at night.

174
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,520
Take Yuan to sleep.

175
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,279
Yuan, behave yourself.

176
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:53,658
Yuan, shall we play together elsewhere?

177
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,740
You have gone too far!

178
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:04,449
She scolded me!

179
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,528
What did I do?

180
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:08,429
Why don't you understand?

181
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:11,129
Do you want Yuan to be the second Young Master

182
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,008
who always lives in hatred?

183
00:11:14,008 --> 00:11:17,689
You witnessed Young Master's pain and sorrow.

184
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:21,569
Don't you know the cost of hatred?

185
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:29,170
Did you see how happy she was just now?

186
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,188
Governor and his wife hoped that

187
00:11:31,188 --> 00:11:34,809
their daughter could grow up lightheartedly

188
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:38,619
instead of suffering from hatred.

His Highness went out.

Did he go to South Hill?

195
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:44,439
Of course not.

196
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,319
He went to the street.

197
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,480
When will he grow up?

198
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:56,980
Well, seeing the miserable condition of the people, he may be touched.

199
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,220
I hope he doesn't make any trouble.

200
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,740
Princess, now you behave more and more like a sister.

Do you like this song?

268
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,580
Lazy bones!

269
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,619
Xu Feng is right.

270
00:16:51,619 --> 00:16:53,798
You shouldn't get too close to me.

271
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,800
Why?

272
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,500
Yuan.

273
00:17:02,359 --> 00:17:03,839
It's a wolf whistle.

274
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,719
It's our specialty.

275
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,640
I have nothing else to compensate you.

276
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:12,919
Blow it when you are in need.

277
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,059
I'll protect you on behalf of your parents.

278
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:21,079
In this way?

279
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,580

A'Bi! What happened?

288
00:18:24,959 --> 00:18:27,238
His Highness the Crown Prince secretly watched juggling and spread money

289
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:30,438
on the street instead of comforting the refugees after he came to Luoyang.

290
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:33,879
But the street was so crowded that many people were trampled on.

291
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,820
Crown Prince is here?

292
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,200
He never does anything right.

<i>Let me bandage it for you.</i>

If you have spare time to care about official affairs,

296

you'd better work with me in South Hill.

Young Master Wei, finally you've come!

00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,669
The people outside seem to be mad.

301
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,579
I want to return to Chang'an! Get the carriage ready!

302
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:12,520
I want to return to Chang'an!

303
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,439
You're injured.

304
00:19:15,439 --> 00:19:17,620
How did you protect him?

305
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,338
They're a bunch of thugs!

306
00:19:20,338 --> 00:19:22,039
I spread money to them out of kindness.

307
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,539
But the outcome is terrible.

308
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:25,358
Some people were trampled to death.

309
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:26,959
Too terrible!

310
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,559
I want to go back to Chang'an!

311
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,520
What trouble did you make?

312
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:33,519
Sister, I'm injured.

313
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,600
But why don't you care about me?

314
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,279
You show no kindness to me at all!

315
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,980
Let me see.

316
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:42,739
Chengqian!

317
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,118
Brother Shuyu, look around with me.

318
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:46,980
- Go.
- Princess.

319
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,099
It's my duty.

320
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:52,860
You keep an eye on His Highness lest he wants to go back to Chang'an.

321
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:56,379
Okay. Thank you.

322
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,300

Please be lenient with me!

Hurry up!

329
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:20,099
Commander, it's these beggars who made trouble.

330
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:21,499
Commander, please be lenient with me!

331
00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:22,659
We're didn't do it on purpose.

332
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:23,999
We've been hungry for days.

333
00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:25,478
A rich man spread money in the street.

334
00:20:25,479 --> 00:20:27,159
We just picked several more coppers.

335
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,938
We didn't expect things to go wrong.

336
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:30,619
Commander.

337
00:20:36,439 --> 00:20:38,198
<i>I know very well the people outside.</i>

338
00:20:38,199 --> 00:20:40,319
<i>They're just too hungry.</i>

339
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,279
<i>Some people are kind on the surface, but vicious inside.</i>

340
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,800
<i>Some people look indifferent but are warmhearted, like you.</i>

341
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:54,198
Take them back and let the magistrate deal with them.

342
00:20:54,199 --> 00:20:56,100
- Yes.
- Go!

343
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,199
<i>Commander! Be lenient with me!</i>

344
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:00,298
<i>Commander, show mercy on me!</i>

345
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:01,699
<i>Hurry up!</i>

346
00:21:22,839 --> 00:21:24,360
<i>Slow down.</i>

347
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,000
Slow down.

348
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,480
Are you feeling better?

349
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,419
Bear the pain.

350
00:22:18,739 --> 00:22:21,260
Why are there so many refugees?

351
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:24,540
They used to be ordinary people.

352
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,980
In the face of disaster and war, they became refugees.

353
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,440
As long as society is not stable, there will be more refugees.

354
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,659
Feel uncomfortable at the sight of that?

355
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:39,238
They are more fortunate than those who have no place to live

356
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:41,400
and no food to eat.

357
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,759
Some of those who have not escaped disaster and war

358
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,220
are still wandering and struggling,

359
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,118
while some of them have been buried in the earth

360
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:54,480
and have no chance to live.

361
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,540
My friend.

362
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,200
You're here, too.

363
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,620
Master.

364
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,660
Master, you're here?

365
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,460
Miss Wu.

366
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,139
Master, who's this sister?

367
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:16,839
Is she new here to cultivate herself?

368
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:20,079
Miss Wu, she's Sister A' Li.

369
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:22,159
She's been cultivating herself in the temple.

370
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,999
I'm busy today.

371
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,919
Can you take her to go outside tomorrow?

372
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,280
My apprentice, aren't you called Li Changge?

373
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,360
When did you change your name?

374
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,660
What I'm called doesn't matter.

375
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,059
Okay. Change your name and restart your life.

376
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,700
<i>[Luoyang]</i>

377
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,839
<i>Have you found her?</i>

378
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:07,999
<i>No.</i>

379
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,700
<i>I searched there but in vain.</i>

380
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,078
<i>Search in all directions!</i>

381
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:14,079
<i>Yes!</i>

382
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,379
What happened?

383
00:24:17,379 --> 00:24:20,000
Yuan is missing.

384
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,340
Yuan is missing! You're the only one out there.

385
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,618
Didn't you see anyone running out?

386
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,438
Stop!

387
00:24:28,438 --> 00:24:31,139
- Xu Feng.
- I'm warning you.

388
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:32,619
If there's anything wrong with Yuan,

389
00:24:32,619 --> 00:24:34,819
I'll get even with you for everything.

390
00:24:34,819 --> 00:24:37,860
I'll kill you for the Gongsun family.

391
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,600
First, find her.

392
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,660
Then it's up to you.

393
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:52,019
Where are you going?

394
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,239
Miss Yuan!

395
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,500
Miss Yuan!

396
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,540
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

397
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:28,658
Let me take you out. All right?

398
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:31,819
Come on.

399
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,218
Yuan, why are you here?

400
00:25:43,218 --> 00:25:46,099
Tomorrow is Mom's birthday.

401
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:49,838
I wanted to pick some flowers for her.

402
00:25:49,838 --> 00:25:54,039
I saw flowers on the tree, but I couldn't reach them.

403
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,860
I didn't expect to fall into the pit.

404
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,758
What a good girl! You are filial.

405
00:26:03,758 --> 00:26:10,959
Gongsun's greatest wish is that you can be safe and happy.

406
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:13,939
It's a pity that he can help everyone in his life

407
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:18,440
but can't protect his family.

408
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:23,999
Well, let's go back.

409
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:29,879
Nothing serious.

410
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,340
You can't do this again. Does it hurt?

411
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:44,338
I will immediately count the number of injured and the registered residence of each household.

412
00:26:44,338 --> 00:26:49,160
Please come with me to comfort them and give them subsidies.

413
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:53,020
Young Master Wei, you can do it alone.

414
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,858
Or I wouldn't have brought you here.

415
00:26:54,858 --> 00:26:57,559
How can you talk to Brother Shuyu like that?

416
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,540
It's all your fault.

417
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,179
You should comfort those people.

418
00:27:01,179 --> 00:27:04,539
Sister, my kindness is not rewarded. I gave them money but was hurt.

419
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,819
I'm sad. Leave me alone!

420
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:11,879
You're the crown prince. If you don't go, should I go?

421
00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:13,860
So you said you would go.

422
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,359
- I...
- You're Princess of Great Tang. You should do that.

423
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:20,290
Last time you comforted

424
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,540
those refugees in person.

425
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:26,640
Sister, I've already been injured.

426
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,910
Let me have a rest for a few days.

427
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,179
Let me see how long you can be so willful.

428
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:38,500
Sister.

429
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,500
Forget it.

430
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,498
I'll go on your behalf this time.

431
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:47,980
But just this once.

432
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,200
Young Master Wei.

433
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,099
Young Master Wei, I dare not go into the street again.

434
00:28:01,099 --> 00:28:04,439
Is there anywhere else I can go?

435
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:08,618
I heard that the Ziwei Palace of the Sui Dynasty is here. Can you go with me?

436
00:28:08,618 --> 00:28:12,339
Your Highness, it was built by Emperor Yang. It's a sheer waste of energy and money.

437
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:15,219
I think you'd better go and visit the common people.

438
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:16,919
Anyway, His Majesty appointed you—

439
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,819
Yes. I think you're right.

440
00:28:19,819 --> 00:28:23,118
You should watch Luoyang carefully, especially Ziwei Palace.

441
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:25,018
Emperor Yang was quite extravagant.

442
00:28:25,018 --> 00:28:28,479
I have to see the palace in detail as a reminder.

443
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:31,539
Get the carriage ready!

444
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:39,579
Wound healing unguent. Blood recovering pills.

445
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:42,219
Medicine is ready.

446
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,218
Princess, why not go with Young Master Hao?

447
00:28:45,218 --> 00:28:46,120
<i>[Anti-plague pills]</i>

448
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,039
No need.

449
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,179
It's not the case in Chang'an.

450
00:28:53,179 --> 00:28:56,738
There are many refugees. They came from many different places.

451
00:28:56,738 --> 00:28:59,139
Young Master Wei will take care of His Highness the Crown Prince.

452
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:01,240
So he can't accompany you.

453
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,239
But I'm afraid if Young Master Hao isn't here, either.

454
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:10,019
I'm either in the government office or in South Hill. He'll find me for sure.

455
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:13,800
By the way, it's impossible that he follows me all his life.

456
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,280
We should be able to protect ourselves.

457
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,399
Princess, you really changed a lot.

458
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:21,119
It's better that Young Master Hao doesn't follow you.

459
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:26,619
Sometimes I'm scared at the sight of him.

460
00:29:26,619 --> 00:29:27,979
Yes.

461
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:31,480
I was also afraid of him before.

462
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,618
Before? Now you're not afraid of him?

463
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,660
Now...

464
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,460
<i>Princess!</i>

465
00:29:44,639 --> 00:29:46,680
<i>I finally find you!</i>

466
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:51,160
<i>Let's go. Let me take you home.</i>

467
00:29:55,139 --> 00:29:59,898
Yesterday, Master asked me to take you to South Hill today to look around.

468
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:08,080
Sister A' Li, do you have something on your mind?

469
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,900
You looked sad yesterday.

470
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,078
Why do you live in the temple?

471
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,660
Where's your family?

472
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:19,080
They all died.

473
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,480
Sister A' Li, here you are.

474
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,499
The candy was given by Master. I haven't had it.

475
00:30:27,499 --> 00:30:29,339
You have it.

476
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,419
You want to give it to me?

477
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,378
Sister A'Li, don't be sad.

478
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:40,719
In fact, my family also died.

479
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:43,559
The people I met yesterday are not your family?

480
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:46,460
I used to live in Yun State.

481
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,740
When winter is approaching,

482
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,640
people from the grassland will come to loot.

483
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,719
Later, in the year of disaster,

484
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,320
no one could survive.

485
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,860
Our parents took us out.

486
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,560
They said...

487
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,840
They said we could survive in the south.

488
00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:14,479
But later, my dad died of disease.

489
00:31:14,479 --> 00:31:18,039
Then my mom also fell ill.

490
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:21,399
She said that ordinary people like us

491
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,339
can only depend on Heaven for food.

492
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:27,439
If God wants to take back your life,

493
00:31:27,439 --> 00:31:29,799
you can only accept such fate.

494
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,838
It shouldn't be the case.

495
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:36,699
But I can do nothing.

496
00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:38,238
My parents died.

497
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:41,519
I took my little brother all the way to Liuyun Taoist Temple.

498
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:45,980
A few days ago, my brother died, too.

499
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,359
I miss him very much.

500
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:53,079
But I was told that people won't feel pain after death.

501
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:56,840
So he won't suffer anymore.

502
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,359
Is that true, Sister A' Li?

503
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,600
Yes.

504
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:05,439
He won't suffer anymore.

505
00:32:05,439 --> 00:32:08,619
Now he's with your parents.

506
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:13,100
But I'm still not happy at all.

507
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,580
Granny Chen told me that

508
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:21,419
my brother won't suffer in a family like ours.

509
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,700
But...

510
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,920
But I'm still sad.

511
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,959
Sister A'Li,

512
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:34,759
what sins have we done?

513
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,819
Why does God just refuse to treat us well?

514
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,858
You have done nothing wrong.

515
00:32:42,858 --> 00:32:45,140
It's the fault of endless war.

516
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,020
I was born in a wealthy family.

517
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,939
We swam in luxury.

518
00:32:49,939 --> 00:32:52,900
We went out by beautiful carriages.

519
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,520
We lived in a fantastic manor.

520
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,979
But everyone wanted more.

521
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:06,580
I have thought that if I were born into a peasant family,

522
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,400
I would have been able to live in peace.

523
00:33:10,119 --> 00:33:12,179
But I was wrong.

524
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:17,430
I should understand earlier that in troubled times,

525
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:20,280
if death can make my wish realized,

526
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,459
that would be much easier.

527
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,139
Here. You have it.

528
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,700
Have a taste.

529
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,860
Let's go.

530
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,499
A'Li, did Miss Wu take you to see anything?

531
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:50,838
Master, could you teach me how to save these refugees?

532
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:54,450
Why do you have that thought?

533
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,550
I hope we can lead a peaceful life.

534
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,930
I go with the flow, like duckweed.

535
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:01,930
You can see Heaven and Earth, and all living creatures in the world.

536
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:05,369
It seems that your heart has been cured.

537
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,050
<i>[Dapu Inn]</i>

538
00:34:12,249 --> 00:34:15,030
We're in Luoyang now.

539
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:17,890
Let's settle down here.

540
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,990
Elder Qin, is Changge really in Luoyang?

541
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,589
If you don't believe my intelligence, you'd better find her alone.

542
00:34:23,589 --> 00:34:25,810
Xu Feng.

543
00:34:30,689 --> 00:34:34,570
Grandpa Qin, what's wrong with Brother A'Zhun?

544
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,710
Nothing is wrong with him.

545
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:39,990
He's afraid he won't find your Brother Li.

546
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,930
Thank you for your kindness.

547
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,850
Sister A'Li, you're quite a fast learner.

548
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:18,650
You are more skillful at pounding herbs.

549
00:35:20,529 --> 00:35:22,329
Come here, everyone!

550
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:25,170
Someone donated some medicine to us.

551
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:27,010
Princess.

552
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:31,210
Sister Princess!

553
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,989
Sister Princess!

554
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:44,410
Sister Princess, you've come!

555
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:16,649
Changge, you don't hate me?

556
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:19,170
I was so stubborn that

557
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:21,529
I always refused you.

558
00:36:21,969 --> 00:36:25,629
Yueyan, can you forgive me?

559
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,669
I've never blamed you.

560
00:36:34,149 --> 00:36:38,370
Thank God, we can meet again.

561
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:42,469
I really thought I'd never see you again.

562
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:45,630
Fate has brought us together again.

563
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,950
Don't cry.

564
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,030
How about you?

565
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,129
Are you all right?

566
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,728
Where did you go after we bade farewell in a hurry in You State?

567
00:36:58,729 --> 00:37:01,129
Did you go directly to Luoyang?

568
00:37:01,129 --> 00:37:05,669
After leaving You State, I went all the way north.

569
00:37:05,669 --> 00:37:08,150
Then I met Taoist Sun.

570
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:12,590
It's a long story.

571
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:17,049
You must have suffered a lot.

572
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:19,770
You went through many difficulties, right?

573
00:37:21,669 --> 00:37:23,189
Let bygones be bygones.

574
00:37:23,189 --> 00:37:25,670
Don't mention it.

575
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:30,930
By the way, we almost met each other before.

576
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,690
What do you mean?

577
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:34,529
Do you remember the purse I gave you?

578
00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:37,429
I embroidered a new one which was exactly alike.

579
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:39,410
I remember that.

580
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:42,409
I was confused as to why someone knew

581
00:37:42,409 --> 00:37:44,649
what the purse you gave me was like.

582
00:37:44,649 --> 00:37:46,389
Why didn't you see me?

583
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,469
I went to see you.

584
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:50,969
But Hao Du arrived in advance.

585
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:54,700
Although Hao Du is not a good man,

586
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,100
he can protect you.

587
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,369
By the way, why were you in Yun State then?

588
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,370
Greetings, Commandant.

589
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:23,449
- Where's Princess?
- Her Highness is ahead.

590
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:28,009
Princess! Princess!

591
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:31,028
Princess! Young Master Hao is here.

592
00:38:31,028 --> 00:38:32,970
Hao Du?

593
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,930
Changge.

594
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:38,089
Changge, I have a lot to tell you.

595
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,470
Wait for me in the market between 3:00 to 5:00 p.m. Go. Hurry up.

596
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:43,028
- Be careful.
- Hurry up!

597
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,310
Hao Du!

598
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,508
I've finished my business. Let's go back.

599
00:38:55,508 --> 00:38:57,189
Wait a minute.

600
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:01,270
What's wrong, Princess?

601
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:03,170
I have a stomachache.

602
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,310
We have doctors here.

603
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:07,689
- Doctor!
- No need. It's just my period.

604
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,170
An Rou.

605
00:39:19,669 --> 00:39:22,109
Let me do that. Take it.

606
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:34,728
Hold on. The carriage is over there.

607
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,810
<i>(3:00 to 5:00 p.m, market.)</i>

608
00:39:48,049 --> 00:39:51,070
<i>What happened between them?</i>

609
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:53,610
<i>[Spring Breeze and Evening Water]</i>

610
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:59,750
Just now someone reported that His Highness the Crown Prince came to Luoyang

611
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,289
to inspect the victims affected by the spring drought.

612
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:06,009
There's a lot of trouble in the city.

613
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:07,890
Considering the chaos,

614
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:11,210
I hope that all of you can put aside personal contradictions

615
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,550
and work together.

616
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:16,810
Elder Qin, we don't need to rely on others.

617
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,050
We can find Young Master on our own.

618
00:40:20,529 --> 00:40:23,310
But why haven't we found Li Changge?

619
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:26,990
Well, the situation in Luoyang is not clear.

620
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:31,230
The sooner we find her, the more reassured we are.

621
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:36,709
Now that we work together, don't always quarrel.

622
00:40:36,709 --> 00:40:39,208
Cooperation? I don't want to work with him!

623
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:41,690
I don't know what he is thinking about.

624
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,369
Do you want to fight against me?

625
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,109
Okay.

626
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:48,809
I think all of us have put up with you for a long time.

627
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:53,129
If Elder Qin hadn't stopped me, I would have beat you up!

628
00:40:56,809 --> 00:40:59,989
Okay. Have a try.

629
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:09,149
I'm old.

630
00:41:09,149 --> 00:41:12,349
If the young men want to fight, go outside.

631
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:14,809
Don't tear down the house.

632
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:16,469
Go!

633
00:41:16,469 --> 00:41:18,310
Upstairs!

634
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:22,889
The view upstairs is good.

635
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,430
On the battlefield, I won in an open and aboveboard manner.

636
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,130
If you're not convinced,

637
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,750
defeat me now.

638
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,329
Close the door!

639
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,730
These young men!

640
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:12,230
I asked them to fight outside.

641
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:16,970
We should compensate the owner here tomorrow.

642
00:42:50,449 --> 00:42:53,610
If you had told them just now, they wouldn't have gotten into a fight.

643
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:58,470
For young people, everything can be settled by a fight.

644
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:01,448
If he can't settle down such a little matter,

645
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:04,769
he can't be a dependable man.
