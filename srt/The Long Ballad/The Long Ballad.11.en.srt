<i>[Governor Manor]</i>

23
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:43,988
Governor! Governor.

24
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:45,698
Registrar Li.

25
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:46,738
Governor.

26
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,338
As a new register of the governor,

27
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:49,978
I'm not familiar with affairs in Shuo State,

28
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,819
so I ought to accompany you there.

29
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,298
Not this time.

30
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,259
Xu Feng will go with me.

31
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,460
Registrar Li, both of you can have a day off.

32
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,760
Yes.

33
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,099
I thought if Gongsun Heng took me to see Sima Tu,

34
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,378
I'd be able to take in the northern border defense.

35
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:27,278
It seems we'll have to work harder in the future.

36
00:02:27,278 --> 00:02:29,758
What about following them?

37
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:30,719
Forget it.

38
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:31,879
He refused us.

39
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:35,079
If we follow them, it seems we're ill-intentioned.

40
00:02:35,859 --> 00:02:37,638
Master, what're you doing?

41
00:02:37,638 --> 00:02:39,339
Having a day off.

42
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,080
General, according to our scout,

43
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,370
Ashile Sun headed for Shuo State last night,

44
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:04,619
while Eagle Division remains unmoved.

45
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,019
Ashile Sun only took Mu Jin with him.

46
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,979
- Guards.
- General.

47
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:20,738
Assemble the Bear Division.

48
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:22,139
Yes, Sir!

49
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,580
Given this chance,

50
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:35,370
I'll let him know who the descendant of Sirius is.

51
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,160
Brilliant.

52
00:03:57,939 --> 00:03:59,839
It's pretty good.

53
00:04:07,188 --> 00:04:08,298
How's it going?

54
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:11,459
I won't believe it without seeing it in person.

55
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,819
There are slightly over 1,000 soldiers stationed in the east and south.

56
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,190
As expected, relying on the terrain in the east and south, it's easy to hold but hard to attack.

57
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,209
Governor of Shuo State mainly deployed troops in the west and north,

58
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,759
but according to our scout, the soldiers are less than 20,000.

59
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,190
How did Shuo State City get its reputation for impregnability?

60
00:04:29,191 --> 00:04:31,449
Tu Kashe said they were all good for nothing.

61
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,519
Is what he said true?

62
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,680
When getting into the city, did you notice the wall?

63
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,290
<i>[Shou State]</i>

64
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:44,819
It's much thicker than other cities in the Central Plains?

65
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,442
The clay is new, which means the wall is timely reinforced.

66
00:04:48,442 --> 00:04:50,398
People of all kinds come and go freely in normal times,

67
00:04:50,398 --> 00:04:54,299
but once there's a war, no one can go through when the gate is closed.

68
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,539
As long as the supplies are enough,

69
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,699
It's not hard to guard the city for years.

70
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,378
Interesting.

71
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:03,099
Have you got any idea?

72
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,579
Let's go.

73
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,600
We have to buy some paulownia wood.

74
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:11,120
Can't you stop bluffing?

75
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,730
If you can help Gongsun Heng analyze the political climate

76
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,570
and promise him a bright future,

77
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:32,458
won't he, a former subject of the Sui Dynasty, be touched?

78
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:35,599
I'm afraid it's not what Gongsun Heng wants.

79
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,680
How old are you?

80
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,934
How can you choke when eating noodles?

81
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,319
Master, it seems we lack money.

82
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,299
We ran out of money when giving away food to the beggars.

83
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,079
- Not a penny left?
- Wasn't it you who said we had to be grateful to who helped us.

84
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,178
Without those beggars who told us where the bandits came from,

85
00:05:57,179 --> 00:05:58,599
how can we be allowed at the governor's?

86
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:01,719
Being well-accommodated, why did we need money?

87
00:06:01,719 --> 00:06:04,659
Master, it's what you said.

88
00:06:06,279 --> 00:06:09,660
Let's run when I count to three.

89
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,117
Guests, have you enjoyed the meal?

90
00:06:15,117 --> 00:06:17,039
Ten pennies for two bowls of noodles.

91
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,979
No, we haven't finished.

92
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,279
We'll pay you later.

93
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,838
I'm sorry, Boss.

94
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:26,019
We came out in a rush and forgot to take our wallet with us.

95
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,498
What about this? Let my brother fetch money, while I stay here.

96
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:32,058
Okay. I'll go fetch money.

97
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,919
Don't run.

98
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,938
Well, one ran away, and the other seeks a time to go.

99
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,610
I've seen much of this.

100
00:06:39,611 --> 00:06:41,958
- Go see the official with me.
- No, Boss.

101
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:44,778
Listen to me. He'll be back as soon as he gets the money.

102
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,880
How can I trust you? Go.

103
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,200
- Hands off.
- How much?

104
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,600
I'll pay.

105
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:52,999
Why are you here?

106
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,140
Ten pennies.

107
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,778
The rest is the tip for you.

108
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:01,398
Thank you, Mister.

109
00:07:01,398 --> 00:07:03,698
I'm sorry.

110
00:07:03,698 --> 00:07:05,739
Leave now.

111
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:07,940
Move out.

112
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:11,370
A'Zhun.

113
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,910
We meet again.

114
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,520
Shisi.

115
00:07:35,059 --> 00:07:36,559
Who is he?

116
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:39,378
I told you not to come to Shuo State.

117
00:07:39,379 --> 00:07:42,159
You turned a deaf ear to me.

118
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,758
What about you? You came instead.

119
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:49,099
How's your wound?

120
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,039
You even know about his wound?

121
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,599
I bandaged it. I know, of course.

122
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,199
You turn out to be that vet.

123
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,760
It'd heal soon without being bandaged, but you...

124
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,750
It's okay now.

125
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,360
He's...

126
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,140
Then it'll be fine.

127
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,830
By the way, border trade in Shuo State is strictly rectified.

128
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,690
A profiteer like you will certainly lose.

129
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:20,086
Shisi, how long will you stay in Shuo State?

130
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:26,753
Forget it! It's better not to inquire about each other's business.

131
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:41,739
Master, you escaped.

132
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,050
Seller?

133
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,510
Who's he?

134
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,000
A'Dou, A'Zhun paid the bill for us.

135
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,759
We're about to leave out of the city.

136
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:57,819
Shisi, can you see us off?

137
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,480
Of course.

138
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,059
We have to part in the end.

139
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,639
I'll stop here.

140
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:10,319
A'Zhun, I wish you a booming business.

141
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:13,920
Shisi, as I told you last time,

142
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,219
if you have no reason to stay in Shuo State,

143
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:19,218
you'd better leave early.

144
00:09:19,219 --> 00:09:21,819
Leave... Where shall I go?

145
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:24,205
Have you thought about going to the grasslands?

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,578
Grasslands?

147
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:30,840
I've no acquaintance. I'd better not.

148
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,640
You know me.

149
00:09:37,219 --> 00:09:40,139
No, but thanks.

150
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:02,338
Who are they?

151
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:04,800
They're men in the vanguard of Ashile's army.

152
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:08,019
They'll attack the city.

153
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,499
Shisi, I still have some men in the north.

154
00:10:11,499 --> 00:10:13,099
I'll be back to take care of them.

155
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,359
You'd better get as far away from Shuo State as possible.

156
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,379
- See you.
- Take care.

157
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,539
Master, what shall we do now?

158
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,940
Return.

159
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,458
How dare Tu Kashe take credit when you're absent?

160
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,138
Do we really have to do nothing?

161
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:37,059
If you wanna see Tu Kashe fall utterly, stay here.

162
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,059
I'm not interested in a stray dog.

163
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,440
Are you sure he'll be defeated?

164
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,179
Tu Kashe is an idiot, but she's there.

165
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:47,780
He? (T/N: Ta - Can be either he or she)

166
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,859
Stop. Who dares break into the defense base?

167
00:10:56,859 --> 00:10:57,889
Light the beacon and beat the drum.

168
00:10:57,889 --> 00:10:59,379
Ashile's army is coming.

169
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,419
Move out of my way.

170
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,551
If we miss the warning time, can you be responsible for it?

171
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:04,578
- Hurry up.
- No, you can't!

172
00:11:04,579 --> 00:11:05,979
Registrar Li.

173
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:08,319
Let him come up.

174
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:09,800
Yes.

175
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:12,499
Registrar Li, why are you here?

176
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,640
Governor, Ashile's army is coming.

177
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,018
Beat the drum.

178
00:11:16,018 --> 00:11:18,579
- Not now.
- Not now?

179
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:21,880
You mean not beating the drum now?

180
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,939
It's not a rush.

181
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,939
It's okay for them to get closer.

182
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:29,258
Governor, think about it carefully.

183
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:33,018
Once Ashile Tribe breaks into the city, Shuo State will be doomed.

184
00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:36,259
- It'll threaten our whole country.
- Stop!

185
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,458
- How dare you push Governor?
- All right, Xu Feng.

186
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:41,698
He just acted on impulse.

187
00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:42,979
The enemy's coming.

188
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:45,299
I have no time to explain to you.

189
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,558
- Guards.
<i>- Yes!</i>

190
00:11:47,558 --> 00:11:49,818
Take them back to Governor Manor and into custody.

191
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:50,878
- Gongsun Heng.
- Go.

192
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:53,199
You're too stubborn to deploy forces.

193
00:11:53,199 --> 00:11:54,900
Gongsun Heng!

194
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,360
<i>[Governor Manor]</i>

195
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,783
<i>Hello?</i>

196
00:12:09,783 --> 00:12:12,521
Can't I walk around Governor Manor if I'm not allowed to the gate tower?

197
00:12:12,522 --> 00:12:14,718
As Governor ordered, you can't walk around.

198
00:12:14,718 --> 00:12:16,338
Don't you doubt his words?

199
00:12:16,339 --> 00:12:18,379
What if his decision is wrong?

200
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,420
Governor has a plan.

201
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,158
I think he doesn't deserve his reputation.

202
00:12:30,158 --> 00:12:32,918
I wonder how he cheats the public here

203
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,578
into supporting him wholeheartedly.

204
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,399
Have you heard the drums?

205
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:40,199
He didn't get the drum beaten until this late.

206
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:43,699
It's hard to win this battle.

207
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:50,199
A'Dou, do you think we shouldn't have come here?

208
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:53,499
I even hope a man ignorant of military tactics

209
00:12:53,499 --> 00:12:56,339
can help me launch a counterattack.

210
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:59,699
That's it. Even I know beating the drum in time on seeing the enemy.

211
00:12:59,699 --> 00:13:02,619
As the Governor of Shuo State, how can he not know?

212
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,240
I'm afraid he's doing it on purpose.

213
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:11,079
If he dares to give up Shuo State City to the Ashile,

214
00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:12,478
I won't make it easy for him.

215
00:13:12,478 --> 00:13:14,619
So will I.

216
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:16,219
<i>Governor!</i>

217
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,310
- Registrar Li, I—
- Why didn't you beat the drum?

218
00:13:28,319 --> 00:13:29,879
Ashile's cavalry raided us.

219
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,118
We were not prepared for it.

220
00:13:31,118 --> 00:13:32,678
No wonder we'll be badly defeated.

221
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:34,899
How many casualties are there?

222
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:36,600
10,000,

223
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,480
20,000,

224
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:43,699
or even more?

225
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:53,490
Registrar Li, we—

226
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,009
Ignorant of military tactics, why didn't you listen to me?

227
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,478
Why must you be so stubborn?

228
00:13:57,478 --> 00:13:59,540
Were you doing it on purpose?

229
00:14:00,579 --> 00:14:01,498
You...

230
00:14:01,498 --> 00:14:04,839
Don't you care about the public in the city at all?

231
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,100
Registrar Li,

232
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,980
we have won the battle.

233
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,780
We won.

234
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,540
Really?

235
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,999
How did you make it?

236
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:22,179
Right, Governor, tell me about it.

237
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,539
How did you win?

238
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:25,639
Please calm down.

239
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,378
Let me explain it to you.

240
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:31,238
Governor didn't beat the drum until that late on purpose

241
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:34,718
for he deployed 3,000 archers in an ambush in and out of the gate tower.

242
00:14:34,718 --> 00:14:40,640
<i>When Ashile's cavalry was coming, they soon came within our range.</i>

243
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,489
<i>Once he ordered, ten thousand arrows shot at once.</i>

244
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:47,710
<i>Ashile's cavalry had no time to turn around, and soon panicked.</i>

245
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,660
<i>At that time, Governor asked us to...</i>

246
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,290
<i>Open the gate and set the spear barricade.</i>

247
00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:56,960
<i>Our soldiers in formations resisted the enemy.</i>

248
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,860
It's Crescent Moon Array.

249
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:12,299
You know military tactics.

250
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,698
I've learned a bit before.

251
00:15:13,699 --> 00:15:16,278
Come on. Sit down, please.

252
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,720
Tell me if you were the commander,

253
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,950
what would you do next?

254
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,839
Next,

255
00:15:30,919 --> 00:15:33,179
we've to change Crescent Moon into Long Snake Array.

256
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:37,505
Hit the enemy with the body of a snake, wag the head and tail, and hang them.

257
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,419
What's next?

258
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,158
Imperial Guard Xu, go on.

259
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:46,090
Next, after waves of strikes,

260
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,370
Ashile's cavalry was utterly routed,

261
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,940
<i>but the head Tu Kashe refused to give up,</i>

262
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,850
<i>and attempted to launch another attack.</i>

263
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:56,438
<i>Beat the drums! Send smoke signals!</i>

264
00:15:56,438 --> 00:16:00,718
<i>At that time, our ambush beat the drums and sent smoke signals</i>

265
00:16:00,718 --> 00:16:03,299
<i>in the northeast and northwest across the tower.</i>

266
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,818
<i>Soldiers' war cries resounded.</i>

267
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:09,478
<i>For fear of being besieged, Tu Kashe was so terrified that</i>

268
00:16:09,478 --> 00:16:12,259
<i>he turned around and fled in helter-skelter.</i>

269
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:14,938
Bravo, Governor!

270
00:16:14,938 --> 00:16:19,358
But if we have the ambush in the northeast and northwest,

271
00:16:19,358 --> 00:16:22,358
why didn't you let them march quietly and launch a surprise attack?

272
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:26,019
Why did you make such a noise?

273
00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:31,319
Were you...

274
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:32,698
What?

275
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:34,740
Were you bluffing?

276
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:41,589
Registrar Li, you're indeed a talent.

277
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:44,349
You see through my tricks.

278
00:16:44,349 --> 00:16:46,470
You're right.

279
00:16:47,969 --> 00:16:51,108
We had only 2,000 soldiers set in ambush.

280
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:53,629
You're a superb military commander.

281
00:16:53,629 --> 00:16:59,810
Don't you think I'm too stubborn to deploy forces?

282
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,368
I'm sorry for my ignorance.

283
00:17:05,369 --> 00:17:07,929
I was so confident of my study of military tactics

284
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:10,528
that I disrespected you.

285
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,510
I'm so ashamed.

286
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:21,690
All right, I won't keep it in mind.

287
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:25,408
But your risking life in sending signals

288
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:29,869
impressed me with your concern about the public.

289
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:35,168
I want to express my thanks to you on behalf of the public.

290
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:36,669
Governor!

291
00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:42,369
I admire your tolerance.

292
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:48,209
After this battle, I finally know why you're invincible,

293
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,589
and where the firmness of the wall and

294
00:17:50,589 --> 00:17:53,729
and the peaceful life in Shuo State come from.

295
00:17:55,649 --> 00:17:57,789
If you don't mind,

296
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:01,209
I want to... I want to...

297
00:18:01,209 --> 00:18:04,449
You want to fight against enemies

298
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,610
with us to guard Shuo State?

299
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,569
That's what I want.

300
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:15,648
For you, a talent good at military tactics, I appreciate you very much.

301
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:17,149
Stand up.

302
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:22,410
I'd like to learn military tactics as well.

303
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,429
Okay. Guard Shuo State with us as well.

304
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:27,910
Stand up!

305
00:18:40,149 --> 00:18:42,929
Congratulations on your safe return!

306
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:56,749
Now you all come to see me.

307
00:18:56,749 --> 00:18:58,569
Of course.

308
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,129
To take credit, you secretly launched a sneak attack with the cavalry on Shuo State.

309
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:07,289
Though you lost, you were not wiped out at least.

310
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:21,630
I'm in a rather bad mood.

311
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,370
Shut your foul mouth up!

312
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:36,288
You acted rashly and alerted the enemy.

313
00:19:36,289 --> 00:19:40,849
You're to blame if we're at a disadvantage later.

314
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,248
What a fuss!

315
00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:47,809
It's just a drill.

316
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,969
Why am I to blame?

317
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,449
I know what I did.

318
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,209
It's none of your business.

319
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:56,850
We don't care about your business.

320
00:19:56,850 --> 00:20:02,050
We'll faithfully report today's battle to Khan.

321
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,089
You don't have to.

322
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:13,209
I'll report it myself.

323
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:25,949
Help me send the letter to the Military Governor.

324
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,509
<i>[To Military Governor Sima Tu]</i>

325
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:31,929
This time Ashile Tribe will not be that easy to deal with.

326
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:38,410
If I get it right, they'll launch another attack for sure.

327
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,949
We need reinforcements.

328
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,550
I'll go right now.

329
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,040
<i>[Protect the Country and Pacify the People]</i>

330
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:01,909
- Governor.
- Registrar Li.

331
00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:05,468
Governor, you may have a look at the new map.

332
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,729
Why are you so worried?

333
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,128
We won the battle.

334
00:21:16,129 --> 00:21:18,408
Why aren't you happy?

335
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:20,329
Just a small battle.

336
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,449
What's so happy about it?

337
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:28,089
I sent Xu Feng to ask for reinforcements from the Military Governor.

338
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,408
Reinforcements?

339
00:21:29,409 --> 00:21:33,570
Why do we need reinforcements in such an impregnable city?

340
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:38,069
The real enemy of us in Ashile Tribe hasn't appeared.

341
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:52,149
Look. The wide and deep Wuding River should have been

342
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:57,529
a natural defense line between Shuo State and the Ashile Tribe.

343
00:21:57,529 --> 00:22:00,488
But due to our lack of soldiers,

344
00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:03,329
we can't deploy troops to guard the riverbank,

345
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:09,069
so that the enemies come and go freely, threatening Shuo State.

346
00:22:09,069 --> 00:22:12,368
Considering they'll come and go across the river,

347
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:15,430
what about turning it into a military installation?

348
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,969
Military installation?

349
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,809
For Ashile Tribe, who are not good at swimming,

350
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,408
they would prefer the dry season.

351
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:25,209
That's it.

352
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,809
If the river bed is dry,

353
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:31,770
they'll march much faster than usual without obstacles.

354
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:36,869
If so, we can grant them a dry season.

355
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:39,469
Grant them a dry season?

356
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:42,389
What do you mean?

357
00:22:42,389 --> 00:22:46,288
I heard the dry season usually starts from July,

358
00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:48,590
but with plenty of rain this summer,

359
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:52,389
the dry season may come about half a month later.

360
00:22:52,389 --> 00:22:56,389
There's a dense forest right up the river.

361
00:22:56,389 --> 00:22:59,309
If we deploy special forces to block the river

362
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:02,370
with soil, stones, and logs, the river can be blocked within days.

363
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:05,270
Governor, what do you think?

364
00:23:09,929 --> 00:23:12,360
You're really something,

365
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,549
Registrar Li.

366
00:23:15,549 --> 00:23:17,929
What a brilliant idea!

367
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:20,690
Governor, excuse my humble opinion.

368
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,968
You're so quick-witted. Impressive.

369
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:29,870
However, Ashile Tribe's Bear Division just lost and ran away.

370
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,750
They dare not launch attacks within days.

371
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,689
Even if they do so, they'll be cautious.

372
00:23:37,689 --> 00:23:41,070
We should think about

373
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,900
how to let their guard down.

374
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,850
If Ashile's cavalry aren't that capable,

375
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,130
we've more feasible ways to defeat them in fact.

376
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,029
More feasible ways? Speak up.

377
00:23:53,029 --> 00:23:55,200
As Sun Zi said, we need direct tactics to join a battle,

378
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,071
indirect ones to secure victory.

379
00:23:57,071 --> 00:24:00,470
If we take our troops as a lure to attract their main forces,

380
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,990
and then deploy our cavalry to detour

381
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,789
and surprise attack the enemy on its flanks and from behind,

382
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:07,689
we'll defeat them one by one when their formations are broken.

383
00:24:07,689 --> 00:24:10,750
Isn't it exciting?

384
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,089
Great.

385
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:17,069
Young as you are, you're so imposing that I admire you.

386
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:20,869
You remind me of another man.

387
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:22,490
Who?

388
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:24,750
The former Prince Qin,

389
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,020
the current crown prince.

390
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:39,089
<i>In the late Sui Dynasty, heroes distinguished themselves.</i>

391
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:40,829
<i>As a youngster,</i>

392
00:24:40,829 --> 00:24:43,549
<i>he led thousands of soldiers fighting against enemies,</i>

393
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,549
<i>with such tactics.</i>

394
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:47,930
<i>He's almost invincible.</i>

395
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,770
<i>Unexpectedly, today you told me similar tactics.</i>

396
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,610
Registrar Li,

397
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:59,260
it seems you were

398
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:02,310
just being modest before.

399
00:25:02,929 --> 00:25:05,850
The crown prince is renowned. I just follow his example.

400
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:07,250
I'm flattered.

401
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,590
Registrar Li, don't be so modest.

402
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:12,469
How lucky you're here in Shuo State!

403
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:15,749
What's more,

404
00:25:18,969 --> 00:25:22,610
Registrar Li, this is a report to the royal court.

405
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:26,689
Get it sent day and night to Changan as soon as possible.

406
00:25:26,689 --> 00:25:30,490
Governor, don't you trust Military Governor?

407
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:33,100
It's not the case,

408
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,780
but it's a matter concerning the public's lives,

409
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:39,869
so we must approach 100% safety as much as possible.

410
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:42,390
Okay, I'll arrange it right now.

411
00:25:51,209 --> 00:25:52,909
<i>Li Shimin,</i>

412
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:56,730
<i>can't I get rid of you at all?</i>

413
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:15,130
I remember you're from Shuo State

414
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:17,610
and know Shuo State well.

415
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,730
You already knew I'd lose today.

416
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:21,250
Did you collude with the enemy?

417
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,569
I was wronged.

418
00:26:22,569 --> 00:26:24,809
Heaven knows I'm loyal to you.

419
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:26,589
I have an idea to tell you, General.

420
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:29,049
After you listen to me, if you insist on killing me,

421
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:31,750
I'll subject my life to you.

422
00:26:40,709 --> 00:26:42,609
Go ahead.

423
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,790
What're the odds this time?

424
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:57,349
If it works, Shuo State will collapse on itself.

425
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:00,749
You'll take the first-class merit.

426
00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:02,509
Really?

427
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,189
Governor, Governor Sima invited you to his manor.

428
00:27:12,189 --> 00:27:14,189
Sima Tu,

429
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,529
did he say something else?

430
00:27:20,529 --> 00:27:23,649
No. Regarding if he'll agree to send reinforcements,

431
00:27:23,649 --> 00:27:25,449
he wants discuss it with you.

432
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:28,500
Since Ashile Tribe's last attack,

433
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,130
he has remained unmoved.

434
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,430
He's always been on guard against me.

435
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:37,069
It's not that simple.

436
00:27:37,069 --> 00:27:39,460
Okay, you may leave.

437
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,860
Yes.

438
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,720
Elder Qin, it's a banquet

439
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,289
where treachery must be planned,

440
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:50,349
but he's the Military Governor.

441
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:53,969
I can't turn him down. I've to accept his invitation.

442
00:27:53,969 --> 00:27:57,329
Governor, I'll accompany you there.

443
00:27:57,329 --> 00:27:58,490
No, thanks.

444
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:02,169
It's more useful for you to stay here.

445
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:18,230
Elder Qin, if I can't return,

446
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:22,410
just give this note to Registrar Li.

447
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:25,388
Are you serious?

448
00:28:25,389 --> 00:28:28,890
Their identities are dubious.

449
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:33,049
I tend to use a man without suspecting him.

450
00:28:33,049 --> 00:28:36,510
As for this, when to give it to them,

451
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,808
- it depends on you.
- Governor.

452
00:28:38,808 --> 00:28:42,730
Elder Qin, I know your concern.

453
00:28:44,209 --> 00:28:45,850
I believe him,

454
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,570
but I'm more inclined to believe you.

455
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,949
Governor, it's...

456
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,788
Judging from his words and behaviors,

457
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:55,210
you'll know his heart.

458
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:59,090
I know he may hide something from us,

459
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,850
but I believe

460
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:04,649
he's not harmful to our country and the people.

461
00:29:04,649 --> 00:29:06,630
These years,

462
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:10,430
I've been resisting the enemy numerous times.

463
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:13,809
Maybe they've long known my tactics well.

464
00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:15,229
But he's different.

465
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:19,469
I think he's quick-witted in various military tactics,

466
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:21,610
which is unfamiliar to the enemy.

467
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,889
Maybe he can defeat them surprisingly.

468
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:28,388
However, he's not experienced in warcraft,

469
00:29:28,389 --> 00:29:31,650
and still needs your help.

470
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:35,289
Even if I can't survive this time,

471
00:29:35,289 --> 00:29:38,410
I believe with you two's joining of hands,

472
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:43,250
you're bound to find ways to protect people from harm.

473
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,430
I want to thank you in advance.

474
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:48,049
Governor, you don't have to.

475
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:51,330
I'll do as you said.

476
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:59,690
<i>[Ample Profound Knowledge and Open Broad-mindedness]</i>

477
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,170
<i>[Military Governor Manor]</i>

478
00:30:24,909 --> 00:30:26,509
Governor.

479
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:29,589
Stop.

480
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:32,489
Why?

481
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:38,370
Xu Feng, await for me here.

482
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,670
Yes.

483
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,150
Go.

484
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:02,549
Military Governor, nice to meet you.

485
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,969
You even know I'm the Military Governor.

486
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:13,975
I don't understand.

487
00:31:13,976 --> 00:31:15,829
Please let me know what's wrong.

488
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,290
Listen.

489
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,569
Did you resist the enemy today?

490
00:31:20,569 --> 00:31:21,589
Yes.

491
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:23,308
Today the situation was urgent.

492
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:27,449
When I was alerted, the Ashile Tribe had been at the gate.

493
00:31:27,449 --> 00:31:30,469
It's too urgent for me to notify you.

494
00:31:30,469 --> 00:31:34,209
I acted as I saw fit.

495
00:31:34,209 --> 00:31:36,429
Hope you may understand.

496
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:38,068
On behalf of His Majesty,

497
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:41,109
I'm patrolling the military forces in four cities.

498
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:44,068
You must listen to me when deploying forces.

499
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:47,110
No one's allowed to do so without my permission.

500
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:51,169
I know in an emergency you can act as you see fit,

501
00:31:51,169 --> 00:31:54,109
but today's battle lasted for four hours.

502
00:31:54,109 --> 00:31:57,090
In the whole four hours,

503
00:31:57,090 --> 00:32:02,689
were you too busy to send anyone to notify me?

504
00:32:02,689 --> 00:32:05,809
I'm sorry I made a mistake.

505
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:10,530
It's said Gongsun Heng's discreet.

506
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,390
How can you make such a mistake?

507
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,110
All in all,

508
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:19,640
you've been ignoring me all the time.

509
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,470
You, as a former subject of the Sui Dynasty,

510
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:25,970
must have forgotten who rules the country now.

511
00:32:26,589 --> 00:32:30,010
I'm loyal to the Tang Dynasty.

512
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:34,269
Please find out the truth that I'm not treacherous at all.

513
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:38,690
So you mean I'm wronging you?

514
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,229
I dare not.

515
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:44,850
Knowing you're in charge of the forces,

516
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:49,060
you've been domineering in Shuo State for decades.

517
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,369
There's nothing you dare not do.

518
00:32:52,189 --> 00:32:56,220
If I turn a blind eye to

519
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,530
your deploying forces without permission,

520
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:01,329
governors of the other three cities will

521
00:33:01,329 --> 00:33:05,629
follow your example and ignore me.

522
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:07,969
Guards.

523
00:33:09,722 --> 00:33:12,449
Military Governor, now it's urgent.

524
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:14,850
Please allow me to defeat the enemy first

525
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:19,148
and then go back to beg your pardon.

526
00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:21,550
Go back after you finish your work?

527
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,150
How cheeky you are!

528
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,761
Don't you respect His Majesty at all?

529
00:33:25,761 --> 00:33:27,211
Military Governor,

530
00:33:27,211 --> 00:33:30,809
resisting enemies and protecting people are our priorities.

531
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:34,110
Take him into strict custody.

532
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:52,028
Governor Gongsun said he'd stay all night here,

533
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:54,169
and asked you to go back first.

534
00:34:05,847 --> 00:34:07,492
Military Governor.

535
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:12,380
Has Gongsun Heng's report been intercepted?

536
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,540
Yes.

537
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:16,029
What happened here will never be known in Changan.

538
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,549
Send men to guard the post station to the south.

539
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,768
Before Ashile Tribe withdraws,

540
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:26,329
no news in four northern cities can be leaked out.

541
00:34:26,329 --> 00:34:27,729
Yes.

542
00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:32,650
Come out.

543
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:43,488
It's done.

544
00:34:43,488 --> 00:34:44,808
Hurry and leave.

545
00:34:44,808 --> 00:34:47,188
You're not welcome here.

546
00:34:47,189 --> 00:34:49,428
Without my message,

547
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:52,989
if you keep letting Gongsun Heng provoke Ashile's army

548
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,549
and attract their main forces,

549
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:58,668
the four northern cities will be in danger.

550
00:34:58,669 --> 00:35:03,108
So is your title as Military Governor.

551
00:35:03,109 --> 00:35:07,188
I did you such a favor, but you drove me out.

552
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:09,949
Wasn't it improper?

553
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:14,768
Our Sima Family has nothing to do with you now.

554
00:35:14,768 --> 00:35:17,388
It was you who committed treason.

555
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:19,129
Don't get me involved.

556
00:35:19,129 --> 00:35:21,628
You wronged me.

557
00:35:21,629 --> 00:35:24,148
I did so for your sake.

558
00:35:24,149 --> 00:35:26,889
I didn't want people in great misery.

559
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:29,609
Gongsun Heng intended to risk all people's lives

560
00:35:29,609 --> 00:35:32,969
for an undeserved reputation of valuing people.

561
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:35,509
Let alone to take him into custody,

562
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,749
it's reasonable for you to kill him.

563
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:42,949
It's none of your business how I handle him.

564
00:35:48,109 --> 00:35:49,809
All right.

565
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:53,628
Shuo State City will sooner or later be occupied.

566
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:56,790
At that time of your life...

567
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:01,188
Now working for Ashile Tribe, I'm highly valued.

568
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:04,668
You know what my status is.

569
00:36:04,669 --> 00:36:06,309
You're my brother.

570
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:10,428
I won't forget to benefit you.

571
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:14,108
You're now on bad terms with Gongsun Heng.

572
00:36:14,109 --> 00:36:16,490
If he's promoted,

573
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:21,730
where can you gain a foothold in Shuo State?

574
00:36:23,189 --> 00:36:27,150
I can only advise you.

575
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:32,420
It's not too late to forsake darkness for light.

576
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:41,270
It's almost dawn.

577
00:36:42,629 --> 00:36:44,329
Scram.

578
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:57,530
<i>[Governor Mansion]</i>

579
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:20,749
Registrar, won't you go to sleep this late?

580
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,450
I will after sorting out documents for Governor.

581
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:25,709
Elder Qin, at your age,

582
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,510
you'd better ask someone else to go on night patrol.

583
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:33,288
Registrar, do you have a guilty conscience?

584
00:37:33,288 --> 00:37:35,489
Elder Qin,

585
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:40,410
I can only tell you I have a clear conscience.

586
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,030
All right.

587
00:37:45,249 --> 00:37:46,868
- Elder Qin.
- Xu Feng.

588
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:48,229
Why're you back this late?

589
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,868
Where's Governor?

590
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:53,348
Sima Tu's men told me Governor would stay all night there.

591
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:55,768
I think something's wrong, so I came back first.

592
00:37:55,768 --> 00:37:59,569
Unexpectedly, Governor was taken into custody.

593
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:00,749
Why?

594
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:06,449
Maybe because Governor deployed forces without permission.

595
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:11,148
Sima Tu has taken Governor as a thorn in his flesh.

596
00:38:11,148 --> 00:38:14,628
He refused to reply to Governor's application for reinforcements.

597
00:38:14,629 --> 00:38:19,388
Governor had no choice but to resist enemies.

598
00:38:19,389 --> 00:38:21,628
He finally got something on Governor.

599
00:38:21,629 --> 00:38:23,559
Elder Qin's right.

600
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:24,889
From Sui to Tang Dynasties,

601
00:38:24,889 --> 00:38:27,288
Governor has been in charge of the military forces in Shuo State.

602
00:38:27,288 --> 00:38:28,728
The reason why Military Governor

603
00:38:28,728 --> 00:38:31,908
was sent to govern four cities is to restrain his power

604
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,668
in case he'd go out of control.

605
00:38:33,669 --> 00:38:36,509
Like today, the enemy lost the battle

606
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:39,029
but Military Governor got something on him.

607
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,069
That's right.

608
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,108
Asshole!

609
00:38:41,109 --> 00:38:42,709
So unreasonable!

610
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,929
I'll break into Military Governor's manor and save Governor out.

611
00:38:44,929 --> 00:38:46,649
Stop! You can't go.

612
00:38:46,649 --> 00:38:47,628
Why?

613
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:48,809
Idiot!

614
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:51,668
They secretly took Governor into custody

615
00:38:51,669 --> 00:38:57,089
exactly for they hadn't got something real on him.

616
00:38:57,089 --> 00:39:00,568
If we revolt against Military Governor, they'll find evidence

617
00:39:00,568 --> 00:39:06,390
for their charge of Governor's treachery and rebellion.

618
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,668
So what shall we do to save Governor?

619
00:39:09,669 --> 00:39:12,469
He's the city's governor.

620
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:16,868
Though in custody, his life shouldn't be in danger for now.

621
00:39:16,869 --> 00:39:21,568
But it's a secret among us and can't be known by the Madam,

622
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,989
in case she'll be worried.

623
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,809
Yes.

624
00:39:25,809 --> 00:39:30,129
Xu Feng, you used to be a scout good at fishing for info.

625
00:39:30,129 --> 00:39:33,549
Keep a close eye on Military Governor,

626
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:37,309
and send messages in detail with pigeons.

627
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:42,428
Tomorrow, I'll see Sima Tu in person to know the situation.

628
00:39:42,429 --> 00:39:44,229
Yes.

629
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,288
Elder Qin, I'll accompany you tomorrow.

630
00:39:46,288 --> 00:39:49,428
Registrar Li, if you can stay here,

631
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:53,149
you'll do our manor a great favor.

632
00:40:05,138 --> 00:40:07,148
Do you know Tu Kashe's military counselor?

633
00:40:07,149 --> 00:40:09,749
Surnamed Sima, he was an official in Central Plains

634
00:40:09,749 --> 00:40:12,388
captured by Tu Kashe when out for a battle with Khan.

635
00:40:12,389 --> 00:40:14,620
He was spared for his wit,

636
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,409
becoming a military counselor in Bear Division.

637
00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:20,088
A so-called villain holding sway in Central Plains.

638
00:40:20,088 --> 00:40:23,770
I don't know what kind of idea the villain got for Tu Kashe.

639
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:28,337
According to the scout,

640
00:40:28,337 --> 00:40:30,809
Gongsun Heng was taken into custody by Military Governor.

641
00:40:30,810 --> 00:40:32,920
What?

642
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,069
It's no use reinforcing the wall.

643
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,160
Gongsun Heng had secured Shuo State for years,

644
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,269
but turned out to be taken custody by his fellow.

645
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,908
It's no other than giving us Shuo State as a gift.

646
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:43,588
What a pity!

647
00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:46,089
A renowned general was framed by a villain.

648
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,588
Keep a close eye on Sima Jian.

649
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:52,349
Don't get us involved because of his misbehavior.

650
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:53,789
Yes.

651
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:00,970
Congratulations, General.

652
00:41:01,569 --> 00:41:04,108
My brother has taken Gongsun Heng into custody.

653
00:41:04,109 --> 00:41:05,728
I'll go on persuading him.

654
00:41:05,728 --> 00:41:08,569
He'll surrender in days.

655
00:41:11,009 --> 00:41:13,109
Great.

656
00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:18,749
If it comes true, not only I'll climb up the social ladder,

657
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,590
but also you'll make a fortune.

658
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:27,629
I'll see how that bastard competes with me.

<i>[Governor Manor]</i>

660
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,388
What are you doing?

661
00:41:45,389 --> 00:41:46,509
Speak up if you want us out.

662
00:41:46,509 --> 00:41:48,248
Why must be like this?

663
00:41:48,248 --> 00:41:50,549
Our mansion was robbed.

664
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:55,749
Registrar, this morning Sima Tu didn't allow me in,

665
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,509
but according to my scout,

666
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:02,749
Sima Tu said Governor colluded with the Ashile Tribe, ignored his orders,

667
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:06,808
and was suspicious of treason, so he was taken into custody.

668
00:42:06,808 --> 00:42:08,148
That's a bunch of nonsense!

669
00:42:08,149 --> 00:42:10,148
It's against justice!

670
00:42:10,149 --> 00:42:11,309
Justice?

671
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:14,849
If there was justice, then the world would be at peace.
