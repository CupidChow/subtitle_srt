10
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,060
Are you excited?

11
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,700
Yes, I'm very excited.

12
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,460
Take a deep breath.

13
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,580
You can do it.

14
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:20,380
Hoo! Juju, fantastic!

15
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,180
Very stunning

16
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,460
pangpuriye watanabe aiko.

17
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:28,860
Eh...

18
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,100
What about Top?

19
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,940
Where's Top, Juju?

20
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,500
I’ll call him.

21
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,180
Call. Call. Call. Call.

22
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,220
Only another half hour and we’ve got to put on the show.

23
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,540
Where is Top?

24
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,180
Oh, I'm going to faint.

25
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,180
Can anyone reach him?

26
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,460
Bro!! My helmet! My helmet!

27
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,940
Oh! Are you okay?

28
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,340
Okay!

29
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,780
Ok ok.... I have to go now.

30
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,740
Top!

31
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,980
Where is he?

32
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,940
Can someone turn up the air conditioner?

33
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,620
Madame,

34
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,100
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,620
Top! Where have you been?

36
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,140
I’ve been worried about you!

37
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:43,740
Take your seat

38
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,460
P’Dui, hurry up and take care of Top right away.

39
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,900
Make sure he's the most handsome!

40
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,820
Madame,

41
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,940
thank you.

42
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,540
I’d like to thank all of you, too.

43
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,460
Today is finally here.

44
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,540
Thank you.

45
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,940
VR1! VR1! VR1! Hey!

46
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:36,780
We did it!

47
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:58,620
Let's go.

48
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,780
(1 year ago)

49
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:59,100
I have found the jewels of Ayudhya, the albino elephant!

50
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:27,420
We have many dreams.

51
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,060
Whether it's boxing,

52
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,420
singing,

53
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,380
if we love it, give it all we've got.

54
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,340
Now the opportunity is here.

55
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,420
Ice!

56
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,100
Yes, sir.

57
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,620
I'd like fried rice

58
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,500
and stir fried clams, please.

59
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,580
Okay sir…

60
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,740
Hia (Bro)! New order!!

61
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,380
Okay!

62
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,380
It tastes so good!

63
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,940
It’s salty, rich, a little spicy,

64
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,420
but so tasty.

65
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,580
Top!  Tom yum kung! Table 2! Hurry up!

66
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,820
Oishi

67
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,500
Oishi

68
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,780
Try this.

69
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,020
This is tom yum kung?

70
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,140
This is tom yum kung?

71
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,540
It's yummy! I can’t stop eating it!

72
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,500
Get ready!

73
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,700
Do you want to become an artist?

74
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,460
A boyband like you used to train for in Korea.

75
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:07,980
Uhm..

76
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:13,540
Artist Manager. Searching for a new and upcoming artist.

77
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,780
People in the entertainment industry call me...

78
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,500
Madame Pauly.

79
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:32,020
Ooh! Yummy!

80
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,020
So…have you decided?

81
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:58,740
Why? You’re talented. You’ve got good looks.

82
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,460
Why are you throwing all this away to work at a porridge restaurant?

83
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,100
I didn't mean to look down on you.

84
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,820
I can't go. I have to work.

85
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:16,220
You’re not going for free. As a boyband working one hour

86
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,900
Earns more money than working here for a month.

87
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,020
Who knows? You might even be able to buy this whole market.

88
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,820
I…

89
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:34,740
Listen to what he says.
You can't work for me for the rest of your life!

90
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:36,940
Isn't that right, hia (bro)?

91
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,180
Can you change what you're calling me?

92
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:38,700
oops!

93
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,180
I'm not very comfortable

94
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,140
with "hia" (bro).

95
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,420
Think carefully.

96
00:15:18,546 --> 00:15:19,826
Hey! My bag!!

97
00:15:39,226 --> 00:15:40,306
Hey, you!

98
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:43,026
Did you just call me?

99
00:15:43,226 --> 00:15:46,026
Yeah, you! Where’s your car?

100
00:15:47,986 --> 00:15:48,666
Huai!
(Isaan dialect)

101
00:15:49,026 --> 00:15:50,146
How am I gonna get that down?

102
00:15:58,626 --> 00:15:59,426
Huai!

103
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:25,826
What the?

104
00:16:26,826 --> 00:16:27,586
What the?

105
00:17:40,466 --> 00:17:47,266
Okay, boys. If you're done with registration, you can go into the auditorium.

106
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,546
We’re about to start in 5 minutes.

107
00:18:16,186 --> 00:18:18,346
That country boy is auditioning too?

108
00:18:32,026 --> 00:18:35,946
Oops... sorry, test the mic.

109
00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:40,026
Hello, everybody....

110
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:46,346
Welcome to World Star,

111
00:18:50,386 --> 00:18:53,746
a company that will truly develop your talents.

112
00:18:54,306 --> 00:19:02,946
And now meet the person who will turn you into a world-class boyband ....

113
00:19:02,946 --> 00:19:07,786
Khun Serena!

114
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:22,786
Who’s that?

115
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:29,266
I’m here to find someone

116
00:19:30,026 --> 00:19:38,786
exceptional talents, star quality,
and readiness to give up their whole life to become a true artist.

117
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:44,066
Only 6 peoples!

118
00:19:46,826 --> 00:19:49,346
Oh! The person who will mould us into a boyband, right?

119
00:19:49,346 --> 00:19:51,746
You, there, do you have a question?

120
00:19:51,746 --> 00:19:54,626
No, ma’am. Nothing.

121
00:19:55,106 --> 00:19:58,546
Many of you are probably wondering

122
00:19:58,706 --> 00:20:06,586
who I am.
I can either be an angel who will make your dream come true

123
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:11,666
or a demon who destroys it.

124
00:20:12,426 --> 00:20:16,106
What I am is up to you.

125
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:23,666
Let’s give it up for Khun Serena, the CEO of World Star.

126
00:20:32,266 --> 00:20:35,466
You’ve all met me before,

127
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:39,066
but let me introduce myself again.

128
00:20:39,506 --> 00:20:46,746
My name is Paul but I'm also known as Madame Pauly,

129
00:20:48,106 --> 00:20:58,106
the most dashing artist manager
in the Thailand...land...land.

130
00:21:05,226 --> 00:21:08,106
I'm ready to see what you have found.

131
00:21:08,786 --> 00:21:10,106
Oh, are we starting?

132
00:21:10,106 --> 00:21:12,626
Yes. Why waste time?

133
00:21:16,706 --> 00:21:24,586
If you think you’ve got what it takes, step up.

134
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:50,306
Good.

135
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:54,306
But not good enough.

136
00:22:59,026 --> 00:23:02,386
Sun, you're exhausted in the middle of the song…

137
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:08,666
Pokpong, you dance with too much energy. Your line is all over the place.

138
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:13,986
I’ll consider you as the mean value of the group….

139
00:23:14,906 --> 00:23:16,466
You know what that is?

140
00:23:19,546 --> 00:23:25,466
That’s the standard.  Everybody who comes up onstage

141
00:23:26,666 --> 00:23:30,506
has to be equal to or better than them.

142
00:23:32,546 --> 00:23:37,546
If you don’t think you can do it, just drop out.

143
00:23:59,666 --> 00:24:01,186
Next!

144
00:24:06,146 --> 00:24:14,266
What I'm about to say are the things on my mind.

145
00:24:14,266 --> 00:24:18,266
The feelings are overwhelming. I need to reveal them.

146
00:24:18,266 --> 00:24:20,466
You're the only person I want to own.

147
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:23,106
I won't let anyone come close and look at you.

148
00:24:23,106 --> 00:24:30,986
Because I'm falling for you, baby.

149
00:24:43,506 --> 00:24:45,506
You’re cute.

150
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:47,866
Thank you.

151
00:24:48,066 --> 00:24:49,306
But you’re out of tune.

152
00:24:51,546 --> 00:24:57,346
And I don’t know if you can dance because you sang a slow song

153
00:24:59,986 --> 00:25:04,466
but I’ll let you pass. I want to see more.

154
00:25:07,386 --> 00:25:08,186
Okay.

155
00:25:08,586 --> 00:25:09,986
Next!

156
00:25:20,066 --> 00:25:21,786
The last one, right?

157
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:37,466
You were an artist trainee in Korea?

158
00:25:38,226 --> 00:25:38,786
Yes.

159
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,240
The last one, right?

160
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,080
You were an artist trainee in Korea?

161
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,600
Yes.

162
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,760
Hello! Ma'am! Okay?

163
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,280
I’m alright.  My leg just hurt a little.

164
00:27:53,719 --> 00:27:55,360
Go back to your studies.

165
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,640
I’ll go home to see you, Mother.  Please wait for me.

166
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,840
Okay! Let's go!

167
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,160
He's good.

168
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,160
Really?

169
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,800
You can also do that move.

170
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,960
What is your name? You didn't introduce yourself yet.

171
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,520
My name’s Top.
(Top speaks in the central dialect, but with an Isaan accent.)

172
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,240
I'm from Khon Kaen,

173
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,560
but I went to work in Ayutthaya.

174
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,160
(Isaan dialect) Hoo, we're from the same hometown! Fighting!

175
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,960
What do you do for a living?

176
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,600
I'm an elephant caretaker and a sword fighter

177
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,080
and a waiter.

178
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,400
Do you know you have an accent?

179
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,920
I thought

180
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,600
we'd found the perfect guy.

181
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,080
Madame Pauly, can't you distinguish between people

182
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,160
who can speak clearly and unclearly?

183
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,520
Uh… His speech isn’t so bad.

184
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,520
Oh! A person who sings

185
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,160
off-key is easy to fix.

186
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,440
But a person who doesn't speakly clearly and has an accent is hard to fix.

187
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,880
Am I right?

188
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,760
I’ll try.

189
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,480
How hard will you try?

190
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,080
Uh… I’ll keep trying.

191
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,040
You can't just keep trying.

192
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,520
I can't wait for my whole life.

193
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:08,880
What you need to do is not only try. You have to be able to do it

194
00:31:09,159 --> 00:31:12,640
no matter what it takes…
Whatever you have to give up, you have to do it.

195
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,920
Do you understand?

196
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,440
Yes.

197
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,720
What if you can't?

198
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,840
Will you go back and raise elephants like before?

199
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:34,680
If you can't become an artist, will you go back to the same old life?

200
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,360
Probably so.

201
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,760
So go!

202
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,040
You’ll never become an artist

203
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,080
if you have other options in life.

204
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,800
To become an artist you’ll have to train hard

205
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,880
and devote your entire life from this second onwards.

206
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,880
If you think you don’t need to be an artist

207
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,280
in this lifetime…  it'd be good to become one…

208
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,200
but if not, it's okay…

209
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:25,080
You could just go back to living your life. Then leave.

210
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,920
There's the door.

211
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,520
Because people who could become artists

212
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:40,760
are people who sold their souls and devoted their lives to training hard.

213
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,040
Can you do that?

214
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,920
If not, pack your bags and leave.

215
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,400
So, are you still going back to raising the elephants?

216
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,920
This morning…I didn’t mean it.

217
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,880
Sorry.

218
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,040
Forget about it.

219
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,800
Hey! You do have an accent!

220
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,240
So what?

221
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,040
Nothing. What I'm saying is that I wouldn't have heard if I didn't try so hard to catch it.

222
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:56,160
Khun Serena’s got sharp ears.  She can hear every note that is out of tune.

223
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,840
But your singing isn't just a little bit out of tune.

224
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,280
So what?

225
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,560
You don’t need good ears to hear that.

226
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,880
So you think being a trainee in Korea is so cool?

227
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,800
Pretty much for a country boy like me.

228
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,400
But you didn’t get to debut.

229
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,400
Did you fail in the training

230
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,120
or gave up
And ended up coming back here to handle elephants?

231
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,320
Shut up if you don't know anything.

232
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,400
So tell me.  I wanna know.

233
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:35,240
Dude, is there any tissue out there? Can I have some?

234
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,320
"Hey, dude, give me some tissue. Hurry!"

235
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,560
Okay.

236
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,280
"Thanks, man. I thought nobody was here."

237
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,240
When I get nervous, my stomach gets upset.

238
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,200
Thanks a lot, dude.

239
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,440
Your hand, dude…did you wash it?

240
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,640
It's not dirty!

241
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,440
Hey! No! That wasn't me!

242
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,000
There are so many applicants.

243
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,080
"Kru..kru..(teacher)... How old are you?"

244
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,360
35.

245
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,040
"Same age as my mother."

246
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,040
I'm sorry.  I meant to ask Kru Namkhing.

247
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,400
How can you ask her something like that? She's a lady.

248
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,880
Ah, are we forbidden to ask women that?

249
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,680
You shouldn't ask them about age.

250
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,160
It’s okay. I can answer. I’m 23.

251
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,400
Woah!

252
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,040
You’re my age, Kru (teacher).

253
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,240
Yes…what are your names?

254
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,080
I’m Ken.

255
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,160
I’m Atom.

256
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,120
Pao Pao.

257
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,880
Tiger.

258
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,800
I'm Yok.

259
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,280
Kru My, should we put name tags on them?

260
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,760
I don't think I can remember all of them.

261
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,280
My name is Ken, Kru.

262
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,440
Yes. I know that already.

263
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,680
Whoooo!  You're so embarassed your ears are red.

264
00:37:55,603 --> 00:38:00,083
Now we have a total of 20 finalists.

265
00:38:00,283 --> 00:38:02,763
When I call your name, raise your hand.

266
00:38:02,763 --> 00:38:03,723
Pokpong

267
00:38:04,443 --> 00:38:05,363
Sun

268
00:38:05,363 --> 00:38:06,403
Ken

269
00:38:07,043 --> 00:38:08,123
Tiger

270
00:38:09,523 --> 00:38:11,003
Pao Pao

271
00:38:11,483 --> 00:38:12,563
Atom

272
00:38:13,363 --> 00:38:14,043
Yok

273
00:38:14,563 --> 00:38:15,723
Kampan

274
00:38:17,243 --> 00:38:18,163
Ryu

275
00:38:19,283 --> 00:38:20,163
Jeff

276
00:38:21,763 --> 00:38:23,003
Copter

277
00:38:23,563 --> 00:38:24,203
Att

278
00:38:25,203 --> 00:38:26,123
Jack

279
00:38:27,163 --> 00:38:28,123
Ice

280
00:38:28,363 --> 00:38:29,483
Natthew

281
00:38:30,243 --> 00:38:31,163
Peach

282
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:33,043
Zen Zen

283
00:38:34,163 --> 00:38:35,203
Leaf

284
00:38:36,003 --> 00:38:37,243
Juju

285
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:39,003
and Top

286
00:38:39,683 --> 00:38:40,563
Yes

287
00:38:41,163 --> 00:38:43,523
From 40 there is 20 left.

288
00:38:43,923 --> 00:38:46,243
That’s still a lot.

289
00:38:46,403 --> 00:38:49,283
I thought we could eliminate some more.

290
00:38:49,563 --> 00:38:53,483
Don’t cut anybody out yet.

291
00:38:53,843 --> 00:38:55,323
I feel sorry for them.

292
00:38:56,443 --> 00:38:59,363
It took such a long time to find each one of them.

293
00:38:59,363 --> 00:39:02,163
I told you before,

294
00:39:02,163 --> 00:39:04,403
Pauly, that there is no pity.

295
00:39:10,243 --> 00:39:16,403
The remaining 20 peoples

296
00:39:17,683 --> 00:39:20,923
are considered "trainees."

297
00:39:21,923 --> 00:39:29,243
Tomorrow get ready to train in dance, singing, and acting.

298
00:39:29,563 --> 00:39:33,043
We start at 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.

299
00:39:33,043 --> 00:39:34,883
or later than that.

300
00:39:35,883 --> 00:39:38,563
We’ll practice every day from Monday to Friday

301
00:39:39,563 --> 00:39:44,683
and take the weekends off. Don't ever come late!

302
00:39:45,123 --> 00:39:51,443
Dress in comfortable wear, Inform your parents.

303
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:58,443
And I’ll watch your development

304
00:39:58,683 --> 00:40:06,443
and decide who is worthy and deserves to become a boyband.

305
00:40:06,443 --> 00:40:09,323
I only want 6 people.

306
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:14,843
Sun, what is it?

307
00:40:15,883 --> 00:40:17,723
I’d like to ask a question

308
00:40:17,723 --> 00:40:21,283
and make sure that everybody here has an equal opportunity, right?

309
00:40:21,523 --> 00:40:22,563
That's right.

310
00:40:24,683 --> 00:40:27,443
What will you base your decisions on, Khun Serena?

311
00:40:27,723 --> 00:40:33,603
What do you think?
What makes a regular boy

312
00:40:34,363 --> 00:40:36,843
turn into a world-class artist

313
00:40:37,363 --> 00:40:39,963
with millions of fans?

314
00:40:40,403 --> 00:40:44,043
That's what I'm looking for.

315
00:40:44,043 --> 00:40:47,203
The 6 people must possess all of those qualities.

316
00:40:49,643 --> 00:40:53,123
Will we get paid during this time?

317
00:40:53,603 --> 00:40:55,003
No.

318
00:41:03,763 --> 00:41:07,603
Ok. If you don't have any questions

319
00:41:08,243 --> 00:41:10,203
you can go your home right now.

320
00:41:10,203 --> 00:41:11,723
Thank you

321
00:41:12,523 --> 00:41:15,083
Wait.

322
00:41:17,323 --> 00:41:22,123
There is one very important rule that everyone has to follow.

323
00:41:24,723 --> 00:41:28,523
We don't allow World Star artists

324
00:41:29,163 --> 00:41:32,563
to have a romantic relationship.

325
00:41:34,323 --> 00:41:36,723
But there are only dudes here.

326
00:41:36,723 --> 00:41:40,043
Yeah? Guys can’t love each other?

327
00:41:40,563 --> 00:41:44,203
No dating.  No loving.  No boyfriends or girlfriends.

328
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:46,443
I hope we’re on the same page here.

329
00:41:46,443 --> 00:41:47,923
Yes.

330
00:41:48,203 --> 00:41:49,403
Ok..

331
00:41:49,963 --> 00:41:54,603
you can go home.  Thank you for today.

332
00:43:54,443 --> 00:43:59,523
There are a million stars tonight

333
00:43:59,523 --> 00:44:03,163
I'll give my love to you
