4
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:30,670
Wait.

5
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,000
Didn't you say you wouldn't reveal our relationship?

6
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,860
How did he know our relationship?

7
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:40,750
You...

8
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,539
Stop.

9
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,490
He discovered it himself.

10
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,920
We're arriving at the filming location.

11
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,440
Mr. Lu.

12
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,240
Do you still want to see Ning Xiao?

13
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
Get off the car.

14
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:05,350
I'll send Wanwan home.

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,640
Slow down.

16
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,950
It hurts.

17
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,850
Poor me.

18
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,680
Why did Han Jingmo send you to the hospital?

19
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,130
The director asked him to do that.

20
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,020
Tell me.

21
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,720
How far have you gone?

22
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,010
What do you mean?

23
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,060
Be reserved.

24
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:35,010
Don't cross the line, understand?

25
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,079
Of course.

26
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,320
If you two are just playing,

27
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,660
forget what I said.

28
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,020
A friendly reminder.

29
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,200
Although our mom is his fan,

30
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,710
Lu doesn't like him.

31
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,230
As long as I like my boyfriend, nothing else matters.

32
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,880
Let me tell you the truth.

33
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,500
Han Jingmo and I are in a relationship.

34
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,150
Liking idols is different from being in a relationship.

35
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,600
You've been his fans for five years.

36
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,290
It's reasonable for you to be obsessed.

37
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,590
I'm an adult.

38
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,620
I can tell admiration from love.

39
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,760
As my biological brother,

40
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:20,220
you should cheer for me.

41
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,260
Wanwan.

42
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,680
You two are not in the same circle.

43
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:30,440
You can't be together forever.

44
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,140
How long have you been in this industry?

45
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,550
Do you know what obstacles the public figures will have

46
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,070
when they're in a relationship?

47
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,270
Have you ever thought about the future?

48
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,620
Guanghan.

49
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:44,270
People only live once.

50
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,860
Don't be so ambitious.

51
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:48,260
You can't have your cake and eat it too.

52
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,700
You taught me how to do things?

53
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:53,850
You

54
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,530
can be optimistic sometimes.

55
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,060
What if one day we suddenly break up?

56
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,720
Right?

57
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,170
It's possible.

58
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,620
I don't want to be the one

59
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,670
who interferes with your decision.

60
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,710
But let me make it clear.

61
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,270
If you two

62
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,860
break up for whatever reason,

63
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,490
don't cry and hurt yourself.

64
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,200
Got it?

65
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,880
Don't curse me.

66
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,200
You told me to be optimistic.

67
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,300
I'm still young.

68
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,330
I want both career and love.

69
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,880
I dare to think and do it,

70
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,680
or I'll regret it when I get old.

71
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,840
You're different.

72
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,060
How am I different?

73
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,030
Ying Ge wouldn't have come this far without me.

74
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,300
You wouldn't be who you are today without me.

75
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,409
Look at you now.

76
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,540
You still didn't figure it out.

77
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,650
Lu.

78
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:41,560
Don't always focus on your career.

79
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,000
Date someone. Date more people,

80
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,840
or you'll really get old.

81
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,360
You know nothing.

82
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,300
The older a man is, the more attractive he is.

83
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,090
I'm not like you who only focus on appearance.

84
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:52,970
You only care about Han Jingmo.

85
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,250
You like that type.

86
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,090
How dare you question my taste?

87
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,590
I also like Qiao.

88
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,060
Qiao is different from him.

89
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,060
Why are they different?

90
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:00,790
Qiao.

91
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,230
For example, his pursuit of art,

92
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,110
his passion for acting...

93
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:08,020
I don't want to talk to you.

94
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,680
I'll sign him sooner or later.

95

I don't want to hear it either.

I'm looking forward to it.

97

I'm looking forward to seeing you sign him.

98
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,030
Can I see it when I'm alive?

99

I'm looking forward to that day.

100

I want to tell you the secret of your origin, Lu Guanghan.

He's gone too far.

It's only been a day.

109

Why do you have so many topics?

110

I'm receiving the friendly concern from my friends in the circle.

Friends?

112

113

He's asking me about my injury.

119

He asked if I could have dinner with him.

120
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,900
I'll tell them I can't eat with him

121
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,200

Why do you want to go there?

177

I'm so disappointed in you.

178

Why are you not curious at all?

179
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,430
That is curiosity?

180
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,550
Of course.

181

I have curiosity.

182

I want to ask you about someone.

Can you handle it yourself?

184

Don't ask me.

185

If the budget is not enough, just increase it.

All right, I'm hanging up.

190

I was too emotional last time.

191

200
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:12,970
He's a man.

201
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:15,230
I can't tie him with a chain.

202

203
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,700
Please tell me his address.

204
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,770
Okay?

205

You're the prettiest, okay?

206
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,660
As a friend,

207
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,750
I have to keep my word.

209

I'll help you find him.

210

Do you know where he is?

211
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,100
No, I don't.

212
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,180
But I have a method

213
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,960
which can make him appear immediately.

214
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,010
I'll tell him

215

that we're getting married

216
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,010
and that I want him to be the best man.

217
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:41,910
You're crafty.

218

You're smart.

220
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,730
But it's not good.

221
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:52,660
Let me ask you.

222
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,910
Are you happy when you're with me?

223
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,900
So,

224
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,620
do you want Zhao Jinghang

225
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,760
to be unhappy?

226
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,190
He has affective disorder.

227
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,700
My sister doesn't mind it.

228
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,230
He should be happy about it.

229
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,180
Just let them deal with it themselves.

230
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,290
This is good for our friends.

for what I said to you before.

But I said what I really meant.

I hope you can understand me.

Yes.

00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,460
That person

693
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,720
is under our noses.

694
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:51,100
Who is it?

695
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,460
Xixi misunderstood me.

696
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,070
I want to find the person as soon as possible

697
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,420
in order to clear my name.

698
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,140
We don't know the details yet.

699
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,720
The shooting was stopped today

700
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,090
to find this person.

701
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,170
Can stopping the shoot

702
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,300
find that person?

703
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,390
What's wrong?

704
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,370
Look.

705
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,260
Mr. Lu came to the filming location last night.

706
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,140
Lu Wanwan has been sleeping in his room

707
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,970
until now.

708
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,100
Xixi, how did you know?

709
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,440
It's a filming set here.

710
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,450
Can gossip like this not spread?

711
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,550
Look.

712
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,570
Every group among the crew is discussing it.

713
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,980
Great.

714
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,420
Great?

715
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,160
What is Lu Wanwan up to?

716
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:49,140
Is she trying to use this chance

717
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,570
to threaten Mr. Lu?

718
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,570
It's not like that.

719
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,430
Wanwan is not that kind of person.

720
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:53,910
I...

721
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:54,800
Song Chi.

722
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,500
Is there anything

723
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:57,690
you can't say?

724
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,380
Tell us.

725
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,680
What time is it now?

726
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,770
You don't want Wanwan to be hurt by rumors, do you?

727
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:04,630
Tell us.

728
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,060
What's going on?

729
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,010
You are not outsiders anyway.

730
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,580
I'll be honest with you.

731
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,350
But you must keep it a secret.

732
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,390
Actually,

733
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,600
I was the one who spread the rumor.

734
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:21,730
What?

735
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,870
Nothing. Let's eat.

736
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,730
Are you crazy?

737
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:30,030
Why did you ruin Mr. Lu's reputation?

738
00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:32,450
I was just obeying orders.

739
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:34,380
Mr. Lu asked me to do this.

740
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,820
Because he found out

741
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:38,270
the one who spread the rumors of Wanwan

742
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,380
and the one who hurt Wanwan last time

743
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,610
was actually the same person.

744
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:43,300
That person is in the filming location.

745
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,180
He wants to smoke that person out this time.

746
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,880
So,

747
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,680
they stopped shooting today

748
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,050
in order to smoke that person out.

749
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,330
You're mart.

750
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,530
Do you need to bother with the trap?

751
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:00,970
Isn't that person

752
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:05,190
under our noses?

753
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:06,850
Xixi.

754
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,580
Why do you always have prejudice against me?

755
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,420
Stop pretending.

756
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:15,800
Someone will be found out soon.

757
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,080
New arrivals.

758
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,719
[New arrivals.]

759
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,719
[You'll be surprised.]

760
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,719
[The price is the same.]

761
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,179
You'll be surprised.

762
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:24,380
The price is the same.

763
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,159
Since you have such a deep prejudice against me,

764
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,960
I won't bother you here anymore.

765
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,150
I'm leaving.

766
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,360
Someone is rushing back to clean up the mess.

767
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,020
Shengkai.

768
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,199
You're here.

769
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,760
I was looking for you.

770
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,460
The director went to the editing room with me.

771
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,400
There're some problems with your performance.

772
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,400
The director asked me to talk to you.

773
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,980
Can you wait a minute?

774
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,330
I have something to do.

775
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:53,980
It's okay.

776
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,750
Let's talk while walking.

777
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,080
I won't waste your time.

778
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,490
Okay.

779
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,270
The director thought

780
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,170
the lines...

781
00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:06,860
Tell the director that I'll adjust it.

782
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,570
Okay.

783
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,910
Rest early.

784
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,150
Be careful next time.

785
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:10,960
Okay, thank you.

786
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,050
Thank you. Bye.

787
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,220
Bye.

788
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:14,530
Close it.

789
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,900
Hurry up.

790
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,830
Come here quickly.

791
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:21,700
Let me ask you.

792
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,580
You haven't gone to Lu Wanwan's room

793
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,710
to take photos of her secretly, right?

794
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,740
That's great.

795
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,690
Listen.

796
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,410
Don't take photos.

797
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,840
It was a trap set by them.

798
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,540
I'm talking to you.

799
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,700
What's wrong?

800
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:52,550
Who is it?

801
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,340
I'm going out. Don't talk.

802
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,680
You don't have to hide.

803
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,000
They already know.

804
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,770
What do you mean?

805
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,130
Why are you doing this?

806
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:38,100
Cheers.

807
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,110
Let's eat.

808
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,940
She's the mastermind.

809
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,540
It's all thanks to Han.

810
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,530
Thanks to Han's

811
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,660
high intelligence,

812
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,790
he discovered everything

813
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:57,750
and found Zhang Qiang.

814
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,990
Then he tried his best

815
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,760
to save you from misery

816
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,750
and solved a big problem for the crew.

817
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,570
But I didn't expect Zhang Qiang

818
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:11,570
to be so unprofessional.

819
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:12,980
Chi.

820
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,930
You are too good at flattering him.

821
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,060
So how did you know it was her?

822
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,970
If it were you,

823
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,260
would you use your own things

824
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,490
to hurt others?

825
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:25,990
Also,

826
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,050
do you still remember the quarrel

827
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:29,450
in the corridor that day?

828
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:30,900
Last time, because of you,

829
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,220
Xi's dress was dirtied.

830
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,800
She scolded you a little,

831
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,670
so you've been holding a grudge.

832
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,150
You did such a thing

833
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,060
to frame her.

834
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,360
I did dirty the dress.

835
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,340
I was wrong.

836
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,200
But I really don't know about the bracelet.

837
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,970
I don't accept the slander.

838
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:46,830
I'd been thinking

839
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:47,870
if Xia Linxi and you

840
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:49,660
were both gossiped,

841
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,230
who would benefit the most?

842
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,810
Yan Shengkai.

843
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,160
Yan Shengkai had been pretending well.

844
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,240
If that matter hadn't reminded me,

845
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,300
I wouldn't have

846
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,980
focussed on her.

847
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,380
Look.

848
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,730
It's not meaningless to eavesdrop.

849
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,870
So Han

850
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:09,040
hired professionals to investigate.

851
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,020
I didn't expect

852
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,540
Zhang Qiang to be the one

853
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,980
who spread rumors.

854
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,700
In that case,

855
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,580
why didn't you confront Yan Shengkai in person?

856
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,550
You let the crew ruin my reputation.

857
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:28,010
They also said I had an affair with Cold Legs.

858
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,290
Yan Shengkai was very careful.

859
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:35,080
She and Zhang Qiang used cash in the deal.

860
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,330
The chat records on WeChat

861
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,440
were ambiguous.

862
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,060
There was no evidence at all.

863
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:41,440
So Han figured out this method

864
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,350
to catch her in a trap

865
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,340
and taught her a lesson.

866
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,940
But we still need to thank Mr. Lu

867
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,540
for coming here in person.

868
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,970
The show was complete.

869
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,340
So she was scared.

870
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,060
I'll open it.

871
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,590
Come on. Eat.

872
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:01,790
I'm eating.

873
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,130
It's not easy.

874
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,320
Here.

875
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,910
Eat, Cold Legs.

876
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,980
Did she admit

877
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,400
what hapened in Big Dunk?

878
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,630
Yan Shengkai

879
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:16,960
is really cunning.

880
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,490
Li Weiqian, Xia Linxi

881
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,910
and you

882
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,510
were all fooled by her.

883
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:23,980
Li Weiqian?

884
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,270
Li Weiqian didn't even know

885
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,000
that she was being used as a pawn.

886
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,090
How stupid she is!

887
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,480
Besides,

888
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,910
the car accident Guan Yiwei was involved in

889
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,960
was plotted by her.

890
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,510
I don't know.

891
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,040
I drove by myself.

892
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,720
I don't know why the car suddenly went out of control.

893
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,700
Thanks to Shengkai

894
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:45,480
who helped me move the steering wheel to the other side,

895
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,200
that's why I can see you today.

896
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,480
This matter has finally come to an end.

897
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,510
Cheers.

898
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,290
Cheers.

900
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,860
This time,

901
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,930
thank you for informing me.

902
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,520
Thank you.

903
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,780
It's all for Wanwan.

904
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,460
You don't need to thank me.

905
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,070
Although the problem has been solved,

906
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:23,830
I have to make it clear.

907
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:26,490
As the boss of the company,

908
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:27,920
I admire you.

909
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:31,770
But as Wanwan's brother,

910
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,220
I still can't accept

911
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,720
your relationship.

912
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,440
I understand.

913
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:41,390
I'll try to change your mind.
