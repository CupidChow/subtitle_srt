00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,980
she said she'd treat me to a meal but hasn't done so.

348
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,540
Please urge her.

349
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,350
Did I promise him to treat him to a meal a month ago?

350
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,320
I don't remember anything.

351
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,670
Those anti-fans who talk about hype,

352
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:18,940
open your eyes

353
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,680
and look carefully.

354
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,430
They are friends.

355
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,920
It's not a big deal to vote for your friend.

356
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,320
What's wrong? It's the truth.

357
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,670
So that's why

358
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,800
Han Beauty took a picture with me just now.

359
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,620
Look.

360
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,380
The comments on Weibo

361
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,020
changed suddenly.

362
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,570
They must be close

363
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,860
in private.

364
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,310
Don't forget the key point.

365
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:41,510
Urge her for the meal.

366
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,340
Lu Wanwan.

367
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,070
Hashtag

368
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,630
"Han Jingmo asked you for a meal".

369
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,160
I'm gonna use this hashtag.

370
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,670
Han Beauty is so nice.

371
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,000
He posted on Weibo

372
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,360
to clarify for me

373
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,970
that we are friends.

374
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,660
I'm so touched.

375
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:02,910
Didn't you notice

376
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,190
Han came here specifically for you?

377
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,730
He left after solving the problem.

378
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,300
He did good deeds without leaving a name.

379
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,910
So Han Beauty cares so much about me.

380
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,340
I'm gonna go find him.

381
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:20,830
Your phone.

382
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,100
Phone.

383
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,400
Phone.

384
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,660
Safe.

385
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,980
My treat today.

386
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,920
To thank you.

387
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,880
You can order

388
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,940
whatever you want.

389
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,550
Come on.

390
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,060
You order.

391
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,620
I want this.

392
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,430
This, this,

393
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,320
and this.

394
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:53,400
I want iced tea.

395
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,280
What about you?

396
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,280
I'll drink water.

397
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,370
Okay.

398
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,400
Put it on.

399
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,670
Here.

400
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,150
Thank you.

401
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,820
I'm thirsty.

402
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,080
I saw

403
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,970
someone commented

404
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,150
under your post

405
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,930
that we made up a good couple.

406
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,980
They said we looked good together.

407
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,860
I didn't mean to

408
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,130
see it on purpose.

409
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,680
I'm not saying

410
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,510
we have to

411
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,000
make up a couple.

412
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,030
I have no objection.

413
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,010
Why are there so many of Han Jingmo?

414
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:30,120
What?

415
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,300
Did you eat that mushroom again?

416
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,010
No.

417
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,240
Why is everything shaking?

418
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,820
Why is it so shaky?

419
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,950
I feel dizzy.

420
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,570
What's wrong?

421
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,500
What's going on?

422
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:56,460
Waiter.

423
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,710
Sir, what can I do for you?

424
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,120
Call your manager over.

425
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,360
Okay.

426
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,240
Why are there so many people?

427
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:04,990
Hello, Miss Lu.

428
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,610
What's wrong?

429
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,740
Why is your iced black tea so strong?

430
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,890
Iced black tea?

431
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,470
Order.

432
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,340
Are you still not feeling well?

433
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,110
Excuse me.

434
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,470
Our waiter thought you ordered

435
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,690
Long Island Iced Tea.

436
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,160
We served the wrong one.

437
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,900
Are you still not feeling well?

438
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,870
No.

439
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,980
I'm not allergic

440
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,650
to alcohol.

441
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,430
I'm really sorry.

442
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,910
To apologise,

443
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,090
this is on the house.

444
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:35,660
I'll take you back.

445
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,530
Please come next time.

446
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,630
Tell me if you feel unwell.

447
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,140
I...

448
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:38,680
Let's go.

449
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,140
I'm fine.

450
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,640
I'll be fine after sleeping.

451
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,370
Here, slowly.

452
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:43,750
Slow down.

453
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:44,930
I'll be fine after sleeping.

454
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,280
-I'm sorry. -It's okay.

455
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,060
Be careful.

456
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:54,180
Where is this?

457
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,350
Are you sober?

458
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,620
Do you want to throw up? Wake up.

459
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,960
No, I'm sober.

460
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,390
I am sober now.

461
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,800
I can drink

462
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,890
five glasses more.

463
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,510
Well,

464
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,650
this is two.

465
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:07,840
Five.

466
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,480
Look.

467
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:15,510
One, two, three, four.

468
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,430
Isn't this five?

469
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,670
Nonsense.

470
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,180
Yes.

471
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,190
Stay here.

472
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,980
I'll close the door and change my shoes.

473
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,750
Go ahead.

474
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,700
Don't find excuses to go back.

475
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,370
You've been picking on me since childhood.

476
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,290
I'm Screw, you're Up.

477
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,600
We screw things up if we're together.

478
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,720
Eat you.

479
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:55,940
Beat you.

480
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,380
I beat you,

481
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,920
smash you,

482
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,810
kill you!

483
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,980
Is the egg ready?

484
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,460
Yes.

485
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:09,750
Here.

486
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,780
Sit over there.

487
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,780
Be careful.

488
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,800
Am I dreaming?

489
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:35,540
This is really a big deal.

490
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,060
Little Leaf.

491
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:44,620
[Little Leaf, here comes the breaking news of the year. I'm in a relationship with Han Jingmo.]

492
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,610
Here comes the breaking news of the year.

493
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,150
I'm in a relationship

494
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,370
with Han Jingmo.

495
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,950
[Little Leaf, here comes the breaking news of the year. I'm in a relationship with Han Jingmo.]

496
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,950
[Come on. It's not April Fool's Day today.]

497
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,500
Come on.

498
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,330
It's not April Fool's Day today.

499
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,590
Wait a minute.

500
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:12,050
The bread is not ready yet.

501
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,460
I'm sorry.

502
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:23,520
Sorry?

503
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:25,850
Yes.

504
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,030
No flowers,

505
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,640
no candlelight dinner,

506
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,720
and no Ferris wheel.

507
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,330
I just confessed my love to you like this.

508
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,380
You don't like me. I like you.

509
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,260
Good.

510
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,150
I like you too.

511
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,760
Smells good.

512
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:52,960
And you were wearing pajamas just now.

513
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,090
Yes.

514
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,030
I shouldn't have worn pajamas.

515
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:59,080
It smells so good.

516
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:02,930
Yes.

517
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,590
You shouldn't have worn it.

518
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,540
From now on,

519
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,910
I'll try to be more elegant.

520
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,340
No need.

521
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,290

[Refuse] [Answer]

524
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,050
I need to take this call.

525
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,090
Okay.

526
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,890
I'll be right back.

527
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:51,660
Go ahead.

528
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,580
Is it from someone sent by Cold Legs to monitor me?

529
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,070
I'd better take it.

530
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,140
Hello?

531
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,870
Where are you?

532
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500
Do you want me to pick you up for work?

533
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,620
No work today.

534
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:15,640
I won't bother you.

535
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,530
I'm gonna hang up if there's nothing else.

536
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,270
I'm asking where you are.

537
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,700
Why are you in such a hurry?

538
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,390
Are you in a hurry to get reincarnated?

539
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,910
Where am I?

540
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,260
I...

541
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,660
I'm in the gym.

542
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,870
I'm in the gym.

543
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,130
I'm working out

544
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,960
to exercise my body.

545
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,980
Hey.

546
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,970
Really?

547
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:38,950
Yes.

548
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,140
This music...

549
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,300
Didn't you hear the music from the gym?

550
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,750
♫Ah-oh♫

551
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,220
♫Ah♫

552
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:49,250
♫Ah, ha, ha, du, du♫

553
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,460
The music in the gym is quite unique.

554
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,100
Come out for dinner.

555
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,880
What's that sound?

556
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,210
Nothing.

557
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,010
It's the gym.

558
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,070
It's crowded.

559
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,940
So noisy.

560
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,170
All right, I'm hanging up.

561
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,530
I need to focus on my work-out.

562
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,320
Bye.

563
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,770
Who called?

564
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,870
Zhao Jinghang.

565
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,100
If he knows I'm here,

566
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,120
I'll be doomed.

567
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:48,490
I was afraid he would tell my brother.

568
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,530
My brother

569
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,840
is too old

570
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,980
to accept

571
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,630
our relationship.

572
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:55,750
You're right.

573
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,870
I still can't accept it.

574
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:02,870
Are you going back on your word?

575
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:05,100
Of course not.

576
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,480
Sit down and eat.

577
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:06,980
Come on.

578
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,150
Well...

579
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,890
I always wanted to do this.

580
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:38,970
You were different

581
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,120
when I first met you.

582
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,360
What do you mean?

583
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,030
Are you really going back on your word?

584
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:57,040
Can I kiss you again?

585
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:21,300
So,

586
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,660
are we going on a date?

587
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,330
Yes.

588
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,790
It's our first date.

589
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:26,600
Tell me.

590
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,980
Where do you want to go?

591
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,830
Right.

592
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:31,150
I want to go to the Ocean Park.

593
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,100
Get in the car.

594
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,180
You agreed?

595
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,430
Are you the same Han Jingmo I know?

596
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,560
Get in the car.

597
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,480
Why are you here?

598
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,980
I didn't do my job well as a bodyguard.

599
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,450
I'll make it up today.

600
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,770
I'll escort you wherever you go.

601
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,440
No need.

602
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,460
Where are you going, my two superstars?

603
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,880
I'll accompany you all the way

604
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,550
to protect you.

605
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,700
How did you know we are here?

606
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,620
It doesn't matter.

607
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:17,710
What matters is

608
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:19,040
I'll be with my boss

609
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,320
wherever she is.

610
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,120
He must have overheard it on the phone.

611
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,770
How could I be so careless?

612
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:29,740
This is my first date.

613
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,040
We're going to the Ocean Park.

614
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:35,400
Are you sure you're going with us?

00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:36,850
Haichang Ocean Park.

616
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,320
I like it too.

617
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,070
I went there several times

618
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,460
with Wanwan

619
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,680
when we were young.

620
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,620
Right?

621
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:49,210
You don't have to emphasise that.

622
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,380
Let's go.

623
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,070
It feels so familiar.

624
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,110
Wanwan.

625
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,860
How many times have we been here together?

626
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,290
Just once or twice.

627
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,350
I remember you often brought me here

628
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,920
when we were young.

629
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,130
I still remember it.

630
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:36,700
Let's go.

631
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:38,880
You have to play with me

632
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,280
what you played with him.

633
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,540
Help!

634
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,610

Let's play this.

00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,760
You like this?

639

I'll win it for you.

640
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,730
Only if you can get it.

641
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:12,780
What?

642
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,380
Do you want to compete with me?

643
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:14,940
Come on.

Show me what you've got.

Do you want to play?

646
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,260
Han Jingmo missed.

647
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:35,380
Five more shots.

648
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,790
I thought you were good.

649
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,340
So that's it.

650
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,540
Okay.

651

Great!

652
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,470
Great!

653
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,409
No wonder you seemed to have missed the first shot,

654
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:11,469
it turns out they hit at the same spot.

655
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,900
Shooting diagonal

656
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,679
doesn't only need to deal with vertical movements,

657
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,480
but also horizontal movements.

658
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,770
It's more difficult.

659
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,050
Isn't he great?

660
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,739
Sir.

661
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,800
I want that bear.

662
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:24,710
Okay.

663
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,969
Look, he looks like Han Jingmo.

664
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:31,350
How could a celebrity come to a place like this?

665
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,150
You're right.

666
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,159
But they really look alike.

667
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:35,980
Let's go.

668
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:36,670
Let's go.

669
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:37,760
Thank you, boss.

670
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,630
Han Jingmo, let's go.

671
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,590
I'll play with you next time.

672
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,540
Is that him?

673
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:49,580
Why did you hit my bear?

674
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,409
The bear seems sleepy.

675
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,969
He annoys me.

676
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,360
How can he seem sleepy?

677
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,340
His eyes are so big.

678
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,620
He looks cute.

679
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,070
He looks like you

680
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,670
when you are sleepy.

681
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,550
How did you sleep last night?

682
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,110
Han Beauty, aren't you picking a fight on purpose?

683
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,240
I don't remember anything last night.

684
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,950
Not too bad.

685
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:26,720
A brother is always better than a lover.

686
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,100
Let me buy you ice cream.

687
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,210
No, thanks.

688
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,260
I really don't need it.

689
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,020
Where are you going?

690
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,580
I'm buying you ice cream.

691
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,550
There you go.

692
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,410
I bought you ice cream.

693
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,840
You're dead if you don't eat mine.

694
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,490
Hello?

695

00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,590
What is it?

697
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,190
It must be Beauty Guan.

698
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,120
Don't forget to pick me up

699
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,490
for the event tonight.

700
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,390
Bye.

701
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,000
I have to go.

702
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,350
You haven't told me

703
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,880
how he found us.

704
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,510
Eat this first, or it'll melt.

705
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,930
Kids,

706
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,070
I bought you ice cream.

707
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,100
Thank you.

708
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,710
-Leave one for me. -Here.

709
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,650
Thank you.

710
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,250
I lent my money and lost my friend.

711
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,450
This is the price for your hesitation.

712
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,200
Let's go.

713
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,180
Where are we going?

714
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,330
What else did you play

715
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,070
with Zhao Jinghang before?

716
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:32,340
Let's go.

717
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,690
No way.

718
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:39,050
Let's go.

719
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:39,600
Okay.

720
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,490
Coming.

721
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,820
You're so punctual.

722
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,540
Tell me.

723
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,910
What do you want?

724
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:58,710
The staff asked for leave.

725
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,250
We're short-handed.

726
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,830
The mall is so noisy.

727
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,060
I need a bodyguard.

728
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:06,310
Isn't that too much?

729
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:08,520
Fine.

730
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,620
I'll wait for you outside.

731
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,050
Besides me,

732
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,550
you also need to protect this.

733
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,730
Put it on for me.

734
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,420
Wei is here.

735
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,610
She's so beautiful.

736
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,680
Wei, here.

738
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,840
This way, Wei.

739
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,410
Wei, look here.

740
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,360
Wei, look here. Wei, look here.

741
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,170
Wei, this way.

742
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,800
-Here. -Why is it Xu?

743
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,020
The ceremony begins.

Miss Guan Yiwei, thank you very much

747
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,100

As the spokesperson,

750
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,680
Miss Guan's image and temperament

751
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,860
are very compatible

752
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,590
