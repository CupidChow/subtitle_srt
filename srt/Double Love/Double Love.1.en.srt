It's my first time.

510
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:29,490
This scene is so real.

511
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,390
Going into the arena with a group of geniuses

512
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,860
makes me feel that there's background music automatically.

513
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,930
There are such four monsters as Deadly Melody, Bai Xiaosheng, Crane King

514
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,470
and Kui Cow in the Thousands Snow Cave.

515
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,730
It's hard to fight the Deadly Melody in this instance zone.

516
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:44,480
She will use the Five-Tone Scale of Do, Re, Mi, Sol, La to set up a formation

517
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,600
and release skills from different ranges.

518
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,190
By then, remember

519
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,420
to dodge them according to the warning red circles on the ground.

520
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,730
Bro, we all know that.

521
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,250
I'm talking to the newbie.

522
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,510
Thank you for reminding me.

523
00:20:59,170 --> 00:20:59,820
Be careful.

524
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,080
The Deadly Melody is coming.

525
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,790
Chu He, pay attention to the order of the musical scale.

526
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,930
If you press it wrongly or press it more, we'll be wiped out.

527
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:15,790
Chu He

528
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,220
That was close. My hands didn't tremble.

529
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:52,990
Be careful.

530
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:54,110
She's going to attack again.

531
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,290
Hide yourself.

532
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:05,710
I told you to hide, but you didn't listen.

533
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,350
Is Genius coming to save me?

534
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,230
Don't...

535
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,530
Oh no, Genius lost so much blood for me.

536
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,650
No, I have to help him regain his blood.

537
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,000
[Rosy Clouds]

538
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,380
[Rosy Clouds]

539
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,410
It's finally full.

540
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,370
[Rosy Clouds]

541
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:55,970
Control her.

542
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,660
The Crane King is here. Let's collaborate with each other.

543
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,790
Finish the battle quickly.

544
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:37,180
The chessboard has appeared.

545
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,750
We are Bai Xiaosheng's chesspieces now.

546
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,850
All the releasing of skills should focus on attacking Bai Xiaosheng.

547
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:50,590
Watch your position. I'll play the role of black chesspiece.

548
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:52,970
Young Master and I will play the role of white chesspieces.

549
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,050
I'm behind you. Don't worry.

550
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:14,930
[Bai]

551
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,600
[Bai]

552
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,080
Chu He, don't be absent-minded.

553
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,630
The three of us have to play the chess while releasing skills.

554
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,140
And the game will get harder.

555
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,780
We'll be wiped out if we don't pay attention.

556
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,280
I'll cheer for you.

557
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,420
Hang in there.

558
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,780
When the nanny is weak,

559
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,080
don't force yourself to fight with Kui Cow.

560
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,370
Yes, I admit that I'm weak.

561
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,330
And there's a whistle player.

562
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,860
He is the mastermind.

563
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,240
The shepherd boy will manipulate Kui Cow with the sound of the flute.

564
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,870
We can only pass this level after we defeat the shepherd boy.

565
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,060
When he starts playing the flute,

566
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,090
he's going to release his skill.

567
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,190
What skill?

568
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,220
Meteorite attack! Hide yourself!

569
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,880
Why are there so many meteorites?

570
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:35,670
How can I avoid them?

571
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:41,820
So big.

572
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:43,670
How can I fight with it? I feel so confused.

573
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,630
Good luck to you guys.

574
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,810
I'll deal with the shepherd boy. You two attack Kui Cow.

575
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,750
Young Master, be careful.

576
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,700
Thanks.

577
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,210
What skill is this? Is it Burning Fury?

578
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:39,950
It's almost finished, huh?

579
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,370
Are you awake, Chu He?

580
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:47,000
It's just a tactical faint.

581
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,570
You know me well, Genius.

582
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,950
The magic sound will cause continuous damage.

583
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,400
It's best to avoid the attack range of the skill.

584
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:01,270
Why am I targeted again?

585
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:03,230
It just attacks whoever is weak? It's unfair to target me.

586
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,940
She always makes others worry.

587
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,270
The cow is targeting me. I have no choice.

588
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,860
I'm exhausted.

589
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,010
Ink White.

590
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,620
I won't interfere if you want to save her.

591
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,350
I'll just watch you torture the single men.

592
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,550
Be careful. It is coming again.

593
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,630
Thank you for earlier.

594
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,800
Congratulations to the players Between Ink White,

595
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:19,400
[Announcement: Congratulations to the players Between Ink White, Three swordsmanship of Tai Bai, Young Master of the Tang Sect and Chu He]

on the victory in the Thousands Snow Cave

600
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,330
with a new record of two minutes and four seconds.

601
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,640
Unbelievable.

602
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:23,150
They broke the record even with a bad player like me.

603
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,270
I think all the players of the sever will be shocked again.

604
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,030
However,

605
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,530
how can I make the Genius stop being angry with me?

606
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,160
I'm waiting online. It's urgent.

607
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,090
I have something to do.

608
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:33,930
I have to log out now.

609
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:34,850
What's the matter?

610
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,290
I'll have a basketball match later.

611
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,550
I almost forgot it if you hadn't not mentioned it.

612
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,980
I'll go to you after I get changed.

613
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,640
You two know each other?

614
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,350
Yes.

615
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,580
Ink White and Three Swordsmanship know each other.

616
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:43,660
Only the two of us don't know each other.

617
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,320
Chu He, let's hug each other for get warmth.

618
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,430
I won't hug you.

619
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:47,800
I'm also going to watch a basketball match later.

620
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,140
Never judge a person by his appearance.

621
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,390
Chu He, is your height 180 cm or so?

622
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:51,590
Go away.

623
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,750
I'm going to watch the match for the sake of my idol.

624
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,490
Who is your idol?

625
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,190
Han Jingmo.

626
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,390
It's funny.

627
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,000
What's wrong?

628
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,650
Is it funny to like Han Jingmo?

629
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,100
Of course.

630
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,880
Do you like Gu Qiaobei?

631
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,000
Yes I do. He is very handsome.

632
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,760
Right? I think so, too.

633
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,660
How shallow.

634
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,020
But I still like Han Jingmo more.

Great!

653

Do you think I would

654
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,300
get his attention by doing this?

655
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,050
Would I?

656
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,450
It'll be lucky if they don't blame you for hurting others.

657

658

the cola back to me later?

00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,140
Keep a low profile.
