00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,750
Mr. Lu.

349
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,650
How's the negotiation about the salary?

350
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:27,730
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

351
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,860
Mr. Lu, I'm sorry.

352
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,700
I want to talk to my boss alone.

353
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,060
Qiaobei,

354
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,940
I have something to discuss with Mr. Lu.

355
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,740
After we're done,

356
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:41,490
I'll find you.

357
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,140
No.

358
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,620
What I want to say is very important.

359
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,300
Qiaobei.

360
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:47,820
Okay.

361
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,580
In that case,

362
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,720
I'll say it here.

363
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,250
I

364
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,000
decided to quit the shoot of Big Dunk.

365
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,470
What did you say?

366
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,140
The setting of Big Dunk now

367
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,930
is too low.

368
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,460
And I heard that we have to film another month.

369
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,300
This

370
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,820
conflicts with

371
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,860
my next variety show.

372
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,020
I don't want to give up on the variety show later on.

373
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,580
So,

374
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,860
I decided to terminate the contract with Big Dunk.

375
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,570
Qiao.

376
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,300
Are you sure?

377
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,000
Mr. Lu,

378
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:22,930
I've made up my mind.

379
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,500
Please grant my wish.

380
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,880
Enough.

381
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:30,850
Let's talk

382
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:32,120
back at the office.

383
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,310
No need.

384
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,690
I've said everything.

385
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:36,660
Qiaobei.

386
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,540
Qiaobei.

387
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,180
Mr. Mu.

388
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,370
It seems that you and your artist

389
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,200
haven't reached a consensus.

390
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:49,460
Why don't you go back and think about it?

391
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,100
We will

392
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,870
look for new male artists.

393
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,200
What do you think?

394
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,600
Actually,

395
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,030
there's no big difference

396
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,230
in changing one role or two roles for us.

397
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,240
As for Gu Qiaobei's unilateral breach of contract,

398
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,380
the penalty...

399
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,340
Mr. Lu,

400
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:14,060
Li Weiqian has brought

401
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,590
a lot of trouble to the crew.

402
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,980
Mr. Lu, stop distracting yourself

403
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,130
for us.

404
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:20,620
Don't worry.

405
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,540
I will persuade Qiaobei

406
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,070
and bring him back.

407
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,830
The pay...

408
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:29,270
After all,

409
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,950
Qiaobei and I still need your support

410
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,790
in various aspects.

411
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,510
As for the pay,

412
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,930
it can be as before.

413
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,000
Okay.

414
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,050
I'll do as you say.

415
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,630
Here, have some coffee.

416
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,980
The evidence is out.

417
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,520
Li Weiqian's fans still came to scold me.

418
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,110
[Lu Wanwan]

419
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,110
[Li Weiqian]

420
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,270
I'll scold you to death with my secret account.

421
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,670
Wanwan. Wanwan.

422
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,420
Wanwan.

423
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,460
Are you busy shooting today?

424
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,740
Not really.

425
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,260
Wanwan.

426
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,520
I was wrong.

427
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,550
I shouldn't have said that.

428
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,650
I shouldn't have thought about you like that either.

429
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,180
The leading actress is really good at acting.

430
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,790
I was careless.

431
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,930
I shouldn't have pretended to fall

432
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,930
and made people misunderstand you.

433
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,530
Now I know I was wrong.

434
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:36,050
Can you help me beg them

435
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,040
to not kick me out of the crew.

436
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,210
I really need this role.

437
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,320
So

438
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:45,290
you admit the video is real?

439
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,380
You also admit that you pretended to fall?

440
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,230
Yes.

441
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,330
I admit what I did.

442
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,060
You're really great.

443
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,640
So when you showed up,

444
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,250
I then had a sense of crisis.

445
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,090
But I know I was wrong.

446
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,290
I shouldn't have hurt you.

447
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,760
Please.

448
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,190
Please give me another chance.

449
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,470
I will change.

450
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:13,900
No.

451
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,750
It's useless to beg me.

452
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,650
It wasn't me who

453
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,470
forced you out of the crew.

454
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,870
I don't have the ability.

455
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,500
I really don't know.

456
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,700
I know you can't forgive me

457
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,980
for the time being.

458
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,870
But I know I was wrong.

459
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,400
Please give me another chance.

460
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,000
You...

461
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:37,840
Stop begging me.

462
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,460
Really.

463
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,750
It's useless to beg me.

464
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,610
I really don't know anything.

465
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,230
Right.

466
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:46,810
Then who did it?

467
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,210
I don't ask you for anything else.

468
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,130
I'm begging you

469
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:53,500
to publish a clarification

470
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:57,060
and turn the situation back?

471
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,080
Qian.

472
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,210
You've already caused damage to the reputation

473
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,300
of Lu Wanwan.

474
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,500
I'm warning you.

475
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,600
Please delete the false information immediately.

476
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,970
Otherwise Ying Ge

477
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,830
will hold you legally liable.

478
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,090
Let me tell you.

479
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,400
On Lu Wanwan's case,

480
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,020
Ying Ge will never give in.

481
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,800
Brother.

482
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,990
Thank you for helping me, Brother.

483
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:57,340
You're really my biological brother.

484
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:00,060
No matter how much I want to stand up for you,

485
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,840
I can't handle

486
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,510
such a big thing alone.

487
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:07,030
Didn't you post the video online?

488
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,560
Didn't you force Li Weiqian out of the crew?

489
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,230
I got her replaced

490
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,670
because the influence

491
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,890
is too huge and bad.

492
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,060
You know what?

493
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,320
Someone has started to boycott the crew.

494
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,250
Who is it?

495
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,410
He saved my life.

496
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,310
Think about it with your unintelligent brain.

497
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,480
Could it be

498
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,180
Li Weiqian's fans took photos secretly

499
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,890
and felt guilty afterwards?

500
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,830
Then who forced her out of the crew?

501
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:39,860
Yes.

502
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,470
Who could it be?

503
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,850
You're acting weird. jpg.

I'll find him.

you paid and worked hard as her bodyguard.

515
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,570
Why can't she think of you?

516
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,340
Well...

517
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,530

Don't touch my head.

520
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:31,710
I can't pet you?

521
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:32,970
Of course not.

522
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,350
If I ask you,

523
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,580
can I touch your hair?

524
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,380
You don't want it either, right?

525
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,030
Sure.

526
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,100
Come on, touch it.

527
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,710
I'll get ready.

528
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:48,450
If you want to touch my head,

529
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:50,120
come to me anytime.

530

[Jinling]

531
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,490
Be careful.

532
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,050
I told you long ago

533
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,880
men shouldn't

534
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,390
be too indecisive.

535
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:31,710
I'm sorry.

536
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,140
I almost hit you just now.

537
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,960
That's not how you play the ball.

538
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,820
This is awesome.

539
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:45,780
I...

540
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,730
Which department are you from?

541
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,020
Hello, Director.

542
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,070
I'm her bodyguard.

543
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:58,270
Being a bodyguard is a waste of your talent.

544
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,610
You have such good conditions

545
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:00,360
and are good at basketball.

546
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,120
Our play

547
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,510
is about basketball.

548
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:03,440
I'll arrange a role for you

549
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,170
if there's an appropriate one.

550
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,670
He was praised,

551
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,970
why are you so happy?

552
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,690
Of course.

553
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,830
Isn't him being praised the same as me being praised?

554
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,200
Piece of cake.

555
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,360
Compared to your appearance,

556
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,490
he's a bit inferior.

557
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,490
But it's not much different.

558
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:24,990
Look.

559
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:27,500
Even a strict person like Director Zheng

560
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,390
can compliment him like this.

561
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,970
He must be really good.

562
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:33,080
I was praised too.

563
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:34,480
And

564
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:37,220
many times.

565
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,750
Okay, you're the best.

566
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,340
Do you want a red flower?

567
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,880
I can also give you this award.

568
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,670
Han Jingmo, be good.

569
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,300
Stop looking.

570

No.

571
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,260
I really need to be a scout for Mr. Lu.

572
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,360
I think he's really a promising actor.

573
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,660
-What star scout? -Let me take a look.

574
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,340
Stop looking.

575
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:03,840
Let me see.

576
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,810
-Stop looking. -Let me see.

577
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:06,670
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

578
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,650
Yes, I am.

Coming. Coming.

What's going on?

582
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,410
I'll take care

583
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,910
of the meal.

584
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,060
I wanted to use my face.

585
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,620
and ask the chef to give me one more portion of ribs.

586
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,480
We have sweet and sour ribs today.

587
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,460
Do you still have the consciousness to be an actress?

588
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,170
I want to send it to Han Jingmo.

589
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,660
Today, I don't know how I upset

590
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,800
your master today.

591
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,620
Why is he so childish

592
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:48,900
and angry all the time?

593
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,070
No way.

594
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,310
Why would he help you if he was angry?

595
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,850
Help me? For what?

596
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,140
The video

597
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,570
was uploaded online by Hanhan.

598
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:01,270
Otherwise, how could it spread so fast?

599
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,420
Don't you know?

600
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,290
I don't know. How would I know?

601
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:11,200
I overheard it too.

602
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,230
This is bad.

603
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,460
Have you heard about the story of the farmer and the snake?

604
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,290
Let me tell you.

605
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,800
I'm the snake now.

606
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,250
I even called the farmer crazy.

607
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,980
No wonder he was so angry today.

608
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:25,700
-What? -So it is not him who is crazy, it is me.

609
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,950
What farmer? What snake?

610
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:29,600

611
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:30,960
No.

612

Could it be that

616

Han Jingmo likes me?

Han Jingmo sent the video of the fake fall.

have feelings for you?

What do you mean?

635
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:15,590

Now you remind me late, you know?

I have to apologize to him first

639
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,639
and then thank him, right?

640
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:25,730
Apologize?

641
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,400
What did you do this time?

642
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,409
How about

and making him the best actor?

645
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:40,550
Even if I give him a good script

646
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,739
and make him the best actor,

647
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:44,150
does it even relate to whether you apologize to him or not?

648
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,650

You look so clean and cool today.

658

It's just a glance that makes me fall for you.

Well...

It looks the same at first glance,

00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,610
but if you look closely, it's quite different.

until I met you.

I was born to worship you.

00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,980
Let me remove the microphone for you.

695
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,400
Change the battery.

696
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:39,650
Okay.

697
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:40,780
I'll go get the food.

698
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:41,340
Here.

699
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:43,450
Thank you.

700
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,380
You're welcome.

701
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,800
Han Jingmo.

702
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,600
What's up?

703
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:07,100
Didn't I say I would come back to you?

704
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,790
Well...

705
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,160
I want to apologize to you.

706
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,980
I spoke without thinking.

707
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:21,500
I shouldn't have said you're crazy.

708
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,460
I'm just...

709
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:28,880
sometimes

710
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,140
I speak faster than I can think.

711
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,370
I'm just inconsiderate.

712
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,700
I was not saying you're crazy.

713
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,410
How could I insult you like this?

714
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:37,890
That's not what I meant.

715
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:38,510
What?

716
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,690
Do you want to get emotional

717
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:41,470
and cry?

718
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,570
No, I...

719
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,190
How could I do?

720
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,710
I didn't mean that.

721
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,160
I... I really want to thank you.

722
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,500
You saved my life.

723
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,190
Wanwan.

724
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,690
A gift from someone

725
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,380
needs your signature.

726
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,740
Wait for me.

727
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,140
What is it? Why is it delivered to the set?

728
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,410
Is this a supermarket?

729
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:08,530
Other fans give roses.

730
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,550
Your fans send melon fruit and vegetables.

731
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,700
They're sincere.

732
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:14,940
Here's a card.

733
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,010
I wanted to send it to your house.

734
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,190
[I wanted to send it to your house. But I don't know where you live.

735
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,190
[Natural and environmental. You can share them with your friends and take the rest home.

736
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,190
[Your little fan Han Xixing]

737
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,480
But I don't know where you live.

738
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,600
Natural and environmental.

739
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,980
You can share them with your friends

740
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,790
and take the rest home.

741
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,230
Your little fan,

742
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,670
Han Xixing.

743
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,160
Look.

744
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,950
Who gave it to me?

745
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,080
It's not for you. It's for me.

746
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:48,330
I'll always be grateful to you.

747
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:57,880
Thank you for helping me in Li Weiqian's case.

748
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,960
If you need any help in the future,

749
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:02,930
just let me know.

750
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,240
I'll help you if I can.

751
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,230
I'll do anything.

752
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,870
I wouldn't say no for sure.

753
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:08,360
Yes.

754
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:10,200
You would say

755
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,180
you would not do anything extreme.

756
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,580
How do you know me so well?

757
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,210
No.

758
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,430
I really want to thank you.

759
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,450
Anyway, if you need any help in the future,

760
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:22,640
I will help you.

761
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:26,790
But

762
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,480
I can't do anything against ethics.

763
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,520
Against ethics?

764
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,180
What are you thinking? What are you thinking?

765
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,140
I'm thinking

766
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,420
what you said

767
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,180
is a way to repay my kindness.

768
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:45,890
How dare you!

769
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,560
How dare a scoundrel harm me?

770
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,790
You're so scared that even an outdated joke came out.

771
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,550
How could I be scared by you?

772
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,210
I've seen all kinds of things.

773
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,490
I see.

774
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,710
Then tell me

775
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,230
how will you repay me?

776
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:11,780
Han Jingmo.

777
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,680
I didn't expect you to be such a person.

778
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,050
You let me down, don't you know?

779
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:40,980
Why are you sighing?

780
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,680
Are you a spiteful woman?

781
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:48,130
Boss, give me the same one as hers.

782
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,570
This lady

783
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,080
wants only half a bowl of wonton.

784
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,180
No oil or salt in the soup.

785
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,790
Same as hers. Thank you.

786
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,600
Okay.

787
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:03,920
Aren't you on a diet?

788
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,020
Why are you here for wontons?

789
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,600
Don't tell me it's a coincidence.

790
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,160
We've been shooting night scenes.

791
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,890
I've been waiting for too long,

792
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,710
so I came out for some fresh air.

793
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,910
It took me a long time to find this place.

794
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:17,320
What a coincidence.

795
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:20,560
Are you sure you weren't following me?

796
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,950
Why should I follow you?

797
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,140
Let me tell you.

798
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,610
Don't think about things you shouldn't think about.

799
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:40,380
The sea of bitterness is boundless. It's time to turn back.

800
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,220
Sir, your wonton.

801
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:44,930
Thank you.

802
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,140
Actually,

803
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,860
you've helped a lot,

804
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,530
I should've repaid you.

805
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:57,030
You are so handsome

806
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,660
and have a good figure.

807
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,220
Actually, I won't lose anything.

808
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,080
But

809
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,980
I can't get through my conscience.

810
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,510
I don't want to stain you.

811
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,000
Stain?

812
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:14,730
Yes.

813
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:20,140
You are the pure white flower on the snow mountain.

814
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:21,800
I am the snow water with dirty

815
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,620
at the foot of the snow mountain.

816
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:25,890
You are the bright moon by the sky

817
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,360
I am the dirty ditch on the ground.

818
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:30,780
You are the fragrant swan.

819
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,300
I'm just an ugly frog.

820
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,930
I dare not even think about it.

821
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:36,840
Enough.

822
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,040
I was just kidding.

823
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,640
I want to say one last thing.

824
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,180
Say it.

825
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:43,670
I know.

826
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:46,440
You are trying to test

827
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:48,310
if I could be tempted by fame and fortune,

828
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:48,820
right?

829
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:49,660
No.

830
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,550
I just wanted to fool you.

831
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,030
Sit there.

832
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,270
If I tell Lu Guanghan,

833
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,180
he'll block you right away and make you

834
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:01,110
unpopular at all. Do you know that?

835
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:01,850
Really?

836
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,760
Are you scared?

837
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:06,100
I'm so scared.

838
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,310
I want to break up with you for 20 years.

839
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:08,910
Bye.

840
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,740
Wait.

841
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,220
No more joking.

842
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,280
I want to tell you

843
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:21,830
it's not only me

844
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,860
who helped you in Li Weiqian's case.

845
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,770
Zhao Jinghang also helped.

846
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:31,510
Li Weiqian dared to bully Wanwan.

847
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,330
She must pay the price.

848
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:35,300
The most important thing for being a human being

849
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:37,350
is to be straightforward.

850
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:39,830
The biggest taboo is being indecisive.

851
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,800
In the end,

852
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:44,440
you can't even protect the person you love.

853
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,130
I see.

854
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:51,550
But why didn't Lu Guanghan tell me?

855
00:44:52,050 --> 00:44:54,510
Never mind. As long as the truth is revealed.

856
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,310
Are you going

857
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:57,730
to repay his kindness?

858
00:44:58,290 --> 00:44:59,770
He's a gentleman.

859
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:00,780
Yes.

860
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,540
I am the only one who has a purpose.

861
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,190
I don't like you.

862
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:09,420
You don't like me either.

863
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,330
Don't be blinded by the hormone.

864
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:13,300
Be rational.

865
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:15,720
You don't like me?

866
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,280
Of course.

867
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,070
What if one day

868
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,440
you suddenly like me?

869
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:24,520
Impossible.

870
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:26,450
You

871
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:27,970
are so mean

872
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,280
and cunning.

873
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,200
You have good look but evil soul.

874
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,890
There are all shortcomings.

875
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:35,090
-You know me well. -Well…

876
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:45,830
I'm not a kid. I know.

877
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:47,380
Okay, I...

878
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:48,950
I'll send you the location.

879
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:59,310
This bodyguard is so good.

880
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:01,530
He insisted on taking me back to the set.

881
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:19,550
Then, let me walk you out.

882
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:36,910
When you get to the set, remember...
