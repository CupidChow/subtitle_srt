Lu Wanwan.

5
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,910
Are you still sleeping, Lu Wanwan?

6
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,630
Get up.

7
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:42,950
Lu Wanwan.

8
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,780
Get up quickly.

9
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,110
What are you doing?

10
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:49,539
Why are you sleeping in?

11
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,330
What are you doing?

12
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,470
I couldn't fall asleep last night.

13
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,420
I stayed up all night.

14
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,259
My dark circles are very serious.

15
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:57,240
Dark circles?

16
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,370
Did you play games all night long?

17
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,820
I was busy with my paper.

18
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,990
You'd better be.

19
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,560
Check your phone.

20
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,790
Lin Wei has been looking for you all morning.

21
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,850
You didn't answer the phone, did you?

22
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,759
What's the matter? So many messages.

23
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,910
Lin Wei picked out several plays for you.

24
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,110
Get up and go to the company.

25
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,230
Discuss with her

26
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,710
to see which play you're going to shoot next.

27
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,320
Really?

28
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,300

00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:25,160
Yes.

38

Stop playing with me.

39

Hurry up. I'm going to work.

40
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,480
No more attacks.

41
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,840
Slow down.

42
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,270
Are you

43
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,850
still angry?

44
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,640
Am I that petty?

45
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:11,240
I knew you love me the most.

46
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,190
I know.

47
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,140
You want to make a name

48
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,840
in the entertainment industry on your own.

49
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,350
You also have the ability.

50
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,670
So I thought about it.

51
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,610
As for your brother,

52
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,670
you can hide our relationship from him at present.

53
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,480
I give you the right to make it public.

54
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,090
I concealed my identity as your assistant...

55
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,280
I was joking.

56
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,110
This is the company.

57
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,210
Go ahead.

58
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:45,950
Lin Wei is waiting for you.

59
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,880
I'll go then.

60
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,820
OK.

61
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:49,950
Bye.

62
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,050
Bye.

63
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:51,430
Bye.

64
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,470
Don't be angry.

65
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,660
Miss Wei.

66
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:02,600
You're here.

67
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,050
Let's sit over there.

The director is Gu Xici.

72
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,680
The battle between the top detective Lin Yu

73
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,620
and the criminal organization,

74
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,700
which led to a series of...

75
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,310
Your role is Su Ran.

76
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,870
The boss of the criminal organization.

77
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,680
You're asked to disguise as blind to approach the male lead

78
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,500
as a spy.

79
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,030
A series of conflicts will be caused by this.

80
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:40,800
A blind one?

81
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,470
Yes.

82
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,190
This is the hardest part.

83
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,130
There's a kissing scene.

84
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,060
Can't you do it?

85
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:55,930
Not really.

86
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,630
As your agent,

87
00:04:59,659 --> 00:05:01,190
I suggest you take the role.

88
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,900
The script and lineup are all good.

89
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,730
It can also show your acting skill.

90
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,960
To be honest, I think this movie

91
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,020
may win an award.

92
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,380
You can go to the director for an audition.

93
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,200
Okay.

94
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,310
There are two more plays.

95
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,530
One is modern trendy drama,

96
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,360
and the other is a historical immortal drama.

97
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,320
As for these two dramas,

98
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,260
the advantage is compared with the movie,

99
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,930
they are a bit easier.

100
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,130
I know.

101
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,680
But Gu Qiaobei's performance is professional.

102
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,000
You'll know when you see his Big Dunk.

103
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,220
Less plays doesn't mean he's incompetent.

104
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,690
If you have doubts about his performance,

105
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,620
you can let him attend the audition.

106
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,340
Right?

107
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,020
Let him attend the audition.

108
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,600
Gu Qiaobei again?

109
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,330
I believe he won't let you down.

110
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:39,180
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,360
Hold on for a moment.

112
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,010
What?

113
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,350
I just came out from Wei's office.

114
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,120
She gave me three scripts to choose from.

115
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:46,600
But

116
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,830
I do prefer the

117
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,940
Tit-for-tat.

118
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,210
But there's one thing.

119
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,830
There's a kissing scene in it.

120
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,300
Then kissing scene...

121
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,630
Just follow your heart.

122
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,490
I'm busy.

123
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,070
I want some advice from you.

124
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,550
Hello?

125
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,020
Mr. Du, where were we?

126
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:58,670
Yes.

127
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,970
Let him attend the audition.

128
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,630
I'm sure you'll be satisfied.

129
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,890
Just trust me.

130
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:03,840
OK?

131
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,880
Our sibling relationship is over.

132
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,110
Okay, no problem.

133
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,620
It's a deal.

134
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:13,930
Okay.

135
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,380
Good.

136
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,920
That's great.

137
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,800
This character is pretty good.

138
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,020
Well,

139
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,170
there's a kissing scene.

140
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,460
What's wrong with it?

141
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,350
Kiss scenes are great.

142
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,110
You're a pro, Wanwan.

143
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,440
Accept it.

144
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,800
But don't tell Wolf.

145
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,890
He's a Scorpio. He holds grudges.

146
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,670
Actually, I really like this role very much.

147
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,409
But there's a kissing scene.

148
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,350
You can accept this job.

149
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,130
But don't tell Han Jingmo.

150
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,590
Actually, I think this role

151
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,310
will do good to my acting experience.

152
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:07,260
But what about the kissing scene?

153
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,610
Accept it.

154
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,790
I support you.

155
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,160
But don't tell Han yet.

156
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,710
Just do it if you want.

157
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:20,100
Forget it if you don't want to.

158
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,920
I'm busy.

159
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,260
It seems I have to rely on my brother.

160
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,100
Miss Wei,

161
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,030
I've made up my mind.

162
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,570
Wanwan.

163
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,810
Wanwan.

164
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,040
What the hell?

165
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,400
Wanwan.

166
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,090
You wanna murder your own sister?

167
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,080
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,240
Take your hand away.

169
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,610
Ouch!

170
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,570
Why didn't you answer me when I called your name?

171
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,710
Who can see you in the dark?

172
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,409
I thought it was a thief.

173
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:40,880
Is there the third one

174
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,510
living here?

175
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:44,950
You're right.

176
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,210
Look.

177
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,450
What is this?

178
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,970
It's so noise and scary.

179
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,550
You're illiterate. Don't you know what this is?

180
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,010
It's called a blind stick.

181
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,470
I've told Wei

182
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,800
that I'd choose the character

183
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,260
who pretended to be blind.

184
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,380
I was trying to get the feeling of blindness

185
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,060
by imitating the blind.

186
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,840
I was try to get the feeling.

187
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,970
You've messed up my pace. So annoying.

188
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,390
As your sponsor, I'm very pleased.

189
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,270
I'll leave the stage to you.

190
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,470
Excuse me.

191
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
Do you want me to turn off the lights?

192
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,250
Hurry up and go.

193
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:19,230
I'll practice.

194
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:20,920
Yes.

195
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,660
Good luck.

196
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,870
Practice hard.

197
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,710
I have faith in you.

198
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,560
A sneak attack.

199
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,190
Hit you.

200
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,430
Between Ink White,

201
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,910
who are you?

202
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,150
Watch out! Take my sword!

203
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,300
Between Ink White,

204
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,330
I'm gonna beat you with my stick!

205
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:06,780
Stop.

206
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,320
Let me help you.

207
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,090
Thank you.

208
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,110
Be careful.

209
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,050
Be careful.

210
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,700
Actually, I...

211
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
Lu Guanghan.

212
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,630
I'll kill you!

213
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,330
I'll kill you!

214
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:02,770
What's wrong?

215
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,900
Is it because of the audition?

216
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,180
I think my performance is not that natural.

217
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,880
I feel that it's less realistic.

218
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,740
Take your time.

219
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,620
Don't worry.

220
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,100
Why are your hands so cold?

221
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,310
I'm too nervous

222
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,800
about seeing Director Gu.

223
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,740
And my shooting of Big Dunk

224
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,440
didn't go that smoothly.

225
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,950
The role is more complicated this time.

226
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:28,320
And the director is even more strict.

227
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,780
I'm afraid I can't make it.

228
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,900
Although I've gained some acting experience through the Big Dunk,

229
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,050
I still want to practice my acting skills

230
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,550
and learn from other outstanding actors.

231
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,880
Hope I can find my best performance state.

232
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,610
Let me take you to a place.

233
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,210
Let's go.

234
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,060
Okay, let's get started.

235
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,880
Are you ready?

236
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,790
OK.

237
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,750
Okay. Ready. Action.

238
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,350
Stop, stop, stop.

239
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:14,200
Director Gu,

240
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,120
let me help her with it.

241
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,910
It's a bit difficult

242
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,670
to act alone.

243
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,230
Okay, go ahead.

244
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:21,890
OK.

245
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,230
One more time.

246
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,090
OK. One more time.

247
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,190
Jingmo, tell me when you're ready.

248
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,730
OK.

249
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,770
Relax. Don't be nervous.

250
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:35,680
Are you ready?

251
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,360
OK. Come on.

252
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,220
Let's get ready for the audition.

253
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:45,890
Action.

254
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,650
Coffee.

255
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:28,280
Okay, stop.

256
00:14:28,850 --> 00:14:30,150
Okay, that's enough.

257
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:38,320
Have you seen Al Pacino?

258
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:39,470
Yes.

259
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,040
I watched Al Parsino's

260
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,750
performance in Scent of a Woman.

261
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,140
His performance was excellent.

262
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,770
So I learned from him.

263
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:46,830
Good.

264
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,710
There's a detail in that movie.

265
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,550
Before he tapped the ash,

266
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,720
he used his little finger to locate the ashtray

267
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,480
first.

268
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,140
But this detail didn't get the close-up.

269
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,830
You can notice it.

270
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,110
It means you've watched it very carefully.

271
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:58,710
Not bad.

272
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,330
You didn't determine if it's full

273
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,960
by the sound of the pouring water,

274
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,070
but to measure the water temperature

275
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,750
from the top of the mug.

276
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,500
This detail is wonderful.

277
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,250
Not bad.

278
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,990
Thank you, Director.

279
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,110
You went to a school for the blind as well?

280
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,580
Yes.

281
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,860
I did observe them there.

282
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,650
But I didn't stay there for a long time.

283
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:16,030
But in the future,

284
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,870
I will observe and learn more.

285
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,560
Look.

286
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,030
The real blind peaple can't see.

287
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,300
So they don't usually fill the cups up.

288
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,380
Neither did you.

289
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,130
Good observation.

290
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:26,910
Good.

291
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,920
Pleasant cooperation.

292
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,110
Thank you, Director.

293
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,660
I am looking forward to working with you.

294
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,250
Jingmo.

295
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,430
I'm looking forward to working with you.

296
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,560
Happy cooperation.

297
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:38,630
Jingmo.

298
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,240
Didn't he tell you?

299
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,700
This is the leading actor in this movie.

300
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,810
Everyone can see that

301
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:51,420
Lu Guanghan likes Qiaobei.

302
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,450
Look.

303
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,290
He's given him resurces over and over again.

304
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,070
We can take these to

305
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,340
cultivate more artists

306
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,600
to strengthen our strength.

307
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,080
Although

308
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,130
I call him Mr. Lu,

309
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,710
actually in my eyes,

310
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,550
Lu Guanghan is a fool.

311
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,370
He used his resources to support an outsider.

312
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,490
Is he out of his mind?

313
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,590
Why isn't Qiaobei here yet?

314
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,370
I'll go take a look.

315
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,890
Lu Wanwan completed the audition successfully.

316
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,350
She's really something.

317
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,710
She can even manage to get the role of Director Gu.

318
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,770
It's not easy.

319
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,430
But Mr. Lu,

320
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,160
Gu Qiaobei hasn't come to the audition yet.

321
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,340
You asked me to keep an eye on him.

322
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,270
Now it's his turn for the audition.

323
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,430
What happened?

324
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:51,440
Where is he?

325
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:58,670
Sir.

326
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,100
Mr. Gu, if you...

327
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,800
Mr. Gu.

328
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,330
Mr. Gu, you can't go in now.

329
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,420
Mr. Gu.

330
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:16,750
Dismiss.

331
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,829
Gu Qiaobei is such a big shot.

332
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,369
Qiao, what happened?

333
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,920
What happened?

334
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,020
Listen, Lu Guanghan.

335
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,690
You kept giving me resources,

336
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,980
you'll only become a laughing stock of others.

337
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,980
Please stay out of my business.

338
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,890
I don't mean to interfere.

339
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,800
I won't take part in the Tit-for-tat.

340
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,460
I won't attend the audition too.

341
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,620
Because I know

342
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,920
you gave it to me secretly.

343
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,000
I don't need it.

344
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,110
Qiao,

345
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,190
you misunderstood.

346
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,550
If you don't like it, you don't have to join.

347
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,010
I just think those opportunities are perfect for you.

348
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,000
Lu Guanghan,
