00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,630
Grandpa is worried.

350
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,520
I don't think I'm the one who should hurry up.

351
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,840
Wei,

352
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,310
remember to bring your Mr. Right home

353
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,030
to meet me.

354
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,180
I'll bring him to you sooner or later.

355
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,530
Okay, you must take care of yourself.

356
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,740
No problem. Don't worry.

357
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,620
I have to go.

358
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,230
Okay.

359
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,340
Bye.

360
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:33,940
Bye, Yiwei.

361
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,060
Take care.

362
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:41,660
Wanwan.

363
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,360
It's late.

364
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,910
This brat and you both drank.

365
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,730
Just stay here tonight.

366
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,540
No, Grandpa.

367
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,700
I could have left

368
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,380
with Yiwei,

369
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,160
but she had to go on a business trip.

370
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,190
She's busy with work.

371
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,470
What are you busy with?

372
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,930
Jingmo told me

373
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,570
you have no work tomorrow.

374
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,780
Just stay here for a night.

375
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,910
Have a good rest.

376
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,980
Thank you, Grandpa.

377
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,260
It's okay.

378
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,720
Make yourself at home.

379
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,920
Thank you.

380
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,860
Don't mention it.

381
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,700
Come on.

382
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,240
It's nothing.

383
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:23,700
Jingmo.

384
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,500
Today's birthday is the happiest one for me

385
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:29,090
because Wanwan is here.

386
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,890
My pleasure, Grandpa.

387
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:32,690
Come on.

388
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,890
This is the room I prepared for you two.

389
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:44,880
Those are Jingmo's old staff from his childhood.

390
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,570
And this.

391
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,860
Someone has sent this to him

392
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,220
since childhood.

393
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,660
It's over.

394
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,030
It's all in the past.

395
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,130
If you need anything else,

396
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,890
just tell Jingmo.

397
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,170
Okay, Grandpa.

398
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,180
I'm sleepy.

399
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,440
I drank too much today.

400
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,819
Okay, you guys continue.

401
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,980
Good night.

402
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:10,900
Okay.

403
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,400
Happy birthday, Grandpa.

404
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:14,020
Happy birthday.

405
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:14,740
I'm happy.

406
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,569
I'm happy.

407
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,930
Go to bed.

408
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:19,849
Good night.

409
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,410
Is there anything else you need?

410
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,290
Nothing.

411
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,070
I'm going back to sleep.

412
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,780
Go.

413
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,350
This door...

414
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,120
What's wrong?

415
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,180
Did you lock the door?

416
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,180
Not me.

417
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,820
Ask grandpa to come back

418
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,030
and open it for us.

419
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,090
I did.

420
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,980
So what?

421
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,050
Just wait.

422
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,730
Han Jingmo.

423
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,420
You were once

424
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,110
a talented student.

425
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,010
I was born with talent.

426
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,860
Well,

427
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,250
you were also born with the popularity by girls?

428
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,880
Handsome Han,

429
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,430
meeting you is my biggest happiness.

430
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,840
Meeting you is my best time.

431
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,180
You make me feel the true meaning of life

432
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,000
and the warmth between humans.

433
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,290
You are like a warm breeze in spring,

434
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,940
blowing past the frozen lake in my heart.

435
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,820
What?

436
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,860
Can't I see it?

437
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,900
Why did you put it away?

438
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,620
You have so many secrets.

439
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,630
Why are you so talkative today?

440
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:02,480
So what?

441
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,600
Does it still hurt?

442
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,450
No.

443
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:09,610
No.

444
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,540
Then it should get well soon.

445
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,500
I won't come to massage you tomorrow.

446
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,090
Didn't you say

447
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,580
it would take a month to recover?

448
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,660
Why is it so fast?

449
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,810
The treatment needs to be changed

450
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,700
based on the actual situation.

451
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,590
How did you recover so quickly?

452
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,290
I apply this everyday, Doctor.

453
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,480
Does this have something to do with it?

454
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,850
So this is it.

455
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,000
You celebrities

456
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,270
are so resourceful.

457
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,230
It must cost a lot of money.

458
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,340
You must have really good networks for getting this.

459
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,700
He told me it is a sample.

460
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,080
Is it hard to buy?

461
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,620
It's not for sale.

462
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,040
It's only for athletes.

463
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,290
I have to go.

464
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,320
Have some rest.

465
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:55,980
OK.

466
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,340
Thank you, Doctor.

467
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,270
You're welcome.

468
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,150
What a coincidence.

469
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,820
I happen to bring a sample ointment

470
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,420
endorsed by Jingmo.

471
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,470
You can try it.

472
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:14,030
It's just an ointment.

473
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,440
Not a big deal.

474
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,800
[Qiao]

475
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,800
[Refuse] [Answer]

476
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,620
Hello, Qiao.

477
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,150
Mr. Lu.

478
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,850
You want to sign it with me?

479
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,890
Thank you for the ointment.

480
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,670
It must take you a lot of effort.

481
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,500
You knew everything?

482
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,400
It's not a big deal.

483
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,650
How come it's not a big deal?

484
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,100
The ointment

485
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,140
is only for athletes, right?

486
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,030
The doctor just told me.

487
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,770
Anyway,

488
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,190
I owe you a favour, Mr. Lu.

489
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,780
I'm flattered.

490
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,740
I treat you as my brother.

491
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,900
Brothers don't ask for anything in return.

492
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,380
Okay?

493
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:10,220
But,

494
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,980
if you really feel sorry,

495
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,300
then

496
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,420
cook

497
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,020
and treat me to another meal.

498
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,540
Okay.

499
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,910
Just kidding.

500
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:23,520
Don't take it seriously.

501
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,780
The most important thing for you now

502
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,180
is to recover

503
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,580
and then focus on shooting.

504
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,140
OK?

505
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,420
Okay, I'll leave you be.

506
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,380
Bye, Mr. Lu.

507
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,010
Bye.

508
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,490
That was close.

509
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,650
I almost got sent to hospital.

510
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,580
Why would someone

511
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,300
want to eat food cooked by me?

512
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:50,860
It seems that

513
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,060
the sweet and sour ribs I cooked last time was pretty good.

514
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,510
Why hasn't grandpa come to open the door yet?

515
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,250
Jingmo.

516
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,270
Is that grandpa?

517
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,940
Grandpa.

518
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,090
Jingmo.

519
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,940
The key broke off in the lock.

520
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,090
Wanwan, don't worry.

521
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,700
I'll find the locksmith.

522
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,900
I'll ask the locksmith to open the door.

523
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:26,880
No hurry.

524
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,660
Hello?

525
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,330
Hi, is it Wang the locksmith?

526
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,740
My key broke off in the lock.

527
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:35,810
Come over and help.

528
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,650
Please hurry up.

529
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,280
You can come tomorrow morning?

530
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,030
Okay.

531
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,410
Thank you.

532
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,950
Get up early.

533
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,060
Okay.

534
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,160
Grandpa, what...

535
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,180
What should we do?

536
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,040
Wanwan,

537
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,500
the locksmith can't come.

538
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,910
You two need to stay here tonight.

539
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,680
No.

540
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,050
You guys talk. It'll be morning soon.

541
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,580
No, grandpa. Grandpa.

542
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,100
Grandpa, don't go.

543
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,320
Save your energy, Calabash Brothers.

544
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:20,850
No, you...

545
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,440
Aren't you going to sleep on the floor?

546
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,600
I looked around.

547
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,380
There's nothing to sleep on.

548
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,080
Then I...

549
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,330
Then you...

550
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,610
I'll sleep on this side.

551
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,160
What are you waiting for? Come to bed.

552
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,790
Well, let's...

553
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,760
Wash feet later.

554
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,080
Can't you sleep?

555
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,130
I've washed my feet.

556
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,880
It's not your problem.

557
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,390
Then are you not used to this bed?

558
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,720
Why did you look at me?

559
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,510
I didn't look at you.

560
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,640
So you and Yiwei

561
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,600
are friends since childhood.

562
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,890
You seem to be close.

563
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,240
What makes you think so?

564
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:05,850
Well...

565
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:09,130
I think you are similar to my brother and me.

566
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,580
We used to play around.

567
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:15,040
So this is what a good relationship is.

568
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,940
That's what family is like.

569
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,700
They play around

570
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:22,340
and have fun.

571
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,600
Isn't your family like that?

572
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,040
There are so many dishes.

573
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,430
Only for the three of us?

574
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,180
No one else.

575
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,140
It was your grandpa's birthday.

576
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,570
Your parents didn't come.

577
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,290
Maybe it's because

578
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,360
they are busy with their work.

579
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,820
But

580
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,390
it's quite normal.

581
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:57,490
It doesn't mean the blessing was not here even if they didn't come back.

582
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,230
What do you want to ask?

583
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:02,750
Nothing.

584
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,620
Nothing.

585
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:15,780
My parents divorced when I was very young.

586
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,710
My dad remarried.

587
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,570
I was brought up by my grandpa.

588
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,460
As for my mom,

589
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:27,020
she's like a stranger to me.

590
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,670
We've never been in touch.

591
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:38,510
Have you ever looked for them?

592
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,530
I looked for her

593
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,300
five years ago.

594
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,760
My presence

595
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,720
scared her.

596
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:54,850
Because at that time,

597
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,060
she had formed a new family.

598
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,960
She was worried that my presence

599
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,850
would ruin her life.

600
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,440
What's wrong with her?

601
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,560
It's all in the past.

602
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,360
I'm going to sleep.

603
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:39,790
You said you need to experience something.

604
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,880
As soon as possible.

605
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,500
Alright.

606
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,870
You're leaving so soon?

607
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,540
What a hurry.

608
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,860
I really don't want you to leave.

609
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,790
We have no choice. We're in a hurry.

610
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,580
Yes, Grandpa.

611
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,420
I'm really sorry.

612
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,460
We'll come again.

613
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,540
Because the crew

614
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,420
changed the schedule.

615
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,860
We're going to shoot at the beach for a few days.

616
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,540
Okay.

617
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,600
It's good for young people to be busy.

618
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,520
Wanwan.

619
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,400
Remember.

620
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,950
This is your home.

621
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,910
You can come whenever you want.

622
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:08,440
Okay.

623
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,420
Take good care of Wanwan.

624
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,730
Don't worry.

625
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,610
Take care of yourself, grandpa.

626
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:19,870
Drive slowly.

627
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:20,730
Let's go.

628
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:21,340
We're gonna go.

629
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:21,700
Okay.

630
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,700
Bye, Grandpa.

631
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,780
Bye, Sister.

632
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,720
Take care of yourself.

633
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,540
Hello, Yan.

634
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,340
The schedule has been changed.

635
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:36,980
What time?

636
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,780
7 o'clock in the evening, right?

637
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,230
Okay.

638
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,060
Bye.

639
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,900
If you really feel sorry,

640
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,140
then

641
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,580
cook

642
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,180
and treat me to another meal.

643
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,620
Hello.

644
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,020
Hurry up. It's freshly cooked.

645
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:37,860
Thank you.

646
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,340
Hurry up.

647
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,270
Okay, thank you.

648
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,020
Delicious.

649
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,170
It's very impressive.

650
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,950
It's very chewy, like Michelin.

651
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,310
He was so happy last time.

652
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,730
There should be no problem this time.

653
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,410
Gosh.

654
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:28,460
Qiao actually took my joke seriously

655
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,820
and cooked for me.

656
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,330
Judging from the appearance,

657
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,450
it should be fine.

658
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,140
Did you eat?

659
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,510
You ate as well?

660
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:52,900
[Crowne Plaza Hotel & Resort]

661
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:48,930
Thank you.

662
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,280
You two are here.

663
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,270
This is the new schedule.

664
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,870
The director said we'll start shooting when all people arrive.

665
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,150
Hurry up and get ready.

666
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,810
Have a good rest in the car.

667
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:07,340
Okay.

668
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,740
Why is there an extra plot in the script?

669
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,050
And there's a kissing scene?

670
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,900
The director is very satisfied

671
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,260
with your basketball scene at the stadium.

672
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,020
He said you two look like a great couple,

673
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,180
so he added this.

674
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,700
Wanwan.

675
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:29,860
You didn't lose anything from you fall.

676
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,590
Looks like I'm the one who'll suffer.

677
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,490
Did you...

678
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:39,440
It's not me this time.

679
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,260
But...

680
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:42,880
But what?

681
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,080
This time,

682
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,220
I allow you to make mistakes.

683
00:34:14,449 --> 00:34:15,670
You are in a hurry.

684
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,590
This time, I allow you to make mistakes.

685
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,100
You are such a jinx.

686
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,179
This is obviously seduction.

00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:14,670
♫We met each other in the middle of night♫

698
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:22,760
♫You had good looks and good characteristics♫

699
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,150
♫When I looked back♫

700
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:36,790
♫We were like two birds flying past each other towards different directions♫

701
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,220
You're so pretty.

702
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:40,940
Will you marry me?

703
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:42,940
Sure.

704
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:49,600
♫Once we meet in a good time♫

705
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:57,180
♫It's better than countless embracement in the world♫

706
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:03,670
♫There's no need for love to stay together every minute♫

707
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:11,840
♫We could spend our whole life in one moment♫

708
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,270
Time to get up.

709
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,620
Haven't you slept enough? Get up.

710
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,000
What kind of dirty dream did you have?

711
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,220
You're drooling.

712
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,620
I think I dreamed of you.

713
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,340
I hope

714
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,670
you didn't do anything to me in your dream.

715
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,340
Let's go.

716
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,060
Nothing.

717
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,170
Nothing at all.

718
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,930
I'm doomed.

719
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,060
I hugged him and slept with him last night.

720
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,020
Now I even had this dream.

721
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:03,300
No.

722
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,270
I can't let him know this embarrassing thing.

723
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,000
It's a dream.

724
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:06,830
It's just a dream.
