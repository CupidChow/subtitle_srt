176
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:57,880
Take a shower.

177
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,030
Hello, the CCTV on the ninth floor is all broken.

178
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,160
It's too late today.

179
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,690
I will come back tomorrow.

180
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,540
He might not be back in his room yet.

181
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,020
I'll come back later.

182
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,280
You're back.

183
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,490
It's 11 p.m. in three minutes.

184
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:37,110
I know.

185
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,370
There's one hour to go.

186
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,700
Don't you have anything to say to me?

187
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,520
Actually,

188
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,760
I have prepared a birthday gift for you.

189
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:51,210
But I'm afraid you don't like it.

190
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,600
Actually, I wanted to give it to you today.

191
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,860
But I found Yan Shengkai bought the same.

192
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,320
It was strange.

193
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,800
So...

194
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,020
No.

195
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,620
You're different from her.

196
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,320
Really?

197
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,170
How is it different? Tell me.

198
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,590
Just say my advantages.

199
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,810
Tell me. I'm all ears.

200
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,160
You are not as tall as her.

201
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:21,870
Shut up.

202
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,920
Since you've accepted the gift, just...

203
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,740
Don't feel wronged.

204
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,630
I feel wronged?

205
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:34,970
Yes.

206
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,580
You look so upset today.

207
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,740
I feel sorry for you.

208
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,190
What are you doing?

209
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,370
Don't come over.

210
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:44,540
I'm telling you, there are surveillance cameras.

211
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,340
Do you think no one will watch it?

212
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,280
The CCTV here is broken.

213
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,900
Didn't you hear it just now?

214
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,000
That's not good.

215
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,230
We can't do this

216
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,880
in this place.

217
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,880
Do you really feel sorry for me?

218
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,090
Yes.

219
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,520
I feel so bad that I'm going to take a quick heart-saving pill.

220
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,880
Why do you care about my feelings?

221
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,560
It's all because of I...

222
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,680
Because of what?

223
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,120
Because...

224
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,620
Because...

225
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,430
Because...

226
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,300
Because... because it responds to the call of the crew.

227
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,900
Because unity is strength.

228
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,020
That's why I...

229
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,490
I almost said I like you.

230
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,830
You did a live stream, celebrated your birthday and filmed today.

231
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,620
You must be tired.

232
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,610
Get some rest.

233
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,720
Do you think you can push me?

234
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,160
Or do you want to take advantage of me?

235
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,330
I didn't.

236
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,160
You pervert.

237
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,780
I'm not...

238
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,910
The cake Yan Shengkai made

239
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,340
is pretty good, right?

240
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,650
Are you sure you want to

241
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,200
discuss this with me here?

242
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:06,540
No need to discuss.

243
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,450
She looks good today

244
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,440
and she made the cake very carefully.

245
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,890
You must be very happy.

246
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,730
Unfortunately,

247
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:14,090
I don't like the flavor.

248
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,100
Yes.

249
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,180
Caramel vanilla, right?

250
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,500
My life as an assistant.

251
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,590
Caramel is gone. Is vanilla okay?

252
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,320
Let's wait in the room.

253
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,980
You've received the gift

254
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:59,540
and ate the cake.

255
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,600
Are you happy now?

256
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,690
Do I look like I'm in a bad mood?

257
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:08,350
I really want to get you a mirror

258
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:10,880
and you can look at your handsome but sad face.

259
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,390
What was it again?

260
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,290
Under the wisteria,

261
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,730
the accidental kiss with senior.

262
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,110
That was a lie.

263
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,010
I was going to say my first kiss was still there,

264
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,400
but I was fooled by the host.

265
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,340
You still have your first kiss?

266
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,660
Then what was that the day at my house?

267
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,630
That doesn't count.

268
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,920
That...that was a misunderstanding.

269
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,160
Why not?

270
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:36,050
How many times doesn't count there?

271
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:38,580
How dare you deceive the audience?

272
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,400
Aren't you the same?

273
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,570
You said it was your first time celebrating birthday

274
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,980
during the live stream.

275
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,600
Aren't you deceiving the whole country's fans?

276
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,980
Of course not.

277
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,000
Since my debut,

278
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,060
I have never celebrated my birthday.

279
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,130
I know.

280
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,340
Because

281
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,240
I was your die-hard fan.

282
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:59,610
So I know everything about you.

283
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:01,490
Was?

284
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:03,720
What?

285
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,960
Aren't you touched by what I said later?

286
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:12,310
All right.

287
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:14,580
Don't be sad on such a good day.

288
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,740
Let's not talk about those sad things.

289
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,760
No past, no harm.

290
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,540
Here, our birthday boy.

291
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,080
Let's eat a piece of cake.

292
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,900
All your worries will be gone.

293
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,450
Here.

294
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,830
Here.

295
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,720
Look at you.

296
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,710
What are you doing?

297
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,740
Nothing.

298
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,320
Then please don't be

299
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,630
up to no good to me.

300
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,310
What did I do?

301
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,370
You got a little piece of cake on you.

302
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,900
I want to wipe it off for you.

303
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,920
What are you doing?

304
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,250
Just say it.

305
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,970
Don't be so close to me always.

306
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,020
He was looking at me like that.

307
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,590
Han Jingmo

308
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,190
must have feelings for me.

309
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,370
My heart is beating so fast.

310
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,200
I can't stop.

311
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,660
What should I do?

312
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,120
So there really is a prince charming in the fairy tale.

313
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,940
So it's true in fairy tales.

314
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:32,570
Why did I dream of him?

315
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,580
Lu Wanwan,

316
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,970
are you really seduced?

317
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,880
Are you

318
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,190
really having evil thoughts for

319
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,560
Han Jingmo?

320
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,930
Lu Wanwan.

321
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,390
Indulging on your lust is equivalent to hang a knife upon your head.

322
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,260
Let's go to the pedestrian street later.

323
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:55,820
Sure.

What do you think I want?

I don't know what you want.

329
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,619
Let go of me first.

330
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,750
Let go of me!

331
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:20,760
Are you afraid of me?

332
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,730
Why should I?

333
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,599
Then why are you hiding from me?

334
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,440
I'm not hiding from you.

335
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,750
I'm going back.

336
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,680
Pack up and go back.

it's inappropriate to pull me.

I used to hold you like this.

341
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,960
How could it be the same?

342
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,990
What's the difference

343
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,410
from now on?

344
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,980
