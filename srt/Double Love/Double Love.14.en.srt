00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,180
It's okay.

349
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,040
Take it home and open it yourself.

350
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:07,460
It's half done.

351
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,990
Why not just open it?

352
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,089
Let me help you.

353
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,589
It's inappropriate.

354
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,339
Don't...

355
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,940
It's indeed well prepared.

356
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,690
This is a limited edition.

357
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,089
Wanwan.

358
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,060
This is too valuable.

359
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,800
Are you and Mr. Gu...

360
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,870
We are friends.

361
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,600
Don't get me wrong. We're just friends.

362
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,620
We are just friends.

363
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,900
Don't get me wrong.

364
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,480
We're just friends.

365
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:35,760
Wan...

366
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,130
Alright, take it.

367
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,940
I really can't take it.

368
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,010
Take it away. Hurry up.

369
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,030
No, I really can't, Wanwan.

370
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,250
It's too expensive.

371
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,740
No, I really can't.

372
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,010
Wanwan, listen to me.

373
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,700
I really can't take it.

374
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,760
No, no.

375
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,590
Hurry up.

376
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,390
No, it's too expensive.

377
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,420
Congratulations.

378
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,110
Well.

379
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,190
Get ready for the next scene.

380
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,590
Hurry up. The next scene.

381
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,150
Lu Guanghan.

382
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,510
The gift you gave to Gu Qiaobei

383
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,970
almost killed me.

384
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,660
You need to call him quickly

385
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,860
and explain it to him.

386
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,040
How?

387
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,900
Tell him you're my sister?

388
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:40,750
Come on, just let him think it's from you.

389
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,870
It doesn't matter.

390
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,740
When did you learn

391
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,670
to do good deeds without leaving a name?

392
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,530
I don't want to keep a low profile.

393
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,840
But once he knew it was me,

394
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,780
he would definitely return it right away.

395
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,740
I don't care.

396
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,150
I am

397
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,100
super awkward today.

398
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,390
All right. Fine.

399
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,200
Don't be angry.

400
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,840
I'll remember your kindness.

401
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:02,650
Thank you.

402
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,210
All right, don't be angry.

403
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,820
I'll play games with you

404
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:09,470
to vent your anger.

405
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,230
Let's go.

406
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,030
You?

407
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,990
Cut it out.

408
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,720
I just saw...

409
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,360
Thank you, Miss.

410
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,060
Have a seat.

411
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,360
I've changed.

412
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,300
This dress...

413
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,370
-Wanwan.
-You guys go ahead.

414
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,540
Wanwan.

415
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,780
Isn't it the promotion for the Big Dunk?

416
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,240
Why is there someone else?

417
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,240
I heard from Miss Wei

418
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,470
the change of roles caused big trouble.

419
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,310
She's in the same company as Yan Shengkai.

420
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:56,290
So I asked her to come and help us.

421
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,950
Let's go. Get ready.

422
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,510
Let's go.

423
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,620
Calm down.

424
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,110
I'm here.

425
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,060
Hello.

426
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,540
Good evening, everyone in front of the screen.

427
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,980
You are watching

428
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,740
the show Secret of the Crew.

429
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:37,000
[Secret of the Crew]

430
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,980
Today, I'm very honored

431
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,660
to invite

432
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,500
the leading actors of the Big Dunk

433
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,190
[Secret of the Crew]

434
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,960
to come to our live broadcast room

435
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,360
to meet you.

436
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:42,580
Today, let's

437
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,580
greet everyone with

438
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,050
a big round of applause.

439
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:46,730
Welcome.

440
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,470
Okay.

441
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,860
[Big Dunk]

442
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,340
Next, please take your seats.

443
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:49,940
Come on.

444
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,500
Please.

445
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,940
Actually,

446
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,650
you came to

447
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,060
such a show today.

448
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,340
I want you guys to talk

449
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,430
about love.

450
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,980
I hope you can share

451
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,180
your opinions and expectations openly.

452
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:00,670
Okay?

453
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,940
As you can see,

454
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:04,340
[Big Dunk]

455
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,680
there's a game device

456
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,110
on our desktop.

457
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,070
There are some questions in it.

458
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,730
Let the boys

459
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,460
draw a game card first.

460
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,100
Okay?

461
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:11,660
Please.

462
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,350
Have some water.

463
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,380
Thank you.

464
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:36,730
Shengkai.

465
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,580
Are you adjusted to the crew?

466
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,360
Miss Yiwei,

467
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,070
everyone is very friendly

468
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:42,490
and takes good care of me.

469
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,970
That's a relief.

470
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,230
Work hard.

471
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,780
Communicate with them if you have questions.

472
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,190
Wanwan.

473
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,390
There are so many meat in your bowl.

474
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,250
Aren't you afraid of getting fat?

475
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,860
As long as I eat fast enough,

476
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,480
my weight will not increase.

477
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,140
Have you heard of Einstein's theory of relativity?

478
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,870
As long as I eat fast enough,

479
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,330
my weight will not increase but lose.

480
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,210
That makes sense.

481
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,220
But

482
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,380
Wanwan, you have such a good figure.

483
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,890
You really don't have to keep it.

484
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,550
I feel dizzy.

485
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,460
Why are you pretending not to know me?

486
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,610
Do we know each other?

487
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,180
Stop pretending.

488
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,290
Miss Yiwei.

489
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,170
Are you okay?

490
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,900
Wanwan.

491
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:48,650
It's okay.

492
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,330
Send me back.

493
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,080
Or I'll tell everyone what happened that night.

494
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,560
Are you really okay?

495
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,480
Are you okay?

496
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,920
We've only had a few drinks.

497
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,980
I'll wait for you at the door.

498
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,590
Let's continue drinking, okay?

499
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,670
Wanwan, she's drunk.

500
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,290
I'll send her back.

501
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,970
Take care.

502
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:08,650
-I want to drink.
-Be careful.

503
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,910
What are you doing?

504
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,950
Good for you.

505
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,330
You didn't even tell me you came back.

506
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,500
Come on.

507
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,950
We don't really know each other.

508
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,510
Fine.

509
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,500
Let's get to know each other now.

510
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,060
Hello, I'm Guan Yiwei.

511
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,020
Let me ask you a question.

512
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,180
Why do you become a bodyguard?

513
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,850
You don't look short of money.

514
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,540
Because it's fun.

515
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,350
Is your birthday coming?

516
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,040
What?

517
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,250
What do you like?

518
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:13,900
I'm giving you a birthday gift.

519
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,320
You just gave away an expensive wrist watch.

520
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,900
Do you still have spare money?

521
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,020

693
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,210
Lin Huang

694
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,280
is too short-sighted.

695
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,380
His vision is not long enough.

696
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,700
It's not the best choice

697
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,240
for your career.

698
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:23,320
But you've been working together for so many years,

699
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,820
you still have some tacit understanding.

700
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,790
So I think

701
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,350
you should communicate with each other more.

702
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,020
Call me if you need anything.

703
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,830
Thank you.

704
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,130
Please enjoy.

705
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,720
I mean it.

706
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,570
By the way,

707
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,160
I saw the rough cut.

708
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,960
I agree with the director,

709
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:42,900
your performance is amazing.

710
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,720
Really?

711
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:45,820
Yes.

712
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,220
To the actor, Gu Qiaobei.

713
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,320
[Sports shall also be in style.]

714
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,760
[Sports shall also be in style.]

715
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,810
Opening the shooting site

716
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,390
is already attractive enough,

717
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,940
plus his birthday live.

718
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,340
I'd better give him the gift first.

719
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,900
I don't want to be photographed.

720
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,960
It's like a show. That'll be awkward.

721
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,500
Gather around. It's starting.

722
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:26,130
So it begins.

723
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,030
Let's go.

724
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,430
When I went there,

725
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:37,040
they introduced it to me seriously.

726
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,770
And then I was watching.

727
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,430
I guessed you would like it.

728
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:41,770
Thank you.

729
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,030
Go.

730
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,550
Come on! Go!

731
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,170
Twenty seconds thirty-two.

732
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,270
OK. Pass.

733
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,530
Well...

734
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,120
It's such a big scene.

735
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,489
Come on. All come here.

736
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:21,480
We have a big event today.

737
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,850
Where is Shengkai?

738
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:23,630
Shengkai.

739
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,880
Here comes the cake.

740
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,929
Here.

741
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,580
This seems to be hand-made by Yan Shengkai.

742
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,010
What? She made it herself?

743
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,100
Yes.

744
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:37,870
I thought

745
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,210
it was made by a national pastry chef.

746
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:40,230
Yes, that's pretty good.

747
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,550
It's amazing.

748
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:43,440
I don't even want to cut it.

749
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,270
The meaning is great too.

750
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:46,980
It matches our birthday boy.

751
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,000
-It's pretty good.
-Yes.

752
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,160
Happy birthday.

753
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,760
Thank you.

754
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,660
It's carefully

755
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,230
prepared by Shengkai,

756
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,600
she told me earlier.

757
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,960
She is very attentive.

758
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,040
On behalf of our Big Dunk crew,

759
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,940
I wish our leading actor Han Jingmo

760
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,870
happy birthday.

761
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:12,270
Happy birthday.

762
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:14,610
I'll go over there. Come to me later.

763
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,810
Take out all your gifts.

764
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,450
Where's your gift?

765
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,750
Mine...

766
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,220
Jingmo, happy birthday.

767
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,510
Thank you.

768
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,110
Her gift is the same as mine?

769
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,720
Happy birthday.

770
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:39,710
What else?

771
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:44,820
I didn't make a cake. I don't know how to make a cake.

772
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:46,990
Wanwan.

773
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,220
He is calling me, I'll leave...

774
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,220
I'll leave first.

775
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,010
Come on.

776
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,560
Let's cut the cake together.

777
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,310
Come on, let's share the cake.

778
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:55,260
Okay. Come on.

779
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,280
Happy birthday.

780
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,340
What's wrong? Why are you looking for me?

781
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,200
I didn't want you to feel awkward.

782
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,320
After getting the cake,

783
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,980
we're going to the next scene.

784
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,190
Coming.

785
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,400
Who else doesn't have it? Come on.

786
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:30,030
If you can't do it,

787
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,210
don't promise next time.

788
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,020
Have this one.

789
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:44,540
Thank you.
