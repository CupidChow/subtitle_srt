I can lose weight again.

00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,290
Looks like our friendship is more strong.

862
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,130
Do you want to upgrade it?

863
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,150
What?

864
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:50,900
Moonlight Blade opens up a new system of Love as One Heart.

865
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,830
Do you know that?

866
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,460
Marry me.

867
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,820
What?

868
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,920
Why is me?

869
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,140
It's so annoying to be sent Love Flowers all day.

870
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:07,150
I want to find someone to tie up as a couple.

871
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:09,480
Then no one will send me the flowers again.

872
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,400
There's another reason.

873
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:13,820
It's that

874
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,220
I want to experience the new system.

875
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,860
I'm so happy.

876
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,680
I'm so happy.

877
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,180
Chu He.

878
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,080
I'm back.

879
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:06,070
I hope I didn't scare you off.

880
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,760
Of course not.

881
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,710
My phone suddenly broke down.

882
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,860
So you agree

883
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,080
to do the mission with me?

884
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,750
That's fine.

885
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,380
But first, we have to fill up our Fondness.

886
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,900
Between Ink White gives Chu He

887

888
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:29,860
999 Love Flowers.

889
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,040
Finally,

890
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,400
he meets his beloved.

891
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,110
Ink White Genius confessed his love.

892
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,490
I'm heartbroken.

893
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,370
He fell in love.

894
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:40,610
Chu He is so lucky.

895
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,820
That's all romance in the world.

My lady.

My lady! Honey!

901
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,540
Dear. Darling.

902
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:56,430
Choose one.

903
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:00,010
