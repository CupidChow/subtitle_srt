[Episode 24]

4
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,720
I didn't expect

5
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,229
you still remember after all these years.

6
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,370
This is my favorite flavor.

7
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,750
Yeah.

8
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:45,940
Enjoy it.

9
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,110
I'll rehearse first

10
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:56,700
and then eat it.

11
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,460
Okay.

12
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,550
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,980
It's all

14
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,850
my fault.

15
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,220
I'm an incompetent mother.

16
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,820
All these years, I've been wondering

17
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,400
if you're doing well.

18
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,490
But

19
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,270
I cared more about my current family

20
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,450
that I ignored your feelings

21
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,530
and hurt you.

22
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,220
Seeing that you have a successful career,

23
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,410
and so many people like you,

24
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,970
I took the chance to comfort myself

25
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,500
to ease my guilt.

26
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,240
It's been my fault

27
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,660
all these years.

28
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,250
Let's finish this scene first.

29
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,300
Let's do the unfinished scene again.

30
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,350
One more time.

31
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,410
What about Han Jingmo?

32
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,530
Director, I'm ready.

33
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,510
Let's get ready.

34
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:53,680
Okay?

35
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,690
Get ready.

36
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,480
Ready.

37
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,820
You must be careful.

38
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,920
Don't worry.

39
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,640
I'll be fine.

40
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,680
Okay, pass.

41
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,659
Good. Well done. Come on.

42
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,520
Be careful in the future.

43
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,570
My future daughter-in-law is not easy to get done.

44
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,540
Next time,

45
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,960
you can come over when you have time.

46
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,590
Okay.

47
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,930
I'm leaving.

48
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,770
Take care.

49
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,620
Watch out your head.

50
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,240
Bye, Mom...

51
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,570
Auntie.

52
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,470
Bye.

53
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,640
Bye.

54
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,560
Why are you so eager to call her Mom?

55
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,220
I'm not.

56
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,000
Well,

57
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,070
you want to rush into marriage?

58
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,030
I'm not.

59
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,950
I'm not. Stop talking nonsense.

60
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,250
Thank you.

61
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,840
I know you've done a lot for me.

62
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,410
You are my boyfriend.

63
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,810
Isn't that normal?

64
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,430
Let's have dinner together.

65
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,650
My brother wanted to ask Qiao out,

66
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,730
but he was afraid he would get beaten up.

67
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,780
So he asked us to come together.

68
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,980
Okay, it's your call.

69
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,040
Let's go.

70
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,130
Go.

71
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,950
Qiao, you're here.

72
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,090
Have a seat.

73
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,520
Since everyone is here,

74
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,890
let's dig in then.

75
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,200
Enjoy the meal.

76
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:48,920
Han Jingmo.

77
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,600
You know all about this, right?

78
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,570
But you hid from me

79
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,600
and lied to me?

80
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,100
What do you mean?

81
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,100
You value love over friendship, right?

82
00:07:58,659 --> 00:07:59,659
You...

83
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,580
Didn't you say that Top Star of Lu is your friend?

84
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,170
We're not friends indeed,

85
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:10,660
but more than friends.

86
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,880
That's right.

87
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,120
Qiao, don't be angry.

88
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:16,450
It's our fault for hiding it from you.

89
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,210
So you all knew,

90
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:18,990
right?

91
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,310
I'm the only stupid one.

92
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,510
Is that funny?

93
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,350
That's enough.

94
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,360
It's not too late for you to know.

95
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,170
Right?

96
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,770
-Calm down. -Calm down.

97
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,020
Let's enjoy the meal first.

98
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,440
Come on, let's have the meal first.

99
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,780
Sit down. Take it easy.

100
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:35,620
Sit down.

101
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,850
Grab a bite first.

102
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,860
Come on.

103
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,290
Well.

104
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,860
I was wronged too.

105
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:53,800
Back then in the game,

106
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,250
it was you who pestered me first.

107
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,580
I didn't know it was you.

108
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,030
And I told you I'm a man.

109
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,770
When did you tell me that

110
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,240
you...

111
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:03,940
Yes.

112
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,780
You told me you're a man.

113
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:07,870
Did you tell me you were Lu Guanghan?

114
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,710
You didn't tell me that you're Gu Qiaobei either.

115
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,010
Fine.

116
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,190
So it was my fault after all, right?

117
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,300
Okay, no problem.

118
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,510
I'll apologize to all of you.

119
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,500
I'll drink three cups as punishment, okay?

120
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,070
Alright.

121
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,560
You can do whatever you want.

122
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,230
I think three cups are too much.

123
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,030
One cup is enough.

124
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,780
Have a seat.

125
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,170
Let me pour you some wine.

126
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:31,830
Come, have a seat.

127
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,190
Come on. Sit down.

128
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,340
A little bit is enough.

129
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,720
OK.

130
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,340
Just a little bit.

131
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,050
Come on.

132
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,210
Let's drink the wine to clear our grudges.

133
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,110
Bottoms up. Forget the unhappy things.

134
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,570
Come on.

135
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,040
Cheers.

136
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,230
Let bygones be bygones.

137
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,380
We are good friends.

138
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:53,780
We've given you an out.

139
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,910
You should know it.

140
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:56,290
Come on.

141
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,400
Cheers.

142
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,330
Let bygones be bygones.

143
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,060
Yeah, come on.

144
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,710
-I can't believe he drank it up? -He drank it all?

145
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,510
Come on, there's still a little left.

146
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,020
Come on!

147
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,090
Gu Qiaobei, you are my idol.

148
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,930
All right, it's fine now.

149
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,610
Can you eat some more?

150
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,330
-Calm down. -Sit down.

151
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,740
Sit down.

152
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,860
Enjoy it.

153
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,010
-Have it. -So...

154
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,350
You'll sign it for me, right?

155
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:54,880
Piss off.

156
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,150
Thank you for the thing about

157
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,010
Jiang Mingshu.

158
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,320
You're welcome. I didn't do anything either.

159
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,890
Don't be so excited.

160
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,690
Chu He will love you forever.

161
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,260
What did you say?

162
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,840
Stop. I was just kidding.

163
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,740
I also want to thank you for myself

164
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,050
five years ago.

165
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,680
What?

166
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:33,100
You went to America five years ago, right?

167
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,600
Yes, my whole family went on a trip together.

168
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,090
Yes.

169
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,630
This man, right?

170
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,420
Right?

171
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,020
Yes.

172
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,520
Hey, man.

173
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,560
Where do you come from?

174
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,970
Won't you say something?

175
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,870
-Where are you from? -Are you okay?

176
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,130

In the movies,

After all,

I've fantasized about it many times

405

Sorry.

408
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,100
I guess I underestimated your confidence.

409

You don't talk to us and don't play with us?

417

Back then,

432

I was a known street bully.

433
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:33,020
I had to fight every three to five days.

434
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,010
And it was common for me to do the righteous deeds.
