I can only say that they have known each other for very long time.

You should ask him.

Mr. Lu, tell me,

since they've known each other for a long time,

should they already be together if it is meant to be?

Yes.

you'd better come to hurt me alone.

Mr. Lu, you're right.

394
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,250
I should focus on the shooting.

695
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,110
What do you mean by no need? Clear it up.

696
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,130
I don't need you to replace her.

697
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,270
I'll wait for her.

698
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,710
I'm not upset about attending the wedding on behalf of my sister.

699
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,040
Why are you so arrogant?

700
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,360
Isn't this a live stream?

701
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:01,370
If she doesn't come,

702
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:04,050
I'll kill her until she leaves the game.

703
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:04,990
You...

704
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:08,990
Forget it.

705
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,130
Whatever.

706
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,500
I don't care.

707
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,100
Genius, why did she leave?

708
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,520
Where is Chu He?

709
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,150
We'll get back to work.

710
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,700
Why did they leave again?

711
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,450
My God, today is your wedding.

712
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,690
Luckily I didn't record the screen.

713
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:39,370
I wouldn't know how I would die if I had recorded the screen.

714
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,670
My God.

715
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:43,100
See? They're all gone.

716
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,830
What's going on?

717
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,940
They went away. Look, they're all gone.

718
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,440
Did Chu He stand Genius up?

719
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,160
She wouldn't dare even if I lend her 100 lives.

720
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,310
Unless she doesn't play this game anymore.

721
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,500
She stood him up?

722
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,540
The how can we play the bride-snatching game?
