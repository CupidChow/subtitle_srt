They're all passed in one shot.

It's not a big deal. This is normal.

That's because Han Jingmo

used to disturb my acting.

326
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,870
I thought

00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,590
you wanted to go home early

You two go visit Han Jingmo on behalf of the crew.

Check how Han Jingmo is doing.

Tell him his health is important.

335
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,740
Ask him to have a good rest.

336
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,420
Since we're changing the leading actress now,

we don't have many scenes to shoot.

338
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,970
Tell him not to come to the set if he's not well.

339

Okay.

340

It's on me.

344
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,340
Wanwan, I don't think we need to buy food.

Today is another day of loving you.

691
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,350
Kiss you.

692
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,460
Good night, honey.

693
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,940
When I think of myself tomorrow

694
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,450
loving you more than I do today,

695
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,850
I'm jealous of myself.

696
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,300
If you don't want to die,

697
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,480
go offline now.

698
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,250
Okay.

699
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,440
Heart attack!

700
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,650
Heart attack!

701
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,290
Figure heart.

702
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,090
Figure heart.

703
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,429
See? A big heart.

704
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,989
Straight into your heart.

705
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:20,310
Hello.

706
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,830
Wanwan, get ready.

707
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:25,530
You're going on a trip for a variety show in the next few days.

708
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,489
Big Dunk has changed the leading actress,

709
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:29,330
so you have time to come.

710
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,639
Going elsewhere again?

711
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,270
Get ready.

712
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,110
I was just informed.

713
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:36,350
Okay.

714
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:37,280
Bye.

715
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:00,490
Isn't your bodyguard coming with you?

716
00:35:00,910 --> 00:35:01,770
Zhao Jinghang?

717
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,080
He's on a business trip.

718
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,940
He's not my full-time bodyguard.

719
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,850
Are you feeling better?

720
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:12,130
Yes.

721
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,890
Why has he changed his style after being sick?

722
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,220
He must have forgot

723
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,630
what happened that day.

724
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,130
I'm done.

725
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:27,330
Wipe your saliva.

726
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,740
I'm hungry.

727
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,880
Let's have dinner together tonight.

728
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,750
What's wrong with you two?

729
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,050
Why don't you eat?

730
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:56,930
Dig in.

731
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,010
It's on me.

732
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,990
Are you saving money for me?

733
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:03,640
You sure?

734
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:06,780
These two men are on a diet.

735
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,190
They have many basketball scenes.

736
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,790
They need to show their body.

737
00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:14,340
Then can I eat this?

738
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,030
Control yourself.

739
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,200
You have to be self-disciplined as a female star.

740
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,520
I'm disciplined.

741
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,270
I don't even eat ice cream now.

742
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,140
You'll become a pig if you keep eating.

743
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,790
Have you seen such a thin

744
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,220
and a lewd pig?

745
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,860
Fine, I'm not eating.

746
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,440
I'll show you

747
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,940
the self-cultivation of a future top star.

748
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,170
I'm gonna go for a run.

749
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,060
Run?

750
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,950
Run!

751
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:44,420
Run in high heels?

752
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,420
You can serve the hot dishes now.

753
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,350
What hot dishes?

754
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,670
All here.

755
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,760
There you go. Hot dishes.

756
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:07,230
[Barbecue]

757
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,370
The mushrooms are fresh today.

758
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:06,010
Have some.

759
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:13,810
[Barbecue]

760
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:09,330
No, thanks.

761
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:14,950
There you go.

762
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,030
Thank you, sir.

763
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,990
You're welcome.

764
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,410
It smells good.

765
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:27,990
It's delicious.

766
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,690
At this time...

767
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,480
You must be hungry

768
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,890
after eating vegetables tonight.

769
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,600
What's wrong?

770
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,750
Look at my phone.

771
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,550
This is...

772
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,510
Anything wrong?

773
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,390
Is it an anomaly?

774
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:19,990
Look.

775
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,960
There are so many jellyfishes.

776
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,820
They're red and green. There's even grass growing.

777
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,620
There are many rabbits.

778
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,240
They are jumping here, you see?

779
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:27,760
Look.

780
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,370
They're still jumping here.

781
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,970
Jumping from here

782
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,630
to here.

783
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:33,400
Can't you see it?

784
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,510
Isn't it here?

785
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:35,900
No.

786
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,750
Yes.

787
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,320
Where are we?

788
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,340
Why are there so many zombies suddenly?

789
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,870
You must have played too much Plants vs. Zombies.

790
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,200
You're hallucinating?

791
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,200
Well,

792
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,200
the lights are bright.

793
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,550
Where are the zombies?

794
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:01,980
Run!

795
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,890
The zombies are coming.

796
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,080
You must have watched too many horror movies.

797
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,700
There are more and more zombies now.

798
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,800
Let's go.

799
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:10,270
What's wrong with you?

800
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:10,870
Get up.

801
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,330
No, I can't.

802
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,320
Zombies!

803
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:17,390
He's biting my leg.

804
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,900
He's eating me.

805
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,660
He's eating me.

806
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,420
He'll eat you after he eats me.

807
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:25,570
There's no zombie. Don't cry.

808
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:26,500
-Don't be afraid. -Don't touch me.

809
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,550
Don't move!

810
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,250
Don't move!

811
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,660
He bit my head.

812
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:33,600
Don't move.

813
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,700
Don't come over and let him eat me.

814
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:37,220
Don't worry. I'm here.

815
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,310
Don't be afraid.

816
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,220
Don't move.

817
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,340
Don't stand up.

818
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,600
Although they look cute,

819
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,880
they can't eat you.

820
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:47,790
Eat me.

821
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:50,460
Bit me. Don't bite him.

822
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:51,450
Han Jingmo.

823
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:52,050
Hello?

824
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,550
Get a car. Hurry up.
