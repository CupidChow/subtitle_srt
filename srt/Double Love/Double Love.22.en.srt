[Episode 22]

4
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:53,990
Three Swordsmanship.

5
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,070
You've been playing games more often lately.

6
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,150
Why? Don't you have work to do?

7
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,190
I rejected several projects

8
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,030
to adjust myself.

9
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,400
Why are you dressed so plainly today?

10
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,590
I've got a friend

11
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,550
in real life.

12
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,829
He's ready to start a new life.

13
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:17,740
I'm corresponding with him

14
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,780
in the game.

15
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,250
We look good together.

16
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,740
What do you mean?

17
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:25,740
You're disgusting. You're a man.

18
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,140
Well...

19
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,060
You quit your job as your wish.

20
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:33,910
Are you a boss in real life?

21
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:36,840
Stop making fun of me.

22
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,350
I'm just a puppet

23
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,510
at the intersection

24
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,020
of my life.

25
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,560
You are like my friend

26
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,170
in real life.

27
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,570
You are both facing choices.

28
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,810
Tell me about it if you don't mind.

29
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,510
I can analyse it for you.

30
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,920
Actually,

31
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,000
I've made a decision.

32
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,090
I just don't know if I did it right.

33
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,320
My boss

34
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,830
helped me a lot.

35
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,660
He has taken good care of me since I started my career.

36
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,460
He gave me many chances.

37
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,700
That's why I always

38
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,960
saw requiting his favours

39
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,930
as my goal.

40
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,329
But recently,

41
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,850
I found that my boss...

42
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,470
Anyway,

43
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,590
I can't meet

44
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,270
their expectations anymore.

45
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,690
You can't

46
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,070
or you don't want to?

47
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,020
I don't want to.

48
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,130
There are too many elites in this industry.

49
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,200
I don't think I'm a must.

50
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,960
You think so low of yourself?

51
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,170
Look at you.

52
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,140
You are even serious in the game.

53
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,270
You must be a wonderful person

54
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,050
in real life.

55
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,860
I'm a good judge of character.

56
00:03:57,329 --> 00:03:59,300
But I don't want to be wonderful.

57
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,070
Then what do you want?

58
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,160
I want to jump out of my comfort zone.

59
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,950
I think

60
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,940
life is short.

61
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,740
We must do something

62
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,770
we really like.

63
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,020
That is meaningful.

64
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,730
Even if it's nothing big.

65
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,899
Unfortunately,

66
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,700
my job is a bit special.

67
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,660
Many people will pay attention to me.

68
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,410
If I can't do it well in the future,

69
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,680
I'll lose face.

70
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,800
I will support you.

71
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,190
Come on, two players.

72
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,380
Take a break and have some fruit.

73
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,970
You need to strike a balance between work and rest.

74
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,700
There you go.

75
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,560
Susu said

76
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,840
you should wash your hands before eating.

77
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,770
She said you have a bad stomach. Go.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,570
Here.

79
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:51,820
No.

80
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,780
You...

81
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,370
This chess puzzle is too difficult.

82
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,060
Not anybody can solve it.

83
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,130
But I won't give up easily.

84
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,200
Well,

85
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,910
there's another person here

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,410
besides Senior Lu

87
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,200
who can solve this puzzle.

88
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:24,970
Who is that?

89
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:29,280
Mr. Lu?

90
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,870
He has been trained

91
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,400
by my dad since he was young.

92
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,090
If it weren't for the entertainment circles,

93
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:35,980
he must be

94
00:05:36,010 --> 00:05:37,340
a titled player now.

95
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,120
Hold on.

96
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,930
Omnipotent Top Star of Lu,

97
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,800
[Omnipotent Top Star of Lu, help!]

98
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:51,750
help!

99
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,030
Cheating is shameful.

100
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,010
[Cheating is shameful.]

101
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:11,090
[Cheating is shameful.]

102
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:07,740
It's an honour to have you.

103
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,090
[It's an honour to have you. Stop dawdling. Think about it. I'll wash your socks for a month.]

104
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,400
Stop dawdling.

105
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,960
Think about it.

106
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,760
I'll wash your socks for a month.

107
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:22,070
[It's an honour to have you. Stop dawdling. Think about it. I'll wash your socks for a month.]

108
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,290
Two months.

109
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,070
[Two months.]

110
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,360
Come here.

111
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,770
Don't go back on your word.

112
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,860
I'll keep my promise.

113
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,720
Take a look.

114
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:40,190
How can we solve this?

115
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,700
Win. Even.

116
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,460
Thank you, Mr. Lu. You can leave.

117
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,880
If you dare to trick me, I'll put you

118
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:01,840
two on my blacklist.

119
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,450
You're so childish. Just go.

120
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,220
Mr. Lu.

121
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,790
Gu Qiaobei told me on the way here

122
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,990
that he was considering going into a different industry.

123
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,320
Which industry does he want to go in?

124
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,260
I have no idea.

125
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,600
He seems to be just thinking about it.

126
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:20,980
He only needs a push now.

127
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,950
Senior Lu, are you ready?

128
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:31,880
Yes.

129
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:42,800
How is it?

130
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,230
I give up, sir.

131
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,420
I know

132
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,970
little about the game of go.

133
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,250
Even if I study it for a few years,

134
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,450
I'm afraid I still can't solve this puzzle.

135
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,510
Even so, you still can't just give up.

136
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,159
Didn't he tell you how to solve the puzzle?

137
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:36,059
You can lose the game,

138
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:37,789
but not your attitude.

139
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,850
I'm serious about Wanwan.

140
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,010
The same goes for this game.

141
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,480
As long as you agree,

142
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,310
I'm willing to come here often to pick your brain.

143
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:46,520
I hope one day

144
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,730
I could become an qualified opponent.

145
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,860
Fine.

146
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:40,860
If you

147
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,970
mistreat Wanwan,

148
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,920
we won't let you off.

149
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,820
I'll keep that in mind.

150
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,710
Honey.

151
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,270
Your parents are still here.

152
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,010
It's okay.

153
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,420
You old bastard.

154
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,750
I want to jump out of my comfort zone.

155
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,130
I must do something

156
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,150
I really like.

157
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,360
That is meaningful.

158
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:32,880
[How's the termination of contract going? I'm waiting to celebrate with you.]

159
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,950
How's the termination of contract going?

160
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,150
I'm waiting to celebrate with you.

161
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,310
[How's the termination of contract going? I'm waiting to celebrate with you.]

162
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,160
[How's the termination of contract going? I'm waiting to celebrate with you.]

163
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:41,160
[Now.]

164
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,610
Now.

165
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,260
I thought we were going to drink.

166
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,750
You don't have to cook.

167
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:01,470
We can't just drink.

168
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,240
We need some snacks.

169
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,260
Don't stand there. Have a seat, Mr. Lu.

170
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,450
It'll be ready soon.

171
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,500
The drink is on the table.

172
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:19,600
Thank you.

173
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,260

181
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,120

Qiao,

190
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,160
you are born

191
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,220
to be an actor.

192
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,940
Right?

193
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,070
You have to make use of your talent.

194
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,880
You have to work hard.

195
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,120
You mimicked me so well.

196
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,530
I always hope

you can join our Ying Ge.

198

199
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,780
your feelings are more important to me.

200
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,450
Right?

201
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,220
Actually,

202
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,630
I always thought you were unhappy.

203
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,270
I thought your negative feelings

204
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,450
came from your agency.

205
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:46,970
I didn't realise

206
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,500
you were unhappy about being an actor

207
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,890
until now.

208
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:53,510
Since you're unhappy and don't like it,

209
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,700
why should you stay?

210

Of course you need to going into a different industry.

211

Right?

212
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,000
I'm really touched

213
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,400
that you can understand me.

214
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,230
Of course.

215
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,320
After all,

216
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,870
I need to give up being a star

217
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,370
and start over.

218
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,930
But nobody can really forget that

219

You've taken the first step,

225
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,110

By the way,

the script has been changed. Take a good look.

367
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,360
Isn't this a music video?

368
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,350
Look.

369
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,140
Everyone should

370
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,420
destroy the evil.

371
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,100
You are pretty

372
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,530
when I take a closer look at you.

373
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,660
You can kill me

374
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,910
as you wish.

375
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,680
You're such a beauty.

376
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:52,160
Cut.

377
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,330
Wanwan.

378
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,630
Don't look like you're going to die.

379
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,430
You have to be upright

380
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,290
but also a little scared.

381
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,800
Okay, Director.

382
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,740
Alright, let's do it again.

383
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,010
This will be better.

384
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:23,750
Well...

385
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:25,650
Are you okay?

386
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:27,040
What happened to me?

387
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:27,950
Cut.

00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,120
What's going on?

389
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,750
Your nose is bleeding.

390
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:31,990
I'm sorry, Director.

391
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,010
Let Wanwan stop the bleeding first.

392
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:37,740
I'm sorry, Director.

393
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,610
It's okay.

394
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,060
Hurry up. Go take care of it.

395
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,690
-Let's do touch-ups. -Go.

396
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,250
Okay.

397
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:42,620
Let's go.

398
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:47,560
Okay.

399
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:58,900
Done.

400
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,590
What's wrong?

401
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,930
Are you nervous?

402
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:14,620
This is my first time filming this kind of scene.

403
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,610
There are so many people watching.

404
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,000
It's too stressful.

405
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,740
You are a professional actress.

406
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,870
No matter what happens,

407
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,080
you have to dive into the role quickly.

408
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,050
Besides,

409
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:28,410
they are working,

410
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,580
not gossiping.

411
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,810
Why are you nervous?

412
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,670
I know. I understand.

413
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,110
I just can't control myself.

414
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,150
What can I do?

415
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,970
You can't even overcome

416
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,270
such a minor psychological barrier.

417
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:44,160
There will be more awkward situations in the future.

418
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,280
If I were not your counterpart today,

419
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,230
but someone else,

420
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,230
what would you do?

421
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,740
I would stop filming.

422
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,350
Okay.

423
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,840
Relax.

424
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:01,190
When we start shooting,

425
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,160
focus on my eyes.

426
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,640
Okay.

427
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:08,890
Don't worry.

428
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,000
I have a good psychological quality.

429
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,560
Don't worry, honey.

430
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,720
This manipulative woman took advantage of Han to climb up.

431
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,520
Shame on her!

432
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,010
I'm gonna unfollow you.

433
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:27,000
Han Jingmo, you have three days to break up.

434
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,510
Is it so hard to admit that

435
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,670
Han Jingmo likes me?

436
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:32,780
I'm pretty, cute, and lively.

437
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,560
Am I not worthy of being loved?

438
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,140
They even think we're a contract couple.

439
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,610
This is ridiculous.

440
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,460
Isn't that normal?

441
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,010
Haters always hate.

442
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,170
If you are hated,

443
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,030
it means you're still popular.

444
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,690
You're right.

445

[Lu Guanghan]

446
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,470
I can't reach him.

447
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,340
Ask him what's going on.

448
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,980
I can't pin this down for long.

449
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,680
I haven't seen Han Jingmo

450
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:35,870
these days,

451
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,530
so I didn't ask about the photo.

452
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,520
I don't think you dare to ask.

453

Anyway, I trust him firmly.

Do you know whom Han Jingmo

455
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,970
was caught meeting in a private club?

456
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:52,590

The one who has won the Award of Best Actress three times?

461
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,720
Not only does she have an outstanding appearance,

462
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,650
but also excellent acting skills.

463
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,960
Isn't the age gap between them

464
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,970
too much?

465
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,100
Maybe Han Jingmo likes old woman.

466
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,290
Look at her body shape.

467
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,970
Can you tell her real age?

468
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,690
Are these all taken by paparazzi?

469
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,550
I didn't see

any news coming out.

471
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,960
It's been pinned down.

472
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,960
Jiang Mingshu has already

473
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,860
reached out to those journalists earlier than me.

474
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,160
If there's nothing between them,

475
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,280
why did she take the initiative?

476
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,100
But I've never seen

477

any interactions between them

478
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,780

479
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,670
They both have professional teams.

480
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,950
How can they let you find anything?

481
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,040
Aren't you in Han Jingmo's team?

482
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,630
You didn't find anything either.

483
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,550
Anyway,

484
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,150
I've reminded you.

485
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,310
Stay away from the scumbag celebrity.

486
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,850

I will find out the truth.

My principle

489
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,340
is not to let any scumbag off

490
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,730
and not to wrong any good man.

491
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,040
Okay?

492
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,190

No.
