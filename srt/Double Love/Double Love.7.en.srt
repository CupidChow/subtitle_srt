00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,480
Genius, let's play the Challenge Tale.

176
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,910
There's a new tale called Heart Sword and War Mirror.

177
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,870
Young Master failed to pass it after playing it for the whole afternoon.

178
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,050
I don't want to play it.

179
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,260
Well, Genius,

180
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:23,350
you're just enjoying the scenery here?

181
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,150
Is it not okay?

182
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,320
It's okay.

183
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,820
Are you in a bad mood?

184
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:38,830
No.

185
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,620
How about I take you to play something fun?

186
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,770
Do you want to go to the lantern show?

187
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,250
Come on. Let's go together.

188
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,660
It'll be fun if you follow me.

189
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,410
It's so beautiful. Look at this latern.

190
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,450
It's so beautiful

191
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:12,540
♫Don't talk about the past♫

192
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:19,340
♫Although I've been wandering, I have nowhere to settle down♫

193
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,020
Let me tell you.

194
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,030
Many players would come to this lantern show.

195
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,110
It is said that

196
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,260
there may be a chance of a romantic encounter for those who come here.

197
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,900
♫Time is silent but it lingers♫

198
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,510
You know so well.

199
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:25,700
Sure enough,

200
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,260
you don't behave decently in your private life.

201
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,410
♫Only then did I dare to worship the moon and talk about my arrogance♫

202
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:36,520
♫Brew the mellow wine of rivers and lakes♫

203
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,590
This lattern is so beautiful.

204
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,840
How about we take a video?

205
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:37,060
We can upload it online.

206
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:38,460
No need.

207
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,580
♫The old wine still smells good♫

208
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,610
Let's take a video.

209
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,510
Many people take videos.

210
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,750
Let's take a video.

211
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,250
No.

212
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,370
♫Let's get drunk and drink together for another 30,000 times♫

213
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,220
Alright. Alright.

214
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:45,900
Let's not take a video.

215
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,100
Let's go around here for fun.

216
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,940
What is this?

217
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,160
♫Go into the crowd and look back♫

218
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,100
This is so cute.

219
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,020
Is this cute? Is it pretty?

220
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,060
Not bad.

221
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,920
Choose a latern and I'll buy it for you.

222
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,610
No.

223
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,820
Not again?

224
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,350
I'll buy it myself.

225
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:26,760
I'll buy this one.

226
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,520
You're not happy even while we're going around at the lantern show.

227
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,800
How about we go to do a mission?

228
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,870
No. I'll be busy tomorrow.

229
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,340
What a pity.

230
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,180
I want to increase the Fondness with you tomorrow.

231
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,300
You want to do that?

232
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,100
I suddenly have some free time recently.

233
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,370
I think when I'm free,

234
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,520
I can try to increase the Fondness.

235
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,810
You do have a lot of free time.

236
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,990
You know I have a lot of free time?

237
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,810
I mean I'll be busy these days.

238
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:02,380
If you want to increase the Fondness,

239
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,070
I can give you my account and password.

240
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,250
Chu He.

241
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:09,960
Chu He.

242
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,740
Is it true that I'm not mistaken?

243
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:22,990
[Weren't you picking on me just now?]

244
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:22,990
[Why are you willing to give me your account and password now?]

245
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,020
Weren't you picking on me just now?

246
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,610
Why are you willing to give me your account and password now?

247
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,530
[Weren't you picking on me just now?]

248
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,530
[Why are you willing to give me your account and password now?]

249
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,530
[Although I'm angry, we still need to become a couple.]

250
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,420
Although I'm angry,

251
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,100
we still need to become a couple.

252
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,350
No wonder he is the Genius.

253
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,860
To complete the mission of Love as One Heart,

254
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:33,870
he can even endure this.

255
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,640
His logic is indeed so different.

256
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,610
[Why are you willing to give me your account and password now?]

257
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,610
[Although I'm angry, we still need to become a couple.]

258
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:39,610
[Do you have time to chat?]

259
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,270
Do you have time to chat?

260
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:39,940
Yes.

261
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,160
[Although I'm angry, we still need to become a couple.]

262
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,160
[Do you have time to talk?]

263
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,160
[Yes.]

264
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:55,100
[Let me ask you. If a person who often appears in your life]

265
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:55,100
[has been on terms with you and suddenly leaves you, what does she think?]

266
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:43,950
Let me ask you.

267
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,540
if a person who often

268
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,980
appears in your life

269
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,940
has been on good terms with you

270
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,010
and suddenly leaves you,

271
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,370
what does she think?

272
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:00,150
[Let me ask you. If a person who often appears in your life]

273
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:00,150
[has been on terms with you and suddenly leaves you, what does she think?]

274
00:12:55,130 --> 00:13:00,150
[She? A woman?]

275
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,020
She? A woman?

276
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:06,280
[She? A woman?]

277
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:06,280
[Yes. She's my coworker. She looks heartless. She didn't tell me first before she left.]

278
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,900
She's my coworker.

279
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,820
She looks heartless.

280
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,860
She didn't tell me first before she left.

281
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,660
[She's a woman.]

282
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:10,660
[Yes. She's my coworker. She looks heartless. She didn't tell me first before she left.]

283
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,450
You must be reluctant to leave her.

284
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:19,080
[It seems that you can't bear to part with her. In my opinion, people's feelings are mutual.]

285
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:19,080
[If you don't want to part with her, she doesn't want to part with you, either.]

286
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,980
In my opinion,

287
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,070
people's feelings are mutual.

288
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,440
If you don't want to part with her,

289
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,910
she doesn't want to part with you, either.

290
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,820
Maybe for some reason,

291
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,490
[It seems that you can't bear to part with her. In my opinion, people's feelings are mutual.]

292
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,490
[If you don't want to part with her, she doesn't want to part with you, either.]

293
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,490
[Maybe for some reason, she couldn't express her true feelings.]

294
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,250
she couldn't express her true feelings.

295
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:27,880
[Maybe for some reason, she couldn't express her true feelings.]

296
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:27,880
[Really?]

297
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,130
Really?

298
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,460
Of course

299
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,030
[Really?]

300
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:31,030
[Of course. In this world, there's no such thing as being completely heartless.]

301
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,420
In this world,

302
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,100
there's no such thing as being completely heartless.

303
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,070
[Of course. In this world, there's no such thing as being completely heartless.]

304
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,070
[Right.]

305
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,020
[Good luck with the shooting!]

306
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,980
Good luck with the shooting!

307
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,580
[Good luck with the shooting!]

308
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,630
[Big Dunk. Good luck with the shooting!]

309
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,700
Look here.

310
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:55,620
Go and give out red packets.

311
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,990
Give red packets to you guys.

312
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,210
Okay. We're giving out red packets.

313
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,720
Here you are.

314
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:59,660
Thanks for your hard work.

315
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,790
Thanks for your hard work. Thanks.

316
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,690
Her you are. One for each person.

317
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:02,740
Thank you. Take a good photo.

318
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,620
Here you are. We're giving out red packets.

319
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,530
Good luck with your work.

320
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,180
Director Zheng, thank you for your hard work.

321
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,520
Not at all.

322
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,380
Good works

323
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,470
are the fruits of all the people's collective efforts.

324
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,420
It's the actors who work hard.

325
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,130
I'm famous for being strict.

326
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,620
Even if it's Gu Qiaobei,

327
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:20,200
I won't take special care of him.

328
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,000
Thank you.

329
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,220
He's an excellent and self-disciplined actor.

330
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,250
No need for that.

331
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,320
By the way, Director Zheng,

332
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,170
he doesn't know that I helped him get the role.

333
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,990
Director, please keep it as a secret.

334
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:31,940
Mr. Gao.

335
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:34,730
Though Mr. Lu recommended him,

336
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,780
he performed well during the audition.

337
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,590
Right.

338
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,550
Right.

339
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,650
Okay. Let's continue.

340
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,210
Go on.

341
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,150
Come on. Red packets.

342
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,380
Thank you, director.

343
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,020
Work hard.

[Good luck with the shooting!]

345
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,530
Come on. Stick out your hands. Come on.

346
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,340
Qiao,

347
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,440
later,

348
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,640
let's go on the stage and take a photo with Mr. Lu.

349
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,690
Come on. Good luck with the shooting. Work hard.

350
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,440
Work hard.

351
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,620
Do your best during the shooting.

352
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,380
Work hard. Work hard.

353
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,380
Thanks for your hard work.

354
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,020
Work hard.

355
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,050
Qiao.

356
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,140
Mr. Lu.

357
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,570
I'm here to support our artists.

358
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,430
You're the producer.

359
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,920
It's only natural that you're here.

360
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,070
Don't worry, Mr. Lu.

361
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,490
Although I'm not Ying Ge's artist,

362
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,940
I will do my best

363
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,380
to perform the role.

364
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,740
Thank you for your trust.

365
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,550
This role suits you well.

366
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:20,940
Do your best.

367
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:22,730
Don't worry.

368
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:23,980
Go for it!

369
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:28,950
[Good luck with the shooting!]

370
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,980
Come on. Qiaobei and the producer should take a photo together.

371
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,540
Okay. Come on.

372
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,680
Okay. Thank you.

373
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,250
[Big Dunk. Good luck with the shooting!]

374
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,180
Take two more photos.

375
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:30,940
Okay.

376
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,500
Come on. Look at the camera.

377
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,000
Gentlemen, smile.

378
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,860
Thank you for your support, Mr. Wang.

379
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,690
[Good luck with the shooting!]

380
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,660
It's a pleasure.

381
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,540
Welcome to visit us later.

382
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,540
Okay. No probelm. See you next time.

383
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,340
Okay. See you next time.

384
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,400
Director, bad news.

385
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,470
The supporting actress's agent called and said

386
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,180
there was a car accident on their way here.

387
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,280
Is it serious?

388
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,720
There's nothing serious with her,

389
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,220
but her face got injured and the wounds need to be sewed up.

390
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,340
You think it's nothing serious?

391
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:57,020
The actress hurt her face.

392
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:01,530
Inform the vice director for actors

393
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,480
to select some candidates.

394
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,510
Inform the coordinator, too.

395
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:04,980
Okay.

396
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,500
The shooting of all the supporting actress's scenes should be postponed.

397
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:07,290
Okay. Got it.

398
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:14,080
She can't come at such an important time as she has got injured.

399
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,660
What should we do?

400
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,090
I heard they are looking for a substitute.

401
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,860
This is a big movie.

402
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,140
We can't delay the progress.

403
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:25,280
Why don't we change the character to a man?

404
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,620
Anyway, for this movie,

405
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,420
it's enough to have me as the only actress.

406
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,260
Whoever else joins us will be eclipsed by me.

407
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,470
You're right.

408
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,170
I did a perfect job as the assistant.

409
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,100
What do you think?

410
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,960
[Big Dunk]

411
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:52,860

412

and hot-tempered actresses

413
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,190
to me from your company.

414
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,150
Okay. Thank you.

415
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,340
Director,

416
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,700
I want to recommend someone to you.

417
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,450
The one who played opposite me

418
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,359
during the audition.

419
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,670
Is she from your company?

420
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:11,940
No. Her name is Lu Wanwan.

421
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,829
She's a student from the Academy of Drama.

422
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,550
You'd better watch her audition clips first

423
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,550
before making a decision.

424
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,240
It feels comfortable to act with her.

425
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,520
Okay. I'll watch her audition clips.

426
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,430
Thank you, director.

427
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:23,839
I have to thank you

428
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,980
for being considerate towards the crew.

429
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,130
Okay. Now you should get ready.

430
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,510
Then we'll shoot the first scene at once.

431
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:29,540
Okay.

432
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,560
My power has finally increased to 100,000.

433
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,850
You must be busy playing games these days.

434
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,700
It's not enough. I still have to continue the practice.

435
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,980
You're in a good mood.

436
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
What happened?

437
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,020
Today,

438
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,820
Gu Qiaobei thanked me,

439
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,110
so I'm happy.

440
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,660
Do you know

441
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,860
what it means?

442
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,150
It means I've made a big step forward

443
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,860
to sign a contract with him.

444
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,860
Do you know Xu Anran?

445
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:17,900
Yes, I do.

446
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,490
Isn't she a popular actress recently?

447
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,260
Is she going to act in the Big Dunk?

448
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,210
Why did you suddenly mention her?

449
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,270
Do you have a crush on her?

450
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,530
What are you talking about?

451
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,220
She was supposed to be the supporting actress.

452
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:35,330
But she had a car accident

453
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,780
on the way to the launching ceremony.

454
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,020
Her face was injured.

455
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,340
She can't join the crew on time.

456
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,100
How could this happen?

457
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,140
What will you do?

458
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,780
Will you delay the shooting?

459
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,760
If this

460
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,380
happened to someone else,

461
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,500
he must be panicking.

462
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:51,770
But what about me?

463
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,620
Who am I?

464
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,100
I'm Ying Ge's boss and your brother.

465
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,130
I've been an elite in the entertainment industry for 30 years.

466
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,770
I'm experienced, handsome

467
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,260
and smart.

468
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,880
Plus, after my careful analysis

469
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,230
of this character,

470
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,840
I've got this conclusion.

471
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,210
This character is important but its requirements are low.

472
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,840
So,

473
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,200
I decided to ask you to give it a try.

474
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,100
What?

475
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,520
What did you say?

476
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,820
I want you to give it a try.

477
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,380
Me?

478
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,840
I didn't thought of you at first.

479
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:32,620
But the director said

480
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,560
after he watched the audition clip of you and Han Jingmo,

481
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,420
he thought it was good.

482
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,660
Since I'm the investor, he asked me about my opinion.

483
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:40,630
I took a look at it reluctantly.

484
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,540
It was not bad.

485
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,700
It was natural.

486
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,940
Really?

487
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,300
Can I really do it?

488
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,460
It's an important role. The supporting actress.

489
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,780
Can I really do it?

490
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,820
So the director

491
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:54,940
wants you

492
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,180
to have an audtion tomorrow.

493
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,250
Get ready for it carefully.

494
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:01,560
Brother, I really like that role.

495
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,780
Don't worry.

496
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,340
Don't worry.

497
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,820
I'll do my best.

498
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,430
I won't embarrass our Lu Family.

499
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,770
I can act in the Big Dunk.

500
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,540
No.

501
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:14,660
What's wrong?

502
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,500
If that's the case,

503
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,290
after I exert my ability normally,

504
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,780
with my excellent acting skills,

505
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:23,380
I will be successful soon in the audition.

506
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,070
If I succeed in the audition,

507
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,320
I will see Han Jingmo often, won't I?

508
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,500
Yes.

509
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:30,740
What's the problem?

510
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:31,780
If you succeed,

511
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,270
I'll aks Lin Wei to be your agent.

512
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:34,580
You know her well anyway.

513
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,540
No, no, no.

514
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:36,970
No need.

515
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,110
She's the best agent of our company.

516
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,500
She only has Han Jingmo as her actor.

517
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,960
It's not stressful for her to have one more actor.

518
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,300
She is not stressed.

519
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,870
But I am.

520
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,320
Can you be more confident about yourself?

521
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,590
She took the initiative to ask you to be Han's assistant.

522
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,090
Don't think too much.

523
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,600
You

524
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,240
just show your spirit

525
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,520
of being shameless.

526
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:02,990
Okay.

527
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,950
You're good at comforting people.

528
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,040
All right.

529
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,800
I'll ask Lin Wei to send you the script later.

530
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,550
Don't play games.

531
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,400
It's shocking.

532
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,090
This...

533
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,450
Right. The game.

534
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,030
Genius, I have to get offline.

535
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,120
[Genius, I have to get offline.]

536
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,380
[Genius, I have to get offline.]

537
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,380
[So suddenly.]

538
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,810
So suddenly.

539
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,460
I heard a piece of shocking news.

540
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,900
I have to get offline to get over the shock.

541
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,670
[I heard a piece of shocking news. I have to get offline to get over the shock. Bye, Genius.]

542
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:43,700
Bye, Genius.

543
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,370
Mind your posture.

544
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,500
Mind your rhythm.

545
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,890
Don't let your guard down.

546
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,340
Jiang Xun,

547
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,300
with your current attitude,

548
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,940
you'll never be able to play in the match.

549
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,940
No chance.

550
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,350
Where are you going?

551
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,060
Come back!

552
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,720
Jiang Xun!

553
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,900
Jiang Xun!

554
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,210
Okay. Done.

555
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,460
That's what I mean.

556
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,720
Try another scene.

557
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:36,940
Give her the script.

558
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,420
Okay.

559
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,540
It's done, Ma'am.

560
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,540
Okay. Thank you.

561
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,260
Come on.

562
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:02,960
Shoot the ball.

563
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,300
Is the light okay?

564
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,140
Yes.

565
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,180
Okay. This position is okay.

566
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:25,860
The camera.

567
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,300
Where should I put it?

568
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,050
Get out now.

569
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,290
What a coincidence.

570
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,600
It's not a coincidence.

571
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,080
I haven't seen you for a long time.

572
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:39,620
Ten days.

573
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,580
It's been a long time indeed.

574
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,290
Ten days are fine,

575
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,970
as I've been watching your new drama.

576
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,760
You acted well and you looked handsome.

577
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,360
No matter how handsome I looked, I wasn't as cool as you when you resigned.

578
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:51,980
Good.

579
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:55,710
I was fired suddenly.

580
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:57,360
I also despaired.

581
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,280
Ying Ge is a big company.

582
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,100
How could they do such a thing?

583
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,100
How unreliable.

584
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,500
During these few days after I got fired,

585
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,640
I felt really bad.

586
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,390
I couldn't eat or drink.

587
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,990
I was afraid something bad might happen.

588
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,260
I was afraid there was something

589
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,780
that I didn't tell you clearly.

590
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,220
I even dreamed of you at midnight.

591
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,000
Really?

592
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,860
But you didn't send me any message.

593
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,890
My mobile phone was broken two days ago.

594
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,020
I've just had it repaired.

595
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,380
You must be busy playing games these days.

596
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:39,200
Between Ink White seemed to say the same thing, too.

597
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:48,360
Xu Anran suddenly got hurt and had an accident.

598
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,340
So they asked me to come here.

599
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:50,830
I know.

600
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:51,470
I suddenly...

601
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,350
I look forward to working with you.

602
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,330
After all, I served you for the whole winter vacation.

603
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,540
When you got drunk,

604
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,260
you held my leg and didn't let me go.

605
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,240
Jingmo.

606
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,400
Has your assistant gone to work in the bank.

607
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,850
I almost forgot.

608
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,610
Han Jingmo

609
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,990
is not the only one whom I don't want to see in this crew.

610
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:27,510
I'm the substitute for Xu Anran.

611
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,050
I'm the actress Lu Wanwan.

612
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,430
Hello. Nice to meet you.

613
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,450
She?

614
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,200
She's my younger schoolmate.

615
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:37,670
Bring me another box.

616
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,350
Hello.

617
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,860
She used to be Han Jingmo's assistant.

618
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,560
I didn't expect her to become an actress.

619
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,030
It seems you had a good chat.

620
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,760
Let's meet the director first.

621

How is it?

625
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:55,350
Are you used to it?

626
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,730
Kind of.

632

Sorry, director.

633
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,060
Maybe I haven't got into the state yet.

634
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,700

635

00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:01,070
Why don't we shoot other scenes first?

681
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,380
Okay. It's settled then.

682
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,360
Thank you, director.

683
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,870
Sorry, director.

684
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,810
It's okay. Don't be nervous.

685
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,260
It's not that hard to peform this scene.

686
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,360
Let's shoot others' scenes first.

687
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,660
You can take a break first.

688
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:14,640
We'll shoot your scenes later.

689
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,020
Okay?

690
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,070
That's it.

691
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,010
Thanks for your hard work, director. Thanks, director.

692
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,910
Wanwan, you came.

693
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,330
Thank you

694
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:36,920
for what you did just now.

695
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,590
I finished that take finally.

696
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:42,690
You're a student from a professional school.

697
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,310
Why did you make a fool of yourself while facing the camera?

698
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,720
No.

699
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,910
I couldn't say the idiom well.

700
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:51,890
That line

701
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,410
happens to be my weakness.

702
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,300
When you acted with me,

703
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,550
I think you did a good job.

704
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:00,610
Next time,

705
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:03,050
if you have any lines you can't say,

706
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,660
you can communicate with the director at once

707
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:07,220
or ask me for advice more frequently.

708
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,340
Let me ask you now.

709
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,030
What did you say to the director?

710
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:13,420
Just guess.

711
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,750
Well, what did you say to him?

712
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,900
Do you have any tips?

713
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,500
I can tell him that next time.

714
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,380
I mean,

715
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:27,660
a smart brain is a good thing,

716
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,980
but you can't expect everyone to have it.

717
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,020
Right?

718
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:41,490
Pig.

719
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:43,780
How is it? It's your first time to act in a movie.

720
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,540
How do you feel?

721
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,820
Not good. The director scolded me.

722
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,760
I think I've delayed the progress.

723
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,810
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

724
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,230
Director Zheng's temper is just like that.

725
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,820
He may seem friendly,

726
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,060
but when he shoots a movie,

727
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,700
he'll be like a different person.

728
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,530
But it's good.

729
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,770
He can frighten the actors

730
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,300
so that the actors won't get too arrogant, right?

731
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:10,380
Actually, Mr. Lu sent you to the crew of the Big Dunk

732
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:12,140
because he thinks highly of Director Zheng's ability.

733
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,460
He can help to sharpen your acting skills

734
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,980
so that when your work comes out,

735
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,340
you won't be criticized because of your acting skills.

736
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,100
I understand.

737
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:19,820
By the way,

738
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,300
I asked Han to take care of you.

739
00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:25,020
Will it be too troublesome?

740
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,870
No.

741
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,680
He still has time to play games after filming.

742
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:30,490
Is it the Moonlight Blade he has endorsed?

743
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,250
I've never restrained him from doing this,

744
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,890
as long as he knows what he's doing.

745
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:36,920
But I heard that

746
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,590
he played quite well in that game.

747
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:39,840
Cut.

748
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,420
The director has finished shooting that scene.

749
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,100
Alright. Read the script carefully.

750
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,090
-Okay. -I'll talk to the director.

751
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,460
Thank you, Lin Wei.

752
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,020
You're welcome.

753
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,700
How are you two?

754
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,300
-Not bad. -Are you used to the shooting scenes?

755
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,020
Yes, I am.

756
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,220
How are your legs?

757
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,940
I feel refreshed now.

758
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,310
You've just got discharged.

759
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,400
It's so cold now.

760
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,420
Don't wander around.

761
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,270
Yes, Ma'am.

762
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,180
I can't stay idle at all.

763
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,450
I'll become a fat woman if I keep being idle.

764
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,990
I specially brought Shengkai here today.

765
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,750
You two must remember

766
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,340
to think about her.

767
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,120
Okay.

768
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,500
Miss Wei.

769
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,180
You came.

770
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,800
I bought some water for you guys.

771
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,650
Mr. Han.

772
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:25,180
Thanks for your hard work.

773
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:25,690
Thank you.

774
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,840
Thanks for your hard work, Mr. Gu.

775
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:28,260
Thank you.

776
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,400
You're a new member, right?

777
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,660
Thanks for your hard work.

778
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,180
Thank you, Miss Wei.

779
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,140
You're welcome.

780
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:40,780
Here you are.

781
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,540
Did you burn yourself?

782
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:42,680
I'm fine.

783
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,300
Wipe it.

784
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,150
Did you burn yourself?

785
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,200
No.

786
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,060
I'm fine.

787
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:51,020
It's surprising that the devil can be this gentle.

788
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,440
Be careful.

789
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,030
It's nothing.

790
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,440
I'm fine.

791
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,260
Not bad.

792
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,170
A suite?

793
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,100
It's quite big.

794
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,090
Are you used to living here?

795
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:09,490
Kind of.

796
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,020
If I need anything,

797
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:11,900
I'll tell you.

798
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,000
Reimburse me for the cost.

799
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,400
How was the shooting today?

800
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,700
Just so-so.

801
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,030
There was a scene in the afternoon that I couldn't pass.

802
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,300
I was scolded by the director.

803
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,620
Do your best, little girl.

804
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,840
I'll try not to be scolded tomorrow.

805
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,340
Just a small goal like that?

806
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,030
I'll try to make Han Jingmo be scolded tomorrow.

807
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,070
Good idea.

808
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:35,790
By the way,

809
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:36,810
please

810
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:39,520
give it to Qiao for me.

811
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,970
It's a cold-proof tool. It's necessary during the filming.

812
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,170
Where is mine?

813
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,790
You don't deserve it.

814
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:46,900
You've been scolded by the director and you still want some gifts?

815
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,600
Just memorize the script.

816
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,560
I'm talking to you.

817
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,420
Do you hear me?

818
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,540
Good luck.

819
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,390
I have to go.

820
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,010
Ask Lin Wei nfor help if you need anything. Don't ask me for help.

821
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,340
Why do I have such a brother?

822
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:08,090
He must be my adopted brother.

823
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,740
Hello, Little Leaf.

824
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,720
Are you busy?

825
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,120
I'm preparing for tomorrow's scenes.

826
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,890
There's a scene like this.

827
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,820
I don't understand

828
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:28,360
the mood of it.

829
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:29,980
I want to ask about your opinion.

830
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:44,660
Okay.

831
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:46,970
Got it.

832
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,900
Thank you, Little Leaf.

833
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,150
Love you.

834
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,580
Bye.

835
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:01,660
Think about something else.

836
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,060
Let me play the game.

837
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:08,179
[Moonlight Blade]

838
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,949
[Kaifeng]

839
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:18,590
Top Star of Lu, you deserve this ending today.

840
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,600
What did you just say?

841
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,810
No, no, no.

842
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,040
I understand that you're a rookie.

843
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,000
Alright. Don't be angry.

844
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,230
I'll take you to practice.

845
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,800
Stop laughing.

846
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,620
Han.

847
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,150
I don't understand

848
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,690
why you have to move back

849
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,060
and live with the people of the crew.

850
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:42,969
