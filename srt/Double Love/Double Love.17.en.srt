00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,070
I borrowed you from Lu Wanwan for two days.

10
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,770
You'll go for dinner.

11
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,199
But I'm not hungry.

12

I won't eat.

13
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:13,070
The bodyguard isn't supposed to eat there, okay?

The results of our event are really good.

19
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,140
The same model you endorsed

20
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,579
has become a popular brand as soon as it goes online.

21
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:36,970
It becomes an Internet celebrity product immediately.

22

23
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:39,190

is beautiful and exquisite.

25
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,990
So we must cooperate for a long time.

He has been involved in a lot of industries.

38
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,430
But he seldom attends activities.

39
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,650
He's usually the one behind the scenes.

40
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,580
It turns out that my bodyguard

41
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,760
is so low-key.

42
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,820
He even invests in our jewelry...

43

to be my bodyguard?

58

00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,030
So I came back to prepare.

175

Wanwan.

176
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,460
I

177
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,400
have something to tell you.

178
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,660
There are many problems in this drama.

179
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,170
You got hurt

180
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,700
and were framed.

181
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,610
It's hard to film.

182
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,950
As your brother,

183
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,480
I didn't protect you well.

184
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,610
Besides,

185
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,780
I've been too busy lately.

186
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,880
You've been in the team for so long.

187
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,140
I didn't have time to care about you.

188
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,860
I'm really sorry.

189
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,640
I hope you don't blame me.

190
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,020
Of course not.

191
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,770
I'm fine.

192
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,610
And I'm very used to it.

193

194

196
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,820
But since you're back today.

197
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,120
I will

198
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,670
cook a bowl of noodles for you.

199
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,340
Wish you a successful completion

200
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,880
of your first play in life.

201

Are you alone here?

00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,700
I came out for some fresh air.

Of course not.

The wrap is a great thing.

359
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,010
You seem to

360
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:15,010
treat shooting as a project.

361
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,690
Since we're here, let's take it easy.

I know

363
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,960
acting is your true passion.

364
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,890
Right?

365
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,320
It's the same.

366
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,950
Acting, recording variety shows,

367
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,120
singing sometimes,

and drinking.

369
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,510
It's all the same. What's the difference?

370
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:40,760
Okay.

371
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,740
Then don't be sad.

372
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,490
You've debuted for so many years.

373
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,640
You have a smooth life.

374
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,770
And you are popular.

375
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:53,240
But have you ever stopped

376
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,670
to think about

377
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,040
what you really want?

378
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,840
So what?

00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,540
Celebrities can't do whatever they want,

00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,490
can they?

Qiao,

382
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,640
why don't you take this step?

383
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,010
Your company has so many restrictions on you,

384
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:20,930
and their ideas are so incompatible with yours.

385
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,010

-Our company... -Lu Guanghan.

387
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,490
I have told you many times.

388
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,580
My agent helped me a lot before.

389
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,820
Okay, I'll tell you

390
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,920
what it is today.

[Men's Chamber]

392
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,660
When I was in college,

393
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,280
I made a literary film.

394
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,860
I thought it's great.

395
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,100
I thought I'd made it.

396
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,030
I thought I was finally worthy.

397
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,470
Do you know what others said when I went out?

398
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,340
I went out to apply for a job at a company.

399
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,430
All of them told me,

400
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,370
"Gu Qiaobei, you can't do it."

401
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,230
They told me,

402
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,730
"you have no commercial value."

403
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,460
What is commercial value?

404
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:11,710
No way.

405
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,620
I watched that video.

406
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,350
I think it's good.

407
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,550
You did very well.

408
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,420
I want to sign you

409

because of that film. Do you know?

410
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,390

what would I be now without him?

00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,920
until after

522
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,800
the Couple PK Competition?

523
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,800
The Couple PK Competition?

524
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,780
Is it the official activity

525
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,430
to promote the system of Love as One Heart?

526
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,780
I've been looking forward to it for a long time.

527
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,360
Then let's wait

528
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,540
until the competition is over?

529
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,610
Yes, My Wife.

530
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,710
I have one more condition.

531
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,180
Don't call me "My Wife" anymore.

532
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,330
Yes. My Wife.

533
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:04,110
Han Beauty.

534
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:06,650
I'm sorry, honey.

535
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,010
I'll get off now.

536
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,160
Good night, Genius.

537
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:13,170
Good night.

538
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:17,620
Look at her.

539
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,350
If I tell her I'm Han Jingmo,

540
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,580
she'll think I lied to her on purpose.

541
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,050
I have to tell her in a better way.

542
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:38,140
[Are you done? I'll be there soon.]

543
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:36,620
Are you done?

544
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,710
I'll be there soon.

545
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,320
What's the matter? You have work to do again?

546
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,190
[Are you done? I'll be there soon.]

547
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,190
[Okay.]

548
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:41,900
Okay.

549
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,420
Nope.

550
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,250
I want to introduce someone to you.

551
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,310
Who is it?

552
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:50,420
Let's go.

553
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,770
This is my best friend, Little Leaf.

554
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,200
This is my boyfriend, Han Jingmo.

555
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,830
Hello.

556
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,670
My goodness.

557
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,890
I'm not used to seeing the real you in front of me.

558
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:05,580
[Bridge of Art]

559
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,720
I heard that Wanwan's study

560
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,670
is taken care of by you.

561
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:07,490
Thank you.

562
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,930
I have good grades, okay?

563
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,280
Stop talking nonsense.

564
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:12,590
So we're leaving.

565
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,380
Go ahead.

566
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:14,820
Bye.

567
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,620
Bye.

568
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,850
Let's go.

569
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:19,860
The safety belt.

570
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,470
Okay.

571
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,250
Lu Wanwan, something's wrong with you.

572
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,530
No, I am good.

573
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,830
I'm your girlfriend now.

574
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,280
Isn't it normal for me to do this?

575
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:04,850
Help yourself.

576
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,920
Have all of these.

577
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:06,500
Eat them all.

578
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
Infinite supply.

579
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,660
Free refill.

580
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,500
You'd better have them all.

581
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,540
You'd better

582
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,620
eat up all my money.

583
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,370
So I'll have a reason to cling onto you.

584
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:19,110
You wish!

585
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,200
What are you doing?

586
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,690
There's no one here.

587
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,960
Don't do PDA like this.

588
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,920
Let's dig in.

589
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,690
Go ahead. You first.

590
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,350
I'll eat the side of the egg tarts.

591
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,780
♫Don't be bothered by my nagging♫

592
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,380
♫I'm learning to curb my fondness♫

593
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,910
You eat the filling of egg tarts.

594
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,630
♫But why is it that every time I see you♫

595
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,910
♫I'm still nervous♫

596
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,770
♫I realized your cool face♫

597
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,530
♫Also has a gentle side♫

598
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,060
♫This love is filled with magic♫

599
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:04,220
♫I don't know what to do♫

600
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,100
The tip of strawberry must be sweeter.

601
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,110
♫Suddenly you take a step forward♫

602
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,480
♫And come close to my face♫

603
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,390
♫You put your heart close to my right shoulder♫

604
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:11,610
♫Your heartbeat is in my ear♫

605
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,960
♫Time is unconsciously♫

606
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,850
♫Fixed in between the breath♫

607
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,820
♫It's lucky that you're standing in front of me♫

608
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,280
What are you doing?

609
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,310
Well.

610
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,910
Why is my brother here?

611
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,470
What should we do?

612
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,910
What if he comes over?

613
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,770
We didn't do something evil.

614
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,300
Well.

615
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,650
When did he

616
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,560
start hearing?

617
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:53,820
Oh, no.

618
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:55,240
We're getting screwed.

619
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,910
What are you two doing?

620
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,680
I booked the whole place.

621
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,900
How'd you get in here?

622
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,280
Booked the whole place?

623
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,080
Do you know whose venue it is?

624
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,780
What were you doing just now?

625
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,730
Nothing.

626
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,320
We just

627
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,000
have a simple meal.

628
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,580
Did you tell your agent?

629
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,310
Did you tell your assistant?

630
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,490
Mr. Lu.

631
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,400
Since when did our company have

632
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,820
such troublesome terms?

633
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,850
Mr. Han Jingmo and I

634
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,860
are just colleagues.

635
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,410
It's a wrap.

636
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,850
So we have a meal together

637
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,500
and communicate with each other, right?

638
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,360
I also want to thank him

639
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,710
for his guidance.

640
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,850
Isn't that normal?

641
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,070
Right?

642
00:27:56,690 --> 00:27:59,290
It's right for celebrities to help each other.

643
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:02,400
But you don't have to eat alone.

644
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,460
Even if you want to eat,

645
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,880
you have to get an agent or an assistant.

646
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,830
It's fine that Lu Wanwan is a rookie.

647
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,910
But what about you?

648
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,050
You've been in this industry for so long.

649
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,450
You don't even know this?

650
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,100
In that case,

651
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,530
Mr. Lu, let me tell you formally.

652
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,110
Lu Wanwan and I are

653
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,700
master and disciple now.

654
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,820
Yes. And we are also friends.

655
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,650
We are teachers and students, but also friends.

656
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,380
You are teachers and students, but also friends?

657
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,340
We were

658
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:38,050
just talking about the drama.

659
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,630
Talking about the drama?

660
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:42,400
Good.

661
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,520
Then I will accompany you.

662
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,420
Even if you get photographed,

663
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,510
it'll also make all things right.

664
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,170
Am I right?

665
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,660
The tip of the strawberry.

666
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,520
The tip of the strawberry is so sweet.

667
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,430
Here, the bottom of the strawberry.

668
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:55,090
Wanwan.

669
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,560
Didn't you say the egg tart was delicious?

670
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,890
Do you want another one?

671
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,420
No, thanks.

672
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,790
I'm full.

673
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,680
You are full, right?

674
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:05,460
Yes.

675
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,470
Then I'll eat it.

676
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:11,340
I'll eat the side of the egg tarts,

677
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,470
you can eat the filling of the egg tarts.

678
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:16,870
Here.

679
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,520
Eat it.

680
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:17,950
Come on.

681
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,060
Mr. Lu, take your time.

682
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,840
Don't choke.

683
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,030
Don't choke.

684
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,070
It doesn't matter if I'm choking.

685
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,870
I'll have a headache if you get photographed.

686
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,710
Have it.

687
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,490
Are you full?

688
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:32,240
Okay.

689
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,600
Go home when you're full.

690
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,550
You, get in my car.

691
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,180
You.

692
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,350
Figure it out yourself.

693
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,650
Stop looking. Let's go.

694
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,100
Wait.

695
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,000
Goodbye, Mr. Han.

696
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,120
Mr. Han?

697
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,050
When did you get together?

698
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,990
Nonsense.

699
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,820
We didn't.

700
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,810
Stop.

701
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,750
Be honest with me.

702
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,540
I'm not a criminal.

703
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,260
If you date a popular male celebrity,

704
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,620
you'll become a criminal.

705
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,180
You may get scolded.

706
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,690
Do you know

707
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,490
what kind of person you are now?

708
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,070
Like the vicious parents who break up lovers

709
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,540
in movies and TV series.

710
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,030
We haven't done anything yet.

711
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,410
I am in the name of parents to stop you

712
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:51,090
from doing something stupid.

713
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,980
I'm afraid you'll do something impulsive.

714
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,160
Something impulsive?

715
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,770
What are you thinking about?

716
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,670
I am older than you

717
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,070
for several years.

718
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,220
So I have more experience than you do.

719
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,080
I'm caring about you. Do you know?

720
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,640
You are too old-fashioned.

721
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,770
I won't listen to it.

722
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,920
Too old-fashioned?

723
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,540
Well, no, no, not at all.

724
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,750
Your're in style.

725
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:26,030
Anyway, you have to listen to me.

726
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,610
Dating an actor won't end well.

727
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,700
Oh, come on.

728
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,770
I can't believe you're mad?

729
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:41,980
Bah!

730
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,730
-Bah! Bah. -Bah.

731
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,570
Keep your eyes on the road.

732
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,790
Brother, I'm hungry.

733
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,940
Me too.

734
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,860
Aren't you still mad at me?

735
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,290
Don't you still hate me?

736
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:24,450
I don't dare.

737
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,700
Food.

738

I'm hungry.

739
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,810
Is it Han Jingmo?

740
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,060
Open the door.

741
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:36,990
Coming.

742
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,350
You came just in time.

743
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,890
I'm starving.

744
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,330
Your brother makes so much money,

745
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,530
you won't be starved.

746
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,870
You have no idea.

747
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:01,370
Attention, please.

748
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,260
You should be self-disciplined as a female star.

749
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,650
An evil boss.

750
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,450
I bought some wine.

751
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:07,380
Let's drink it.

753

What a feast.

754
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,840
You came at the right time. I have a question.

755
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,660
While you were a bodyguard,

756
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,870
did Lu Wanwan have an affair

757
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,100
with a certain actor?

758
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,490
Yea, maybe a bit.

759
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,790
I knew it.

760
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,530
Han Jingmo, right?

761
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,400
Well...

762
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:40,210
I have a big gossip to share with you.

763
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,280
Recently,

764
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,840
Guan Yiwei, Beauty Guan.

765
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,210
Don't mention this woman in front of me.

766
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,360
She's so annoying.

767
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,100
I don't think

768
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,210
I'll have a relationship with her in my life.

769
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,610
Stop talking about that.

770
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,300
Tell me about the affair.

771
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,700

Zhao Jinghang is at my home.

774
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,210
She often

775
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,630
talks with Gu Qiaobei.

776
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,130

for you.

780
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,719
For our Ying Ge.

Fine.

784

How do you know where my house is?

796
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,700
I have my own way to figure it out.

To a place where there is no Guan Yiwei.

If she asks me, what should I do?

You can say I went to Mars.

He will be greatly stimulated.

Instead of being known like this,
