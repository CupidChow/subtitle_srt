But after I got the tissues for you,

you splashed water on me.

122

Unfaithful.

150
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,200
It has nothing to do with being unfaithful.

151

Not only that,

152
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,950
but also a bad attitude.

153
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,570
That's what fangirls are like.

I won't. So what?

You're too strict with your fans.

Don't follow me if you don't want to change it.

My fans posted the photos on Weibo yesterday.

170
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,299
But I just posted a Weibo

171
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,460
and clarified it.

172
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,960
