I'm afraid you would get sunburn,

I don't need to report to you where I am.

Yes.

64

Then I can still meet him.

67

Don't call him that in front of him later.

69

But the fans and the media call him that.

70
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,360
But he doesn't like it.

71
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,410
Then I won't call him that.

72
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,670
Are you his fan?

73
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,790
Yes.

75
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,030
Shallow.

76
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,930
He has a good figure.

77
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,100
Childish.

78
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,530

You said Qiao has a bad personality?

82
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,860
Actually

83
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,040
he enjoys people calling him Qiaoqiao.

84
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,540

85
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,170

What's the matter?

88
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,350
He likes to be called like this?

89
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,070
You are his...?

90
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:14,350
I'm not his fan.

91
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,300

93
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,450

but you're not his fan?

95
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,340
Is there any essential relationship

96
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,640
between these two?

97
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,730

102
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:40,350

What's wrong with your assistant?

106
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,780
I don't know. She just got discharged from the hospital.

107
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,460
Okay, cut the crap.

108
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,340
Hurry up and get on-line.

109
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,690
We haven't finished the game script yesterday.

110
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,490
You've been on-line quite frequently lately.

111
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,630
It's quite interesting.

112
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:07,970
Interesting?

113
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,470
What's interesting is Chu He who knocked you off.

114
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,660
Stop teasing me.

115
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,900

Stop it.

118
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,890
Finally I found some peace

119
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,980
in the game.

120
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,470
But Chu He

121
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:27,740
looks good.

122
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,100
Go ahead.

123
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:31,960

128
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,090
Eat up.

129
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,860
I'll buy more if you need more.

130

But

134
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,410
we can't waste them.

135
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,220
So I will finish them for you.

136
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,080
Not bad.

137
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,100

00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,210
Your fan is good at buying fruits.

139
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,450
I'll kill you.

140
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,700
It's quite sweet.

141
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,920
Do you want one?

142
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,970
Where's my weapon?

143
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,080
I want to kill someone.

144
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:51,140
You're a future actress.

145
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,460
Don't talk to me.

146
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,820
I'm starving. Let me have some first.

147
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:54,730
Wait.

148
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,470
Han Jingmo doesn't even let you eat?

149
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,240
No, no, no.

150
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,670
I have no appetite.

151
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,280
I was mad at him.

152
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,420
Okay.

153
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,140
Now,

154
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,130
give you two options.

155
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,440
First, resign yourself.

156
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,500
Second, get fired by him.

157
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,800
Don't worry.

158
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,160
Let me show you.

159
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,550
A selfie.

160
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,270
A photo with him.

161
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:22,980
I saw Gu Qiaobei today.

162
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,780
At the scene.

163
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,580
When I called you.

164
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,490
And then?

165
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,380
Your dear sister, I,

166
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,210
with my sharp heart,

167
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:30,900
I met Gu Qiaobei

168
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,720
through Han Jingmo.

169
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,530
Why don't I believe it?

170
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,159
Don't you believe me with all these pictures as evidences?

171
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,669
Let me tell you.

172
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,309
In the future,

173
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,370
I can help you to look for news

174
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,450
about Gu Qiaobei.

175
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,950
I can even know where he lives.

176
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,670
So, Mr. Lu,

177
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,420
you can't fire me

178
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,300
even for this.

179
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,550
Han Jingmo hasn't apologized to me yet.

180
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,680

181
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,080
Fine, fine, fine.

190
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,860
Mr. Lu,

191
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,130
there are so many artists

192
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,900
in your company.

193
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,490
Why are you only holding onto Gu Qiaobei?

194
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,480
Besides, it's not enough to have Han Jingmo?

195
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,570
You're too young to understand.

196
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,100
Back then,

197
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,380
when Qiaoqiao was in college,

198
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,170
he was already in a couple of niche literary movies.

199
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:37,010
Do you know that he is incomparable

200
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,410
in handling the roles,

201
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,270
and his expressiveness in front of the cameras is remarkable?

202
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,080
I still remember it until now.

203
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,810
If we talk about nowadays,

204
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,340
he would definitely win the Best New Artist Award.

205
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,780
So, an excellent artist like him.

206
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,570
If he stays in Lin Huang's entertainment company to do tv shows,

207
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,960
would it be any future for him?

208
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,830
I didn't expect that Qiaoqiao

209
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,530
has acted in some literary films.

210
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,950
You said you're his fan.

211

You don't look like it.

213
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,380
Anyway,

214

Get along with Qiaoqiao,

215
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:14,840
I must sign him.

216
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,260

217
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,800
You change your mind so quickly.

218
