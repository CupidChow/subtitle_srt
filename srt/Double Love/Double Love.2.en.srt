00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,450
Next one.

341
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:20,080
Next artist.

342
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,470
How about you drink mine?

343
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,730
I haven't drunk it yet.

344
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,910
Thank you.

345
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:36,390
Thank you.

346
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,320
You're welcome.

347
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:38,390
By the way,

348
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,070
I've already arranged

349
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:40,920
for your temporary assistants.

350
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,580
I'll do it as soon as possible.

351
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,870
I think she's good.

352
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,180
Why don't you ask her to be my assistant?

353
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,480
Do you know her?

354
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,430
No.

355
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,620
That's why

356
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,810
I need your help.

357
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,460
Okay.

358
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,390
I'll get to know her thought.

359
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,650
Is she here for dinner?

360
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,510
Lu Wanwan.

361
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,180
Hello.

362
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,820
I'm Han Jingmo's agent,

363
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:13,600
Lin Wei.

364
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,310
Hello.

365
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,570
I...I know you.

366
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,930
I haven't booked dinner yet.

367
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,070
Miss Lu, you're really humorous.

368
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Here's the thing.

369
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,740
Han's assistant

370
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,940
took a long leave.

371
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:29,530
So recently,

372
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:30,300
I've been

373
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,030
taking care of his daily life.

374
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,090
But I have lots to do in the company, too.

375
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:34,620
So I can't

376
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,510
take care of him on set every day.

377
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,420
So?

378
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,460
Han seems to

379
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,760
admire you today.

380
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,210
Me?

381
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,710
I wonder if you want to

382
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:51,140
be Han Jingmo's temporary assistant?

383
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,430
Your job is supposed to last for 2 months,

384
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,740
which is during the winter vacation.

385
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,500
The salary will be 20% higher

386
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,720
than the average level in the industry.

387
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,790
Will I work

388
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,130
for little money?

389
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,860
For money, I need to work for Han Jingmo,

390
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,750
and provide a full range of services for him.

391
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,560
Of course not.

392
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,790
Since you want to develop in this industry,

393
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,550
why don't you start from the bottom?

394
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,190
Han

395
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:10,640
is an excellent artist.

396
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,630
Being his assistant,

397
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:12,830
you can learn a lot

398
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,720
and get some useful experience.

399
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,660
Wait, if I can be his assistant and by his side,

400
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,150
then I don't have to wait 10 years for my revenge.

401
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:21,080
I accept the job.

402
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:21,950
Okay.

403
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,940
Please leave your phone number.

404
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,150
This is

405
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,270
Han's address.

406
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,230
From tomorrow on,

407
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:35,110
you'll officially be his assistant.

408
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,850
So soon?

409
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,300
You don't even train me?

410
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:37,860
No need.

411
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,460
He won't trouble others.

412
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,430
And his hand is injured.

413
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,940
I haven't arranged any work for him lately.

414
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,270
Maybe a week later,

415
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,550
he'll start working.

416
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,910
He really got hurt during the basketball game.

417
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,410
You noticed this?

418
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,550
You're very detail-oriented.

419
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,710
Looks like I can

420
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,640
leave him to you.

421
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:57,590
By the way,

422
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,270
I'll ask someone to draft two contracts tomorrow.

423
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,430
Please sign it

424
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,670
after reading and checking it.

425
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,230
Okay.

426
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:04,950
Thank you.

427
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,070
Han Jingmo.

428
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:17,470
I'll repay you for pouring water.

429
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,060
Wait and see for the next two months.

430
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,650
I'm back.

431
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,680
Lu Wanwan, are you out of your mind?

432
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,630
You already knew?

433
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,960
You are my sister.

434
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,450
How can you be Han Jingmo's assistant?

435
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,750
I was just impulsive.

436
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,820
I didn't sleep well and agreed on impulse.

437
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,080
You didn't sleep well?

438
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,710
Reject Lin Wei now.

439
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,070
I've promised her.

440
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,890
It's not good for me to reject it again.

441
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,070
Why not?

442
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,850
Just reject her.

443
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:54,900
Hurry up. Now!

444
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:56,980
Brother,

445
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:58,610
do you think Lin Wei knows

446
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,540
I'm your sister?

447
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,810
Lin Wei is so wise.

448
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:02,900
Why would she

449
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,110
find a stranger

450
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:05,770
to be Han Jingmo's assistant?

451
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,380
You mean

452
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,190
she knew I am your sister,

453
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:10,920
but she didn't tell Han Jingmo?

454
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,890
Don't try to fool me.

455
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,610
Reject her at once.

456
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,630
Don't forget

457
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,090
how he treated you before.

458
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:19,760
Brother.

459
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,980
Am I that weak?

460
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,250
Haven't you heard?

461
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,770
You have to take revenge on your own.

462
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,500
I've never heard of such a lame way of revenge.

463
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,790
You're really something.

464
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:34,270
How old are you?

465
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,200
You really worry too much about me.

466
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,880
Take a rest.

Sorry.

It's not your fault.

You can take it.

But at this stage,

you need someone to guide you.

It will be great if he can guide me.

He just has an undeserved reputation.

Isn't that too troublesome?

You can't defeat him.

Well,

664
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,310
why is she here today?

665
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,640
Surprised?

670
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,190
Why can't an assistant

671
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,650
enter a celebrity's home?

672
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,840
I want her to adapt to her assistant work as soon as possible.

673
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,900

674
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,800
Sister.

675
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,600
You should have told me in advance.

676
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,260
Right?

677
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,070
She's the person you want to hire.

678
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,200
Now she arrived earlier.

679

Aren't you happy about it?

680
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,790
It must be the wrong way to knock at the door.

Let me knock at it again.

00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,330
