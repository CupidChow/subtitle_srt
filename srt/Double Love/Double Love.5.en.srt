Qiao, why are you here?

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,920
What a coincidence.

6
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,970
Hello.

7
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,190
Jingmo.

8
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,700
I heard you hurt your hand. Are you okay?

9
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,390
Well...

10
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:47,870
His hand

11
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,100
was injured during filming.

12
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,100
It's nothing serious. Don't worry.

13
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,210
Be careful.

14
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,550
Why do I feel something is going on between you two?

Let's eat together if you haven't.

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,860
I watched your food show before.

36
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,870
You seem to be a good cook.

37
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,020
Yes. He made sweet and sour ribs.

38
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,440
It's completely burned.

39
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,280
That's a hobby,

40
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,920
not my specialty.

41
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,930
You're too modest.

42
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,340
I've watched the show.

43
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,270
I think

44
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,450
although it doesn't look good,

45
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:02,820
maybe

46
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,450
it tastes good, right?

47
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,020
It doesn't taste good.

48
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,160
You said it was okay, right?

49
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,690
If I don't care about colour or flavor,

50
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,420
it's not bad.

51

We can have a match.

54
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,320
Maybe two negatives make a positive, right?

55

No, I won't.

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:31,830
And this.

176
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,490
My signature dish, sweet and sour ribs.

177
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,320
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes.

178
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,190
I made this.

179
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,390
It smells so good.

180
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,180
Here, try it.

181
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,020
Let me try it.

182
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:39,090
Try it.

183
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,210
Although the appearance...

184
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,000
Delicious.

185
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,340
Wanwan, you're so good at cooking.

186
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,680
I didn't expect that.

187
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,100
-Right? -Teach me how to make it.

188
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,900
Try it. It's so delicious.

189
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,980
It's so delicious.

190
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,900
Is it good?

191
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,220
You tried it?

192
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,220
No.

193
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,440
Because I think it might not taste good.

194
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,000
Try it. It's good.

195
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,910
I'm not stupid.

196
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,630
I didn't swallow it.

197
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,060
You swallowed it yourself. Don't blame me.

198
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:28,850
You two eat. Hurry up.

199
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,200
Come on, try one more.

200
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,020
Coming.

201
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:34,900

202
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,670
You're here too.

203
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,150
Mr. Lu.

204
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:38,780
You...

205
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,740
Are you here to see Jingmo?

206
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,140
He's inside.

207
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,300
Yes.

208
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,430
Come in.

209
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,860
Jingmo, I heard you got hurt during the shooting.

210
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:48,950
I was so worried.

211
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,260
Are you okay? Does it hurt?

212
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,250
I'm fine.

213
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:51,900
Mr. Lu.

214
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,090
I worried about you.

215
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,370
You didn't tell me you were coming.

216
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,050
As the boss of Ying Ge,

217
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,570
I should care about my artists.

218
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:03,510
Mr. Lu, Qiao...

219
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,580
Mr. Gu just made a table of

220
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,350
his signature dishes.

221
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,290
Try it.

222
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,220
You are?

223
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:10,970
I am...

224
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:12,920
Stand up and talk to my boss.

225
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,470
Mr. Lu, I'm Han Jingmo's temporary assistant.

226
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,430
I'm Lu Wanwan.

227
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,520
Hello.

228
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,490
Hello.

229
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,160
I heard from Lin Wei.

230
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,460
Qiao is really something.

231
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,360
You're good at both acting and cooking.

232
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:31,970
Great.

233
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,800
Just so-so.

234
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,500
My cooking is actually average.

235
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,020
This is the sweet and sour ribs made by Qiao.

236
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:36,910
Would you like to try it?

237
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,190
It smells so good.

238
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,030
Of course.

239
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,500
Yes.

240
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,060
Delicious.

241
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:10,320
It's very impressive.

242
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,690
I've never tasted such a special dish.

243
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,150
It tastes good.

244
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,490
Despite the look,

245
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,420
it's as chewy as a Michelin dish.

246
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,220
Right?

247
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,730
Speaking of which,

248
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,430
Ying Ge

249
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,200
is preparing a food show.

250
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,400
Qiao, you are so good at cooking.

251
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,550
I wonder if you are interested.

252
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,590
I think I should discuss it with my agent.

253
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:48,970
Of course.

254
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,230
You must, right?

255
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,030
However,

256
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,060
if you are like Jingmo

257
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,310
who is an artist of Ying Ge,

258
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,460
then everything will be more convenient,

259
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,210
right?

260
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,170
Qiao, I don't know if...

261
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,790
Mr. Lu,

262
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,460
Thank you for your kindness.

263
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,740
But now,

264
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,710
I really don't want a job-hopping.

265
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,380
Thank you.

270
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,050

Maybe tomorrow.

272
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,580
Right?

273
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,760
Am I right, little assistant?

274
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,950
Yes.

275
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,670
Mr. Gu and Jingmo

276
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,980
are also good friends.

00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,840
I was taking care of the patient at his house.

349
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:52,480
He, do you have improper relationship

350
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,710
with your boss?

351
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,380
It's something that can't be described.

352
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,810
What are you imagining?

353
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,500
A bossy president fell in love with you.

354
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,170
Alright, don't say that.

355
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,640
Genius is the best to me.

356
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,060
Look at you.

357
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:10,099
She must have fallen in love with the bossy president.

358
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,980
Genius, you've changed.

359
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,900
You weren't like this before.

360
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,540
Let me tell you.

361
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,050
We are just employer and employee.

362
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,910
Although the salary he gave me

363
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:26,010
is 20% higher than industry average.

364
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,099
Is that normal?

365
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,720
Master, are you alright?

366
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,680
It's hilarious.

367
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,140
A bossy president fell in love with you.

368
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,740
Isn't it funny?

369
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,130
Three Swordsmanship.

370
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,140
Is your net narrow?

371
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,790
Chu, turn back.

372
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,100
He...

373
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:54,120
You're a good girl.

374
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,960
You can't be degraded like this.

375
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,960
Don't look at me like that.

376
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,320
Why can't I explain it to you?

377
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,100
Forget it.

378
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,310
It's time.

379
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,950
She goes to work for the boss.

380
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,260
Let's go to do our task.

381
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:10,960
Let's go.

382
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,030
Your net is too slow.

383
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,030
Do you want to change a set package?

384
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,590
Change what?

385
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:25,180
It's good that it works.

386
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,240
How long can we  with such a profession stay at home for a year?

387
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,690
Don't you always do variety shows?

388
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:32,020
Those take little time.

389
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,210
You have plenty of time to stay at home.

390
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,360
Damn you!

391
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,540
You almost touched my arm.

392
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,580
Why are you suddenly so kind

393
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,660
and start to protect Chu He?

394
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,610
Did you come up with a new idea

395
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,000
to make fun of her again?

396
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,230
I'm thinking.

397
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,840
But

398
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,680
are you really not going to consider

399
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,100
Mr. Lu's proposal?

400
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:02,330
Stop talking about that.

401
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,690
Send him a message when you have time.

402
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,900
Tell him to give up.

403
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:08,870
Well. Why are you

404
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:10,000
talking about this?

405
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,580
Finish this game and log out.

Don't steal the Internet speed from me.

407
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,490
Okay.

408
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,580
Tell my teammates that.

409
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,950
I'm going to bed.

410

Sleep, sleep, sleep. All you know is sleep.

Hello, Miss Wei.

415
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,090
There's a variety show in two days.

416
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,150
It will take a whole day.

417
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,360
Go with Han.

418
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,690
Someone will contact you about the details.

419
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,460
Okay, Miss Wei.

420
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,790
I'll complete the task.

Healthy and delicious, you'll be satisfied.

422

Last time, spicy buns. This time, sandwiches,

423
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,400
Do I look like someone

424
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,050
who falls twice in the same toilet?

425
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,450
You are so picky

426
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,960
and now you're half-disabled.

427
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,390
I'm afraid you don't have anywhere to eat early in the morning.

428
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,560
So I bought it for you.

429
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,420
Suit yourself.

430
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,170
Forget it.

431
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,570
Judging from your reaction,

432
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:22,870
I'm sure

433
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,900
this sandwich is not poisonous.

434
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,150
How did I react?

435
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:28,740
Your anger is real.

436
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,740
It can't be fake with your acting skills.

437
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,550
You're insulting my acting.

438

What do you mean?

441
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,580
You pulled me

442
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,940
with a lot of strength.

443
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,650
So it hurts a lot now.

444
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,090
You're not good at acting.

445
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,000
Forget it.

446
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,340
I'm not eating.

447
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,950
Come on.

520
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,320
and go back tomorrow.

521
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,190
Sleep in the guest room?

522
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,230
Or the sofa.

523
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,870
No, I mean

524
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,570
you want me to sleep at your place?

525
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,550
I don't want to see you on the news the next day.

526
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:06,130
A driver met a black-hearted girl.

527
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,790
It's not good to sleep at your place.

528
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:18,700
Can you bear a driver meets someone

529
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,220
like you?

530
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,990
He's so mean.

531
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,620
It's a pity he has such a handsome face.

532
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,580
Are you suspecting me of doing something to you?

533
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:33,780
Don't worry.

534
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,950
Someone like you...

535
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,010
I don't have to.

536
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,010
You don't have to...

537
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,320
What do you mean? Tell me clearly.

538
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,780
I'll take it if you don't want it.

539
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,340
No pajamas.

540
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,450
I can only wear this bathrobe.

541
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,330
You don't have to be so formal.

542
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,210
Get up.

543
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,610
Don't move.

544
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,210
Don't come out later.

545
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,260
Gu Qiaobei is coming to deliver breakfast.

546
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,470
Qiao is coming?

547
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:19,780
So,

548
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,780
stay inside. Don't come out.

549
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,680
Why?

550
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,470
The way you look now

551
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,500
will make him misunderstand.

552
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,060
Coming.

553
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,510
Why did you eat so much in the morning?

554
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,270
Are you a pig?

555
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,560
You won't survive.

556
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,060
I'm hungry.

557
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,340
Believe it or not,

558
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,390
I'll block you

559
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,590
if you ask me to buy you breakfast again.

560
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,160
I can buy it for you next time.

561
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,400
All right, go home.

562
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,000
Why do you have women's clothes?

563
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,030
No, I got my costumes dirty.

564
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,250
I took them back to clean them up.

565
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,780
Come on.

566
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,080
What happened?

567
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,680
We've known each other for so many years.

568
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,510
When did I lie to you?

569
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,210
Good for you, Big Grey Wolf.

570
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,990
What? I slept in that room.

571
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,150
My phone is ringing.

572
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,680
We've known each other for so many years.

573
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,480
Have you slept in the guest room?

574
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,630
No.

575
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,970
It's my own house.

576
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,310
I'll stay in the guest room to experience if the bed is comfortable.

577
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,030
Can't I?

578
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,970
Experience it?

579
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,510
I want to experience it too.

580
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:54,780
No, I think you're dirty.

581
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,720
So what if I experience your guest room?

582
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,140
I...

583
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:57,900
Stop.

584
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:24,670
Okay.

585
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,030
Is it Li Weiqian?

586
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:28,840
Right?

587
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,780
Li Weiqian.

588
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
What do you think?

589
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:37,910
I know you don't like her.

590
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,780
No, you have to tell me who it is.

591
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,440
Who is it? Tell me.

592
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,000
It's none of your business.

593
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:47,160
No one is here. Get out.

594
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,800
Is she someone I don't know?

595
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,990
-I'm hungry. I want to eat. -No.

596
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,690
You're an idol.

597
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:53,290
You have to pay attention to your public image.

598
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,740
Come out

599
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,300
Qiao is gone.

600
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,880
You're disappointed.

601
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:13,000
I missed another chance to meet my idol close.

602
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,660
How can I not be disappointed?

603
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,080
Then look at me.

604
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,830
You're different from Qiao.

605
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,490
Shut up and eat.

606
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,910
Qiao brought so much breakfast.

607
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,320
-You have no idea that I found. -Qiao.

608
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,470
What a coincidence.

609
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,000
Han Jingmo.

610
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:55,510
Mr. Lu, why are you here?

611
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:58,950
The air in your neighborhood is nice and the environment is nice.

612
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,490
It's suitable for exercise.

613
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,060
No, I finally moved

614
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,100
and lived in a tranquil environment for a year.

615
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,160
Am I going to change my address again?

616
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,430
I'm leaving, Mr. Lu.

617
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,360
Qiao.

618
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,770
Don't be so polite.

619
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,840
Don't worry. I won't be like before.

620
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,360
It's up to you to sign the contract or not.

621
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,880
I respect your decision.

622
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:21,980
Are you serious?

623
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,350
Of course.

624
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,550
I just hope

625
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,230
to have your number.

626
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:28,890
If you change your mind,

627
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,270
you can call me anytime.

628
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,390
We still live our own lives, okay?

629
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:33,550
I won't bother you.

630
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:34,050
Okay?

631
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,510
It's going to rain soon, Mr. Lu.

632
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,700
Go back early after exercising.

633
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,430
I'm leaving.

634
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:48,040
OK.

635
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,380
Thanks, Qiao.

636
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,060
Take care.

637
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:21,670
Morning.

638
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,639
Guess who I ran into

639
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:28,050
when I went to Jinxiu Garden to exercise

640
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,460
this morning.

641
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:30,770
What?

642
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:33,489
The neighborhood Han Jingmo lives in.

643
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:34,670
Did he find me

644
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,489
spent the night at Han Jingmo's?

645
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,150
He won't kill me, will he?

646
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,540
You're disconnected.

647
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,620
Guess who I ran into.

648
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,750
Han Jingmo.

649
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,719
What's so surprising about meeting him?

650
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,980
It's Gu Qiaobei.

651
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,699
What a coincidence.

652
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,360
Why did you go to

653
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:58,510
his neighborhood in the early morning?

654
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,770
For morning exercise.

655
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:03,080
And see if I can meet my Qiao.

656
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,770
Your Qiao?

657
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:09,120
Your sister stayed out last night.

658
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,910
Why don't you care about me?

659
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,440
You told me.

660
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,420
You were busy yesterday

661
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,280
and didn't have time to come back.

662
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:16,910
You're an adult.

663
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,770
What's there to care about?

664
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,080
You won't die anyway, right?

665
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,270
His neighborhood is so nice.

666
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,060
The air is nice and the environment is nice.

667
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:26,710
Right?

668
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:27,840
Well.

669
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,650
As a good young man,

670
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,390
shouldn't you prefer pretty female stars?

671
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,410
It's mainly that

672
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,350
I really wanted to poach him.

673
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,250
I feel very uneasy

674
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:40,100
that I didn't poach him.

675
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,660
Then poach him.

676
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:42,460
Just wait.

677
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,510
I'll poach him sooner or later.

678
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,670
I've got his number.

679
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:54,550
But it's not good to disturb him often.

680
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:56,240
Mainly,

681
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,670
I promised him

682
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:59,770
not to pester him like before.

683
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,410
There's nothing I can do.

684
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,070
Han Jingmo told me

685
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,950
he also played Moonlight Blade.

686
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:07,610
You can ask about his account.

687
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,610
He's easy to deal with in the game.

688
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,670
Please register an account for me.

689
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,740
Find out his account first

00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,510
He's my friend.

864
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,040
I take him to play together.

865
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:46,850
A man?

866
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:49,710
Fine.

867
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:53,060
But seeing your gossip girlfriend

868
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,600
being so nice to someone else,

869
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,300
it's quite strange.

870
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,320
Gossip girlfriend?

871
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,230
You and I...

872
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,060
Since it's a gossip,

873
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,050
it means it's not true.

874
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,400
It doesn't matter.

875
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:11,480
I mean I don't care about these gossips.

876
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:12,830
I don't mean anything else.

877
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,220
Don't be nervous.

878
00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,720
I'm not nervous. Who's nervous?

879
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,050
I was nervous.

880
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:24,600
At first,

881
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,150
I knocked Genius off.

882
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,480
That's why there are so-called rumors.

883
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,700
Logically speaking,

884
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,820
I should be responsible for Genius.

885
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,080
You don't have to.

886
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,130
Don't worry, Genius.

887
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:37,760
I'll take care of your game life

888
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,570
in the future.

889
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,450
[We'll go out for meal.]

890
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:41,590
We'll go out for meal.

891
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:45,170
I'll go down first. Hurry up.

892
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:54,380
[He just played a game today. He knows nothing. Let me take care of him.]

893
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:54,380
[He?]

894
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:54,380
[You have meal together. You are close?]

895
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:49,940
You have meal together.

896
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,240
You are close?

897
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:58,440
[He?]

898
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:58,440
[You have meal together. You are close?]

899
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:58,440
[Love and fight]

900
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,540
Love and fight.

901
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:20,170
Hello.

902
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:21,440
Come pick me up now.
