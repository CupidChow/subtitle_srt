176
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,420
The conditions are generous and the company is actively responding to it.

177
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,900
It's highly likely that we can get the endorsement.

178
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,210
No.

179

Don't worry. I'll get you

a high-end mountain bike

181
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,040
which is suitable for men.

182

You got a new endorsement again.

That's so you.

188

Why don't you ask her to become a regular employee at my place?

198
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:40,550
No.

199
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,140
Of course I have to torture her myself.

200
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,790
Torture her by yourself? Is it necessary?

201

00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:44,110
hands, abdominals,

348
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,670
and legs.

349
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,550
Following this order,

350
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,970
you were looking at my abdominals, right?

351
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,280
How did you know?

352
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,260
I didn't disconnect from the Internet.

353
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,620
Next, will you look at the legs?

354
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,770
I just want to see

355
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,080
how your hand wound is.

356
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,010
We've met for so long.

357
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,390
You just remembered that I hurt my hand?

358
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:06,990
No.

359
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:10,500
Isn't the Internet said that you're handsome,

360
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,839
silent, noble and cool?

361
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,500
Why does it not match

362
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,460
your real image?

363
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,079
You mean

364
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,260
I'm not handsome?

365
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,280
I'm not talking about that.

366
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,960
I mean

367
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,390
you're not silent at all.

368
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,490
Before I met you,

369
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,970
I was indeed silent.

370
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,290
But now,

371
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,170
I just want to make you uncomfortable.

372
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:36,860
By the way,

373
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,130
I have to congratulate you.

374
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,360
I heard you got the endorsement for Mountain Down.

375
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,480
Miss Lin Wei is so efficient.

376
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,790
She got it in a week.

377
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,150
You're going to shoot an advertisement soon, right?

378
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,140
In my opinion,

379
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,420
I should thank the person who posted the post on Post Bar.

380
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,350
If she hadn't deliberately smeared me,

381
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:54,410
I wouldn't have got the endorsement.

382
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,680
Do you think

383
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,060
she is mad now?

384
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,260
He got a trending topic and an endorsement.

385
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,780
This is a big loss to me.

386
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,480
500 yuan for damaging the car.

387
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,630
It'll be deducted from your salary.

388
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,410
Creep.

389
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,890
Nice to meet you.

390
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,000
On behalf of Mountain Down Advertisement,

391
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,100
I welcome you.

392
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,830
Mountain Down Advertisement

393
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:51,550
follows high-end styles.

394
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,690
We don't care about the number of brand ambassadors.

395
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:55,170
We care about the qualities instead.

396
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,940
Let's drink a toast.

397
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:57,810
Come on.

398
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:58,970
Drink with President Liu.

399
00:18:58,970 --> 00:18:59,860
To everyone.

400
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,170
Gosh!

401
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,560
Isn't this Han Jingmo's on-screen couple

402
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,490
and gossip girlfriend Li Weiqian?

403
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,310
I have to say

404
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,630
her face

405
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,330
looks much better

406
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,420
than her pictures.

407
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,080
Thanks for Director Li and President Liu's support.

408
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,380
I'm inexperienced.

409
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,310
If I don't perform well tomorrow,

410
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,170
please forgive me.

411
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,950
Miss Li, you're too humble.

412
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,840
Mountain Down hasn't made mistakes

413
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,270
in choosing right persons.

414
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,670
Here.

415
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,590
I look forward to working with you.

416
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:33,230
Thank you.

417
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,140
I look forward to working with you too, Jingmo.

418
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,120
Jingmo?

419
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,100
Are they a real couple?

420
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,100
Here, Jingmo.

421
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,400
I'd like to drink a toast to you.

422
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:00,630
I hope our cooperation will be a success.

423
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,500
Director Li, I look forward to working with you.

424
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,800
Cheers.

425
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,480
But they

426
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,950
don't look like a couple.

427
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,490
Are they too good at acting

428
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,460
or not a real couple?

429
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,140
I'm a vegetarian.

430
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,910
No wonder we have to come one day earlier.

431
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:30,100
It's for business.

432
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,640
Because we'll shoot the sunrise tomorrow.

433
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,550
Should I get you a glass of water?

434
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,180
No need. I'm not thirsty.

435
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:40,870
I'm sleepy.

436
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,260
Did you forget this is my room?

437
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,200
Right.

438
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,670
You can't drive in private.

439
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:59,070
You asked me to be your driver and help you open the door.

440
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,010
You even came to the dinner.

441
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,770
You really enjoyed it.

442
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,640
You are really

443
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,530
the most high-maintenance assistant I've ever seen.

444
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,530
That's because

445
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,970
you're the most high-maintenance artist.

446
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,680
We'll start working at 3 o'clock tomorrow. Sleep early.

447
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,160
You can only sleep for a few hours.

448
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,240
See you.

449
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,240
After the new version is out,

450
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,170
the game is getting harder to play.

451
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,020
I beat Deadly Melody yesterday.

452
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:45,040
ABCC has a grudge against Chu He.

453
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,680
It is said that ABCC is divided into two groups.

454
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,250
One group

455
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:50,290
keeps cursing in the safe zone.

456
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,650
Another group has been fighting in the wild all the way.

457
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,850
I don't know if it will cause a guild war.

458
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,140
Look at World channel now.

459
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,990
Genius belongs to Time Flies Flower Blooms.

460
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:02,580
That's right.

461
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,900
Chu He is a waste of space.

462
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,740
In my opinion,

463
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,190
she should delete the account and leave the server.

464
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,260
That's right. Leave now.

465
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,410
She should leave. Why should Chu He be here?

466
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:09,120
She should stop playing.

467
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:15,380
[Has Been Being Given the Tea for 100 Years] [Luo Huayu]

468
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,860
They're the first place in the polls

469
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,120
on couples quarterly.

470
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:13,320
She's wanted online.

471
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,250
This time, there will be a big show.

472
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,400
Chu He, you're a coward!

473
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,530
What a loser!

474
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,580
You only hide yourself in tales.

475
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,260
We, ABCC, will keep watch everyday

476
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,880
at the place where you enter the tale.

477
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,530
Don't come out if you dare.

478
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,720
They forced Chu He to keep hiding in the tale.

479
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,800
Poor girl.

480
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:30,750
Interesting.

481
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,090
Wolf.

482
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,480
You're good at killing with a borrowed sword.

483
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,110
I was wondering

484
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,910
how you, who's tricky inside,

485
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,620
suddenly had a conscience

486
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,900
and stood up for Chu He.

487
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,820
That was because you wanted her to get into trouble?

488
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,530
Brother.

489
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,910
You're indeed a Scorpio.

490
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,650
You're a scheming prince.

491
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,740
You're only half right.

492
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,370
I didn't expect

493
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,870
my charm could make people hunt her down.

494
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,760
Do you want me to spit out the food I ate

495
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,970
when I was six?

496
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,290
But

497
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,660
I'm really worried about your assistant.

498
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,200
You can do this to a series of data.

499
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,250
What about the living in real life?

500
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,600
Is this the first day you know me?

501
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,930
She ate so much

502
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,720
at the dinner.

503
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,070
Did she feel bloated?

504
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,290
She was in a daze when she left.

505
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,310
Did she really feel bloated?

506
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,880
She might delay the shooting tomorrow.

507
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,130
I am wanted online?

508
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:49,980
Are you out of your mind?

509
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,110
Am I going to hide in Tianmang Secret Order

510
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,200
forever?

511
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:13,900
Who is it?

512
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,010
It's you.

513
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:22,010
Why are you dressed like this?

514
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,720
You look handsome in the clothes.

515
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,160
Can you reply to my WeChat messages when you see them?

516
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,020
