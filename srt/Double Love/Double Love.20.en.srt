00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,420
I'm fond of her.

177
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,210
Not bad.

178
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,280
You know such an niche artist.

179
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:10,870
What?

180
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,580
Are you interested in Space Art?

181
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,330
I majored in art

182
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,680
before I entered this industry.

183
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,010
My entering the industry was an accident.

184
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,910
So,

185
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,920
you don't know me well enough.

[Reject] [Answer]

222
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,570
Lu Wanwan has become famous, right?

223
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,970
Such a big star.

224
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,810
You didn't even say hello.

225
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,410
What's going on?

226
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:12,850
What's wrong?

227
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,280
Who bullied you?

228
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,660
Han Jingmo

229
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:18,420
is Between Ink White.

230
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,950
Han Jingmo is Between Ink White.

231
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,670
Between Ink White is Han Jingmo.

232
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,240
Are you sure?

233
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,750
What's with that look?

234
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:34,930
Shouldn't you be as mad

235
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,150
as I am?

236
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:41,140
Three Swordsmanship and Ink White always travel together.

237
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,800
Since Ink White is Han Jingmo,

238
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,400
then Three Swordsmanship

239
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,530
is Gu Qiaobei?

240
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,970
How could he lie to you?

241
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,130
Han Jingmo, that bastard.

242
00:14:57,310 --> 00:14:58,770
Don't scold him like that.

243
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,390
He lied to you just now.

244
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,030
You're still defending him?

245
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,630
Aren't you angry that he hid his game identity?

246
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:05,820
Well,

247
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,630
I don't think he's that kind of person.

248
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,690
What if there's a misunderstanding?

249
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,930
Miss.

250
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,420
Stop pretending, okay?

251
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,640
If you're not angry,

252
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,000
what was that?

253
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,250
Just now,

254
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,600
who lay

255
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,500
here?

256
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,120
Who was it?

257
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:22,980
Get up.

258
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:23,660
No!

259
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,580
Get out of my bed.

260
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,020
Get up.

261
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,770
Let's talk business.

262
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,250
Okay, go ahead.

263
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:33,410
Well,

264
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,220
when I knew

265
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,020
he is Between Ink White,

266
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,720
I was really angry.

267
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,360
But you know,

268
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,090
I used to admire

269
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,440
and appreciate

270
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,550
Genius.

271
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,370
I even...

272
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,530
Well...

273
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:51,870
Anyway,

274
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,500
I was suffering before.

275
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,700
In the end,

276
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,510
they were the same person.

277
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,270
And?

278
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,970
I'm blaming myself for nothing.

279
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,440
But now that I think about it,

280
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,260
I think I've always been consistant.

281
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,050
Are we like the Farewell, My Concubine?

282
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:13,840
I am Concubine Yu. He is the king.

283
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,310
As soon as the king leaves, I'll kill myself.

284
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,710
I'm loyal until my death.

285
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,700
It's quite romantic and tragic.

286
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,200
Your brain is really different.

287
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,260
Thank you.

288
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,300
It's just fine.

289
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,250
He must have come to me.

290
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,390
My king!

291
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,510
Stop!

292
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,330
A woman should put on airs

293
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,530
when it's necessary.

294
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,560
Stay still.

295
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,040
He lied to you just now.

296
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,950
Look how I'll deal with him.

297
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:47,020
Look how I'll deal with him.

298
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,020
Don't run around.

299
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,700
She doesn't want to see you.

300
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:03,980
I know.

301
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,460
But I have something to tell her.

302
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,099
She doesn't want to see you.

303
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,300
I want to see her.

304
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,460
She doesn't want to see you.

305
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,270
I know

306
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,790
it was my fault.

307
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,210
You don't have to tell me.

308
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,220
I'm not interested in your explanation.

309
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,819
I only care about the result.

310
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,740
The result is you've been fooling her.

311
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,930
You play two roles.

312
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,290
Really a good actor.

313
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,960
I didn't mean it.

314
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,630
I only care about the result.

315
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,810
Lu Guanghan, you're using your power for personal revenge.

316
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,660
Can't you be more promising?

317
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,050
I couldn't stand this if it happened to me.

318
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,270
I have the final say.

319
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,300
Wanwan, in a relationship,

320
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,590
you'd better set a higher bottomline.

321
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:23,610
Don't change your mind after being coaxed.

322
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,880
Otherwise men won't cherish you.

323
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,820
That's true.

324
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:31,630
But

325
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,680
I'm afraid I can't help replying to him

326
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,730
and calling him back.

327
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:36,660
What should I do?

328
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,180
Play a game and distract your attention.

329
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,610
What if I meet him in the game?

330
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,190
Isn't that embarrassing?

331
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,100
Top Star, you're finally online.

332
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,150
Are you still not willing to play Love as One Heart with me?

333
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,790
It's not that I don't want to.

334
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,820
I never had a chance to tell you.

335
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,020
Actually, I'm just like you.

336
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,930
I'm a man.

337
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,540
Just tell me if you don't want to play with me.

338
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,560
Why did you use such an excuse

339
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,400
to lie to me?

340
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,450
This is my first time playing a game.

341
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,780
When I registered,

342
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,770
I accidentally registered it as a woman.

343
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,250
If I lied to you on purpose,

344
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,130
why would I tell you?

345
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,050
It's true.

346
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,130
You really didn't lie to me?

347
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,130
I didn't.

348
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,260
You're really a man?

349
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,740
For real.

350
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,430
Fine.

351
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,640
I'm just imagining it.

352
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:03,520
Anyway,

353
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,190
I didn't want to be in a relationship.

354
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,170
I just want to team up

355
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,010
to unlock the double movements.

356
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,290
So, let's be brothers.

357
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,540
OK, be brothers.

358
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,720
I'll tell Qiao you're my brother.

359
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:30,620
How dare you!

360
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,630
You said two minutes ago

361
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:34,420
you couldn't stand what Han Jingmo did.

362
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,020
What?

363
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,990
Are you going to cheat Qiao now?

364
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,650
A double standard.

365
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,280
This is called special treatment for special cases.

366
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,390
What do you know?

367
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,000
You're shameless.

368
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:45,680
I can't stand it anymore.

369
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,680
I want to login my own account.

No.

With your determination,

372
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,110
you'll be taken down by Han Jingmo.

373
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:52,680
Fine.

374
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,400
If you don't let me login,

375
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,570
I'll tell your real identity to Three Swordsmanship.

376
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,040
You're just a bully at home.

377

Why don't you use your phone?

This screen is big.

379
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,350
I didn't think it through.

380
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,840
I'm reflecting on myself.

381
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,760
Don't be angry.

382
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:36,930
It'll hurt me if you harm your health.

383
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,210
Wanwan, can you answer the phone?

384
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:40,440
At least let me explain

385
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,580
before you decide what to do with me.

386

387
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,460
I'm fine.

Yes.

392
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,450
Just a little cold.

Okay.

I'll call you Brother Top Star.

When are we getting married?

398
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,690
We'll find another chance.

Probably.

404
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,510
I guess they've talked it through in private.

405

00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,940
[You're not filming tomorrow morning. Have a good rest at home.]

517
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,920
Do whatever you want. I'll cooperate.

518
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,260
It's cold at night.

519
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,430
Don't catch a cold.

520
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,820
You're not filming tomorrow morning.

521
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,210
Have a good rest at home.

522
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,460
What do you want for breakfast?

523
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,790
I'll order food for you.

524
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,930
It's been so long.

525
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,490
It's been a long time.

526
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,530
It's just a small quarrel. That's enough.

527
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:23,810
[You're not filming tomorrow morning. Have a good rest at home.]

528
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:23,810
[What do you want for breakfast?]

529
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:23,810
[I'll order food for you.]

530
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,030
Come on.

531
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,590
You can only take this opportunity

532
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,870
to give him a lesson.

533
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,430
Show him your authority.

534
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,370
There's no such a chance in the future.

535
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:32,920
I...

536
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,380
No.

537
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:33,810
I...

538
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:34,510
No.

539
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,310
I don't want to give him a hard time.

540
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,020
He sent me so many messages.

541
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,080
Look how pitiful he is.

542
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,940
He must be very sad.

543
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:44,540
Wanwan.

544
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,290
Look at me.

545
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:47,850
Wanwan.

546
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,980
One is bound to pay price for lying.

547
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,080
This is a warning to him.

548
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,320
No matter what happens in the future,

549
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,270
he should be honest with you.

550
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,320
No.

551
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,570
Dating is like a war to you.

552
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,670
I'm sincere.

553
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,930
I can't play tactics.

554
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:07,200
Dating and managing companies are the same.

555
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:09,470
There's reward and punishment.

556
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,000
No matter how close you are,

557
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,420
there must be a boundary.

558
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,570
Listen to me.

559
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:17,480
I'm a man.

560
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,950
So I know what a man thinks.

561
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,980
How long do I have to punish him?

562
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,770
When he tried his best to cheer you up.

563
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,020
He's working hard now.

564
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,760
Is the news accurate?

565
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,030
Okay.

566
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:56,810
I see.

567
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,180
That's all.

568
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,490
Let me guess.

569
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,000
Qiao is in trouble again.

570
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,090
Not bad.

571
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,570
Why don't you become a fortune teller instead?

572
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,180
You look so sad.

573
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,400
You must be in trouble

574
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,970
on the way to sign with Qiao.

575
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,010
What happened to him?

576
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:27,750
He rejected you again?

577
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,590
He

578
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,080
was kept.

579
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,590
Why so sudden?

580
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,520
Before this,

581
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,050
he started to reject some commercial plays.

582
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:35,990
Finally,

583
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,930
he provoked Lin Huang.

584
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,080
Congratulations.

585
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,900
They broke up.

586
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,180
You'll have a chance.

587
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,590
He hasn't called me even once.

588
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:51,830
Obviously,

589
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,790
he doesn't want me to get involved.

590
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,170
Then you won't?

591
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,330
That's impossible.

592
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,710
Mind your own business.

593
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,100
What should I do?

594
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,910
I'll meet him at the scene.

595
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,540
I'm afraid I can't help it.

596
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,370
How about this?

597
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,150
I'll persuade the investors

598
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,510
to invest more funds

599
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,750
and ask them to replace you and retake it.

600
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,620
In this way,

601
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,370
you won't have to see him again.

602
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,920
That's great, okay?

603
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,920
Do you think I'm a fool?

604
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,960
Are you stupid?

605
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,180
You can't even handle Han Jingmo.

606
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,410
What else can you do?

607
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,390
Eat.

608
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,270
It's hard to buy this scallion pancake.

609
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,470
You bought it?

610
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,640
This wonton

611
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,410
are limited-sale.

612
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,450
You still love me, Lu.

613
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,060
Yours.

614
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,730
[Wanwan Sorry I love you]

615
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,090
So he bought it.

616
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:29,630
Such a romantic encounter.

617
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,580
Why should I be angry?

618
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,350
I'm about to leave.

619
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,740
Do you want me to take you to the filming location?

620
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,760
No, I'm working in the afternoon.

621
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,460
I have to work early these days.

622
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,320
I won't come back.

623
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,810
I'll stay in the filming location.

624
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:47,420
OK.

625
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,770
Qiao!

626
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:18,800
It's your fault that the boss kept you.

627
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:21,870
But he just wanted to warn you

628
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,580
so that you can be more positive about work.

629
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,510
You don't have to terminate the contract, right?

630
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,200
I've thought about terminating the contract

631
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,780
for a long time.

632
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:34,530
I have two years left in the contract.

633
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,500
But that's all I can afford.

634
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,580
It's written in it.

635
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,370
I've tried my best.

636
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,880
You know my income.

637
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,150
Qiao.

638
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:43,350
Mr. Lu.

639
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,190
It has nothing to do with Ying Ge.

640
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,350
Is there no room for turn?

641
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,470
Instead of wasting time,

642
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,880
we'd better break up nicely.

643
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:01,290
Fine.

644
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,420
I'll call and ask.

645
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,760
[Tell me if you need help]

646
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,520
Tell me if you need help.

647
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:53,820
[Then let's celebrate together. I terminated the contract.]

648
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:53,820
[When I'm done with my work, let's drink.]

649
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:47,949
Then let's

650
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,179
celebrate together.

651
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:51,230
I terminated the contract.

652
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,090
When I'm done with my work,

653
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:53,940
let's drink.

654
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:56,659
Thank you, Miss Lu.

655
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:57,770
You too.

656
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,560
You haven't talked to me for 18 hours.

657
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,220
So?

658
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,640
Let's have a good talk.

659
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,710
That's it? Senior Lu is right.

660
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:17,030
You deserve to suffer.

661
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:21,750
Move.

662
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,310
I have something to tell you.

663
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,230
Intentional assault.

664
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,800
You'll be sentenced for more than ten years.

665
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,640
Think it over.

666
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,440
Where are you? It's taking so long to pick up something.

667
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,550
Cut the crap. I'm taking the big film.

668
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,110
Sir,

669
00:36:09,370 --> 00:36:10,750
I'm not talking about you.

670
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,160
This big film.

671
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,450
We're embarrassing ourselves in the crew.

672
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,730
You kissed me by force.

673
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,950
You even bit my lips.

674
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,900
We're even now, okay?

675
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,530
No.

676
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,500
It's my fault for lying to you.

677
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,870
You should be angry.

678
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:36,780
But you...

679
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,790
you can't ignore me forever.

680
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,270
I'll say it one last time.

681
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,690
Let go.

682
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,600
You'll only make me angrier.

683
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:51,910
What do you mean?

684
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,710
A forced kiss?

685
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:54,590
You can kiss me back.

686
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:55,400
Here.
