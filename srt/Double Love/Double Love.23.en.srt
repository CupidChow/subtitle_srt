00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,170
If you were beaten to death by Young Master of the Tang Sect,

176
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,170
you'll lose face.

177
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,250
Not bad.

178
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,360

You didn't treat your friends as well as your wife.

Why couldn't you go easy on me at all.

184
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,510
Didn't he let you start seven seconds before he did?

185
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,640
Young Master.

186
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,820
Chu Chu, you are here.

187
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,340
You must have waited long.

188
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,000
Not really.

189
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:40,790

You're all here.

193
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,310
Young Master said you've improved a lot.

194
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,200
Impressive.

195
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,040
Of course.

196
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,390
I taught her!

197
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,980
Since you're in the Sword Tournament Field,

198
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,250
why don't you battle?

199
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,770
Sure.

200
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,030
I didn't say anything.

201
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,930
Please go easy on me, Chu He.

202
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,360
I'm not good at it.

203
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,250
Chu Chu, don't be modest.

204
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,210
Let them see your progress these days.

205
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:13,540
Show them your ability!

206
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,230
Come on.

207
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,860
If I lose,

208
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:19,510
you can't laugh at me.

209
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,770
Of course I won't.

210
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,620
Chu He is so rough.

211
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,380
Take her as a man.

212
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,960
It's not embarrassing to lose to a man.

213
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,980
That's too much.

214
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,420
Do you want to die again?

215
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,450
I haven't practiced for a long time.

216
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,530
If I lose,

217
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,350
don't laugh at me.

218
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,270
Don't worry. You won't lose.

219
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:42,940
You have me.

[Strong Wind and Heavy Rain]

223
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,000
Chu Qianlan's operation

224
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,950
has indeed improved a lot.

225
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,260
Right? You think so too?

226
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:20,140
I remember when she first joined the guild,

227
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,150
she knew nothing

228
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,700
and pestered you every day.

[Battle]

230
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,900
Well done.

231
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,910
Of course.

232
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,510
What do you think? Does she improve a lot?

233
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,350
But I still lost.

234
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,320
Compared to Chu He, I still can't win.

235
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:59,310
Chu He used to practice hard

236
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,580
to battle against Time Flies Flower Blooms.

237
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,180
Chu Chu, you'll be better if you practice more.

238
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,250
OK.

239
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,310
By the way,

240
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:07,840
Chu Chu, do you know Time Flies Flower Blooms?

241
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,710
I'm not sure.

242
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,680
Right.

243
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,220
When Chu Chu started gaming,

244
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,500
Time Flies Flower Blooms had exited the game.

245
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,380
I think you know Chu Chu soon after

246
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,660
Time Flies Flower Blooms exited the game, right?

247
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,100
Yes.

248
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,970
Who is Time Flies Flower Blooms?

249
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,430
The president of the ABCC Guild.

250
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,190
She said she wanted to fight against Chu He.

251
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,950
They had a great battle.

252
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,970
Many people were watching.

253
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:34,080
She was so embarrassed when she lost.

254
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,040
You can tell it too, right?

255
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,540
Chu Qianlan's operation

256
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,890
is similar to Time Flies Flower Blooms's.

257
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,110
Although she deliberately avoided

258
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,380
some classic tricks,

259
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,020
a person's habit

260
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,450
can't be changed easily.

261
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,510
I suspect

262
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,840
Chu Qianlan is the smurf of Time Flies Flower Blooms.

263
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,000
Judging from Time Flies Flower Blooms's character,

264
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,900
she wouldn't have given up so easily.

265
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,030
It's very possible.

266
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,000
That's really scary.

267
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,300
She even used Young Master's feelings.

268
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,830
No, I have to tell Young Master of the Tang Sect.

269
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,630
Calm down.

270
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,010
You have to find solid evidence first.

271
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,830
That makes sense.

272
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,150
I have an idea.

273
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,340
Can you lend me your account?

274
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,210
Sure.

275
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:30,680
Here you are.

276
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,610
Also,

277
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,510
we need to

278
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,940
pretend to break up for a few days.

279
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,910
It's an act.

280
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:39,790
Just an act.

281
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,140
I need to find the evidence

282
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,190
to prove

283
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,230
Chu Qianlan is Time Flies Flower Blooms.

284
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,260
Like you said,

285
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,920
if we expose it rashly,

286
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,240
she might not admit it.

287
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,070
She might even say it wasn't her.

288
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,970
So,

289
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,280
I have to let her admit herself

290
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,670
that she is Time Flies Flower Blooms.

291
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,560
It's fine whether she's or not.

292
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,710
It won't hurt Chu Qianlan.

293
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,780
So the way you came up with

294
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,750
is to pretend to break up?

295
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,840
What's that look?

296
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,360
Nothing.

297
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,210
I just think

298
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,730
you've become smarter recently.

299
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:20,500
Of course. I'm still a kid.

300
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,640
I'm more mature now.

301
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,440
I've grown up.

302
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,190
To me,

303
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,040
you are a kid who will never grow "big".

304
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,710
Right?

305
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,580
I'll poke your eyes!

306
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,760
-Why are you so greedy? -I'm sorry.

307
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,060
-I'm sorry.  -You're not satisfied!

How dare you!

309
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,920
Where have you been these days?

310
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,280
It's rare that we're all here.

311
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,330
Let's play in the Instance Zones.

312
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,330
Okay.

313
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,060
Let's go.

314
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,780
Sure. Let's go.

315
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:53,850
I'm not going.

316
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,450
Why?

317
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,220
I won't go if he goes.

318
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,890
No way.

319
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,250
Did you quarrel again?

320
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,650
It must be Madam's fault.

321
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:09,630
Master.

322
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,390
Tell me if you need my help.

323
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,280
Anytime.

324
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:14,190
My good disciple.

325
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,570
Did Genius have a quarrel with Chu He again?

326
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,270
Yes.

327
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,960
My Wife, don't be angry.

328
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,170
Please forgive me.

329
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,650
I just...

330
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,450
If you want to be forgiven, why are you just standing there and saying so?

331
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:28,410
On your knees.

332
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,470
It's OK if you want me to kneel on the keyboard

333
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,880
or the washboard.

334
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,940
But please don't leave me, okay?

335
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,780
You are my goddess.

336
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,660
My only goddess.

337
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,120
Gosh.

338
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,650
Did I see it wrong?

339
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,090
Why do I smell sour?

340
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,480
I got goose bumps.

341
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:53,510
Goddess.

342
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,410
And the only goddess?

343
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,670
How blind he is

344
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:58,080
to say that?

345
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,430
Chu He,

346
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,310
since Genius is so sincere,

347
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,460
please forgive him.

348
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,680
It's a matter of principle.

349
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,810
I can't forgive him.

350
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,710
You've been studying this

351
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:25,099
after work these days?

352
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,280
Yes.

353
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,089
Will it work?

354
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,950
Don't worry about it.

355
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,320
Just eat your food and I'll set up the plan.

356
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,580
I'm really sorry.

357
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:45,310
I won't do this again.

358
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,300
Even if there are only two people

359
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,960
in my heart,

360
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:54,100
[I'm really sorry. I won't do this again. Even if there are only two people in my heart,]

361
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,320
one is you,

362
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:02,030
the other is also you.

363
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,220
I only love you.

364
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,200
What's wrong?

365
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,330
Did I say that wrong?

366
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:17,390
No, no, no.

367
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,660
Come on, try this.

368
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,230
Don't stop me.

369
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,750
I want to poke my own eyes.

370
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,250
No need.

371
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,070
Chu He.

372
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,800
I think Ink White's account was hacked.

373
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,380
Probably.

374
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,020
I've known him for so many years.

375
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,900
I've never heard him

376
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,770
saying such words.

377
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,850
I can't imagine

378
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:40,740
since when

379
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,650
can we watch this kind of program for free.

380
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,480
I'm willing to be changed for your sake.

381
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,890
Why did Genius and Chu He have a quarrel?

382
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:54,100
There are two people in his heart?

383
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,390
Don't say anything.

384
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,780
Let's get a divorce.

385
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:02,390

Trust me.

393
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,400
It's effective.

394
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,060
Don't you think you should pay me?

395
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,720
For what?

396
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,620
It's my revenge for the divorce.

397
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,420
I... I haven't made it clear yet.

398
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,060
I have to make Chu Qianlan believe that we're divorced.

399
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,400
But my bedroom is ready.

400
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,570
Han Jingmo.

401
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,710
You've changed.

402
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,430
You've changed a lot!

403
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:33,970
I can change for you.

404
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:36,140
How could you be like this? Let go of me!

405
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,580
Are you sure

406
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,140
this will work?

407
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,270
Yes, I'm pretty sure.

408
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,310
Just do it.

409
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,410
Okay, I've done pretending to be angry and I'm offline.

410
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,270
It's your turn.

411
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,390
Then I will now post the

412
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,540
the information to recycle

413
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:01,200
the access to Between Xing Yuan with high price.

414
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,870
Turn on your friend request permission.

415
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,790
If Chu Qianlan is Time Flies Flower Blooms,

416
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,080
after these two days,

417
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,760
she must be touched.

418
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,830
Besides, only Time Flies Flower Blooms

419
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,350
has the access to Between Xing Yuan.

420
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,550
Her sockpuppet will be exposed by then.

421
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,320
[The access to Between Xing Yuan is wanted. One who has it just put it on the shelf. Any price is acceptable.]

Chu Qianlan hasn't made a move yet?

428
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,550
She has added me as a friend.

429
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,550
It should be soon.

430
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:44,170
Looks like I'm a good actress.

431
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:47,560
It owes you an Oscar.

432
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,960
You haven't got it yet.

433
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,200
It's not my turn.

434
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,110
By the way,

435
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:54,500
I still owe the Moonlight Blade a live stream.

436
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,830
I made an impromptu appointment tonight.

437
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:57,890
Okay.

438
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,430
I promise I will mute myself.

439
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,690
I won't expose myself.

440
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,530
It doesn't matter.

441
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,530
Ink White, do you want the access to Between Xing Yuan?

442
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:09,390
[Ink White, do you want the access to Between Xing Yuan?]

443
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,360
I have it.

444
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,380
[Ink White, do you want the access to Between Xing Yuan?]

445
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,990
You do?

446
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,380
[You do?]

447
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,380
[Yes.]

448
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,100
Yes.

449
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,860
Only few people have the access to Between Xing Yuan.

450
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:26,390
You're just an smurf with 100,000 power.

451
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,260
How can you get this?

452
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,400
[Don't worry about that. If you need it, I can log in another account to trade with you.]

453
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:33,400
[But I have to wait until you divorce Chu He.]

454

456

I can log in another account to trade with you.

457
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,090
But I have to wait until you divorce Chu He.

458
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,810
The enemy took the head to you.

459
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,850

460
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,190

[Another account? Time Flies Flower Blooms?]

Oh my god, what did I see?

467
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:55,350
[Oh my god, what did I see? Chu Qianlan said she had the access to Between Xing Yuan.]

468

Hundreds of thousands of people are watching it now.

487
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,030
I feel embarrassed for her.

488
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:12,940
So awkward.

489
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,160
She even asked Genius to divorce Chu He.

490
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,870
How could she say that?

491
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:18,090
Didn't you give advance notice about your live stream?

492
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,070
It's temporary.

493
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,660
[So Chu Qianlan is a substitute for Time Flies Flower Blooms.]

494
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,660
[Wait. Doesn't she know it's live?]

495
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,660
[Oh my. Hundreds of thousands of people are watching it now. I feel awkward for her. So awkward.]

496
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,780
Who was that person talking just now?

497
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,090
A girl?  Is she your girlfriend?

498
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:27,200
Yes.

499
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,970
Yes?  Genius admitted that she is his girlfriend.

[Yes? Genius admitted that she is his girlfriend.]

503
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,420
What about Chu He?

504
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,410
Genius, what if your girlfriend sees you and Chu He gaming as a couple?

Please give me a dozen.

520
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,130
Because Chu He is my girlfriend.

521

My girlfriend is Chu He.

522

The key point now is Time Flies Flower Blooms.

you are not in the mood

I'll tell you everything today.

Long time ago,

619
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,360
I found out your username in this game by accident.

620
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,970
Then I approached you

621
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,430
in the game with the name of Time Flies Flower Blooms.

622
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:04,300
We were already

623

624
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:07,760

625
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,120
you suddenly came out.

626
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,480
Watch your mouth.

627
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,590

628
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,690
I met Genius by coincidence.

629
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,090

630
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,490

I won't like you.

633
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,370
Besides,

634
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,780
I've met her.

635
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,450
Stop pestering me.

636
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,000
Or I'll kill you every time I see you.

637
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,420

Hello.

640
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,300
Young Master may look carefree,

641
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,210
but he's actually very loyal.

642
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,360
If he really quit the game this time,

643
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,400
I will be held responsible.

644
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,840
Sir, please come in.

645
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,710
Hello.

646
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,280
Young Master?

647
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,320
The mighty Young Master is back to life.

648
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:21,210
Are you alright?

649
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,210
Of course.

650
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,600
But I felt scared when I think back of it.

651
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,590
I almost married a scheming woman.

652
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:28,900
Luckily, you survived it.

653
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,150
Chu Qianlan has been kicked out of the guild.

Come on, I...

657
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,090
That's enough.

658
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:39,470
Don't dirty our eyes.

659
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,950
It's just a hug.

660
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,830
You don't need to be jealous.

661
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,390
So it's over?

662
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,350
No.

663
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,380
But don't worry.

664
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,770
I'm here.

665
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,140
I just checked Weibo.

666
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:04,160
Guess who Time Flies Flower Blooms and Chu Qianlan is.

667
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,060
Yan Shengkai.

668
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,810
Who exposed it?

669
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,670
I don't know.

670
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,150
It became the trend on Weibo.

671
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:16,850
The netizens sorted it out according to the timeline.

672
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,010
Time Flies Flower Blooms battled with Chu He.

673
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,430
She lost and quitted the game.

674
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:21,540
She broke the contract later.

675
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,780
Then she secretly

676
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,220
registered an smurf as Chu Qianlan to come back.

677
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,240

Please let me know when you get them.

1021
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,760
I'll help you with the rehearse.

1022
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,490
Let's make some preparations.

1023
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:08,980
Okay.

1024
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:31,300
I remember the day I left,

1025
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,130
you gave me candies in this flavor.

1026
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,010
You were very young back then.

1027
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:40,920
Later,

1028
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,200
I've been eating this kind of candy.

1029
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:53,390
I didn't expect that

1030
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:57,050
you still remember it after all these years.

1031
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:59,150
This is my favorite flavor.

1032
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:02,620
I remember it.

1033
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:07,580
You can have it.
