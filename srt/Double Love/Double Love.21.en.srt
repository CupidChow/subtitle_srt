Don't be angry.

177
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,130
Why are you here?

178
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,580
You're finally back, bro.

179
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:01,540
Let me hide here for a while.

180
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:05,030
Reporters are everywhere in front of the lounge.

181
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,870
Because you want to terminate the contract?

182
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,380
Exactly.

183
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,320
Isn't this circle too peaceful these days?

184
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,130
Now,

185
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,890
I hope someone else can have his scandal exposed.

Before giving this award,

204
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,290
it reminds me of

205
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,810
a vote of your favorite actor

207
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,180
There were many options.

208
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,320
But one of my good friends

209
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,890
voted for the same person.

210
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,460
It's definitely not me.

211
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,190
I was a little sad.

212
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,240
Mr. Tao is revealing something?

213
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,520
Let's guess.

Okay, I'll stop joking.

why she only chose one for multiple votes.

at this moment,

307

Actually, you are complicated.

You must be stubborn.

We've known each other for a few days.

317

And you already tried to label me.

318
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,350
It has nothing to do with the time we met.

319

you don't dare to love.

321
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:34,630
You must be afraid of losing.

322
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,300
Right.

323
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,620
I'm a coward.

324
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,870
I always wanted to protect her as my younger sister,

325
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,870
and see her happy.

326
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,780
But when that day comes, you realized that

327
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,200
it was not you by her side,

328
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:59,510
then you start to be heartbroken.

329
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,100
You are regretted

330
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,180
and regretted about

331
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,900
why you were not by her side.

00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,100
Right?

333
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,780
It's a great virtue to correct what you have done wrong.

334
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:13,990
In my opinion,

335
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,700
that's not a breakup at all.

336
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:20,330
A breakup requires two people to fall in love first.

Then what am I?

338

At most, it's unrequited love.

339

00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,750
males and females.

347
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,350
Are you blind?

348
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,620
You fell in love with a loser who can't love

349
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,200
and said you have good eyesight.

350
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,010
That's because I'm confident.

351
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,760
You've already missed Lu Wanwan.

352
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,430
Don't miss me, Guan Yiwei.

353
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,420
If you don't cherish me,

354
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,010
what awaits you in the future are the ones

355
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:26,250
who loses the ability to love and to be loved and

356
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,640
even nursing house

357
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,030
doesn't accept even if they pay a lot.

358
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,090
I curse you.

359
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,030
Thank you.

360
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,380
You're welcome.

361
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:45,910
It's been an hour.

362
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,360
What are we waiting for?

363
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,550
The award ceremony just ended.

364
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,200
The whole world's media is waiting for you.

365
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,610
Mr. Lu is protecting you two.

366
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,980
Congratulations to Mr. Lu.

367
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,840
for enchanting another fangirl.

368
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,600
As expected, everyone is discussing this.

369
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:06,860
I want...

370
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,540
I want to take a look.

371
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,230
No.

372
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,680
I won't say anything after I take a look.

373
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,250
Mr. Lu specifically ordered,

374
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,610
without permission,

375
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,050
you are not allowed to respond to anything.

376
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:19,320
Can't I just take a look?

377
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,160
What if you accidentally click on a thumb-up button

378
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,980
you shouldn't have clicked?

379
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,800
How about this?

380
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,880
If you want to hear,

381
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,310
let Song Chi read to you.

382
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,960
Sure.

383
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:35,820
OK.

384
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,740
Ye sent me a message.

385
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,440
Can I reply one?

386
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,370
Don't do it again.

387
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:43,910
OK.

388
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,990
Dear meatball, congratulations.

389
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:54,850
[Dear meatball, congratulations. Finally comes the official announcement. Hope for your happiness ever after. ]

390
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:54,450
Finally comes the official announcement. Hope for your happiness ever after.

391
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:00,700
Okay, I'll read the comments now.

392
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,630
Half an hour has passed.

393
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:08,460
I still don't think it's true.

394
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,210
Any good ones?

395
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,840
Yes, yes, yes.

396
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,840
Look, here it comes.

397
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,840
Finally comes the official announcement.

398
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,670
We're already celebrating.

399
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,420
I like you guys together the most.

400
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:23,470
The cute couple I have liked for a year is finally together.

401
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,060
Please be happy.

402
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:26,150
Is there any more of this?

403
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,710
This is good. I want to hear more of this.

404
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,490
There are more...

405
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,890
The guy is a famous actor.

406
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,540
And the girl's career is going up.

407
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,280
It takes courage to make it public.

408
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:35,670
Best wishes.

409
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,260
I like this kind of comments.

410
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,130
Anything else?

411
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:39,700
Are you done?

412
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,390
Hello, Mr. Lu.

413
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,560
Are you hungry?

414
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:07,590
Do you want to have dinner together?

415
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,790
Are you hungry?

416
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,540
Eat?

417
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:11,610
I can eat her alive.

418
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,990
Eat me!

419
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:16,610
I'm innocent here.

420
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,760
Yes, it has nothing to do with Wanwan.

421
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,660
I'll take the responsibility.

422
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,900
You will take the reponsibility?

423
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,970
A good man.

424
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,530
She's a love-struck.

425
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,360
You're doing this too, aren't you?

426
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,490
Can't you just tell each other?

427
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,480
Why do you have to choose tonight?

428
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,110
My head hurts.

429
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,810
I was planning this morning

430
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,690
for you guys to go on a variety show together.

431
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:40,540
Now,

432
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,680
this grew too big.

433
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,680
It's actually not necessary.

434
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,020
I'm an actor.

435
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,910
I don't need to do this kind of stuff,

436
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:49,520
Right?

437
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,240
Are you teaching me how to do it?

438
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,410
Are you teaching me how to do it?

439
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,600
Are you teaching me?

440
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,580
All right, all right.

441
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:01,140
You can't blame him for this.

442
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,710
It's a global live stream.

443
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,180
You can't hide it even if you want.

444
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,390
We have said it out loud,

445
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:05,910
right?

446
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,490
Yes, we can't hide it anymore.

447
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,380
Another call.

448
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:10,890
I'll answer the phone.

449
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,220
You know that too?

450
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,460
Senior Lu was furious.

451
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,710
He bought a ticket and rushed back.

452
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,410
You can explain to him yourself.

453
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,450
What about Susu?

454
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,750
They will come back together.

455
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,880
Su, Senior Lu?

456
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,260
My parents.

457
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,340
They ordered you

458
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,100
to come to our home

459
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,800
to have dinner with us.

460
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,370
Of course.

461
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,750
Mr. Lu,

462
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:47,010
please tell me the exact time in advance.

463
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,110
Of course?

464
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,390
I really want to hit you. Of course my ass.

465
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,230
A friendly reminder.

466
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,920
Senior Lu doesn't like you at all.

467
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,330
Does he misunderstand me?

468
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,320
No.

469
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,990
Because Susu is your senior fan.

470
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,720
It smells good.

471
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:27,420
How is it?

472
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,140
Good.

473
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,810
Not bad, not bad.

474
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,620
Susu.

475
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:40,800
He's here!

476
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,960
I'm going.

477
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,180
How am I? Is this okay?

478
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:43,740
Do I look good?

479
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,280
Yes, yes, yes.

480
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:44,680
Okay.

481
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,810
Coming.

482
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
You're here.

483
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:03,890
Come in.

484
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,770
Why did you bring so many things?

485
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,570
Is it heavy?

486
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,220
No.

487
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,300
-I'll carry it for you. -I'll hold it.

488
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,630
Let me carry it for you.

489
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,540
Be careful.

490
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,240
Okay.

491
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:17,710
Jingmo.

492
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,540
You are here.

493
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,660
Hello, auntie.

494
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,640
You bought so many things.

495
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,020
Take it.

496
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:25,320
Great!

497
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:26,430
Let's go.

498
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,380
Come in quickly.

499
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,340
Haohao.

500
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,620
Look who's here.

501
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,890
Hello, uncle.

502
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,610
Let me introduce to you formally.

503
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,520
Senior Lu, Susu.

504
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,680
This is the Han Jingmo I told you about.

505
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,590
Isn't he handsome?

506
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:48,610
Sorry to disturb you, uncle and auntie.

507
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:52,680
Not at all.

508
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,210
You must be tired from driving.

509
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,560
Come and sit.

510
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,560
Here.

511
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:02,510
This tea is just made.

512
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,580
Have some tea.

513
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,680
Thank you.

514
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,640
You're welcome.

515
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,510
I just bought the fruit

516
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,830
this morning.

517
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,610
It's very sweet.

518
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,450

519
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,490
Susu, slow down.

520
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,150
You're not feeding a pig.

521
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:16,250
Shut up.

522
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:17,980
Is there such a pretty pig?

523
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,700
Look at you.

524
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,840
Just come.

525
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,610
Why did you buy so many things?

526
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,670
You're too polite.

527
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,970
They are just small gifts.

528
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:36,890
I wonder

529
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,570
if you would like them.

530
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,730
For me?

531
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,220
This is for you.

532
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:57,850
This is from my favorite jade shop.

533
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:00,980
The transparency

534
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,330
and the shine...

535
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:07,140
This is the best jade.

536
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:09,460
Wanwan told him?

537
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,090
I didn't tell anything.

538
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,800
Am I that kind of traitor daughter?

539
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,790
He picked what he wanted to send.

540
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,490
I'm glad you like it.

541
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,520
I like it.

Calm down. Look at you.

visits his future parents-in-law,

545
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,900
will Susu be jealous?

546
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,420
Right.

547
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,820
Where is little Lu?

548
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:32,300
Yeah.

549

550
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,050

551

590
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,990
Look at the texture.

If you find Wanwan suddenly gained weight,

645
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,560
would you tell her directly?

646
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,760
I will.

647
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:23,790
If Wanwan ask your opinion about raising a pet,

648
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,680
will you agree?

649
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:25,710
No.

650
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,740

651
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,800
Give her time to calm down.

Why are you so straightforward?

654
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,200
I didn't think so.

655
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,880
You have been hiding too much.

00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:37,620
No.

657
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,760
No, no, no.

658
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,980
This is just a difference in personality.

659
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,390
This means

660
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,200
Jingmo is just like your dad,

661
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,920
with limited experience in relationship.

662
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,590

663
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:59,440
These are good answers for the choice questions.

664
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,250
OK.

665
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,010
Now let's start with the true or false question.

666
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:06,210
Uncle, you asked a little bit fast.

667
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,520
My answer was not complete.

668
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,070
Can I add more?

669
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,100
Sure.

670
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,130
You don't have to add anything.

671
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:13,900
Wanwan,

672
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,710
let him talk.

673
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,630
Say it.

674
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,350
First,

675
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,210
as an artist,

676
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,030
Wanwan managed her body very well.

677
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,130
It's hard to gain weight.

678
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,760
But if she really gets fat,

679
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,830
I'll find the reason with her

680
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:27,360
and give the right solution.

681
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,380
If necessary,

682
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,250
I can also lose weight with her.

683
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,090
The reason why I didn't let her keep her pet

684
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,210
because I found that

685
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,550
although she likes these cats and dogs very much,

686
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:38,810
but she's just like me.

687
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,630
She's allergic to fur.

688
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,659
If she wants a pet,

689
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,070
we need to ask the doctor's opinion.

690
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,730
If she really wants a pet,

691
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,940
we can raise some little turtles

692
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:49,900
or lizards,

693
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,050
small animals which doesn't have fur.

694
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,170
Third,

695
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,080
Wanwan doesn't throw a tantrum for no reason.

696
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,080
Calm down is not cold violence.

697
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,610
I'll give her some time but

698
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,600
I won't let the problem pass through the night.

699
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:07,940
Alright.

700
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,090
Absolutely alright.

701
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,720
This is the best son-in-law of the Lu family.

702
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:14,620
I want to record this

703
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,370
for your brother.

704
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,270
Don't make trouble.

705
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:22,660
Continue with the true or false question.

706
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,530
Are you done?

707
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,190
Jingmo is here to eat,

708
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,140
not for the exam.

709
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,590
Come on!

710
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:34,100
Let's go.

711
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,760
Set up a table with me.

712
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,180
Don't play with him.

713
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:44,420
Let's go.

714
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,700
Senior Lu,

715
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,940
are you satisfied?

716
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,300
Tell me.

717
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:57,480
-Are you satisfied?-Enough, enough.

718
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:58,270
Satisfied?

719
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,420
So-so, so-so.

720
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,390
I...

721
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,940
I'm back.

722
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,750
There was a traffic jam.

723
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,710
Hurry up.

724
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,700
Do you know that dinner is ready? We're waiting for you.

725
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,700
Don't you know we have a guest today?

726
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,530
You're finally back.

727
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:29,180
Didn't I tell you

728
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,740
to come back early?

729
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,030
Do you have to let Jingmo wait for you?

730
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,290
What if he gets hungry?

731
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,380
Mr. Lu

732
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,560
is busy.

733
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,520
As family members,

734
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,140
we should fully understand.

735
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,260
Who do you think cause the delay?

736
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,320
Go wash your hands.

737
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,510
Dad.

738
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,600
Go wash your hands.

739
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,310
Here.

740
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:56,370
Bring me the soup and spoon when you come.

741
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,270
Let's eat.

742
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,970
Here, the soup.

743
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,340
Be careful.

744
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:05,930
Here.

745
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,420
Let's eat.

746
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,590
Come on.

747
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,830
In your business,

748
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,630
health is extremely important.

749
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:18,830
So our vegetables

750
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,240
are planted in our own garden.

751
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,560
We can't count on them.

752
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,610
Me and Haohao planted all of these.

753
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,260
Can't you tell?

754
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,800
Here, try it.

755
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:31,950
See how it tastes.

756
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:32,730
Thank you.

757
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,840
Sweet with fragrance.

758
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,890
It smells fresh.

759
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,470
It's not inferior to Chef Michelin's recommendation.

760
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,170
It's been a long time since I had

761
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,620
such delicate food.

762
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,200
What a suck-up.

763
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,660
What a double-dealer.

764
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:54,540
Jingmo,

765
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,760
you're both cultured and educated.

766
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,510
Why do I like to listen to you so much?

767
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:01,670
Come on.

768
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,020
Eat more if you like it.

769
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:03,750
Here.

770
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,550
You.

771
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,130
Look at Wanwan,

772
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,280
then look at you.

773
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,590
What's wrong with me?

774
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,760
Don't you know

775
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,500
how old you are this year?

776
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,490
So what?

777
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,910
In your eyes,

778
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,510
am I supposed to be your baby forever?

779
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,960
-Baby.-Yes.

780
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,620
You're over 30.

781
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,280
Don't you know when to hurry up?

782
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,360
I know. I know.

783
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,290
How many times have you told me?

784
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,760
Shut up.

785
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,480
Here, eat more.

786
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,800
You know what?

787
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:51,090
When your dad was your age,

788
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,860
Wanwan was already two years old.

789
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,420
How can I not be anxious?

790
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,300
Awesome.

791
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:58,960
Try it.

792
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:01,910
Is it good?

793
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,430
Let's do the same.

794
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,950
What?

795
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,830
Don't get married until we are over 30 years old just like him?

796
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:35,700
No.

797
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:39,920
Look.

798
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:41,280
Eat more.

799
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,820
It's so delicious.

800
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,180
Let me do it.

801
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:52,130
Let me do it.

802
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,020
You are a guest.

803
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:53,860
Don't move.

804
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,210
You can't do this.

805
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:55,960
Take it away.

806
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,510
Have a good rest.

807
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:02,730
Han,

808
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,270
I heard you're young

809
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:07,510
but very skillful with chess.

810
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,710
Come, play one round with me.

811
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,330
I hope you don't mind that I'm not good.

812
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,110
They are going to play the chess.

813
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,260
How are you getting along?

814
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:24,770
Did you fight?

815
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,040
No.

816
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:28,180
He never quarrels with me.

817
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,780
Jingmo is a good kid.

818
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,160
He's modest, polite and sensible.

819
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,220
Most importantly,

820
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,650
he looks good

821
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,810
in every aspect.

822
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,080
Let me tell you.

823
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,610
I'm happy when I see him.

824
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:46,410
As expected, mother and daughter are connected.

825
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,890
Even the aesthetics are so similar.

826
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,080
Can I ask him

827
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,510
for his autograph and take a photo with him?

828
00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:00,070
There will be plenty of opportunities in the future.

829
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:00,600
Besides,

830
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,580
do you think Senior Lu would be

831
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,700
jealous?

832
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,360
He would be angry with you.

833
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,470
Susu,

834
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,890
can you do me a favor?

835
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:28,870
What is it?
