(All characters, locations, organizations, and incidents...)

9
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,419
(in this drama are historically irrelevant and fictitious.)

10
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,648
(Production guidelines were strictly followed...)

11
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:48,789
(when filming with children and animals.)

12
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,689
Do you wish to be a mother who gets her own son killed?

13
00:00:57,859 --> 00:00:59,359
I told you to shut your mouth!

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:02,770
I killed her.

15
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,569
Because of me, you can no longer clear your name.

16
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:08,639
Now, you can no longer save Father...

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,680
or take down the traitors.

18
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:12,280
So, why...

19
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,609
Why are you not saying anything?

20
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,510
Ask me why I did such a thing.

21
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,019
Yell at me and call me insane!

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,250
Your selfish brother dragged you into this mess for his own sake.

23
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,419
Let go. Let go of me!

24
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,659
- It is okay. - Let go...

25
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:28,489
Dosung.

26
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:31,129
It is all right.

27
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:33,829
Gun.

28
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:45,010
- The royal taster is... - About the royal taster.

29
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:47,280
I killed her.

30
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,659
Your Majesty!

31
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:09,069
Your Majesty.

32
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,370
Your Majesty!

33
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,710
No, Your Majesty!

34
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,110
Your Majesty, please open your eyes.

35
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,210
- Your Majesty! - Calm down.

36
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,909
Soo Ryeon took medicine, not poison.

37
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:24,979
She will wake up in less than four hours.

38
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,219
Court Lady Kim, I will leave her in your hands. I must get going.

39
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:30,889
Please take good care...

40
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,020
of my dear Soo Ryeon.

41
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,460
No, you cannot leave.

42
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:40,330
What are you doing?

43
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:43,400
The royal taster is dead.

44
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,310
I do not know the details yet,

45
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,839
but one of the guards at the prison saw her,

46
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,809
stabbed and covered in blood.

47
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:53,849
So please...

48
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,680
I cannot miss the morning assembly today,

49
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:58,979
so once Soo Ryeon wakes up,

50
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,490
come to the Royal Office. Do you understand?

51
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,860
Your Majesty.

52
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,289
(Episode 13)

53
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,000
Where is the letter?

54
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,228
I was about to head over to the Crown Prince's Palace.

55
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:15,129
There is no need. Hand it over.

56
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,949
- Did you read it? - I was worried about Myung Yoon.

57
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:32,849
I wanted to understand what was going on to save Lady Myung Yoon.

58
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,620
Take my life, my lord.

59
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:55,840
I heard the royal taster was found dead.

60
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:57,710
Did you know?

61
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,879
Did you hear...

62
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,909
who did it?

63
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,849
It was the deposed Crown Prince.

64
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,689
The deposed Crown Prince.

65
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,629
Am I...

66
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,759
wrong?

67
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:18,430
Your father...

68
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,129
was a loyal vassal.

69
00:04:22,829 --> 00:04:24,439
His Royal Highness the Crown Prince is entering.

70
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,389
I heard on my way here...

71
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:50,560
that the Queen Dowager might be late.

72
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,459
We will have to wait a few moments.

73
00:04:52,699 --> 00:04:54,699
- Yes, Your Royal Highness. - Yes, Your Royal Highness.

74
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,750
Why did she ask to see me?

75
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,420
She said she had something to ask you.

76
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:19,790
Go inside.

77
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,199
Is the Crown Prince all right?

78
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,370
Are you trying to add fuel to the fire?

79
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,569
I am sure you heard everything, hiding here.

80
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,139
He is not all right at all.

81
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,550
Happy now?

82
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,180
I am aware...

83
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,550
that my father framed His Royal Highness for high treason.

84
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,850
However, I do not know why my father did such a thing,

85
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,819
so I cannot find a way to help him even though I truly want to.

86
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,528
It is shameless of me to ask you this, but tell me the reason.

87
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:56,789
What are you, the cat worried about the mouse?

88
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,128
Or do you feel responsible...

89
00:05:58,129 --> 00:05:59,529
because your father caused all this mess?

90
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,230
Gosh.

91
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:02,730
What is the reason...

92
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:06,740
my father is trying to get the Crown Prince killed?

93
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:08,370
Your father...

94
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:13,509
did something horrendously heinous.

95
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,910
His Royal Highness happened to see it.

96
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,850
So to cover up his heinous sin,

97
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,790
your father tried to murder His Royal Highness, but it failed,

98
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,519
That is why he poisoned His Majesty.

99
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,660
What was the thing my father tried to cover up?

100
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,458
The thing His Royal Highness saw.

101
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:30,660
If you are that curious, go and ask your father...

102
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:33,029
No.

103
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:35,399
There is no way he will tell you.

104
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:40,139
If you truly wish to know, ask those in the Queen Dowager's Palace.

105
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:45,709
Does it mean the Queen Dowager knows everything too?

106
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:48,750
They say, in the palace,

107
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:51,220
even the walls have ears.

108
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:00,290
Keep a close eye on her so that she does not leave this room.

109
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:01,689
Yes, sir.

110
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,300
Not just her leaving the room.

111
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:07,029
Make sure no one enters the room either.

112
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,199
Especially those from the Queen Dowager's Palace.

113
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,850
If you truly wish to know, ask those in the Queen Dowager's Palace.

114
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,420
You may put your worries to rest for the time being,

115
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,990
so relax and focus on taking care of your health first.

116
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:33,790
It is true that we cannot trust Yoon Yi Kyum,

117
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:36,230
but until Prince Dosung officially becomes Crown Prince,

118
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:37,659
we will just have to...

119
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,499
keep a close watch on Jang Hyun Mok and the Crown Prince.

120
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,170
How could you do this?

121
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,870
How could you try to leave me behind, all alone?

122
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,579
Did you want to see me...

123
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,078
live on as if I was already dead?

124
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,810
- Soo Ryeon. - Leave.

125
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,779
At the moment, I cannot even stand the sight of you.

126
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:02,290
- Soo Ryeon. - I told you to leave.

127
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,589
I am sorry.

128
00:08:04,089 --> 00:08:06,420
I am... It is all my fault, Soo Ryeon.

129
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,829
Did you believe that I could go on living without you?

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,329
Had it never occurred to you...

131
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,629
that I would take my own life to follow you if you died?

132
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,110
Soo Ryeon.

133
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:33,480
I suppose the medicine still has not worn off completely.

134
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:35,419
I shall administer acupuncture on you.

135
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,230
Your Highness, let me ask you first.

136
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,100
The royal taster was found dead last night,

137
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:53,470
and I heard...

138
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,279
it was the deposed Crown Prince who killed her.

139
00:08:58,009 --> 00:08:59,809
Is it true?

140
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:01,879
- About that... - Yes.

141
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,450
I did it.

142
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,950
He truly killed the royal taster?

143
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,459
Was there something she knew about...

144
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,389
that you did not want her to tell others?

145
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:17,499
Is that why you took her life, to silence her?

146
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,029
You are out of line.

147
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,629
Are you interrogating His Royal Highness now?

148
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,730
No, I am not.

149
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,700
Anyone would agree with me.

150
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,710
If he were not involved in the plan to poison His Majesty,

151
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,579
he would have no reason to kill her...

152
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,409
when he was the one who captured her.

153
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,980
- Am I wrong? - Do not go off on a tangent!

154
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,749
I heard His Majesty collapsed...

155
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,758
upon eating the dried yellow corvina the Crown Prince had sent.

156
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:45,860
If that is true,

157
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,429
the royal taster should have died right there and then.

158
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,058
The fact that she did not die that day...

159
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:54,028
serves as proof that His Royal Highness...

160
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:56,628
had nothing to do with how His Majesty collapsed.

161
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:57,639
That is correct.

162
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,500
When His Majesty collapsed,

163
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,669
His Royal Highness was not even in the palace.

164
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,340
Are you admitting your guilt?

165
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,409
At that time, I was outside...

166
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:11,678
the palace walls.

167
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,919
Are you pleading guilty or not?

168
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,690
I was outside the palace walls.

169
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,759
However,

170
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:23,529
the deposed Crown Prince has admitted to committing treason.

171
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,730
I suggest you go over the reports once again unless you are blind.

172
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:29,428
He has never once admitted to doing such a thing.

173
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:32,570
But as you are aware, he has never once denied it either.

174
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,799
All right.

175
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,639
He is right here.

176
00:10:39,539 --> 00:10:41,250
I will ask you once again.

177
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:43,549
If you are not guilty of treason,

178
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,120
why...

179
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,049
did you not deny it?

180
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:55,190
Look.

181
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:58,100
- Even now... - All right, ministers.

182
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,399
That is enough!

183
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,600
That woman is already dead. It is pointless...

184
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,409
to discuss her death now.

185
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:13,580
You all know there is a more important matter we must discuss.

186
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:16,909
What? What could be more important than this?

187
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,049
We must decide...

188
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:25,620
which one of the two deserves the official Crown Prince title.

189
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:28,330
Do not tell me...

190
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:33,200
you are planning to let both of them stay in the Crown Prince's Palace!

191
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,179
- Gun. - Now is not the time yet.

192
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,330
The Queen Dowager is not feeling well today.

193
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,229
She says you are all dismissed.

194
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,669
(Miryeong: Not feeling well due to illness)

195
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,389
Was it Prince Dosung?

196
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
Or was it the Queen?

197
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:34,389
Who is it that you are trying to protect?

198
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,629
Please tell me.

199
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,970
I must know why you are doing this to come up with a plan.

200
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,970
I did it.

201
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,709
It has nothing to do with the Queen's Palace.

202
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,240
If that were the case,

203
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,908
Yoon Yi Kyum, the former Left State Councillor,

204
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:54,709
would not stay quiet.

205
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:56,378
(Wonimdaesin: A former senior or junior 1st rank court official)

206
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:59,518
I bet he is staying quiet...

207
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,419
because he is afraid that...

208
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:04,620
you might change your mind and reveal the truth.

209
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:08,529
Your Royal Highness.

210
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,960
I owe you an apology, Grandfather.

211
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,840
Do not be too concerned.

212
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,240
Gun will make sure nothing will happen to you, Mother.

213
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,149
However, I cannot dump it all on him again.

214
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:31,580
You know how he is.

215
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,879
He is wise,

216
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,289
so I am sure he has a plan.

217
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,559
I truly cannot dump it on him again.

218
00:13:40,059 --> 00:13:41,529
Mother, please!

219
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,899
By keeping this up,

220
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,399
you will only make things more difficult for Gun.

221
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,330
So...

222
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,440
please trust him...

223
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,899
and wait.

224
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:57,679
- Mother! - I did it,

225
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:00,139
so I should be the one getting punished.

226
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,759
I will bring in your lunch.

227
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,179
- Lady Myung Yoon. - Let her know.

228
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,549
Her Majesty is...

229
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,179
I am Myung Yoon, the Inspector General's daughter.

230
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,789
I must speak with you. Please allow me to enter for a moment.

231
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,860
Lady Myung Yoon.

232
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:12,679
Was this why?

233
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,590
Was this the reason...

234
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,690
you tried to kill the Crown Prince?

235
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,100
Lady Myung Yoon.

236
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,829
What are you doing?

237
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,799
Hurry. Go after her.

238
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:34,340
Right now, she will not want to hear anything I say.

239
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:37,139
- Sang Rok. - After some time has passed,

240
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,909
I will have a talk with her,

241
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:42,480
so do not worry.

242
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:46,620
I understand Myung Yoon is a righteous, brave girl,

243
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,490
this will be too much for her to handle.

244
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,769
So why are you doing this?

245
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:14,609
Why must you have him killed? I do not understand.

246
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,610
I never asked...

247
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
for your understanding.

248
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,879
So, think of me as your mother.

249
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:21,919
My father was poisoned,

250
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,759
and my brother was framed for it.

251
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:26,889
Was this why?

252
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,960
Was this the reason...

253
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,230
you tried to kill the Crown Prince?

254
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,230
My lady.

255
00:16:35,169 --> 00:16:36,169
Lady Myung Yoon...

256
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,250
Even so, I doubt she went straight to the Queen Dowager's...

257
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
Lady Myung Yoon.

258
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:14,970
Lady Myung Yoon.

259
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,519
Please kill me, Your Royal Highness.

260
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,720
Please take my life.

261
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,119
Take my life.

262
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:08,990
I suggest you two talk inside.

263
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,309
What you saw...

264
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:03,470
I saw it too.

265
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,980
My lady.

266
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,079
- Queen Dowager and your father... - How could they...

267
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,720
do such a thing to you...

268
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,250
and to His Majesty?

269
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,460
- My lady. - What should I do now?

270
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,559
Knowing what they have done to you...

271
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,700
Even brutes would never do what they did to you.

272
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:30,430
How will I carry the burden of their sins?

273
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,500
My lady.

274
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,509
Please look at me.

275
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:44,049
I am...

276
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,680
not in love with someone's daughter.

277
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:55,059
You are simply...

278
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,329
the first woman I have ever loved.

279
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,970
So I ask you...

280
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:09,609
to please remember me...

281
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:14,750
as a man who loved you,

282
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:18,519
not as the Crown Prince.

283
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,769
Where is Myung Yoon?

284
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,069
Why are you looking for her here?

285
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:18,440
You took her from Yanghwadang yesterday.

286
00:22:20,509 --> 00:22:22,980
That was not me. The person who took her...

287
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,549
was the Crown Prince.

288
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,589
Did he hide it from you as well?

289
00:22:33,089 --> 00:22:34,890
When I visited him last night,

290
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,160
he was with Myung Yoon.

291
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,400
Tell the Crown Prince to hand over Myung Yoon.

292
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:48,640
Why should I do that?

293
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:53,480
Your Highness, you and Myung Yoon will get married.

294
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,579
So, you must find her before rumours spread.

295
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,250
You must hurry.

296
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:06,019
Then I will trust that you will find her, Your Highness.

297
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,750
Are you Moo Baek?

298
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,960
Where does her mother's maternal family live?

299
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,369
Her mother's uncle lives in Buyeo.

300
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,230
Do you think...

301
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,900
you can take Lady Myung Yoon there without your master finding out?

302
00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:55,140
I ought to obey Lady Myung Yoon's orders.

303
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,639
If she wishes to go home...

304
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,440
If she returns home and stays with your master,

305
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,509
they will both end up...

306
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,650
being punished for treason eventually.

307
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,849
Keep your head down!

308
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,589
How dare you...

309
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,589
"Treason?" That is preposterous.

310
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:14,118
Lady Myung Yoon did nothing wrong.

311
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,829
But her father committed high treason.

312
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,130
Seeing how you will not ask another question,

313
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,369
I am certain you already know what your master did.

314
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,240
Even better if her mother's maternal family does not live there.

315
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,240
Can you take her to a place where no one knows her...

316
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,039
and keep her safe?

317
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:35,579
I already told you.

318
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:39,880
I must obey her and follow her wishes.

319
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,250
Even if...

320
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,789
it gets her killed?

321
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,519
No matter what happens,

322
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:48,058
I will protect her.

323
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:50,529
Even if it goes against your master's wishes?

324
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,960
Would you still be able to protect her?

325
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,730
The person I ought to risk my life to protect...

326
00:24:58,599 --> 00:24:59,740
is Lady Myung Yoon,

327
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:02,069
no one else.

328
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,690
Did he hide it from you as well?

329
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:20,619
When I visited him last night,

330
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:23,190
he was with Myung Yoon.

331
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,630
I have informed the Royal Kitchen, so they will soon bring our drinks.

332
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,869
People will constantly knock on these doors,

333
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:35,809
so let us drink in your room.

334
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,889
Where is Gun?

335
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,390
How did you find me here?

336
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,629
His Royal Highness is looking for you. I was on my way...

337
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,900
to fetch you.

338
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,640
I need to talk to you. It is about Lady Myung Yoon.

339
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:13,910
She is...

340
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,349
at Buyong Pavilion now.

341
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,920
Choi Sang Rok dropped by earlier.

342
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,750
Was he looking for her?

343
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,250
Yes.

344
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,420
The truth is,

345
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,920
Choi Sang Rok...

346
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,690
came into my chamber with a dagger to kill me last night.

347
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:32,500
Choi Sang Rok did such a thing?

348
00:26:33,329 --> 00:26:35,000
Are you not hurt?

349
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,200
I wanted to wait until I calmed down a bit,

350
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,309
but this happened.

351
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:44,809
I am sorry.

352
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,539
No, do not be sorry. I am relieved that you are okay.

353
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,410
But earlier...

354
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:56,049
Never mind.

355
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,459
What do you plan to do now?

356
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,618
What if...

357
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:03,559
Father's condition worsens drastically overnight?

358
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,799
We ought to torture Choi Sang Rok...

359
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,629
to find out what we can use as an antidote.

360
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,899
Do you think he will surrender and give us that information?

361
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,170
Before returning to the palace,

362
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:16,910
I met the Training General and the Royal Guard Commander in secret...

363
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:19,039
and made sure to obtain their promise.

364
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:20,640
As soon as I let them know,

365
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,879
they will come barging in with their soldiers.

366
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,680
- Then Lady Myung Yoon is also... - That is correct.

367
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:27,980
She will be hurt too.

368
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,049
Then we must make sure...

369
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:33,119
she leaves the palace as soon as possible.

370
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:45,099
Gun, the wind is still chilly.

371
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,539
I cannot believe you made her wait here.

372
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:50,210
I had no choice.

373
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,940
Her priority is to avoid those who might harm her, not the wind.

374
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:56,349
Are you all right?

375
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,518
Yes.

376
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:00,779
- Let us go to the East Palace. - Your Royal Highness.

377
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,589
My brother and I thought long and hard...

378
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,160
and arrived at the conclusion that it is the safest place now,

379
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,289
so please listen to us.

380
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:11,629
We will make sure you can leave the palace tonight.

381
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:12,959
No, I...

382
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,230
If you decide not to leave,

383
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:16,329
I will stay here too.

384
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:20,400
Then...

385
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,369
I shall also stay here to protect you, Gun.

386
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:38,250
She is not in the East Palace? Then where did she go?

387
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:41,390
She could not have left the palace yet,

388
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,589
so she must be somewhere inside the palace.

389
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,829
"Somewhere inside the palace?"

390
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:50,298
She must still be in shock. What if something bad happens to her...

391
00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:52,140
while wandering around in her current state?

392
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,769
We must hurry up and find her before that happens.

393
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,640
Yes, she must be very hurt emotionally.

394
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,109
However, neither the Crown Prince nor Prince Dosung...

395
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,480
will hurt Myung Yoon,

396
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,579
so she will be safe.

397
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:06,980
As for Prince Dosung,

398
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,990
I understand he will not hurt Myung Yoon for he fancies her.

399
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,720
How could you be so certain that the Crown Prince would not hurt her?

400
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,130
I have confirmed that the Crown Prince...

401
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,230
also feels the same way about Myung Yoon.

402
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,400
- Then... - Yes.

403
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,869
Since this has already happened,

404
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:29,269
I believe it is better that they leave the palace with Myung Yoon.

405
00:29:29,509 --> 00:29:30,910
That is why I am not intervening,

406
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,180
so do not be concerned.

407
00:29:34,309 --> 00:29:35,480
Understood.

408
00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:42,319
Then what do you think we should do with the Crown Prince?

409
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:51,858
I suggest you issue a royal decree.

410
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:55,669
(Bimanggi: A royal decree)

411
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:56,869
A royal decree?

412
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,950
Get some rest.

413
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:17,250
I am stepping out for a quick talk with Dosung.

414
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:19,859
Sure.

415
00:30:20,259 --> 00:30:23,230
Will you be all right alone?

416
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:25,829
Yes.

417
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,028
Gap Seok is guarding the room outside, so relax and...

418
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:30,470
I am okay now.

419
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,269
Please do not worry about me. Get going.

420
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:20,220
That man, Moo Baek. Can we trust him?

421
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:23,619
We have to trust him.

422
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:26,160
At the moment, we have no choice.

423
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,519
Well understood.

424
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:31,588
Then I will take her...

425
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,230
to that location.

426
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:35,230
- You will take her there? - Yes.

427
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,269
There are more eyes watching you than me,

428
00:31:38,569 --> 00:31:39,900
so I believe that would be better.

429
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,470
Then do me a favour and take her there safely.

430
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,779
A favour? Please.

431
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,240
After all, we nearly got married.

432
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,579
Of course, I should do it.

433
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:06,900
It will be a tough journey.

434
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:09,829
If you leave on an empty stomach, you may faint.

435
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:12,099
I was worried, so I prepared this meal.

436
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,410
Force yourself to have some food.

437
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,269
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

438
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,579
You should eat too.

439
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:50,069
It is all pointless.

440
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,339
I will never see her again anyway.

441
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,640
Whatever happens,

442
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,240
why would it matter?

443
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:15,190
Did you draw this?

444
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:17,530
Yes.

445
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,900
My mother's maternal family lives near a village called Saleogae.

446
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,469
Every spring,

447
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,868
you can see apricot blossoms in full bloom.

448
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:28,699
I suddenly remembered that scenery, so I drew this.

449
00:34:38,949 --> 00:34:42,019
So, these fluttering petals are all apricot flowers?

450
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:45,219
It actually looks much more beautiful in real life.

451
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,719
But I cannot draw too well.

452
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,829
They look like peach blossoms or snow.

453
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,139
I certainly would not call this a great painting.

454
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,409
But I am not a painter, am I?

455
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,219
Who is this man?

456
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,449
Who do you think it is?

457
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,719
He is good-looking.

458
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:21,820
You must have drawn a handsome nobleman.

459
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:25,630
Could he be someone you have feelings for?

460
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,238
(I will remember you forever.)

461
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,340
"I will..."

462
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,480
"forever remember you."

463
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:57,929
(I will remember you forever.)

464
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:10,239
I will remember you forever.

465
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:20,219
Though I do not know who she is, she has well-defined features.

466
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:22,789
You must have drawn a beautiful lady.

467
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:24,618
Could she be someone...

468
00:36:24,619 --> 00:36:26,820
Your Royal Highness has feelings for?

469
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:51,980
Until the petals that fall...

470
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,348
make a mountain of their own,

471
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:56,249
(Until the petals that fall...)

472
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,819
(make a mountain of their own, )

473
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,919
I will remember you forever.

474
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,630
(I will remember you forever.)

475
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,760
(Baek Gu)

476
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:35,630
"Baek Gu?"

477
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,329
I wish...

478
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,369
I was Baek Gu.

479
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,139
I wish you were Baek Gu.

480
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,780
Had I been Baek Gu,

481
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,079
I would not have had to leave like this.

482
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,250
I would have been able...

483
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:08,058
to stay by His Royal Highness's side.

484
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:10,090
(Baek Gu)

485
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,059
Had you been Baek Gu,

486
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,400
I would have stopped you from leaving.

487
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,869
I would have...

488
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:24,269
had you stay by my side.

489
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:34,078
(Until the petals that fall make a mountain of their own, )

490
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,250
(I will remember you forever.)

491
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:50,130
Please...

492
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,300
be well, Your Royal Highness.

493
00:38:55,469 --> 00:38:56,510
You should also...

494
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:00,579
stay safe.

495
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,920
Eat well,

496
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,050
and sleep well.

497
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,309
It is how I feel about you.

498
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,899
(Until the petals that fall make a mountain of their own, )

499
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:31,769
(I will remember you forever.)

500
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,570
Are you all right?

501
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:11,170
Let us take a short break.

502
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,110
My apologies.

503
00:41:19,719 --> 00:41:20,750
Did something happen...

504
00:41:22,219 --> 00:41:24,119
at the Queen Dowager's quarters during the day?

505
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:27,159
I witnessed what...

506
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,960
the Crown Prince had seen.

507
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:34,030
I am leaving...

508
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:37,400
as I cannot defy His Royal Highness's wishes.

509
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,400
However, how could I...

510
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:42,139
dare to think of surviving?

511
00:41:43,909 --> 00:41:44,969
If only...

512
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:47,738
I could pay for my sin with death.

513
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,349
Stop with that absurdity.

514
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,619
You did not choose your father, did you?

515
00:41:54,949 --> 00:41:56,590
Whether I chose him or not,

516
00:41:56,989 --> 00:41:59,789
the fact that I am his daughter does not change.

517
00:41:59,889 --> 00:42:02,860
Are you implying the child is a murderer if their father is one?

518
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:05,530
Had I really thought so,

519
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,659
you would not be before me right now.

520
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,929
I would have had you killed a long time ago.

521
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,969
So, do not think like so.

522
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:22,849
Are you able to walk?

523
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:26,079
Yes.

524
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:31,719
Gun. It is I.

525
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,219
Come in.

526
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,300
She has left safely.

527
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,368
Great work.

528
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:48,139
I told her once again...

529
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:50,139
not to go home.

530
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:52,440
Do not worry.

531
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:56,550
The fortress gates will open when dawn breaks.

532
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,650
She should sleep within the capital tonight.

533
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,480
I wonder if there are any places to sleep.

534
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,500
By the way, where do we sleep...

535
00:43:20,769 --> 00:43:22,269
if we do not go home?

536
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:25,110
I found a place near the gates to stay the night.

537
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,079
Let us go home.

538
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,848
We cannot do that, my lady.

539
00:43:29,849 --> 00:43:31,449
If I disappear like this,

540
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,619
who do you think will take the blame?

541
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:36,449
It is crystal clear His Royal Highness...

542
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:38,789
or Prince Dosung will have a hard time.

543
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:41,489
I cannot let that happen.

544
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,429
What now?

545
00:43:54,269 --> 00:43:56,769
I will not allow it. You cannot go home.

546
00:43:58,010 --> 00:43:59,610
- Move. - No, I will not.

547
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,139
I am ordering you to move.

548
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,209
My lady.

549
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:07,179
You know better than anyone else why I am stopping you.

550
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,119
And you know better than anyone else why I wish to go home.

551
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:12,320
I do. However,

552
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,360
please follow my words this time.

553
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,960
My lady.

554
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:22,929
Keep stopping me,

555
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:24,928
and either you or I...

556
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:26,699
will get hurt.

557
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:29,039
You know me, no?

558
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:32,210
Do not test my volition any longer.

559
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:39,619
I cannot handle this.

560
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:41,579
What is wrong with her?

561
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:42,889
Let us go.

562
00:44:43,719 --> 00:44:45,820
Pardon? Are we going home?

563
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,630
But will we not die if we go home?

564
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:52,090
Should you not make her pass out and carry her?

565
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,960
We should not go home, should we?

566
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:57,769
Moo Baek!

567
00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:05,139
His lord has returned home.

568
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:24,489
My lady?

569
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:26,559
Do not bother.

570
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:43,449
Sit down.

571
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:52,349
Did you not hear me?

572
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:54,559
Sit.

573
00:45:59,429 --> 00:46:01,029
What happened at the Queen Dowager's quarters...

574
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:02,360
I do not want to hear about it.

575
00:46:03,099 --> 00:46:05,070
We must settle the misunderstanding, no?

576
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:07,639
What...

577
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,408
could be a misunderstanding...

578
00:46:10,409 --> 00:46:12,170
when I clearly saw it with my own two eyes?

579
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:15,939
What you saw is not everything.

580
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,050
If not,

581
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:21,249
is there more I must know about you two?

582
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,250
We...

583
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:28,289
Did you...

584
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,829
just say "we?"

585
00:46:33,699 --> 00:46:36,268
I could not believe what I saw.

586
00:46:36,269 --> 00:46:37,730
Nor did I want to believe it.

587
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:39,769
Do not assume...

588
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:42,869
that what you saw is the end of it all.

589
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:46,209
Loving someone...

590
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,239
You...

591
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:51,179
You loved someone you should not love.

592
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:53,920
A queen dowager of a nation...

593
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:56,218
gave way to her temptations...

594
00:46:56,219 --> 00:46:58,618
and deceived others and brought them misery.

595
00:46:58,619 --> 00:46:59,619
Myung Yoon,

596
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,059
you can resent and condemn me all you want,

597
00:47:03,659 --> 00:47:04,959
but not her...

598
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,900
How can you be this brazen?

599
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,368
How could a person be this cruel?

600
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,070
Do you not fear the skies?

601
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:19,070
That...

602
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:23,409
is what I would have said if I were not your daughter.

603
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:25,809
Do you not think that there is a story...

604
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,289
behind what led us to be this way?

605
00:47:31,989 --> 00:47:32,989
Of course.

606
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,260
I am sure there is one.

607
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,530
But your relationship is not what I cannot tolerate.

608
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,469
To conceal this relationship,

609
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:48,469
you killed those innocent...

610
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,840
and framed His Royal Highness as a traitor...

611
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:54,078
which resulted in his deposition.

612
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,280
Not only that,

613
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,119
you poisoned...

614
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:03,920
His Majesty.

615
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:08,689
What I cannot bear is the fact that my father...

616
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,860
is a terrifying, cruel, and despicable sinner.

617
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,058
Whatever story you may have...

618
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:17,630
could never be an excuse for what you did.

619
00:48:18,369 --> 00:48:20,699
Even your own child cannot tolerate it,

620
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:24,170
so how could anyone forgive you?

621
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,440
They will not.

622
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:31,050
Not even the skies...

623
00:48:33,219 --> 00:48:34,679
will forgive you.

624
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,199
Until the petals that fall...

625
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:31,809
make a mountain of their own,

626
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:36,210
I will remember you forever.

627
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:48,260
You did not choose your father, did you?

628
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:50,829
Whether I chose him or not,

629
00:49:51,329 --> 00:49:54,099
the fact that I am his daughter does not change.

630
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:57,099
Are you implying the child is a murderer if their father is one?

631
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,999
Had I really thought so,

632
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,800
you would not be before me right now.

633
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:29,199
Myung Yoon...

634
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:50,989
This is the royal order from the Queen Dowager...

635
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:53,789
regarding the status of the deposed Crown Prince Lee Gun.

636
00:50:55,559 --> 00:50:56,690
You ought to read it.

637
00:50:58,030 --> 00:50:59,090
I will excuse myself.

638
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:09,969
Read it for us.

639
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,070
Sure.

640
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,690
"Government officials continue to discuss and argue..."

641
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:29,590
"about the reinstatement of the deposed Crown Prince."

642
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:33,130
Due to lacking virtue and fortune,

643
00:51:34,699 --> 00:51:36,230
I suffered a series of misfortune...

644
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:38,730
which led me to be in constant worry...

645
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:41,739
ever since I took over as regent.

646
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:46,239
So how could I possibly be at ease even if it is for a brief moment?

647
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,610
The Crown Prince is the root of this nation,

648
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:52,480
and with him lies the future of this nation and the royal family.

649
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:55,949
The people's and the sky's trust also lies with him.

650
00:51:56,849 --> 00:51:57,920
For that reason...

651
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:59,488
"The deposed Crown Prince..."

652
00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:01,219
"who murdered a material witness that could prove treason..."

653
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,699
"His reinstatement..."

654
00:52:09,929 --> 00:52:10,969
"is prohibited."

655
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:22,309
However,

656
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,679
I have come to realize...

657
00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:27,820
that his so-called crime of treason is also beyond reason.

658
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,320
Thus, he will be exonerated.

659
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,819
(Shinwon: Exonerate)

660
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,789
He will be given the royal name Susung...

661
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:38,729
and be addressed as Prince Susung.

662
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:39,929
(Jinchek: The act of bestowing a regnal name)

663
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,099
How can you be chuckling at a moment like this?

664
00:52:49,239 --> 00:52:51,539
Are you suggesting I weep instead?

665
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:52,739
That is not what I meant.

666
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:55,309
How can you be downgraded...

667
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:57,809
to an ordinary prince?

668
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,780
That is not the matter at hand.

669
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:04,389
Who cares whether I am a crown prince or not?

670
00:53:05,489 --> 00:53:07,219
I am glad to have been exonerated from the crime of treason.

671
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:14,429
The Queen Dowager wants us to be at each other's throats.

672
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,570
You are absolutely right.

673
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,369
The officials are already taking sides...

674
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:23,809
between you and Prince Dosung.

675
00:53:30,579 --> 00:53:31,780
The Queen Dowager...

676
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:35,050
let her affection sway her decision.

677
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:40,090
We all know why he murdered the royal taster.

678
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,429
That is preposterous.

679
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:46,960
He should have been reinstated, not just exonerated.

680
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,499
Think of why...

681
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:51,230
His Majesty had him take the royal seal.

682
00:53:51,869 --> 00:53:54,469
The situation is completely different now.

683
00:53:55,539 --> 00:53:59,268
Obviously, Prince Dosung should be Crown Prince and...

684
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:00,840
That is enough.

685
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:18,289
I wish to deliver a few words.

686
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:20,630
I am aware of the heated discussions...

687
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,199
that take place here regarding my situation.

688
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:24,829
However,

689
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:26,940
discussing my situation...

690
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:29,469
should not keep you from doing your work.

691
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,610
While you have been arguing about my reinstatement,

692
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:37,510
appeals have been piling up.

693
00:54:39,449 --> 00:54:42,519
If I must be punished for a crime, I will gladly accept my sentence.

694
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,889
Still,

695
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:48,119
the concerns of the people should not be pushed aside.

696
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,489
Let us stay up all night...

697
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:53,230
and handle all of these appeals.

698
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:04,239
I ask that you aid us...

699
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:06,710
with your vast knowledge and experience.

700
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,690
I hear a disease is spreading in the Honam region.

701
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,300
We could use your advice, Inspector General Choi.

702
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,949
Your Majesty, your grandson has a request.

703
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:50,650
Speak.

704
00:55:51,289 --> 00:55:52,419
I heard the position of Left State Councillor...

705
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,420
still remains vacant.

706
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:55,789
If the court shuts down for a day,

707
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:59,159
the people will suffer for a year.

708
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:02,099
It is why I ask for Yoon Yi Kyum...

709
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:04,469
to be reinstated.

710
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:16,710
Please share your thoughts on the matter.

711
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:20,750
Prince Susung's request is thoughtful and appropriate.

712
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:23,788
Please consider his request.

713
00:56:23,789 --> 00:56:25,089
(Ganab: Approving one's request)

714
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,889
- Please consider his request. - Please consider his request.

715
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:44,869
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

716
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,340
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

717
00:56:53,719 --> 00:56:55,380
- Congratulations, Lord Yoon. - Congratulations.

718
00:56:55,519 --> 00:56:57,949
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

719
00:57:11,170 --> 00:57:12,929
He is not a pushover, that is for sure.

720
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:16,869
It did not take him long to captivate the officials.

721
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:21,639
His innate qualities of a monarch are finally blossoming.

722
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:24,909
If only we could change Prince Susung's mind.

723
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:29,320
Could there be a way?

724
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,969
Should I brew a tonic for her?

725
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,570
As if she would drink that...

726
00:57:51,409 --> 00:57:52,670
when she is refusing to eat.

727
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:54,440
What do we do, then?

728
00:57:57,349 --> 00:57:59,110
I do not remember...

729
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,980
her being this disheartened at anything before.

730
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,150
Hold on.

731
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,489
Well...

732
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:14,130
The Queen Dowager sent me.

733
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,730
What does the Queen Dowager want?

734
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:16,928
Lady Myung Yoon...

735
00:58:16,929 --> 00:58:18,829
is to obey the Queen Dowager and make way...

736
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,599
to the palace.

737
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,969
Tell her I cannot travel due to being ill.

738
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:35,550
My lady.

739
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,650
We are prepared to leave,

740
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,289
so give me the word,

741
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:43,690
and I will escort you.

742
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:48,130
If I could, I would love to leave this house.

743
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:52,500
However, he is still my father.

744
00:58:54,869 --> 00:58:56,340
How could I abandon him...

745
00:58:56,739 --> 00:58:58,670
and run to save my own life?

746
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,340
Now that you know what is going on,

747
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,179
I will fill in the blanks.

748
00:59:07,579 --> 00:59:10,150
You see, the day the royal taster died,

749
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:13,760
Lord Choi was planning to escape the palace...

750
00:59:14,619 --> 00:59:16,389
with the Queen Dowager.

751
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:18,959
He ordered me...

752
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,360
to escort the Queen Dowager to the rendezvous point,

753
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,269
but he gave me no instructions...

754
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:26,940
regarding your safety.

755
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:31,309
That is the day I finally learned the truth.

756
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:33,980
To him,

757
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:37,979
the Queen Dowager's life takes priority over yours.

758
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:39,409
Watch your words.

759
00:59:41,219 --> 00:59:42,420
Lord Choi...

760
00:59:43,050 --> 00:59:46,420
is more terrifying than you could imagine.

761
00:59:46,789 --> 00:59:49,159
You must know that he would abandon his child...

762
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:52,030
- if that was an option. - Enough.

763
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,599
No matter what you say,

764
00:59:56,030 --> 00:59:58,329
I will never choose to abandon my father.

765
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:59,769
My lady.

766
01:00:02,199 --> 01:00:03,969
- Lord Choi... - I know.

767
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:07,340
He took innocent lives.

768
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:08,979
And among his innocent victims are...

769
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,449
The Crown Prince...

770
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:14,280
and also His Majesty.

771
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:17,219
Your mother is also one of them.

772
01:00:20,289 --> 01:00:21,960
He is the one...

773
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:25,590
who took the life of your birth mother.

774
01:00:31,269 --> 01:00:32,400
Are you saying...

775
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:37,110
that my father killed...

776
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:44,879
How dare you accuse him of such an outrageous crime?

777
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,679
I swear on my mother's name that I am telling the truth.

778
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:51,289
Your mother was lying in the pool of her own blood,

779
01:00:52,989 --> 01:00:55,289
and I remember that as if it happened yesterday.

780
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:02,829
That cannot be.

781
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:07,538
You must be mistaken. Why would my father...

782
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:09,139
For the Queen Dowager.

783
01:01:10,539 --> 01:01:11,710
For her,

784
01:01:13,369 --> 01:01:15,079
he killed his own wife.

785
01:01:17,409 --> 01:01:19,780
You were just over the age of one and with your mother.

786
01:01:20,820 --> 01:01:24,190
As if you knew what was happening,

787
01:01:26,989 --> 01:01:28,860
you were crying your eyes out.

788
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,230
And I remember it like it was yesterday.

789
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:08,460
Myung Yoon...

790
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:19,269
My lady.

791
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,309
Moo Baek.

792
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:25,980
Yes, my lady.

793
01:02:29,949 --> 01:02:31,019
Myung Yoon...

794
01:02:33,389 --> 01:02:34,389
My lady...

795
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:43,059
My lady, no!

796
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:46,929
My lady!

797
01:02:57,309 --> 01:02:58,309
This...

798
01:03:00,349 --> 01:03:02,380
is the baby quilt you were wrapped in.

799
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:11,059
I could not bring myself to throw it away...

800
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:13,230
after how she was robbed of her life...

801
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,360
which is why I kept it.

802
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,730
But never did I want to display it...

803
01:03:23,739 --> 01:03:25,340
in front of you.

804
01:04:02,579 --> 01:04:03,679
Mother...

805
01:04:13,489 --> 01:04:14,559
Mother.

806
01:04:57,969 --> 01:05:01,769
Why did you want to see me?

807
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,579
This is what the Office of the Inspector General found...

808
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:14,820
while looking into your grandmother.

809
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:30,929
What do you mean by this?

810
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:32,828
We should let bygones be bygones.

811
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:34,099
For you and I...

812
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:37,039
have the same objective.

813
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,579
What if I decline the offer?

814
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:49,979
Do you want me to reveal...

815
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:52,119
who actually killed the royal taster?

816
01:05:53,989 --> 01:05:56,059
You must be aware that she did not die...

817
01:05:56,889 --> 01:05:58,690
at the hands of the deposed Crown Prince.

818
01:06:16,139 --> 01:06:17,678
(Until the petals that fall make a mountain of their own, )

819
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:18,849
(I will remember you forever.)

820
01:06:56,949 --> 01:06:58,650
It is Mother's silver dagger.

821
01:06:59,489 --> 01:07:01,289
She dropped it at the prison cell...

822
01:07:01,889 --> 01:07:03,059
which I retrieved.

823
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,030
Good.

824
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,829
I will get rid of it on my end,

825
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,969
so forget that such an event ever took place.

826
01:07:38,389 --> 01:07:39,489
Is it true?

827
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:42,800
What are you asking?

828
01:07:43,329 --> 01:07:44,369
Was it you...

829
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:49,199
who killed my mother?

830
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:57,139
Please answer me.

831
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:00,309
Was it you...

832
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:03,619
who killed...

833
01:08:08,989 --> 01:08:10,320
Mother?

834
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,698
Tell me if it is not true.

835
01:08:16,699 --> 01:08:18,529
Why are you not saying anything?

836
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:22,539
Father!

837
01:08:31,909 --> 01:08:32,949
Yes,

838
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:36,949
that is true.

839
01:08:39,149 --> 01:08:40,520
I killed your mother.

840
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:24,899
(Missing Crown Prince)

841
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:27,270
Find out where they are keeping Kim Dal Saeng.

842
01:09:28,069 --> 01:09:29,569
I am certain it was his doing.

843
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,709
I put my life on the line and entered the palace...

844
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:33,809
to put a stop on my father's evil deeds.

845
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:35,179
We are only in this mess...

846
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:37,609
because the two brothers share a tight bond.

847
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:39,680
We should sever that bond between them.

848
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:41,519
It was the Crown Prince's bodyguard...

849
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,979
who attacked Left State Councillor Yoon.

850
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:45,649
Did it seem like Prince Dosung was wavering?

851
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:47,019
And then some.

852
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,919
I cannot let Lady Myung Yoon be sacrificed as well.

853
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,559
There are things in this world we must do...

854
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,729
even though it goes against our wishes.
