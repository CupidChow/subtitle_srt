(Episode 5)

14
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:21,420
No!

15
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:25,560
Your Majesty.

16
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,430
Prince Dosung.

17
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,159
His Majesty...

18
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,359
His Majesty...

19
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,969
What happened?

20
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:36,230
What happened to Father?

21
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,870
I am asking you what happened!

22
00:01:39,969 --> 00:01:42,068
Please take our lives.

23
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,780
- Please take our lives. - Please take our lives.

24
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,949
Mother.

25
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,919
Please calm down.

26
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,319
Calm down...

27
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,090
and tell me what happened.

28
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,530
Prince Dosung.

29
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,889
Prince Dosung.

30
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:37,430
Yes, Mother.

31
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:40,030
I am listening.

32
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,669
It was not me.

33
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,840
I did not do this.

34
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:46,500
I did not do anything.

35
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,370
I am telling you the truth.

36
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,139
Please calm down and speak slowly.

37
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,780
Please explain what happened.

38
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,918
In the middle of his meal, His Majesty suddenly...

39
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,490
(Sura: King's meal)

40
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,620
He suddenly...

41
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,360
So, you were with him when it happened?

42
00:03:06,189 --> 00:03:09,789
Were you the one who prepared the meal?

43
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,830
Yes.

44
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,259
No.

45
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,270
It was not me. It was prepared by the Queen Dowager.

46
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:19,139
Did you...

47
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,240
just say the Queen Dowager?

48
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:23,939
I know nothing about it.

49
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:27,009
I swear, I know nothing about it.

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,110
The Queen Dowager...

51
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:31,180
It was the Queen Dowager.

52
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:53,240
What are you doing? Stop him!

53
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,310
- Your Highness. - Step aside!

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,349
Open the doors!

55
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:09,550
Tell them to get out, right this instant.

56
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,419
Before I slay them all.

57
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,480
You deserve to die a thousand times...

58
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,310
to pay for what you did to the Crown Prince.

59
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,680
How dare you hurt His Majesty...

60
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,920
and frame my mother for it...

61
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,689
just to cover up your despicable sin?

62
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,389
So?

63
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,459
Will you...

64
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:48,389
slay me with your sword?

65
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:49,930
Shut your mouth!

66
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,899
The moment you had such a secret rendezvous with Choi,

67
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,229
you lost your dignity as the Queen Dowager...

68
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,069
and became this witch who has gone crazy over a man.

69
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,870
You do not think I can slay you?

70
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,769
Then go ahead and slay me.

71
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:06,240
Take my life.

72
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:08,910
However,

73
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,250
the King will never wake up again if I die,

74
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:16,089
and the Queen will become a traitor who assassinated the King.

75
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:19,459
And you, Prince Dosung. For killing me, the Queen Dowager,

76
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,730
you will undoubtedly face your demise too.

77
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,959
If none of that matters to you,

78
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,230
you may slay me.

79
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,170
Do you truly mean it?

80
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:38,910
I am asking you if you are still on my side.

81
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,319
Because my grandfather betrayed you,

82
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,719
you wish to know if I am now on the Queen Dowager's side too?

83
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,759
Are you?

84
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:57,930
Why did you want to see me if you could not trust me at all?

85
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,629
To see if I would hand you over to them?

86
00:06:02,069 --> 00:06:04,269
Did you want to check and find out for yourself?

87
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,249
I did give the King a chance to choose...

88
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,089
between the throne and the Crown Prince.

89
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,560
Unfortunately, he chose the Crown Prince.

90
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,360
And now, you are witnessing the consequences of his choice.

91
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,160
I shall give you...

92
00:06:32,329 --> 00:06:35,129
a chance to save one of them.

93
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,769
Make your choice.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,439
Will you choose your mother...

95
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,379
or your half-brother?

96
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,720
Here comes Lee Gun, the traitor. Tie him up!

97
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,629
Do you trust me?

98
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:38,959
Yes.

99
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:41,769
Unlike you, I am not untrusting.

100
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:55,050
I need a word with Prince Dosung.

101
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:57,009
Step aside.

102
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,259
Did something happen...

103
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:13,600
at the palace?

104
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,129
Father...

105
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:19,639
has collapsed.

106
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,910
What are you waiting for?

107
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,879
Tie up the traitor at once!

108
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:32,820
Oh, gosh.

109
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,019
Stop, that is enough.

110
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,860
Your Royal Highness.

111
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,730
It is okay.

112
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,429
Let us go.

113
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:26,570
Where is my father?

114
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:28,440
No.

115
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:32,240
- What just happened? - Pardon me?

116
00:09:32,379 --> 00:09:33,908
Father kidnapped that scholar.

117
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:35,778
Why did the Department of Justice take him?

118
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:37,209
(Euigeumbu: Department of Justice)

119
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,379
Father could not sort out the situation himself,

120
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,620
so he got the Department of Justice involved?

121
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,960
Is this why I was suddenly sent to visit a patient?

122
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,888
So I would not see this?

123
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:49,329
My lady, it is not what you think.

124
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:51,330
Then why can you not answer my question?

125
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,069
If I am wrong, just say so.

126
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,769
Why can you not say anything?

127
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,840
What did he do?

128
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:05,480
Why did they arrest him? Tell me that, at least.

129
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,779
I am sorry.

130
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,210
- Lord Choi... - What? He did it for my sake?

131
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:18,559
Is it okay...

132
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,789
to trample all over someone innocent for the sake of his child?

133
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:27,259
Where is my father now?

134
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,629
Is he inside?

135
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,769
I...

136
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:40,080
did exactly what you people told me to do.

137
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,450
Give my father an antidote so that he can regain consciousness...

138
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,990
His Majesty will wake up soon enough.

139
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,860
I suggest you return to the palace at once.

140
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,099
You should stay by the Queen's side at this critical time.

141
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:04,039
Why? Are you planning to do something else to take her down?

142
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,709
Or is there a reason I must hurry back to the palace to protect her?

143
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,240
Of course, that is not the case.

144
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,980
If something else happens to Father,

145
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,889
or if you try to kill my brother,

146
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,389
I will kill you.

147
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,059
The Queen Dowager too, whom you love so dearly.

148
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,690
I will kill you both.

149
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:36,500
Say hello.

150
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,700
This is Prince Dosung.

151
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,250
Prince Dosung?

152
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,490
"Prince?"

153
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,190
(Public Dispensary)

154
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,340
By any chance, do you have feelings for Myung Yoon?

155
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,399
I am talking about my daughter.

156
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,619
What are you doing? Step aside at once.

157
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,789
I need your answer.

158
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:35,190
He does not even know that you were the one who kidnapped him,

159
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,129
so why are you doing this?

160
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:40,629
I kept racking my brain but could not figure it out.

161
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,569
Why must you have him killed?

162
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,139
I do not understand.

163
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:48,840
Please tell me.

164
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,110
Why did this have to happen? Explain so that I can understand.

165
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:55,079
Stop avoiding me. Please help me understand you.

166
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,179
I never asked...

167
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,220
for your understanding.

168
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,980
Father.

169
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,490
You were never like this.

170
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:04,789
Why did you change so much?

171
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:08,330
All your life, you were devoted to saving lives as a physician.

172
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,788
You contemplating the idea of killing someone...

173
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,200
Moo Baek, are you outside?

174
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,169
Take her home at once.

175
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,509
If you truly have nothing to do with what happened today,

176
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,309
please save him.

177
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:28,908
As soon as you get home, lock her in her room...

178
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:30,408
and make sure...

179
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:33,080
she does not leave her room until you have my permission.

180
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:35,049
- Father. - What are you waiting for?

181
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,019
Drag her out, at once!

182
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,559
Please come with me.

183
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,990
What is it...

184
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,330
that you are trying to hide?

185
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:09,049
My goodness. They must have tortured him severely.

186
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,519
Those despicable scoundrels.

187
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:14,019
They deserve to be stoned to death!

188
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,159
Oh, dear.

189
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,399
My goodness.

190
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,799
Your Royal Highness, let me do it.

191
00:14:25,169 --> 00:14:26,169
No, let me.

192
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,740
Are you all right?

193
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,278
Your Royal Highness.

194
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:35,980
Yes, it is I.

195
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,690
It is okay. You do not need to get up.

196
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,268
Because of my foolishness,

197
00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:55,699
(Miuk: Foolish)

198
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,639
I disgraced Your Royal Highness again.

199
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,440
You are badly hurt.

200
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,740
How did you hold out?

201
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,580
Did they accuse you of treason too?

202
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,750
They accused me of delivering the poisoned dried yellow croaker...

203
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,679
you gave me...

204
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,519
to the Queen.

205
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:44,480
Your Highness.

206
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:48,549
The Department of Justice has arrested the Crown Prince.

207
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:52,590
That means Father is...

208
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,889
I am sorry, Your Royal Highness.

209
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,090
I see.

210
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,259
That is what happened.

211
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,399
That is why Prince Dosung is also...

212
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,629
Yes.

213
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,340
The meal...

214
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,470
was served by the Queen.

215
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,980
But it was not her. The Queen Dowager did it.

216
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,710
That witch!

217
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,019
I am worried about Mother.

218
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,250
She has such a tender heart.

219
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:26,190
She must be deeply devastated.

220
00:16:26,789 --> 00:16:28,360
It is all my fault.

221
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:30,860
It is my fault that the Crown Prince is in such a mess now.

222
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,899
This is all my fault.

223
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:39,539
What kind of mother puts her son in such a predicament?

224
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,440
Mother, please calm down.

225
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,409
I will tell them the truth before it is too late.

226
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,279
That I was the fool who was deceived by the Queen Dowager...

227
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,419
and that I served the meal without realizing that it was poisoned.

228
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:55,250
It was all me.

229
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:57,889
I will tell them that it was all me...

230
00:16:58,389 --> 00:17:00,389
and gladly accept any punishment they decide to give me.

231
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,960
Mother!

232
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,730
I must go to the Department of Justice.

233
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,529
No, I must go to the Queen Dowager's quarters.

234
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,969
Mother, please calm down.

235
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,309
You will collapse at this rate.

236
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,479
I cannot let the Crown Prince die because of me.

237
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,009
I cannot do that.

238
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,548
I must save the Crown Prince.

239
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:22,710
Mother!

240
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:26,150
The Crown Prince did nothing wrong.

241
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:29,390
I am the one who should be punished. Why did they take him?

242
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:32,159
He did nothing wrong.

243
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,258
Mother.

244
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:35,759
Crown Prince...

245
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,630
Mother.

246
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,400
Mother!

247
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,750
You stay there.

248
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,119
You may come out.

249
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,410
I am sorry, Gun.

250
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:27,309
You are a fool.

251
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:29,380
Then what was I supposed to do?

252
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,179
What would you have done in such a situation?

253
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,680
You should have gone after Choi Sang Rok.

254
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:36,619
Had you caught the one who used the poison,

255
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,559
we could have saved Father.

256
00:18:43,529 --> 00:18:45,799
As Father always said,

257
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:49,069
you must learn to tame your fiery temper first.

258
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,298
Gun, in this situation...

259
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:52,569
In urgent situations,

260
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:54,910
you must think twice before you act.

261
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,440
You are at it again.

262
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,109
Once I die,

263
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,609
you will have to ascend the throne and become King.

264
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:05,380
I am truly concerned.

265
00:19:07,349 --> 00:19:09,390
Will you really die like this?

266
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:12,088
There is no way out of this.

267
00:19:12,089 --> 00:19:14,089
I did not know you were the type to give up so easily.

268
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,190
This is very unlike you.

269
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,960
If I deny it,

270
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,430
Mother...

271
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:25,440
will be arrested right away for treason.

272
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:29,140
Is that what you want?

273
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,508
If you are doing this to relieve me of...

274
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:37,279
How is Mother? Is she all right?

275
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,720
I do not know...

276
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,519
how I would pay for being such an unfilial son.

277
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,720
You are concerned about not being a perfect son...

278
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:50,359
in this situation?

279
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:52,930
Please.

280
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,099
Figure out a way with that smart brain of yours.

281
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,099
Please, Gun.

282
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:13,049
My lady, what are you pondering now?

283
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,450
My lady.

284
00:20:17,789 --> 00:20:18,789
Yes?

285
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,529
I understand that you are worried about the scholar,

286
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:26,059
but what are you cooking up that you are so deep in thought?

287
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:29,969
I am deeply concerned and anxious.

288
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,230
Do not be concerned.

289
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,869
I wish I could do something,

290
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:36,940
but there is nothing I could do. That was what I was pondering.

291
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,049
Who...

292
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:53,160
exactly are you?

293
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,630
Who are you really?

294
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,339
Baek Gu. How does Baek Gu sound?

295
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:46,480
This will not do. Let us go.

296
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,279
Pardon?

297
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:50,079
To where in the middle of the night?

298
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:03,390
Why must you look for patients at this hour?

299
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:05,700
Stop picking a fight.

300
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,500
I must do something to clear my mind.

301
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,029
Why must you clear your mind?

302
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,299
Thinking will not give me any solution.

303
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,670
I do not want to think,

304
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,579
which is making me think more.

305
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,309
Why not...

306
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,279
drink instead?

307
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,379
If you get drunk and knocked out, you will not think of anything.

308
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,390
Are you serious? May I do that?

309
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,059
- Excuse me? - Hold on.

310
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,690
I better ask the cook maid for drinks first.

311
00:22:35,589 --> 00:22:36,829
Are you really going to drink?

312
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,829
Do not do it!

313
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,829
All right, fine.

314
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,140
Wait a moment.

315
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,539
I forgot to give this medicine to Jin.

316
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,579
Wait here. It will not take long.

317
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,480
Do not think of running away.

318
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,650
Then go and deliver this to them.

319
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,950
Do not move an inch from this spot.

320
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:05,759
I will not leave without you.

321
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,789
I came here to drink in silence.

322
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:12,890
Leave. Do not disturb me.

323
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:17,160
We meet again.

324
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,000
I am a regular of this place.

325
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:24,500
Little did I expect to see you here.

326
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:30,210
- If you are asking me to leave... - No.

327
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,880
I, too, came to drink in peace.

328
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:36,380
If you allow it, I will leave after drinking these bottles.

329
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,779
I will not disturb you.

330
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:16,819
Seriously...

331
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,230
My lady...

332
00:25:23,829 --> 00:25:25,460
Where is she hiding?

333
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:03,170
May I ask a question?

334
00:26:05,339 --> 00:26:06,639
Earlier, at the Office of Medicine...

335
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,369
You promised not to disturb me, no?

336
00:26:09,309 --> 00:26:11,739
But I gave you a bottle. Consider it as payment and...

337
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:12,779
No.

338
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,210
Take it back.

339
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:20,879
Some may think...

340
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,750
I am hitting on a stranger.

341
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,219
You are much colder than the winters...

342
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,259
Cheol Du!

343
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,730
- Cheol Du! - Yes.

344
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,660
- Did you ask for me? - More drinks.

345
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,200
Understood.

346
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,180
My apologies.

347
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,509
My mind is crowded today.

348
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,950
I took it out on you for no reason.

349
00:26:56,089 --> 00:26:57,150
I apologize.

350
00:26:58,789 --> 00:26:59,859
I am sorry.

351
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:03,890
Do not apologize.

352
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:07,759
I had a bad day as well.

353
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,930
I apologize if I crossed the line.

354
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,940
Let us drink.

355
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,299
Why are you looking at me like that?

356
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,700
Why of all people...

357
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,740
were you born as the daughter of the royal physician?

358
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:55,650
Then why of all people were you born as the son of His Majesty the King?

359
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:01,950
Oh, right.

360
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:04,349
What was it that you wanted to ask me?

361
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,960
Well...

362
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,088
What did you talk about with my father?

363
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:12,099
That...

364
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,200
It is better to ask your father yourself.

365
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:16,329
Then...

366
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:18,939
I witnessed the military arrest a scholar...

367
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,970
at the Office of Medicine today.

368
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,240
By any chance,

369
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,410
do you know what happened?

370
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:29,009
Did you not see him?

371
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,880
When he was getting dragged away,

372
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,279
you would have been at the Office of Medicine.

373
00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:35,589
Why are you curious...

374
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,950
about that matter?

375
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,890
I doubt you know who that man is.

376
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:46,460
It suddenly occurred to me.

377
00:29:02,849 --> 00:29:05,579
The one I love and respect the most in the world...

378
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,849
might die because of me.

379
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,819
Same here. Because of me...

380
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:16,259
No.

381
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:20,259
Because of the fate I was born with,

382
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:22,769
an innocent person might die.

383
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,269
I believed...

384
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,940
I could die in that person's stead for their sake.

385
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:36,950
But I am drinking here after running away alone.

386
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,819
I had no idea how much of a coward I was.

387
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:49,759
I kept them alive one way or another, but today again...

388
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,730
"This must be the end."

389
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:57,430
"In the end, they might die because of me."

390
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:00,140
"They will die."

391
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:07,539
Just thinking about it drives me mad.

392
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,420
However, there is...

393
00:30:15,589 --> 00:30:17,750
nothing more I can do now.

394
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,079
You little...

395
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,539
I am your elder brother.

396
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,450
Stay still, will you?

397
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,150
Do you trust me?

398
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,250
Yes.

399
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,990
Unlike you, I am not untrusting.

400
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,269
My Baek Gu.

401
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:08,609
I suppose you were very worried about me.

402
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:11,470
He has been stabbed.

403
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,809
Would you be able...

404
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,609
to help me?

405
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:21,250
He does not even know that you were the one who kidnapped him,

406
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,220
so why are you doing this?

407
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,720
What is it that you are trying to hide?

408
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:51,680
We must make the Crown Prince admit it.

409
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:54,818
He will not confess to it easily.

410
00:31:54,819 --> 00:31:58,890
You, Left State Councillor, must make him confess to it.

411
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,259
Only then can Prince Dosung become the Crown Prince,

412
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,960
and only then will people not talk behind his back...

413
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,759
when he ascends the throne later on.

414
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,839
You ought to persuade the Crown Prince.

415
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,069
If he says things we do not need him to say,

416
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,480
the rest of the plan will go awry.

417
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:22,410
And if that happens, the situation will get uncomfortable...

418
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,410
for both of us.

419
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:32,819
Your Highness.

420
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,329
Please try to pull yourself together.

421
00:32:35,529 --> 00:32:38,529
If you keep refusing to eat and drink...

422
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,799
- Your Highness. - I must see him.

423
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,068
Your Highness.

424
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:48,240
The Commander of the Royal Guards must be guarding the bedchamber.

425
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,869
He said he would let us know right away if anything happened, so...

426
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:55,309
Your Highness.

427
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,450
Gosh, Your Highness.

428
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,029
Yes, my lord.

429
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:12,099
Hey.

430
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,309
Me too?

431
00:33:25,339 --> 00:33:28,079
Tell the guards outside to leave...

432
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,979
and wait at the meeting hall.

433
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,019
(Bincheong: Meeting hall where ministers' meetings were held)

434
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:35,619
Pardon me?

435
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:54,069
Leave at once!

436
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,980
How are you feeling?

437
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:39,150
The cat is worried about the mouse?

438
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,079
You are out of line.

439
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:45,149
Do you really think so?

440
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:49,190
This situation saddens me too.

441
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,400
What do you want?

442
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,570
You framed me and came here to see me.

443
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,900
There must be something you want from me.

444
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,170
Tell me.

445
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:09,780
Please die.

446
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:18,420
The Queen raised you as if you were her own child,

447
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:23,230
and Prince Dosung cherishes you as if you are his real brother.

448
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:28,059
You are the only one who can save them.

449
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,369
Why must I do that?

450
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:34,300
I suppose you have already forgotten...

451
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,009
why I am here now.

452
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:41,139
Most importantly, you ought to save His Majesty.

453
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,880
If you wish to save His Majesty,

454
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:49,550
you must do as I say.

455
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:52,760
If I obey you and die,

456
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,360
Father...

457
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,489
will be your next target.

458
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,460
Am I wrong?

459
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,369
Because as long as Father is alive,

460
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,070
Dosung cannot become King.

461
00:36:08,909 --> 00:36:11,239
You are making unreasonable assumptions.

462
00:36:11,539 --> 00:36:12,610
"Unreasonable assumptions?"

463
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:16,179
If you want to, you can influence the Minister of War right now...

464
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,579
to oust the Queen Dowager as well as Choi Sang Rok.

465
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:21,519
But why are you obeying the Queen Dowager without rebelling once?

466
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,619
Do you think I would not know the reason?

467
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:28,218
If you can make Dosung ascend the throne...

468
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,659
No. If you can become the King's grandfather...

469
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:33,829
and take power over the sovereign,

470
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,469
you will not care even if your daughter becomes a widow,

471
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:40,769
and you will hurt my father...

472
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,210
without feeling an ounce of guilt.

473
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:49,309
If I am wrong,

474
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,480
try and deny it again.

475
00:36:55,619 --> 00:36:58,820
You will not believe me no matter what I say,

476
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:01,289
so go ahead and think whatever you want.

477
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:05,030
But if you wish to save His Majesty...

478
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:11,230
and those who are dear to you,

479
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,900
you must...

480
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,739
remember what I said.

481
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,239
And you must remember this.

482
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,210
If you do anything to hurt my father in any way,

483
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:28,519
you will certainly pay for it.

484
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:42,800
Your Highness, what happened inside?

485
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,369
Gosh, Your Highness.

486
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,500
Your Highness, are you all right?

487
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,269
How did it go?

488
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:23,269
What did the Crown Prince say?

489
00:38:23,469 --> 00:38:25,610
Did he accept it without resisting?

490
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,579
Why was the Queen there?

491
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,218
Did you call her there to persuade the Crown Prince?

492
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:35,420
What do you mean?

493
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,489
The Queen was at the prison?

494
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,239
If I obey you and die,

495
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,510
Father will be your next target.

496
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,780
Because as long as Father is alive,

497
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,960
Dosung cannot become King.

498
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,969
Your Highness.

499
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:26,440
You should return to your palace and go to sleep.

500
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,210
I told you...

501
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:33,139
that I would not even budge until His Majesty woke up.

502
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,010
Just know that and leave.

503
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:37,409
Your Highness, but...

504
00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:03,510
What are you doing?

505
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,610
Step aside!

506
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,178
Her Highness...

507
00:40:07,179 --> 00:40:09,879
ordered us not to let anyone in.

508
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,110
"Anyone?"

509
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,880
Do you not know who I am?

510
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,089
I am the Queen's father.

511
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:20,319
We were told not to let anyone in, whoever it may be.

512
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,119
How dare you.

513
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:26,800
What are you waiting for?

514
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,869
Tell her at once that I am here.

515
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,869
Tell her now. What are you waiting for?

516
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:40,409
- I apologize. - How dare you!

517
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,880
Move aside!

518
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:48,618
Leave now, or I may have to hurt you.

519
00:40:48,619 --> 00:40:50,690
Such insolence.

520
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:53,659
Step aside at once!

521
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,138
Your Highness!

522
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:08,070
I must speak with you urgently.

523
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:11,369
Please spare me a moment!

524
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:13,940
Your Highness!

525
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:17,250
Please leave.

526
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:21,079
Your Highness!

527
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,690
Commander of the Royal Guards. You must not let anyone in...

528
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,119
until I give you permission to do so.

529
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:27,690
Do you understand?

530
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,130
Yes, Your Highness.

531
00:41:58,849 --> 00:41:59,860
My wife.

532
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:03,260
We will soon be summoned to the palace,

533
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,929
and I cannot guarantee when I will be able...

534
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:09,969
to visit your grave again.

535
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:14,039
Please...

536
00:42:15,469 --> 00:42:17,139
watch over our Gun.

537
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:23,949
When I die sometime in the future,

538
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:27,650
have me buried beside your mother.

539
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:35,760
Gun.

540
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,530
Yes, Father.

541
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:41,558
The palace is like a forest that harbours blades.

542
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:44,368
(Dosangeumsu: A situation of grave danger)

543
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:45,400
I am aware of it.

544
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,039
No, you are not.

545
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:52,469
Once I become King...

546
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,409
and you become Crown Prince,

547
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:59,719
many who covet authority and power...

548
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,980
will flock to you like flies.

549
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:06,659
With words that cut sharper than blades,

550
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,019
they will try to cloud your judgement.

551
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,360
Some will mask them as loyalty,

552
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:16,299
and some will deceive you with lies about others.

553
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,869
(Chameon: Speaking ill of others through lies)

554
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,309
No matter what happens in the future,

555
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:28,579
can you promise me...

556
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:31,949
that you will protect your stepmother and brother...

557
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,820
without wavering to such forces?

558
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,989
Do not worry, Father.

559
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,599
Your son...

560
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,929
will protect my mother and little brother.

561
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:56,210
Place your trust in me.

562
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:09,719
Your Royal Highness,

563
00:44:11,619 --> 00:44:14,389
Sang Soo and I will confess that it was our doing.

564
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:17,789
We urge you to feign ignorance.

565
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,599
He is right.

566
00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:22,460
We will confess that you are innocent...

567
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:26,039
and that we are to blame for everything.

568
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,909
Your loyalty is laudable,

569
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:35,179
but it is my head they want on a stick.

570
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,619
It will be futile.

571
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,880
However...

572
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:47,659
I must speak to the Queen Dowager.

573
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:50,130
Send word to her quarters.

574
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:56,329
The Queen Dowager enters.

575
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,119
You are to raise your heads.

576
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:29,659
- We bow to the Queen Dowager. - We bow to the Queen Dowager.

577
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,289
The tragedy that found His Majesty...

578
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:01,889
has led this nation to the brink of disaster.

579
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:06,260
Those involved in this incident will not be forgiven,

580
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:08,000
and all sinners must be interrogated...

581
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:11,170
in order to find everyone...

582
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,199
that was involved.

583
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:16,968
For that purpose, you will install a temporary interrogation office.

584
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:19,679
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

585
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:26,679
Your Majesty,

586
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:29,079
to officially interrogate the sinners,

587
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:33,219
all three judicial offices must be present as it is the law.

588
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:34,819
However, the Inspector General position...

589
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,059
remains vacant.

590
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:39,030
I advise that you first appoint someone...

591
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:41,399
to fill in that position.

592
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,030
(Daesaheon: Head of Office of Inspector General)

593
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,230
You are...

594
00:47:44,231 --> 00:47:47,839
to recommend anyone you seem fit.

595
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,908
(Cheongeo: Recommend or introduce)

596
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:53,139
I, Magistrate Yoon Jung Dae of Hanseong Magistracy,

597
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,179
humbly voice my opinion.

598
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:56,948
Royal Physician Choi Sang Rok...

599
00:47:56,949 --> 00:47:59,619
seems to be the best candidate to take on the position.

600
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:03,250
Choi Sang Rok may only be a physician,

601
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:05,249
but he is of a prestigious family...

602
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,988
that once saw an elected minister.

603
00:48:06,989 --> 00:48:09,219
He passed the lower civil service examination,

604
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:10,928
and even though he greatly contributed...

605
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,460
in the restoration of this government,

606
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,730
he never once sought power since then...

607
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:17,670
which speaks to the righteousness of his character.

608
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:20,070
He sets an example to all officials,

609
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:22,368
and no one is more adequate...

610
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:24,039
to take on the role as Inspector General.

611
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:26,638
I strongly request that you consider my recommendation.

612
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:27,739
(Ganab: Gladly welcoming someone's request or advice)

613
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,510
Are there any other recommendations?

614
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:51,630
Magistrate Yoon's recommendation is nothing but logical.

615
00:48:51,969 --> 00:48:53,940
Please consider his recommendation.

616
00:48:54,269 --> 00:48:57,409
- Consider his recommendation. - Consider his recommendation.

617
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,409
Choi Sang Rok, step forward.

618
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:13,860
I hereby appoint...

619
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,989
Choi Sang Rok...

620
00:49:17,429 --> 00:49:18,459
as Inspector General.

621
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,129
(Jesu: Appointing personnel by word of the king)

622
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:23,130
- I am much obliged. - We are much obliged.

623
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,828
In Left State Councillor Yoon's place,

624
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:25,968
Choi Sang Rok will also be appointed...

625
00:49:25,969 --> 00:49:27,099
as principal director of the Royal House Administration.

626
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,099
And until the deceased Chief Royal Secretary is replaced,

627
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:32,139
he will also serve in that position as well.

628
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:33,909
Consider yourselves informed.

629
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:42,849
We are much obliged.

630
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:46,250
- We are much obliged. - We are much obliged.

631
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:57,799
(Kim Dae Seung: Censor, Lee Guk Ju: Deputy Education Director)

632
00:49:57,800 --> 00:49:59,300
A word, please.

633
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:03,909
She and her people will rise to power now.

634
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:05,808
You do not want to get on their bad side.

635
00:50:05,809 --> 00:50:08,908
Are you telling me to curry favour with them instead?

636
00:50:08,909 --> 00:50:10,250
Hardly.

637
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:13,579
They say one should know their place in certain situations.

638
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,849
Be patient, and the moment will come.

639
00:50:19,789 --> 00:50:21,218
Is it not the king's father-in-law...

640
00:50:21,219 --> 00:50:22,359
who is appointed as principal director...

641
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,488
of the Royal House Administration?

642
00:50:23,489 --> 00:50:24,859
(Gukgu: The king's father-in-law)

643
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:27,030
Left State Councillor Yoon will not give up his seat so easily.

644
00:50:27,699 --> 00:50:29,730
- Did you not hear the rumour? - Hear what?

645
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:31,928
Royal Physician Choi, I mean Inspector General...

646
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:32,969
Strike that.

647
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,469
The now Principal Director Choi.

648
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,308
His daughter...

649
00:50:37,309 --> 00:50:39,138
will soon be Crown Princess.

650
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:41,539
Prince Dosung is yet to be Crown Prince,

651
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:43,949
but they have already chosen his wife.

652
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,010
Once the interrogations are over,

653
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:48,949
they will rush his coronation.

654
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,219
That seems highly likely.

655
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,190
Appointing him as Inspector General and Chief Royal Secretary...

656
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:00,260
is a way to keep us in check,

657
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,158
but him as Principal Director of the Royal House Administration...

658
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,730
came out of nowhere.

659
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:08,670
He must be in that position...

660
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,808
for them to meet as they please...

661
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:12,539
without people raising their eyebrows...

662
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,539
as they are right now.

663
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:32,190
You did well.

664
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,900
I am proud of you.

665
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:40,739
When the interrogations begin,

666
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,469
how will you handle the Crown Prince?

667
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,269
You do not seem your healthy self.

668
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:17,609
- That is why... - Once Prince Dosung...

669
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:19,210
is installed as Crown Prince,

670
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:20,679
Left State Councillor Yoon...

671
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:23,280
will first murder my father.

672
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:25,309
After him,

673
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:30,119
it will be you and Choi Sang Rok.

674
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:34,489
Are you voicing...

675
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:36,859
your concern for me?

676
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:37,929
If you wish to live,

677
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:42,260
you must make sure my father lives.

678
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,469
You told Dosung...

679
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:47,539
to choose between me...

680
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,800
and his mother.

681
00:52:50,269 --> 00:52:51,368
But in your case,

682
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:52,710
you do not get the luxury of choosing.

683
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:57,050
To stay alive, you must continue to act as regent.

684
00:52:57,309 --> 00:52:58,779
And to remain as regent...

685
00:52:58,780 --> 00:52:59,848
(Suryeomcheomjeong: Acting as regent for a tender-aged sovereign)

686
00:52:59,849 --> 00:53:01,519
You must protect my father.

687
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,889
I will excuse myself knowing that you are informed.

688
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:21,239
Lastly,

689
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,969
may I ask one thing?

690
00:53:27,139 --> 00:53:30,610
All the moments you spent with me.

691
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:36,989
Were they all a show...

692
00:53:38,190 --> 00:53:39,320
and full of lies?

693
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:45,730
If any of it came from the heart,

694
00:53:47,059 --> 00:53:48,400
please spare the lives...

695
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:51,369
of Guard Lee Gap Seok and Eunuch Han Sang Soo.

696
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,039
That is my last request.

697
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,789
Let go of me.

698
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,389
Let go!

699
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:14,860
Mother!

700
00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:16,889
Mother!

701
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:19,630
Mother, please save me.

702
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:22,329
- No! - Mother!

703
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,369
Let go of me. My son!

704
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:26,598
- Mother! - You cannot do this.

705
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:27,940
- Mother! - No!

706
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:29,739
Please help me.

707
00:54:30,469 --> 00:54:32,670
Prince Gwangchang, no!

708
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:35,078
No, you cannot.

709
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:36,980
Not my Prince Gwangchang.

710
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:39,679
Please let him live.

711
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:42,980
Crown Prince Gun.

712
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:46,050
Crown Prince Gun.

713
00:54:47,719 --> 00:54:48,719
Please let me go.

714
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:53,699
Can you please...

715
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:57,070
Can you please spare his life?

716
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,500
It is like losing Prince Gwangchang all over again,

717
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:04,309
and I cannot bear the pain.

718
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:06,510
At least let him live...

719
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:17,090
I am sorry.

720
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:19,519
I am sorry,

721
00:55:20,889 --> 00:55:21,889
Soo Ryeon.

722
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:50,319
Bring the prisoners forward.

723
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,320
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

724
00:56:28,119 --> 00:56:30,289
Prepare for their interrogation.

725
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:31,889
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

726
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,750
Please get back on your feet...

727
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,718
and punish your foolish wife.

728
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:00,788
(Shincheob: A humble way for a woman to refer to herself to the king)

729
00:57:00,789 --> 00:57:02,460
Please save the Crown Prince's life.

730
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:17,610
You attempted murder by poisoning His Majesty.

731
00:57:18,539 --> 00:57:19,909
Do you admit to this crime?

732
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:25,909
When Father collapsed,

733
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,579
I was outside the palace walls.

734
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:34,019
Eunuch Han Sang Soo of the Crown Prince's quarters...

735
00:57:35,159 --> 00:57:36,690
confessed that you ordered him...

736
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:39,058
to deliver dried yellow corvina laced with poison...

737
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:40,730
to the Queen's Palace.

738
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:42,659
And Han Sang Soo delivered the corvina...

739
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:45,699
to Court Lady Cho of the Queen's Palace.

740
00:57:46,269 --> 00:57:47,840
We confirmed that...

741
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:51,239
by confronting both Han Sang Soo and Court Lady Cho.

742
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,340
The statements collected in advance...

743
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:57,949
have their words written in detail.

744
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,519
Also, the Queen stated...

745
00:58:02,019 --> 00:58:04,219
that the corvina was sent...

746
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,420
by you.

747
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:10,159
Is this true?

748
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:11,530
It is.

749
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:13,559
I confirmed it...

750
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,559
by asking the Queen myself.

751
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
It is not true.

752
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:19,670
He is being framed!

753
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:21,499
I swear to the skies...

754
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,670
that the Crown Prince has no knowledge of this.

755
00:58:24,269 --> 00:58:25,610
He is being framed!

756
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:28,280
Once His Majesty's health is restored,

757
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:30,779
he will not forgive those...

758
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:34,050
who participated in and sanctioned this line of questioning.

759
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:35,650
Do not just stand there.

760
00:58:35,949 --> 00:58:39,519
Shut his mouth this instant!

761
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:40,760
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

762
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:45,030
Your Royal Highness!

763
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,030
Your Royal Highness!

764
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,869
Your Royal Highness...

765
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:52,599
Your Royal Highness...

766
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,989
Do you agree...

767
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:17,059
with his statement?

768
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,909
Will you claim that the Queen lied to the officials?

769
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:32,110
Or...

770
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,349
will you admit to the poisoning of His Majesty?

771
00:59:59,969 --> 01:00:01,699
You have my word...

772
01:00:03,769 --> 01:00:05,139
that I will keep His Majesty safe.

773
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,079
Answer the question.

774
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:14,650
Were you framed...

775
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:16,449
or not?

776
01:00:55,389 --> 01:00:56,389
Your Majesty.

777
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,289
Have you come to?

778
01:00:58,889 --> 01:00:59,889
Your Majesty?

779
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,030
Your Majesty...

780
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:06,570
I...

781
01:01:43,739 --> 01:01:45,510
(Missing Crown Prince)

782
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:47,980
Lee Gun who is guilty of high treason...

783
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:49,340
will be deposed.

784
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,308
The Crown Prince escaped of his own accord,

785
01:01:51,309 --> 01:01:52,979
which makes him guilty of high treason.

786
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,549
Have they still not been able to find him?

787
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:56,079
He will be caught in the end.

788
01:01:56,349 --> 01:01:57,618
What do you mean the royal seal is missing?

789
01:01:57,619 --> 01:01:58,848
The chest containing the royal seal...

790
01:01:58,849 --> 01:02:00,218
and national seal disappeared?

791
01:02:00,219 --> 01:02:03,319
Were my brother and your daughter arranged to be married?

792
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,288
If you want Myung Yoon to yourself,

793
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:06,789
proclaim the position as Crown Prince.

794
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:07,999
That is him. Get him!

795
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,860
I will return, Father.

796
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,929
Please wait until I do.
