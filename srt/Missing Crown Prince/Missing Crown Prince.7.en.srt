(Episode 7)

13
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:54,890
Calm down.

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,069
My lady!

15
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,349
You are Baek Gu.

16
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,989
The lady you serve is...

17
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:28,629
So, are you...

18
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:31,400
Royal Physician Choi's servant?

19
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:37,400
Answer my question.

20
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,370
Do you work for Royal Physician Choi's family?

21
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:48,980
Is she your maid?

22
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,230
My lady!

23
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:03,129
My lady!

24
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,770
Her pulse is normal.

25
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,240
I think she was just too surprised...

26
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,759
- My lady. - Hush.

27
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,229
Are you all right?

28
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:44,240
Yes. I did not know what to do,

29
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,240
so I acted like I fainted.

30
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,969
Well done.

31
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,680
You are shrewder than I am.

32
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,379
Anyway, what will happen now?

33
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,650
We shall wait and see.

34
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,849
They went straight to my room and kidnapped you,

35
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,120
so I am assuming he wanted to get his revenge for getting kidnapped.

36
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,759
But how did he find our place?

37
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,060
What?

38
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:10,090
If he knew where to find my family, he must have known about me too.

39
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:12,960
Then why did he ask me if I was the royal physician's servant?

40
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:14,900
Do you not find it strange?

41
00:03:15,699 --> 00:03:17,340
That, I am not sure.

42
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,270
But I do not think he did it to get his revenge.

43
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,340
Why do you think they kidnapped me?

44
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,779
To prevent a future mishap for his daughter.

45
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,348
You told me that was what Baek Gu said.

46
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:32,949
Do you think I was not their target?

47
00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:36,389
They kidnapped a man for that reason,

48
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,489
and it happened to be me?

49
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:42,788
My gosh. Then when Choi Sang Rok realized it was you,

50
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,430
I bet he nearly fainted.

51
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,628
Are you saying they kidnapped you...

52
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,169
in case Father catches them again?

53
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:52,598
Yes. I believe that man thought I was you...

54
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:54,710
and thought they could hold me hostage.

55
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:57,008
Are you sure?

56
00:03:57,009 --> 00:03:58,009
Yes.

57
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,879
But that handsome scholar said...

58
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,848
he would rather die than be a coward who would hold a woman hostage.

59
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:06,550
He told that man to let me go right away.

60
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,689
He looked so cool when he said that.

61
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,520
He looked cool?

62
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,560
We do not have time for this.

63
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,329
My lady, hurry up and get out of here.

64
00:04:20,569 --> 00:04:23,129
It would be hard for us to escape together,

65
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,970
but you can certainly sneak out alone.

66
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,509
They do not care about me. To them, you are more important.

67
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,039
Since they think you are me, we do not know what they would do to you,

68
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,579
so no. I refuse to escape alone.

69
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,920
Get out of here and let Lord Choi know about the situation.

70
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,490
Then you can come back to save me.

71
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:50,529
So, you are leaving?

72
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,268
You mean, we should just leave?

73
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:55,470
Then what?

74
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,269
Darn it.

75
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,110
I did not know you were this type of person.

76
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:08,708
I did not know you would do something like this,

77
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:09,778
kidnapping a woman.

78
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:12,250
Watch your mouth! How dare you...

79
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,459
Whatever the reason may be,

80
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,829
you cannot deny that she helped you for she wanted to save you.

81
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:22,790
So how could you do this?

82
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,698
Had she known you were like this,

83
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,959
she would have just left you to die.

84
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,429
She deeply regrets helping you.

85
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,540
Hey, that is...

86
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:41,449
I have nothing to say.

87
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:44,079
Tell her I am sorry.

88
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:46,050
Hurry up and go home with your lady.

89
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:49,290
Go inside and get our things.

90
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,490
Yes, my lord.

91
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,970
I am sorry.

92
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:04,339
All you did was follow your master's orders.

93
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,699
You did nothing wrong,

94
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,839
but I took my anger out on you.

95
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:15,410
I apologize.

96
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:23,319
Because of me,

97
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,360
you experienced all sorts of hardships,

98
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,629
and because of my father,

99
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,560
you are being chased. For that, I truly apologize.

100
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:41,170
That was the message she wanted me to relay to you.

101
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
I see.

102
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,860
Let us get going.

103
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:01,490
Do you have a place to go?

104
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,959
Baek Gu, you are the only one who is worried about me.

105
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,269
Do you know how you will pass through the fortress gates?

106
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,500
I will find a way.

107
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,069
Wait.

108
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,509
I have an idea that may help you...

109
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,009
pass through the fortress gates without getting caught.

110
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,420
Would you hear me out?

111
00:07:38,899 --> 00:07:40,600
Your daughter clearly told me...

112
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,500
that she was engaged.

113
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,670
It is true that she is engaged.

114
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,138
However, my daughter, Myung Yoon,

115
00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:49,139
is not engaged to the deposed Crown Prince.

116
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:52,240
She will become the Crown Princess.

117
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:55,279
Why were you born...

118
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:59,319
as the daughter of Royal Physician Choi, of all people?

119
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:02,990
What about you, Your Highness?

120
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:05,589
Why were you born as His Majesty's son?

121
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:28,649
If you want Myung Yoon to yourself,

122
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,480
proclaim the position as Crown Prince.

123
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,889
My lord.

124
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,960
What brings you here?

125
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,929
Earlier today,

126
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:51,870
the assistant police chiefs lost the Crown Prince...

127
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:54,509
near the Yeonhwabang around the Jongmyo Shrine.

128
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,039
They believe...

129
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,679
he is likely hiding in or around that area.

130
00:09:00,309 --> 00:09:01,480
What should we do?

131
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,949
If the deposed Crown Prince gets caught...

132
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,080
and reveals things about us, we will have a big problem,

133
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:10,149
so I told them to search the Changseonbang area in the south.

134
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,620
But if...

135
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,529
the Left State Councilor finds out later, we will have problems.

136
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,500
Tell them to search the Yeonhwabang area.

137
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:22,669
Pardon me?

138
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,039
Do you think Gun will let us get away unscathed if he returns?

139
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,200
I got him out of the prison,

140
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,110
so I have done my duty.

141
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:32,409
My brother and I...

142
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:35,450
No.

143
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,120
The deposed Crown Prince and I...

144
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,389
are enemies now.

145
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,850
We cannot keep them locked up forever,

146
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:21,288
so tell Prince Dosung that we must find the Crown Prince soon.

147
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:23,289
Prince Dosung is already trying to track him down.

148
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,970
Is this the last house?

149
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,129
Yes, Your Highness.

150
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:01,730
You lost him yet again?

151
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,759
I was concerned it would cause unrest among the people,

152
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:09,769
so I told them not to tell their men it was the deposed Crown Prince...

153
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:11,299
and to keep the search discreet,

154
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:14,070
so they have hit a dead end in their search.

155
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:18,080
Is that your excuse?

156
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:21,949
How could I trust you and work with you on more important things...

157
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,480
after this?

158
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,120
I apologize.

159
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:28,720
Please give me just one more chance, and I will be sure...

160
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,690
to catch the deposed Crown Prince.

161
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,220
I heard you, so please leave now.

162
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,659
Yes, Your Highness.

163
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:32,549
I do not know where I am headed...

164
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:34,990
or where I will stay.

165
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,590
But I will return as soon as the bridal selection order is lifted.

166
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,789
Once I return, I will gladly accept any punishment you give me.

167
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,830
Please stay healthy until the day we meet again.

168
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,100
From your unfilial daughter, Myung Yoon.

169
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,539
The places Myung Yoon visited in the past...

170
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:03,279
and the places she might visit.

171
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,850
Search them all.

172
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:08,690
Search every nook and cranny.

173
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,360
- Yes, my lord. - We must find her...

174
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,659
before the bridal selection order is issued, no matter what.

175
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:16,960
Do you understand?

176
00:14:18,259 --> 00:14:19,259
Yes, my lord.

177
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:39,320
What do you have there? Dead bodies or patients?

178
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,220
They are patients, sir.

179
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,559
I suggest you keep your distance.

180
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:54,330
They have the plague.

181
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:58,399
We call them patients, but they are practically dead.

182
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,069
We were told to transport them out of the Public Dispensary at once...

183
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:02,269
to curtail its further spread...

184
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:05,939
I think I have contracted the disease too.

185
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,340
Save me...

186
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:09,750
Pass!

187
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:31,439
- Good job. - My gosh.

188
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,899
It is not like I did it for free.

189
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,239
Oh, it is real gold.

190
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,909
See the teeth marks here?

191
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,139
Get going already.

192
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:42,110
Okay, missy.

193
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,350
Get in touch with me if you need anything else.

194
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,789
Oh, boy.

195
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,429
I cannot repay you for your help right now, but I will never forget.

196
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,769
Thank you for everything.

197
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,070
Oh, yes.

198
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:14,179
We should get going.

199
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,190
You should...

200
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,919
get going too, with your lady.

201
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:30,029
She and I...

202
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:32,399
will go with you.

203
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:34,159
- What? - What?

204
00:16:37,669 --> 00:16:38,669
There is no need.

205
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:41,470
You have helped us enough, so get going already.

206
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:43,970
We have just left the Capital,

207
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:45,878
so you should not let your guard down yet.

208
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:46,879
All right.

209
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:49,779
I will be very careful.

210
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,220
- Well... - What is it?

211
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,190
Do you have something else to say?

212
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,460
The truth is...

213
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,490
- My lady... - My lady here...

214
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,829
said we should stay together...

215
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,269
until we can ensure your safety...

216
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:11,400
since this already happened.

217
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,699
She said that?

218
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,039
Yes, that is what she wants to do.

219
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,380
Well, it is...

220
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:23,609
Thank you for your kind offer.

221
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,720
You are welcome. We will be leaving, then.

222
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,890
Whatever she does,

223
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,118
she always likes to see it through.

224
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:33,160
What are you doing?

225
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:34,430
Since she...

226
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:36,829
decided to help you,

227
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,799
she wants to accompany you to your destination...

228
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,569
and make sure you are safe.

229
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:48,269
You need not feel obligated to help me because of your father.

230
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,740
That is not why.

231
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,980
It has nothing to do with Lord Choi.

232
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:00,349
You told me that earlier. Right, my lady?

233
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,990
Even so, this is not an easy journey even for men like us.

234
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:09,088
I do not want the two of you to come with us. Hence...

235
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:11,400
Goodness. They are volunteering to help us.

236
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,999
Why turn it down?

237
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,630
Right now, we cannot afford to reject help.

238
00:18:16,099 --> 00:18:17,170
Thank you.

239
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,099
I will escort you well so that you can be comfortable, my lady.

240
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,240
Let us go.

241
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,740
Come along, Baek Gu.

242
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:27,609
Gap Seok.

243
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,250
Baek Gu!

244
00:18:32,619 --> 00:18:33,920
Well, my lady.

245
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,519
Wait, my lady.

246
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,900
They are keeping up with us just fine.

247
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:49,170
Are you that excited?

248
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:51,200
It is not that I am excited.

249
00:18:51,269 --> 00:18:53,338
We need a hostage, so I risked my life...

250
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:54,710
to kidnap her.

251
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,240
But she has decided to follow us of her own accord.

252
00:18:56,539 --> 00:18:59,009
I think the universe is helping us.

253
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,750
Why do you keep turning around?

254
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,519
I am worried. That is why.

255
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,289
They are women, so we cannot sleep outdoors with them.

256
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,089
We do not know how many days it would take to get to Mungyeong.

257
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,099
Where will we sleep tonight?

258
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:29,440
Oh Wol.

259
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,880
Are you still mad at me?

260
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,950
I am not mad at you.

261
00:19:36,579 --> 00:19:39,150
I just cannot figure out what you are thinking.

262
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,289
You said they kidnapped me because they thought I was you.

263
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:44,049
That means they planned to kidnap you.

264
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:47,220
So why would you go out of your way to help them like this?

265
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,829
As I mentioned before, this all started because of me.

266
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,470
The kidnapping would have never happened had I had a different fate.

267
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:59,769
And without the kidnapping, he would not be in this situation now.

268
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,839
Oh Wol.

269
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,069
I am sorry for putting you through all this,

270
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:07,609
but could you be patient and hang in there, for my sake?

271
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:12,119
As you know, we cannot return home right away,

272
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:15,490
so let us think of this as a little trip.

273
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:18,859
The two of us can go on a trip without them.

274
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,630
Oh, right. I forgot about something very important.

275
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,858
The scholar's wound.

276
00:20:24,859 --> 00:20:27,399
It is way more difficult to treat a wound that has festered.

277
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,699
You know that.

278
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,298
So, just until the wound heals up...

279
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:32,440
Okay, that is enough. I heard you.

280
00:20:32,869 --> 00:20:34,769
The more you talk...

281
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:36,740
The more I talk... What?

282
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,210
The more suspicious you look.

283
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:40,410
"Suspicious?" Who?

284
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,278
Me?

285
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,279
Yes.

286
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:46,749
Listen carefully.

287
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,049
- The reason why... - Goodness, okay.

288
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,759
I understand, so that is enough.

289
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:54,289
Let us go.

290
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:55,759
They are waiting for us.

291
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:01,930
Yes, let us go.

292
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,529
Gosh.

293
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:07,369
Moo Baek will kill me.

294
00:21:17,349 --> 00:21:19,579
Move. Hey, move.

295
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:22,789
Why, you little...

296
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:30,359
You piece of...

297
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,160
Hey, seriously.

298
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:41,240
Look, I... I surrender.

299
00:21:41,609 --> 00:21:43,539
I will tell you everything, so please stop hitting me.

300
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:46,309
I helped them and two men...

301
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:49,109
pass through the gates.

302
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,309
- Men? - Yes, that is right.

303
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:56,619
Was one of them this man?

304
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,059
Yes, I think so.

305
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:05,529
If this turns out to be a lie,

306
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:07,799
I will cut your head off.

307
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,230
What did you say?

308
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:14,069
Myung Yoon is with the deposed Crown Prince now?

309
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,869
- Yes, my lord. - What?

310
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,240
What is happening?

311
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,279
Do not tell me...

312
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,579
Do you think Myung Yoon ran away from home...

313
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,720
to meet him?

314
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:30,650
Find them.

315
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,690
Find them at all costs. Do you understand?

316
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,660
- Yes, my lord. - If Myung Yoon...

317
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,059
is seen with the deposed Crown Prince,

318
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,769
everything will go down the drain.

319
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,740
Find them no matter what!

320
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,670
Do you understand?

321
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:07,819
My gosh.

322
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,089
We will sleep here?

323
00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:11,529
Yes.

324
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,160
We will freeze to death...

325
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,400
We will go and gather some firewood.

326
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,069
- Come along. - Yes, my lord.

327
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:37,019
You need not follow us if this is too much for you.

328
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,960
Persuade your lady and head back.

329
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,588
Are we a nuisance to you...

330
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,759
now that you have managed to pass through the gates?

331
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,529
It is not that.

332
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:52,199
This is difficult for her, so...

333
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,670
I will take good care of her, so do not worry.

334
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,440
This must be hard for you too.

335
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:00,710
Will you be all right?

336
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,250
Yes.

337
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,210
Is he getting better?

338
00:24:33,609 --> 00:24:35,509
I am asking you if his condition is improving.

339
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:37,809
- Please take our lives. - Please take our lives.

340
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:42,420
You are all dismissed.

341
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,500
Court Lady Cho, are you outside?

342
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:56,329
Yes, Your Highness.

343
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:06,039
I was a fool for putting my trust in them and waiting.

344
00:25:06,579 --> 00:25:07,740
Who are they, after all?

345
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,309
They all belong to the Royal Infirmary.

346
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,618
I am sure they are all connected to Choi Sang Rok...

347
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:13,980
one way or another.

348
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:16,150
I apologize, Your Highness.

349
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,519
I must send you out on an errand.

350
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,019
My lord.

351
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:52,920
Someone is here from the palace.

352
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,059
Mother sent you?

353
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,970
Yes, Your Highness.

354
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,429
She is looking for a physician...

355
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,200
who is not affiliated with Choi Sang Rok.

356
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,359
Who is that man behind you?

357
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,099
Seeing what he is wearing, he does not work in the palace.

358
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,569
Who gave you permission to let him in?

359
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,609
It is none of your business,

360
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:47,410
so please step aside.

361
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,608
What if I refuse?

362
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:51,680
Focus on looking after the Queen Dowager's Palace.

363
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,250
I handle all matters at the Queen's Palace.

364
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,720
If this was the Queen's Palace,

365
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:00,059
I would turn a blind eye to this.

366
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,258
However, this is the Main Palace.

367
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:06,500
Her Highness the Queen is the one in charge of the Main Palace now.

368
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:11,430
Also, the head of the Internal Court is not the Queen Dowager.

369
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,640
It is Her Highness the Queen.

370
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:59,279
Your Majesty, are you not feeling well?

371
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:09,289
Your Majesty.

372
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:11,029
You may hold it.

373
00:28:23,069 --> 00:28:25,009
Dosung is moving out too.

374
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,480
I got you this cat so that you would not feel lonely.

375
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:35,420
Keep her company and play with her so that she will not be lonely.

376
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,288
This is a royal order.

377
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:39,319
Meow if you understood what I said.

378
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:48,259
My wife cries so easily. What should I do?

379
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,269
Do not cry, meow.

380
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:03,450
Your Highness, Her Majesty the Queen Dowager is here.

381
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:08,319
The Left State Councilor and the Inspector General are here too.

382
00:29:15,019 --> 00:29:16,089
They may enter.

383
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,730
Who is that man?

384
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,868
How dare he touch His Majesty?

385
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:01,099
I called him here.

386
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:04,609
He is a physician. I called him to the palace.

387
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,980
Your Highness.

388
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:08,910
You cannot do this.

389
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,079
Head Eunuch! What are you waiting for?

390
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:15,490
Drag him out at once!

391
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,059
Father.

392
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,690
Father!

393
00:30:25,329 --> 00:30:26,730
You made a reckless decision.

394
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,098
We do not even know his background or credentials.

395
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:31,470
How could you let him enter His Majesty's bedchamber?

396
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:33,440
I understand that you are the Queen,

397
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:35,739
but what you did is simply unacceptable.

398
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,910
Then what was I supposed to do?

399
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:39,439
None of the so-called skilled physicians...

400
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,339
from the Royal Infirmary could cure him.

401
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:45,109
How much longer do you expect me to just trust them and wait?

402
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,789
Your Highness, His Majesty is here.

403
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:51,018
Please lower your voice.

404
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:52,019
Queen.

405
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:54,160
The Left State Councilor is right.

406
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:57,129
There are rules to be followed.

407
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,259
You cannot ignore the rules and let an outsider enter the palace.

408
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:02,068
If you cannot trust the physicians in the Royal Infirmary...

409
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,430
That is correct. I do not trust them.

410
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,269
How could I trust them?

411
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:10,210
Whose fault is it that His Majesty is in this state now?

412
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,079
Your Highness.

413
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,880
What do you mean?

414
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:17,549
Is that really a question?

415
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,150
You must know well as you are on their side, Father.

416
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,220
So why are you feigning innocence?

417
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:30,630
Why not take a look at His Majesty?

418
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:34,099
You examining him is better than the physicians doing it, no?

419
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,430
Understood.

420
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:47,439
Is the commander out there?

421
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,579
Yes, Your Highness!

422
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:53,779
If he lays...

423
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:56,549
a finger on His Majesty to cause harm to him,

424
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:59,318
kill him at once!

425
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,319
Understood!

426
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,329
Why are you going this far, Your Highness?

427
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,640
His Majesty's pulse is slow.

428
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,779
However, there is no need to be concerned.

429
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,980
Please do not worry too much.

430
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:02,089
It seems the Queen has something to tell me.

431
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:04,119
Give us some privacy.

432
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,779
Do you...

433
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:31,179
hate me that much?

434
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,980
Yes, I do, to the point there is no end to my hatred.

435
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,690
Every night, I dreamt of storming...

436
00:33:36,789 --> 00:33:39,519
into your chamber and killing you.

437
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,990
But that was all I could do.

438
00:33:42,529 --> 00:33:44,829
I do not know how to shed crocodile tears.

439
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,759
I do not know how to insist fornication is love.

440
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,399
I have never imagined...

441
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,740
harming or killing the innocent to fulfill my greed.

442
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,808
Scared and frightened of facing you,

443
00:33:56,809 --> 00:33:58,269
I avoided and hid from you.

444
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,809
But the moment I saw you,

445
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,210
I got angry rather than scared.

446
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,779
I was filled with so much rage that I could not breathe.

447
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:10,719
Queen.

448
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,960
- What must I say... - Do not say a word.

449
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,059
I, a human being,

450
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:18,429
will do the talking.

451
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,929
That is right.

452
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,929
You are far from a human being to me.

453
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,570
You brought down...

454
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,639
the divine King using me, his wife.

455
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,780
You set up and dismissed the kindhearted Crown Prince.

456
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:37,150
A human being could not have done any of those.

457
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,019
Only a beast could do those!

458
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,989
- Queen. - Do not look at me with such eyes.

459
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,559
Never will I be fooled again.

460
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,929
Do not set foot toward His Majesty's chamber again.

461
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,360
Do not go near my dear Prince Dosung, either.

462
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:56,769
And stop going after the Crown Prince.

463
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,369
If you try to harm my family again,

464
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:07,280
I will never forgive you.

465
00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:11,409
Let us...

466
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,280
talk again...

467
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:16,489
once you have calmed down.

468
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,690
No matter...

469
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:27,300
how weak I am,

470
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,900
keep in mind that I am the Queen of this kingdom!

471
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,780
Your Highness!

472
00:35:44,849 --> 00:35:47,579
- Your Highness! - Get the physician at once. Hurry.

473
00:35:51,219 --> 00:35:52,789
What are you saying?

474
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:55,090
"Postpone the Crown Prince proclamation?"

475
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:57,759
The royal seal and the national seal are nowhere to be found.

476
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,859
Without the national seal,

477
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,658
how are we to send the Crown Prince proclamation letter?

478
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:04,300
I told you I would take care of that matter!

479
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:09,570
The Queen is being stubborn.

480
00:36:09,909 --> 00:36:11,070
So how will you do it?

481
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:36,130
Did you sleep well?

482
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,969
And you? Did you get some good sleep?

483
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,039
I did. Where is your lady?

484
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:45,069
She tossed and turned throughout the night.

485
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,380
So she is still asleep.

486
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:51,110
My gosh.

487
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:33,619
All right.

488
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:35,630
Here I go.

489
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,809
What do you think you are doing?

490
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:01,079
Is it not obvious?

491
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:04,320
Stop it at once.

492
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,089
What was that for?

493
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,090
You are still a patient, my lord.

494
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:14,030
What if your wound gets infected?

495
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,530
Wait...

496
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:24,409
Look at this. Are you a fool?

497
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:27,239
Even so, do not call me a fool.

498
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,909
Then are you stupid?

499
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,980
Good grief.

500
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,079
This will not do.

501
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:36,449
We need some cotton cloth from the market.

502
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:38,920
Come with me. Goodness.

503
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,249
(If you spot them, report to the government office.)

504
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,480
It is dangerous as we are.

505
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,599
What do you think?

506
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,969
Without looking closely,

507
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,670
it is hard to tell who I am, yes?

508
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:30,409
Give me a moment.

509
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:43,920
As a servant,

510
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,988
you look too pale and elegant.

511
00:39:46,989 --> 00:39:49,059
We should cover it up.

512
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:51,260
Goodness.

513
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,300
Well, it is true that I am good-looking.

514
00:39:55,699 --> 00:39:57,630
You have a sharp eye, Baek Gu.

515
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,969
Sure.

516
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:19,760
What is it?

517
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:21,960
At a closer look,

518
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:25,360
do I look more handsome?

519
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,169
Stay still. I only said those...

520
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:32,969
because you were pale from staying indoors every day.

521
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:57,659
See?

522
00:40:58,159 --> 00:40:59,960
I told you to stay still.

523
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:08,070
Give it to me.

524
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:10,809
Will you apply it yourself?

525
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,090
Stop it.

526
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:31,460
You are a beauty despite being a servant.

527
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,659
It must be covered.

528
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,699
Gosh.

529
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,170
You outright flirted with her by calling her pretty.

530
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,039
She looks completely different dolled up in that dress.

531
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:17,210
Yes, she is a pretty one.

532
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,010
Young Master?

533
00:42:22,949 --> 00:42:24,980
Yes? What is it?

534
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,820
All right.

535
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,550
Now that we have switched attires,

536
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,949
from now on,

537
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,118
Baek Gu and I will present ourselves as a married couple.

538
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,119
Why you...

539
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:41,159
A married couple does not seem to work.

540
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,800
- You do not look the part. - Pardon?

541
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,269
Rather than a married couple...

542
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:48,469
Yes, you will be siblings.

543
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:49,840
That suits you two better.

544
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:52,469
That is even more bizarre.

545
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,409
They hardly look alike.

546
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:58,479
- Tell me about it. - Stop that.

547
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,319
I urge you to discard that bigoted notion...

548
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,949
regarding how siblings should look alike.

549
00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:05,250
One can take after the father,

550
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,719
while one takes after the mother.

551
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,788
Still, playing a married couple seems more believable...

552
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,429
than saying they are siblings.

553
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,538
Then, let us say he looks that way...

554
00:43:19,539 --> 00:43:21,399
because of a bad batch of medicine he took.

555
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,308
What about my face do you see as ugly...

556
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,340
Quiet.

557
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,210
Siblings, it is. Okay?

558
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:30,079
All right. Off we go.

559
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:34,119
We have a long way to go.

560
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,400
What nice scenery we have.

561
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:55,869
Let us rest for a while.

562
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:58,940
How can you be in awe with the scenery given your situation?

563
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,750
We should keep our peace of mind at times like this.

564
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,090
Gosh, that is hot.

565
00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:20,059
The smoke is coming my way.

566
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:21,900
I need to start a fire for us.

567
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:24,000
Do better, then.

568
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,110
Now I am light-headed.

569
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,670
Gun, hurry!

570
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,210
Hurry on over here.

571
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:10,809
Go to him.

572
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:16,150
That brat.

573
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:18,789
Over here.

574
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:21,159
Hold on.

575
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,829
You will trip at that rate.

576
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:26,960
Gun and Young.

577
00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:29,230
Watch your steps and do not get hurt.

578
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,199
Yes, Mother. Do not worry.

579
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:35,739
Does it hurt?

580
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:37,170
Keep going.

581
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,619
You pushed me. Stop right there.

582
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:49,019
Play somewhere else.

583
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:51,420
You will scare all the fish away.

584
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:53,260
Just wait until I catch you.

585
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,460
You brats.

586
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:59,860
Just wait until I catch you!

587
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:01,829
Come here.

588
00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:03,869
Pull!

589
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,340
Here you go.

590
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:13,440
All right.

591
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:14,980
Take that!

592
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,289
Come on.

593
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:34,030
Put that down and come with me.

594
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:36,969
All right. Shall we?

595
00:46:39,469 --> 00:46:40,739
Not so fast!

596
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:42,940
We will not stop!

597
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,260
I...

598
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:04,590
I will...

599
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:08,159
make things right again.

600
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:43,670
- Gosh, I am dizzy. - Goodness.

601
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:45,300
Why are you by yourself?

602
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,340
You left to bring Young Master back.

603
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:48,570
I did not.

604
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,909
There he is.

605
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:02,119
Gosh, it is cold. I might freeze to death.

606
00:48:04,219 --> 00:48:06,389
It must have been cold out there...

607
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:07,920
seeing how you were in tears.

608
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:15,559
When I am cold, I shed tears and get a runny nose.

609
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:21,339
That never happened.

610
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,340
When...

611
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:24,440
By the way,

612
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:28,309
should you not have a name that we can call you by?

613
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:29,809
- A name? - That is right.

614
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,610
Since you are dressed as a servant, you should have a different name.

615
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:35,949
We cannot call you "Young Master" in front of others.

616
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:38,150
You have a point.

617
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,960
A name?

618
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:46,960
"Hwang" to suit your yellow skin complexion.

619
00:48:47,329 --> 00:48:48,329
Hwang?

620
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:50,900
And since your face is round like the moon,

621
00:48:51,329 --> 00:48:52,670
I suggest "Gu" that means sphere.

622
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:56,099
What do you say to Hwang Gu?

623
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:59,980
- Hey! - Such insolence, Hwang Gu.

624
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:02,210
Someone might hear you.

625
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,619
Sure thing, my lady.

626
00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:11,119
Unbelievable.

627
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,090
- Gosh. - Hold on.

628
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,070
How about we spend the night over there today?

629
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:53,900
Well,

630
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:57,800
this seems like a hut used by herb gatherers or hunters.

631
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,440
We already slept inside a cave,

632
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:03,269
so this is not too bad.

633
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:27,329
Stop pushing me.

634
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:29,329
We are too close as is.

635
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,599
She has seen everything that needs to be seen,

636
00:50:33,139 --> 00:50:35,099
so why are you acting all shy?

637
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,210
While treating my wounds,

638
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,650
she got a glimpse of my chest.

639
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,679
I see.

640
00:50:49,219 --> 00:50:51,888
She has already seen your naked chest,

641
00:50:51,889 --> 00:50:55,888
so having your buttocks touch is not a big deal.

642
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:57,429
We can hear you.

643
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:01,259
Even if you hear servants mumbling,

644
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,900
one should feign ignorance...

645
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:05,730
as the master and...

646
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:09,869
I did not mean any of that.

647
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:11,840
Of course!

648
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:25,289
The rice cakes...

649
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:28,219
are burned.

650
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:32,530
Do not just sit there.

651
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:34,159
She says the rice cakes are burned.

652
00:51:37,929 --> 00:51:38,929
(Did you see that?)

653
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:39,940
(What about it?)

654
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:41,099
(She said, "Of course!")

655
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:42,340
(Watch it!)

656
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,440
(It came out involuntarily.)

657
00:51:43,469 --> 00:51:45,239
(What the...)

658
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,849
Look at them get toasted.

659
00:52:55,179 --> 00:52:56,209
Did you find someone who can help?

660
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:58,079
Yes, he is at a village down the hill.

661
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,780
But would it not be dangerous?

662
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,019
A person's life matters more.

663
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:09,519
Oh, dear.

664
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:12,730
She is burning up all over her body. What do I do?

665
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:14,159
Excuse us.

666
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:19,400
She cannot even open her eyes anymore.

667
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,500
She should see a physician.

668
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:24,670
Get her on my back.

669
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:26,340
Let me carry her instead.

670
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:30,010
No, head down first and be on the lookout.

671
00:53:33,849 --> 00:53:34,849
(Clinic)

672
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:51,000
(Pulse Diagnosis)

673
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,780
(Pulse Diagnosis)

674
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:21,829
She only has a severe cold, so do not worry too much.

675
00:54:27,739 --> 00:54:30,610
However, she is fatigued due to the cold...

676
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,869
and too much movement could worsen her condition.

677
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,078
I recommend that she rest for a few days.

678
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:37,479
(Jeongyang: Resting the body and mind)

679
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,179
You do not seem to be from around here.

680
00:54:39,449 --> 00:54:40,820
Do you have a place to stay?

681
00:54:49,059 --> 00:54:50,059
A forgery?

682
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:57,428
Are you suggesting we forge the royal seal and the national seal?

683
00:54:57,429 --> 00:54:58,569
(Gukin: A seal bestowed upon the nation by the emperor)

684
00:54:58,570 --> 00:54:59,969
What if someone finds out?

685
00:55:00,139 --> 00:55:03,538
That is why no one should know about it.

686
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:05,239
If the truth comes out,

687
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:08,210
we will be charged with high treason.

688
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,809
This...

689
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:15,179
This is wrong, Lord Yoon.

690
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,190
Do not worry.

691
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,860
Once Prince Dosung is installed as Crown Prince,

692
00:55:23,389 --> 00:55:26,659
no one will dare to question it.

693
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,929
And should a problem present itself,

694
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:36,039
the Queen will not sit around and let it hurt us.

695
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,269
Not when it concerns her son.

696
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,340
She will have no choice but to hand over the royal seal.

697
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:49,280
If you understand my words, do not fret about what is useless...

698
00:55:49,849 --> 00:55:51,989
and focus on capturing the deposed Crown Prince.

699
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,929
Once you are installed as Crown Prince,

700
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,729
we will welcome...

701
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:03,059
Choi Sang Rok's daughter as Crown Princess.

702
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,570
And I told you that I would not fill the position...

703
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:08,139
while Father still fights for his life.

704
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,440
Enough with the childish tantrums.

705
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:14,739
Have you forgotten how His Majesty ascended the throne?

706
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:17,009
The Queen Dowager and Choi Sang Rok...

707
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:19,110
could join forces with other members of the royal family...

708
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:21,179
and frame us in any way.

709
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:25,119
While the Queen Dowager is regent,

710
00:56:25,789 --> 00:56:28,159
your fate and the Queen's...

711
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:30,329
as well as the well-being of His Majesty...

712
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,260
lie in the hands of Choi Sang Rok. Do not forget that.

713
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:38,230
Whether you like it or not,

714
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,299
you must welcome Choi Sang Rok's daughter...

715
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,639
as Crown Princess.

716
00:57:10,599 --> 00:57:12,570
Do you not have an appetite?

717
00:57:14,739 --> 00:57:16,599
Yes, but you dig in.

718
00:57:19,210 --> 00:57:21,539
I will take a look around. There is no need to follow me.

719
00:57:36,460 --> 00:57:37,460
Wait.

720
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,300
Can you save me half of that?

721
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:43,929
Please help yourself first.

722
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,659
(Pulse Diagnosis)

723
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:05,980
Oh Wol, I want some water.

724
00:59:35,309 --> 00:59:36,309
Young Master.

725
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:44,420
Young Master?

726
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:02,039
Baek Gu.

727
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:14,179
- Get him. - Yes, my lord!

728
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:00,860
(Missing Crown Prince)

729
01:02:01,019 --> 01:02:02,489
The Crown Prince has been captured.

730
01:02:02,989 --> 01:02:05,360
My death will not bury the truth.

731
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:06,558
This is the royal seal.

732
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,400
Is this not a forgery?

733
01:02:08,699 --> 01:02:10,969
The coronation ceremony of the Crown Prince will be held.

734
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:13,229
I would rather keep following you.

735
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:15,300
Do not follow me and accompany me instead.

736
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:18,110
