(when filming with children and animals.)

12
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,030
Do you think...

13
00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:57,460
you can deceive me?

14
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,040
You woke up too early.

15
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:53,489
Sleep some more,

16
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:55,349
Your Majesty.

17
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,210
He had no choice as I was to become a widow.

18
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,478
Please take pity on my father for his clouded judgment...

19
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,310
- because of me... - "Take pity?"

20
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:58,080
Will you be able to say that even if your father had murdered someone?

21
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,599
(Episode 11)

22
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,889
Was my father the person...

23
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,919
who poisoned His Majesty?

24
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,089
I did hear the Inspector General was in his bedchambers...

25
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,229
Stop hiding the truth from me. Please just tell me.

26
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,129
Was my father the one who...

27
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,740
Was it my father...

28
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:01,379
who made His Majesty like that?

29
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,319
Yes.

30
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,050
It was your father who concocted everything.

31
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,160
My lady, where have you been?

32
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,470
I thought something might have happened to you.

33
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:23,939
Do you know how worried I was?

34
00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:27,470
My lady.

35
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,370
Are you all right?

36
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,439
Her Majesty the Queen Dowager is asking for you.

37
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,279
Please come with me.

38
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:40,220
I will escort you.

39
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:48,259
You have grown up to be a beautiful young lady.

40
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:52,660
We met once when you were little. Do you remember?

41
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:54,699
No, I am sorry.

42
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
Do not be sorry.

43
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:00,370
You were very young, and we only met briefly.

44
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,639
It is natural that you do not remember.

45
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:08,379
I will always be right by your side.

46
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:12,720
So, think of me as your mother.

47
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,189
When and if you face any difficulties,

48
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,420
come to me anytime.

49
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:23,160
I am much obliged, Your Majesty.

50
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:28,169
I will take care...

51
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,199
of all the preparations for your wedding ceremony,

52
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:34,410
so do not worry about anything. Now, go and get some rest.

53
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,579
Both the Queen and Prince Dosung...

54
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:44,680
are very kind.

55
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,949
So, do not be concerned.

56
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:49,889
Trust...

57
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,259
your father's choice.

58
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,490
Stop crying.

59
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,949
Why, when such an auspicious event is to be held...

60
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,860
Come closer.

61
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:49,149
You woke up too early.

62
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:53,149
Sleep some more,

63
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,389
Your Majesty.

64
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,069
Are you afraid of me?

65
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:16,509
I understand how you must be feeling,

66
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:20,579
but today is the last day I can treat you as my daughter,

67
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,649
so stop crying.

68
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,019
Would you please look at me?

69
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:34,259
There are...

70
00:07:35,829 --> 00:07:38,398
many reasons I am forcing you...

71
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:41,529
to marry Prince Dosung against your will,

72
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:47,069
but I cannot explain everything at the moment.

73
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,610
However, if I had not trusted in Prince Dosung and his character,

74
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,709
I would have never forced you to marry him.

75
00:07:57,449 --> 00:07:59,319
I am doing this because I truly cherish you.

76
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,790
Knowing the prince's character,

77
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,519
I am convinced that he will make you happy.

78
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:10,629
That is why this wedding must happen.

79
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,129
I will not ask you to understand me.

80
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:16,930
However,

81
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:19,970
no parent wants to see...

82
00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:23,310
their children unhappy.

83
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,779
(Injeongmun)

84
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:06,320
(Gwanghwamun)

85
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,070
Kneel.

86
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,470
Bow four times.

87
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,470
Stand up.

88
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:22,308
Receive the royal order.

89
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:26,220
(Jeongyeo: A royal command)

90
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:28,789
Kneel.

91
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,960
How come he is not here yet?

92
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,259
He will come.

93
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:42,570
He will come. I am sure of it.

94
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,700
Her Majesty said,

95
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,870
"We must reinforce the throne..."

96
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:52,210
"to strengthen the nation,"

97
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,879
"and no one is more qualified than Prince Dosung to sit on the throne."

98
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,419
"Hence, I announce that he is now officially installed..."

99
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,720
"as the Crown Prince of Joseon."

100
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:07,759
"You, Prince Dosung, Lee Young,"

101
00:13:08,529 --> 00:13:11,100
"possess many of the outstanding qualifies of the King."

102
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:15,799
"You were born blessed with many sacred abilities."

103
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,139
"You are good-natured and kind."

104
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:23,210
"You exhibited the depth of your filial piety..."

105
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,750
"and your love for your siblings from an early age."

106
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,320
"Hence, based on the rules..."

107
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:33,850
"concerning an investiture and accession,"

108
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:39,360
"you are now officially invested as the Crown Prince."

109
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,629
"Listen, the daughter of the Choi family."

110
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:47,769
"You grew up..."

111
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:51,769
"in a family of loyal vassals."

112
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:55,340
"You are a chaste lady and a woman of integrity."

113
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,090
You cannot enter.

114
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,620
Open the gate.

115
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:13,990
You cannot enter.

116
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,330
Let us all go inside!

117
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,700
- Yes! - Yes!

118
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
- Come on. - Let us go!

119
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,980
"Hence,"

120
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:35,049
"I abide by the formal procedures..."

121
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,720
"and officially invest you..."

122
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,620
"with the title of Crown Princess."

123
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,970
Once he accepts the order, it cannot be undone.

124
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,308
How come he is not here yet?

125
00:15:05,309 --> 00:15:06,679
(Jukchaekmun: Order of investiture)

126
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:55,559
Stop!

127
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,950
- What? - What is that?

128
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,920
I, the Crown Prince of this country, is alive,

129
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,519
and this is His Majesty's seal.

130
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,390
Who dared to forge a royal order...

131
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,359
and organize an investiture ceremony for a new crown prince?

132
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:48,210
What is going on?

133
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,420
My goodness.

134
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,420
- Gosh. - Oh, dear.

135
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,920
You can be relieved now.

136
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,660
Gun is back.

137
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,430
Get up.

138
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,009
- My gosh. - Oh, boy.

139
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:04,579
- What is that? - What is he doing?

140
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:06,349
Goodness.

141
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,920
- What is happening? - What is going on?

142
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,529
This is...

143
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,029
all fake!

144
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,500
Is it not?

145
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,200
Why can you not answer my question?

146
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,279
Is it truly the real royal seal?

147
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:43,150
So, they have been using a fake one until now?

148
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,990
- Then... - My goodness.

149
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,529
Who forged the royal seal?

150
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:52,859
Come to your senses, all of you!

151
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:55,269
Whether or not the royal seal is real,

152
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,730
he is not the Crown Prince.

153
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,039
He is a traitor who tried to assassinate His Majesty.

154
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:03,009
- He is a traitor! - A traitor?

155
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:05,140
He is absolutely right.

156
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:07,539
We must drag him out of here at once.

157
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,250
Guards!

158
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,078
Drag the traitor out at once...

159
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,079
Shut it!

160
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,419
- Your Highness. - Be quiet...

161
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,049
and wait to listen to His Royal Highness' words.

162
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,759
Do you understand?

163
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:21,859
Yes, Your Highness.

164
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,609
Bring in the criminal!

165
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,079
Is she not the royal taster who was said to be dead?

166
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:14,579
- What? - I heard she died.

167
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:20,750
The fact that the royal taster is not dead...

168
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,890
in and of itself is proof...

169
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,559
that His Royal Highness was framed.

170
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,328
Who lied that the royal taster was dead...

171
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:32,400
and sneaked her out of the palace?

172
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,230
Also, who was the traitor that attempted...

173
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,869
to poison His Majesty? And for what reason?

174
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,839
Why was His Royal Highness framed for the assassination attempt?

175
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,778
We must establish a temporary interrogation office...

176
00:21:44,779 --> 00:21:46,410
and find out everything.

177
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,779
He is absolutely right.

178
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:54,450
The fact that she is still alive...

179
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:56,848
serves as evidence that His Royal Highness...

180
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:59,088
had nothing to do with the attempt to poison His Majesty.

181
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:00,190
That is correct!

182
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,130
His Royal Highness was framed.

183
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,730
We ought to discuss His Royal Highness' reinstatement right away.

184
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,470
Your Majesty.

185
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,240
We do not know anything for certain yet.

186
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,470
It is too soon to discuss his reinstatement, is it not?

187
00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:18,240
First, we should interrogate her...

188
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:20,839
and find out exactly what happened.

189
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,450
Yes, I agree.

190
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:26,880
The Queen Dowager...

191
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,250
seems deeply shocked by this unexpected situation.

192
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,920
Let us all go to the assembly hall and discuss this matter.

193
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:36,058
Let us go to the assembly hall.

194
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,589
- Come along. - Let us go.

195
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:39,430
- Let us go. - I cannot believe this.

196
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,450
Gun.

197
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,259
I am truly relieved that you have returned safe and sound.

198
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,689
It must have been difficult...

199
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,700
to protect Father and Mother all by yourself.

200
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,630
Yes. What took you so long?

201
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,269
I...

202
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:22,009
desperately waited for your return.

203
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,039
I am sorry.

204
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:30,848
I should let Mother know...

205
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:33,450
that you are back.

206
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,089
Let me go and get her. Wait just a moment.

207
00:24:00,579 --> 00:24:01,680
It has been a while.

208
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,980
Have you been keeping well?

209
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,920
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

210
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,150
Please come with us.

211
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,880
Your Royal Highness, did you see?

212
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,450
Baek Gu... No, I mean,

213
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:14,420
- the physician was not a servant. - I know.

214
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,220
Pardon me?

215
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,690
When did you find out?

216
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:21,289
Crown Prince!

217
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,369
Crown Prince.

218
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:30,900
Mother.

219
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:41,410
Thank you, all great spirits. Thank you so much.

220
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,480
Thank you for helping the Crown Prince return safely.

221
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,190
Mother.

222
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,559
Are you all right?

223
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,799
Yes, thanks to your concern.

224
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:07,569
You must have...

225
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:11,839
suffered a lot because of me.

226
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,839
No, do not worry about me.

227
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:18,750
I am truly grateful that you have returned safely.

228
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,160
Mother.

229
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:32,359
Why are you both crying on this happy day?

230
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:34,970
We should laugh together instead.

231
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:51,920
How did the Left State Councillor end up siding with the Crown Prince?

232
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:54,649
There is no way he does not know that the Queen will also...

233
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:57,549
be put in a pickle if the royal taster spills the truth.

234
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,558
I bet the Crown Prince has the slave register...

235
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,259
of Yoon Yi Kyum's grandmother.

236
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,028
Other than that,

237
00:27:06,029 --> 00:27:09,230
I cannot think of a reason he would side with them.

238
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,539
How much does the royal taster know?

239
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,039
She knows everything.

240
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,990
Your Royal Highness.

241
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,059
Commander of the Royal Guards.

242
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,799
I heard you saved my father's life.

243
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:45,569
Thank you.

244
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,369
I am much obliged, Your Royal Highness.

245
00:27:54,009 --> 00:27:55,210
Let us go inside.

246
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,839
What is that thing covering Father's face?

247
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:23,539
The Inspector General made it to treat His Majesty.

248
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,480
- Choi Sang Rok? - Yes, Your Royal Highness.

249
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,779
He started using it when His Majesty was in critical condition.

250
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,079
That was when His Majesty's condition began to improve,

251
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:33,950
so we could not remove it.

252
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,750
Remove it for a moment.

253
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,089
I must see Father's face.

254
00:28:41,619 --> 00:28:43,230
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

255
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:16,460
Father.

256
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,099
Your foolish son,

257
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,400
Gun, is here.

258
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:30,640
You can...

259
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:33,740
hear my voice, right?

260
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,680
Then you ought to scold me.

261
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:43,450
"What took you so long?"

262
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,920
"Why could you not return sooner?"

263
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,029
You must scold me, Father.

264
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:02,509
It is almost over.

265
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:07,839
Please...

266
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,680
hang in there just a little longer, Father.

267
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:27,599
Reinstate the deposed Crown Prince?

268
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,329
The Queen Dowager has invested Prince Dosung...

269
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:32,298
with the Crown Prince title.

270
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:34,470
As you know, the investiture ceremony was never completed.

271
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,969
The Crown Prince whom His Majesty invested with the title himself...

272
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,480
is alive.

273
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,509
He was deposed as Crown Prince for he was convicted of high treason...

274
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,180
for attempting to poison His Majesty,

275
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,879
so why does that even matter?

276
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,990
It has already been revealed that he was framed for it.

277
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:51,789
We have not even launched an investigation yet.

278
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,419
What has been revealed?

279
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,558
You cannot cover the sky with the palm of your hand.

280
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:56,690
What did you say?

281
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,759
My lord.

282
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:05,598
That is enough.

283
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:08,910
All the talking we do here is useless.

284
00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:11,170
We should inform the Queen Dowager...

285
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:13,339
that we will start...

286
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:16,680
interrogating the royal taster at sunrise tomorrow.

287
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,579
Yes, we should do that.

288
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:22,549
Let us leave now.

289
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,359
Come to your senses.

290
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:37,170
We have deposed the Crown Prince...

291
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,799
with our own hands.

292
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,769
If the deposed Crown Prince becomes the King,

293
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,579
do you think we will survive? Do you?

294
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,809
The only way we can live...

295
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:52,349
is to make Prince Dosung the Crown Prince...

296
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,150
one way or another.

297
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,259
Do you understand?

298
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,210
If you want to discuss about Court Lady Yoon,

299
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,150
I have heard enough.

300
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,420
Do not bring it up.

301
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:33,460
Do you trust the Crown Prince that much?

302
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:36,259
I do. No matter what,

303
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,460
Gun will protect me and Mother.

304
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,170
Then what about me?

305
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:55,140
When you joined the palace with Gun,

306
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,108
was there not a promise you made with him?

307
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:01,619
Do you know why I joined the palace with the Crown Prince?

308
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,789
Last night, the Crown Prince...

309
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:08,420
came and blackmailed me with your great-great grandmother's...

310
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,259
slave register...

311
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:12,400
to find Court Lady Yoon.

312
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:14,358
How did he know about that matter?

313
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,569
The slave register nobody knew about...

314
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,900
could not have appeared out of anywhere.

315
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:21,369
The one who had the slave register...

316
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:25,039
and the report made to the Slave Administration Office...

317
00:33:25,809 --> 00:33:28,880
must have been Jang Hyun Mok.

318
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:32,009
Do you get what I mean?

319
00:33:32,849 --> 00:33:34,980
The Crown Prince you trust so much knew you and Her Highness...

320
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,119
would be put on the spot...

321
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,459
if he exposed our family had a son born...

322
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,920
from a nobleman and a servant.

323
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,789
And yet, he pulled a trick.

324
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:51,569
It must not have been Gun's intention.

325
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:56,039
He knew the matter would be buried deep quietly.

326
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:58,369
- Prince Dosung... - I trust Gun.

327
00:33:58,809 --> 00:34:00,679
Do not try to come in between...

328
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,079
me and Gun anymore.

329
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,920
I am not telling you this to make you stop trusting the Crown Prince.

330
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,789
Do you think I do not know what the Crown Prince's nature is like?

331
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:14,960
Like I am trying to get rid of the Crown Prince for your sake,

332
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,030
Jang Hyun Mok will try to do anything,

333
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,900
more than the slave register,

334
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:26,039
to get rid of you for his grandson's sake.

335
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:32,940
No matter what you say, I trust Gun.

336
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,280
Excuse me first.

337
00:34:57,099 --> 00:34:59,170
Did you catch up with Father?

338
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,139
Yes.

339
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,139
Then we should drink.

340
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:05,409
Let us stop by one more place.

341
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,679
There are more we must greet, no?

342
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,090
What are you waiting for?

343
00:35:19,091 --> 00:35:21,590
Inform the Crown Prince has come.

344
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,139
I was planning to visit you both.

345
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,679
Coincidentally, you two are together.

346
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,078
Are you refusing to show your manners now?

347
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,380
Neither did you two...

348
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:49,150
show your manners to Her Majesty.

349
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:50,920
- What was that? - Let us sit.

350
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:02,929
Tomorrow morning,

351
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,230
a temporary interrogation office will be established...

352
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:06,400
to question the criminal.

353
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,599
I believe you will permit it.

354
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,539
After the interrogation, a morning assembly will be held...

355
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:13,510
to clearly disclose...

356
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,280
those who tried to poison Father...

357
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,519
before the civil and military officials.

358
00:36:31,429 --> 00:36:33,530
If you sincerely atone for your sin...

359
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,199
and return Father to his original healthy state,

360
00:36:37,699 --> 00:36:39,469
I will not hurt your dignity or honour...

361
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,570
as the Queen Dowager.

362
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:45,579
Refuse to do so,

363
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:48,238
and your private feelings and adultery...

364
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,579
with this man will be exposed.

365
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,880
You will be...

366
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:55,690
written in history as the most shameful...

367
00:36:56,349 --> 00:36:57,750
and wicked woman.

368
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:03,089
Do not dare judge what is right and wrong...

369
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,860
about us and our long years...

370
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,629
with your standard.

371
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,929
Even if you condemn us for our private feelings and adultery,

372
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:14,070
the fact that our love is sincere...

373
00:37:14,769 --> 00:37:16,239
does not change.

374
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,710
Have you no shame until the end?

375
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,639
Let us see if you can say that,

376
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:23,379
even when your head is hanging on the street.

377
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,750
It is not over yet.

378
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,219
Despite arresting Court Lady Yoon,

379
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,919
your false charge as the deposed Crown Prince...

380
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,389
will not be cleared.

381
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:39,099
Can you guarantee Court Lady Yoon will open her mouth?

382
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,760
Say that she does.

383
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,170
Are you confident...

384
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,300
she will not make an issue out of you, Prince Dosung,

385
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:49,639
or Her Highness?

386
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,710
It seems this is your last desperate move.

387
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,550
But how this fight will end has already been set.

388
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,849
Go ahead and try to do as you please.

389
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,989
I will fight...

390
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,559
with everything I have.

391
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:14,730
I fully understand your will.

392
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,130
- Gun? - In return,

393
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,469
I promise you this.

394
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:23,969
Nothing more and nothing less...

395
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,039
than what you have done to us.

396
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,880
As much as you hurt me,

397
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:31,579
as much as Dosung struggled,

398
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:36,119
and as much time Father and Mother were in misery,

399
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:42,360
I will make you pay for them.

400
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:01,178
Master Moonhyung, Censor,

401
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:02,849
and the Deputy Education Director are waiting inside.

402
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,750
The Commander came with them.

403
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:05,920
Understood.

404
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:08,349
- Let us go inside. - No.

405
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,949
They must be waiting to speak with you.

406
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,690
Go ahead.

407
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,860
There is nothing we cannot talk about before you.

408
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,058
Join me.

409
00:39:16,059 --> 00:39:17,860
You know how much I hate...

410
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,230
having to sit down for long hours.

411
00:39:20,429 --> 00:39:22,969
I will stay the night at the palace and leave tomorrow.

412
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,630
How about we drink later tonight?

413
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,808
All right. I will see you later.

414
00:39:30,809 --> 00:39:31,969
Yes, Gun.

415
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,880
Oh, right.

416
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,079
It is about Lady Myung Yoon.

417
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,820
I was too busy to take care of her.

418
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,619
Say no more.

419
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:47,489
We are thinking of the same.

420
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:53,260
Is that so? I see.

421
00:39:55,699 --> 00:39:57,268
I do not know how you think, but...

422
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,500
Do not worry. Head inside.

423
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,940
I will look into Lady Myung Yoon and take care of her.

424
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,710
Right. I leave her to you.

425
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:20,590
Cheol Du.

426
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,289
Yes?

427
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,130
Search where Lady Myung Yoon is.

428
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,230
It is such a great relief.

429
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,500
As the wedding did not go through,

430
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,739
the marriage is called off. No?

431
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,340
My lady?

432
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,980
What?

433
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,150
Right.

434
00:40:45,679 --> 00:40:47,420
You were thinking of Sir...

435
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,349
No. I mean, His Royal Highness, right?

436
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:54,459
It is only natural. I cannot believe it myself.

437
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,260
You must have it worse.

438
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,489
Good grief.

439
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:01,159
To think he was the Crown Prince.

440
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:05,400
How could this have happened?

441
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:08,138
I heard a messenger with words of his arrest...

442
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:09,369
and transfer to prison.

443
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:11,670
It was a fake messenger.

444
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:14,679
He was safe.

445
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:16,750
By the way,

446
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:20,480
what will happen to Lord Choi?

447
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,789
It has been uncovered that...

448
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:26,090
he had His Royal Highness kidnapped.

449
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,130
It is all my fault.

450
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:38,130
Back then,

451
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,800
when you said we had to get rid of Court Lady Yoon as well,

452
00:41:43,409 --> 00:41:45,340
I should not have stopped you.

453
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,840
Do not say such a thing.

454
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:52,010
I was the one who decided...

455
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:53,820
to let the royal taster live.

456
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,380
No.

457
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:58,019
I kept begging,

458
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,630
and you made the decision to ease my mind. That, I know.

459
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,460
- Because of me, you... - Your Majesty.

460
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:10,170
You must stay strong.

461
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:13,070
Nothing has happened just yet.

462
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,340
She is right.

463
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:18,610
Please hang in there a while longer.

464
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,909
I will find a way to stop us from going down.

465
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:36,130
Even now,

466
00:42:36,789 --> 00:42:39,929
taking out the royal taster seems like our only option.

467
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,829
I doubt that will be as easy anymore.

468
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:47,170
They would also know that it is our only move.

469
00:42:47,969 --> 00:42:51,210
Firm measures will be taken to prevent her death.

470
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,050
Commander, you are the only person I can trust.

471
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,780
There is no way of knowing what the Queen Dowager will do,

472
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,949
so keep the royal taster safe.

473
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:06,820
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

474
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,159
Master, I must ask. Should the royal taster talk,

475
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:12,900
His Royal Highness will clear his name.

476
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:15,130
However, the Queen's Palace...

477
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:17,530
I mean...

478
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,670
Left State Councillor Yoon is also responsible.

479
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:23,539
Of course Left State Councillor Yoon should be eliminated.

480
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,039
He framed His Royal Highness.

481
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,409
That leaves us with the Queen.

482
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:32,949
Showing her mercy will cause an issue.

483
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:34,880
There should never be an exception...

484
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,650
to those who receive punishment.

485
00:43:38,489 --> 00:43:40,590
Whether it is the Queen or not,

486
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:43,130
anyone should be held accountable for their actions.

487
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,860
That is not acceptable.

488
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,699
- Your Royal Highness. - That can never happen,

489
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,630
so do not mention it ever again.

490
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,900
Mother had no idea what was going on.

491
00:43:56,139 --> 00:43:58,039
She was tricked and threatened by the Queen Dowager.

492
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,980
However, the Queen's Palace...

493
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,249
is somewhat responsible for framing you.

494
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:07,250
No, Left State Councillor Yoon was acting on his own.

495
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:09,649
However, Your Royal Highness...

496
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,090
I clearly said it was out of the question.

497
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,690
Our targets are the Queen Dowager and Choi Sang Rok,

498
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,460
not the Queen.

499
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:19,729
All indiscretions will be punished by relieving Yoon Yi Kyum...

500
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:20,800
of his position.

501
00:44:22,699 --> 00:44:23,769
Do you hear me?

502
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,769
- Yes, Your Royal Highness. - Yes, Your Royal Highness.

503
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,280
My lord.

504
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,750
Go on without me.

505
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:50,558
I have not been able to ask...

506
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,130
since His Royal Highness ordered me to keep quiet.

507
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:54,300
But...

508
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,969
revealing the Queen Dowager's involvement with Choi Sang Rok...

509
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,840
will save us all this trouble and scheming.

510
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:08,210
The Queen Dowager...

511
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:10,479
helped His Majesty take the throne...

512
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,150
by upturning the previous government.

513
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:27,630
So what do you think will happen...

514
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:31,630
if she is painted as a wicked witch?

515
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:35,940
That will hurt the current regime.

516
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:37,869
Exactly.

517
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:42,980
His Majesty's legitimacy will come into question.

518
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:47,948
Rebellious forces are still hunting...

519
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:49,690
for opportunities to take over the throne.

520
00:45:50,119 --> 00:45:52,219
That is why this regime...

521
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:55,159
must stay strong.

522
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:56,389
Of course.

523
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,969
Father.

524
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,369
Gun has safely returned.

525
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:08,639
You must be thrilled.

526
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:11,239
Now,

527
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,579
everything will go back to how things were.

528
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,250
Now that Gun is back,

529
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:21,449
I will go back...

530
00:46:24,289 --> 00:46:26,760
to being the carefree Dosung...

531
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,260
and live my life freely.

532
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,260
I have also had it rough during this ordeal,

533
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,130
so you can cut me some slack.

534
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,518
Whether it is the Queen or not,

535
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:57,690
anyone should be held accountable for their actions.

536
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:06,530
- Is the meeting over? - Yes.

537
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:11,369
Why? Is there something you wish to tell me?

538
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,199
No.

539
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:15,399
I will head out...

540
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,769
for I must stand guard by the prison cell.

541
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:00,719
It has been a while.

542
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:04,920
Never did I expect to see you under these circumstances.

543
00:48:07,789 --> 00:48:08,920
I will cut to the chase...

544
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,630
and get to the point.

545
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:16,400
If you wish for His Majesty to get well,

546
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,699
turn a blind eye...

547
00:48:20,139 --> 00:48:21,340
to the incident with the royal taster.

548
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,710
Do you even hear yourself?

549
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:29,848
How dare you bargain with His Majesty's life?

550
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:32,280
You of all people will know...

551
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:35,780
what I have opted to do for the sake of the Queen Dowager.

552
00:48:37,449 --> 00:48:38,989
Please consider the matter.

553
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:43,130
If any harm is inflicted on the Queen Dowager's life,

554
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:47,730
His Majesty...

555
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,900
will not survive.

556
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:54,670
Then,

557
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:57,269
I will excuse myself.

558
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:21,130
Look here.

559
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:25,030
My offer will stand the same no matter what you say to me,

560
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,070
so do not bother to persuade me.

561
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:29,099
I have no intention of doing that.

562
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:32,010
However, you seem to be confused about something...

563
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,239
which is why I am hoping to correct you.

564
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,719
Do as you wish.

565
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:43,750
His Majesty that I know of...

566
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:48,019
will gladly give up his life for the sake of the Crown Prince,

567
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,960
not miserably prolong his life...

568
00:49:50,429 --> 00:49:53,699
as your prisoner and bargaining chip.

569
00:49:55,699 --> 00:49:56,699
However,

570
00:49:57,099 --> 00:49:59,099
should His Majesty lose his life,

571
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:02,969
you will surely be held accountable for it.

572
00:50:03,969 --> 00:50:06,039
Not just you and the Queen Dowager,

573
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:09,039
but your daughter will also pay the price.

574
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:11,210
Do you understand?

575
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:17,590
If you wish for the Queen Dowager to live,

576
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,320
you will give up the antidote...

577
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,730
this second.

578
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:48,579
I am afraid...

579
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:52,549
we are out of options.

580
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,920
But you have the antidote.

581
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:55,888
With that, you can bargain her life...

582
00:50:55,889 --> 00:50:58,090
They will kill us all even if I hand it over.

583
00:50:58,929 --> 00:51:01,030
I was clearly told that we would not be forgiven...

584
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:05,000
even if His Majesty dies due to not having the antidote.

585
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:09,239
Is that truly what the Crown Prince said?

586
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:11,309
Those are the words of Master Moonhyung.

587
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,380
You know very well of his character.

588
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,710
Even in a new world,

589
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:19,250
he would never bend.

590
00:51:23,889 --> 00:51:25,849
That leaves me with only one choice.

591
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,889
I must escape the palace with Soo Ryeon.

592
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,099
Can I count on your help?

593
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:38,829
Is there a way for you to safely leave the palace?

594
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:43,840
I never made a move for I could not guarantee its success,

595
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:48,110
but I have thought about this for many years.

596
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:51,179
Of course.

597
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,079
I hear you.

598
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:56,519
Soo Ryeon might be against making a move...

599
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,449
due to her concern about my life.

600
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:02,860
I will try to persuade her in any way I can.

601
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,230
You can also count on me...

602
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:08,500
to buy time for your escape.

603
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,570
Do not be absurd.

604
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:12,328
If you stay back, you...

605
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,800
This is not the time to be concerned about my life.

606
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:18,440
Not when the Queen Dowager's life is currently at risk.

607
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:26,179
Then, I will put my trust in you and plan the escape.

608
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:29,780
Of course. I will have her ready and await instructions.

609
00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:31,820
Please send word.

610
00:52:38,929 --> 00:52:42,400
Are you telling me to make a run for it?

611
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,530
Inspector General Choi says...

612
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,199
that this is your only option.

613
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:50,139
Your Majesty,

614
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,069
it was your lifelong dream...

615
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:53,940
to reside outside these palace walls.

616
00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:56,239
Inspector General Choi says...

617
00:52:56,909 --> 00:52:58,779
that he is putting into action...

618
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,420
what he has dreamed of for 30 years.

619
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,980
However,

620
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,518
if they catch us escaping...

621
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:07,590
Your Majesty,

622
00:53:08,289 --> 00:53:09,960
please put your faith in him.

623
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:14,360
A man who always puts your safety first...

624
00:53:15,329 --> 00:53:17,429
would not have made a reckless decision.

625
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,710
- What about you? - I will soon follow suit.

626
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:27,840
Who else but I...

627
00:53:29,179 --> 00:53:30,550
could escort and serve you?

628
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,349
You must hurry.

629
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,590
Where is Sang Rok at the moment?

630
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:45,690
Change into these.

631
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:48,929
You will be able to blend in with those at the palace.

632
00:53:54,739 --> 00:53:56,340
This is an identity tablet with an access pass to the palace.

633
00:53:56,739 --> 00:53:58,109
Use when necessary.

634
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,280
(Tongbu: A palace access pass, Bushin: Identity tablet)

635
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,280
Listen to everything I say...

636
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,349
and carry out my instructions to the letter.

637
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:24,030
I am prepared to accept any kind of punishment.

638
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:26,000
If you allow my daughter...

639
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,169
to safely make it out of the palace...

640
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:30,239
In exchange,

641
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:32,670
will you give me the antidote?

642
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,479
Once Myung Yoon is safely on the other side of these walls,

643
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,809
then yes. I will hand it over.

644
00:54:41,849 --> 00:54:43,689
Do you expect me to believe that?

645
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:45,550
The wedding was interrupted,

646
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:49,519
but she is already as good as your wife.

647
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:53,159
Please take pity...

648
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:55,599
on the poor girl who might suffer in spades...

649
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,170
for the crimes of her father,

650
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:02,199
and help me this once.

651
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:19,249
Let me know if anyone wishes to enter.

652
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,360
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

653
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:44,579
I know it was not an easy day for you,

654
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,480
but it was a long day for me as well.

655
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:51,650
When I opened my eyes today,

656
00:55:54,889 --> 00:55:58,489
I was determined to return to the palace on this very day.

657
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:02,429
I do not know if it was the installation ceremony...

658
00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:07,170
or the wedding...

659
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:09,769
that I wanted to stop.

660
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:15,309
However, after I set my eyes on you,

661
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:17,309
I had my answer.

662
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:25,690
Forgive me.

663
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,590
I should not have said that.

664
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:34,000
Did you see His Majesty?

665
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,630
I did.

666
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:38,699
Is he doing better?

667
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:40,570
Were you aware...

668
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,199
of my father's illness?

669
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:46,940
I also know that it was my father...

670
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:49,110
who caused it.

671
00:56:53,449 --> 00:56:55,249
Did Dosung tell you?

672
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:56,280
I found out...

673
00:56:58,019 --> 00:57:01,489
when I sneaked into his chambers last night.

674
00:57:01,719 --> 00:57:03,260
You entered his chambers?

675
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:05,690
Why would you do something so reckless?

676
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:07,698
You would have had to suffer the consequences...

677
00:57:07,699 --> 00:57:09,099
had you been caught.

678
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:11,098
Considering what my father did,

679
00:57:11,099 --> 00:57:13,400
I should already be punished by the skies.

680
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,369
Why would I care about anything happening to me?

681
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,440
Did it never occur to you...

682
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,340
that I would care?

683
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:34,789
Let us put out the urgent fire first.

684
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:36,929
You may have already assumed this,

685
00:57:37,489 --> 00:57:39,190
but once the royal taster talks tomorrow,

686
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,059
another tornado will rip through the entire palace.

687
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:45,570
That is why you must escape the palace.

688
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,968
I will find a chance to help you escape, so...

689
00:57:48,969 --> 00:57:50,099
Forgive me for saying this,

690
00:57:50,909 --> 00:57:53,139
but I do not intend to leave the palace.

691
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:55,610
I cannot do that.

692
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:56,909
What are you talking about?

693
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:59,980
- If you stay, you will... - I know.

694
00:58:02,449 --> 00:58:04,289
And that is why I cannot leave.

695
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:06,859
- Lady Myung Yoon... - He is my father...

696
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:09,460
even if he committed a mortal sin.

697
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:12,488
How could his daughter leave him behind...

698
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:13,558
just to save her own life?

699
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:17,269
Are you telling me to do nothing and watch...

700
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,369
while knowing the hardship you will face?

701
00:58:21,469 --> 00:58:22,969
If I run,

702
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:25,369
you will have to deal with the repercussions.

703
00:58:25,809 --> 00:58:27,308
How could I run while knowing that?

704
00:58:27,309 --> 00:58:30,250
Repercussions or not, that is for me to bear.

705
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:47,329
Have you lost your mind? You cannot be here.

706
00:58:47,659 --> 00:58:49,329
But this is an urgent matter.

707
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:01,510
Your Royal Highness.

708
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,150
I said not to disturb me.

709
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:09,780
Your Royal Highness,

710
00:59:10,179 --> 00:59:11,249
it seems as though the Inspector General...

711
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,519
has escaped the palace with the Queen Dowager.

712
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:35,179
It is the second watch of the night.

713
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:36,979
We must leave.

714
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:39,709
(Yigyung: Between 9pm and 11pm)

715
00:59:39,710 --> 00:59:41,949
On my own? I cannot do that.

716
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,820
I will wait for the Inspector General.

717
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:48,489
I received specific instructions to escort you out of the palace...

718
00:59:48,659 --> 00:59:50,190
once the designated time passes.

719
00:59:50,489 --> 00:59:51,889
I said I was not going anywhere.

720
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,860
He chose another rendezvous point in case of an emergency.

721
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,369
Lord Choi will meet us there with Lady Myung Yoon.

722
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,199
What if he cannot make it out?

723
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:04,840
What then?

724
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:09,139
That will never happen.

725
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:10,210
However,

726
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:12,550
if you do not leave,

727
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,149
Lord Choi will risk his life...

728
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:16,480
and return to the palace for you.

729
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:19,150
That is why you must go.

730
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:18,849
Such insolence!

731
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:23,920
I am still the Queen Dowager of this country.

732
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:26,119
Show your respect.

733
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:10,829
(Missing Crown Prince)

734
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:13,800
Is this why you tried to kill the Crown Prince?

735
01:02:13,969 --> 01:02:17,710
Should we not discuss who is the legitimate Crown Prince?

736
01:02:17,739 --> 01:02:19,709
I meant what I said...

737
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:21,578
when I wished you to be unscathed.

738
01:02:21,579 --> 01:02:24,279
You promised me we would grow old...

739
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,050
- in our next life. - Your Majesty!

740
01:02:26,179 --> 01:02:29,479
Jang Hyun Mok will eliminate Prince Dosung.

741
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,589
Court Lady Kim was murdered.

742
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:34,419
I heard the deposed Crown Prince was behind it.

743
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,559
That is true. I was behind it.
