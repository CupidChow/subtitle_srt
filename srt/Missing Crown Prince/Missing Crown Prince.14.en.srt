(All characters, locations, organizations, and incidents...)

00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:46,449
(in this drama are historically irrelevant and fictitious.)

10
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:47,749
(Production guidelines were strictly followed...)

11
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,950
(when filming with children and animals.)

12
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,469
Was it you...

13
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,180
Myung Yoon...

14
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:12,040
who...

15
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,049
killed my mother?

16
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:18,879
Yes,

17
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:22,890
that is true.

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,060
I killed your mother.

19
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,430
My lady, are you all right?

20
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,370
For the Queen Dowager.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,200
For her, he killed his own wife.

22
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:41,469
My lady.

23
00:01:43,109 --> 00:01:44,109
My lady?

24
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,310
Oh Wol!

25
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,549
My lady...

26
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,079
(Episode 14)

27
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:27,520
An old vixen of the royal court...

28
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,289
has been ruining our nation.

29
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:31,289
His Majesty is ill,

30
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,960
and the title of the Crown Prince remains vacant.

31
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,830
Such misery.

32
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,530
The future of Joseon is nothing but pitch black.

33
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,669
It seems as though the old vixen is behind it all.

34
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:42,669
All eligible men...

35
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:44,668
should rise to the occasion,

36
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:46,169
hunt the old vixen,

37
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,669
and uphold the authority of the royal family and nation.

38
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:51,979
What could be on it that has everyone interested?

39
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:53,979
It is a poster stating that an old vixen...

40
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,210
is poisoning this nation.

41
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,250
An old vixen?

42
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,759
The Queen Dowager.

43
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,020
The Queen Dowager?

44
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,698
(An old vixen of the royal court has been ruining our nation.)

45
00:03:11,699 --> 00:03:13,199
There must still be those...

46
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,770
who support the deposed king.

47
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,400
Of course.

48
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,669
We should have uprooted them all.

49
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,270
I am worried that our internal issues...

50
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:26,240
will provide a reason for their actions.

51
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:29,509
If people find out about the Queen Dowager,

52
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,519
Father's uprising against the deposed king...

53
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,479
will lose its justification.

54
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:37,189
That could serve as a pretext for rebellious forces...

55
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,919
which might result in an insurgency.

56
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,060
Do you now understand why I cannot reveal...

57
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:43,429
the intimate relationship...

58
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,430
between the Queen Dowager and Choi Sang Rok?

59
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,729
- Yes. - Her transgression...

60
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,139
must be dealt with discreetly.

61
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:54,639
If we let our emotions get the best of us and strike,

62
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:57,080
what we do will obviously backfire on us.

63
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,539
Never forget that.

64
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,879
Of course. I will keep that in mind.

65
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,800
His Majesty's health still remains in jeopardy.

66
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,099
I believe it is wise...

67
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,470
to hold a rite for the sky...

68
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:28,240
and appease its anger by pardoning sinners.

69
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,609
What do both princes think of the suggestion?

70
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,680
I...

71
00:04:34,579 --> 00:04:35,750
am against it.

72
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,648
Those innocent...

73
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:40,790
should be set free upon investigation,

74
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,319
but pardoning sinners...

75
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,920
will only cause...

76
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,689
the resentment of their victims to reach the sky.

77
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:52,959
The better solution would be to let court ladies...

78
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,500
leave the palace.

79
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,339
The order was carried out by former kings at times...

80
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,009
to appease the sky.

81
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:05,239
Former kings only allowed court ladies...

82
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,309
to leave the palace for good...

83
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,310
when they faced natural disasters.

84
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,879
How about this, then?

85
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:18,290
This is a petition from Anju,

86
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,290
but for some reason,

87
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:22,930
the Royal Secretariat never reported it.

88
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,670
Despite Anju seeing cold weather daily,

89
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,568
Prince Gwangchang's graveyard and the temporary palace...

90
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:33,339
are being rushed to be completed.

91
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:35,240
Since the people are protesting,

92
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,810
a request has been made to postpone the construction.

93
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,480
I contemplated on the matter,

94
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:43,648
but it does not sit right with me...

95
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:45,879
as a member of the royal family to delay the construction...

96
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:49,589
of Prince Gwangchang's graveyard when he met an untimely death.

97
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,818
Letting some of the court ladies go...

98
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,620
will help us reduce the cost.

99
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,589
I believe it is our duty...

100
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:58,829
to comfort our people by sending the money we save to Anju.

101
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,310
The suggestion could not be any wiser.

102
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,810
Please consider his request.

103
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,379
- Please consider his request. - Please consider his request.

104
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,429
I guess this old man can retire now.

105
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,600
I am flattered.

106
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:34,800
Well,

107
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:36,729
nothing will be better...

108
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,739
than to send away the court ladies...

109
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,199
who serve the Queen Dowager.

110
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:42,638
I doubt she will agree...

111
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,409
to losing the people who support her.

112
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,910
Left State Councillor Yoon will take care of it.

113
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:48,979
- Sorry? - The Queen Dowager...

114
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,980
may have great power and authority,

115
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,879
but the Internal Court is led...

116
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:54,789
by the Queen.

117
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,688
(Naemyungbu:)

118
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:58,519
(Female personnel within the palace that hold a title)

119
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,759
Please do not fret.

120
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,560
I have already persuaded the vice-head court lady.

121
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:05,529
She will help me...

122
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,269
if she is offered the position of Head Court Lady.

123
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,500
Get me a list of those who are loyal...

124
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:13,910
to the Queen Dowager.

125
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,079
This is silk granted to you by the Queen.

126
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,180
Once all goes well,

127
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,920
you will be appointed as Head Court Lady.

128
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:27,888
Did you bring me the list of court ladies...

129
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:29,649
that should be dismissed?

130
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,720
Here you go.

131
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:34,829
(List of Court Ladies to Dismiss)

132
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:42,970
I do not see Court Lady Kim of the Queen Dowager's quarters.

133
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,170
I left her out since trying to dismiss her...

134
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,709
could result in heavy opposition from the Queen Dowager.

135
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,319
What is the meaning of this?

136
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:12,129
Goodness me.

137
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:18,139
Since the silk stands for dishonour,

138
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:20,939
I will have it burned.

139
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:29,749
There seems to be...

140
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,779
a lack of discipline among court ladies.

141
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,349
I believe one must be strict with them.

142
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,419
Of course.

143
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,989
Have all the court ladies gather tonight...

144
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,730
outside the King's Palace.

145
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,330
Absolutely.

146
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:53,600
You must punish Court Lady Kim who had the audacity...

147
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,570
to burn the silk you bestowed...

148
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,440
and remind the court ladies...

149
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:01,710
that you are the head of the Internal Court.

150
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,350
I delegated the task to you.

151
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,689
Do not report anything to me...

152
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,120
unless it concerns Prince Susung.

153
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:11,820
Your Highness,

154
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:15,129
Court Lady Kim did not just burn the silk.

155
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,230
She disdained Prince Susung...

156
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,559
in front of everyone.

157
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:25,470
What did you just say?

158
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,840
She dared to disdain Prince Susung?

159
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:30,339
Are you sure?

160
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,639
I would not dare to lie to you.

161
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,779
She ripped the book of names...

162
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:38,750
that carries Prince Susung's wishes in shreds.

163
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,559
Make way for the Queen.

164
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,398
Court Lady Kim of the Queen Dowager's quarters...

165
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:56,700
will step forward.

166
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,450
For abusing her master's authority and displaying arrogant behaviour,

167
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,080
Court Lady Kim Ye Bun...

168
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,990
has been sentenced to a flogging of 100 times.

169
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,000
Do not just stand there and lift up your skirt.

170
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:32,539
First, you disdain the Crown Prince...

171
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,440
and now you are disobeying my order!

172
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:12,580
Do not say a word to the Queen Dowager.

173
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,879
Of course, Court Lady Kim.

174
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:16,409
Pick up the pace.

175
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,950
The Queen Dowager will summon me soon.

176
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,090
Tie it with more force.

177
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,769
Your Majesty.

178
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,409
- It is no big deal. - Who did this?

179
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,679
This is between the court ladies.

180
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,349
Please do not be concerned.

181
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,850
Tell me what happened this instant!

182
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:54,919
Your Majesty...

183
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,929
Leave us.

184
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,529
I will keep it short.

185
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,398
I doubt you went after one of my people...

186
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,970
without considering the consequences.

187
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,169
Dismiss Court Lady Cho.

188
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,110
No.

189
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,740
- Queen! - It will be Court Lady Kim...

190
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,350
and not Court Lady Cho who leaves.

191
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:24,379
On whose authority?

192
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:27,148
As if I would allow that.

193
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:29,120
I am the head of the Internal Court.

194
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,889
Managing the court ladies falls under my purview.

195
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:34,529
There is nothing you can do...

196
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,759
to stop me from dismissing Court Lady Kim.

197
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,500
Did you think you could push me around forever?

198
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,928
You should learn the pain of losing your own people too.

199
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,000
Queen,

200
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:48,539
are you declaring war against me?

201
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,740
Yes, I will stand against you.

202
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:56,008
I am close to losing my husband and child,

203
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,820
so what could I be afraid of?

204
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,419
You seem unwell and are not thinking straight.

205
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,559
We will continue this some other time.

206
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:12,059
Do not make me out to be ill when I am not!

207
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:15,399
When your mind clears after a good night's sleep,

208
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,539
you will have a change of heart.

209
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,409
Do you think I cannot do it?

210
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:24,840
Just you wait and see.

211
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:28,350
I will have Court Lady Kim dismissed from the palace!

212
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
Sit.

213
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:46,159
It is not your fault.

214
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,230
If you did anything wrong,

215
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,139
it would be the fact...

216
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,370
that you withheld this from me for too long.

217
00:13:53,669 --> 00:13:55,269
I thought Lord Choi...

218
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,470
could also hurt you.

219
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,509
That is why I could not tell you.

220
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:05,419
You believed...

221
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:09,090
that my father could even hurt his own child.

222
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,460
So why did you stay...

223
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:14,019
and serve him all these years?

224
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,799
Your mother was the one who took me off the streets...

225
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,299
and saved me...

226
00:14:26,169 --> 00:14:27,539
from dying out in the cold.

227
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:31,409
Ever since being orphaned,

228
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:34,409
I had not felt that kind of warmth.

229
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,250
Here.

230
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:15,450
That same lady...

231
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,889
asked me to protect you before taking her last breath.

232
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:22,090
So how could I possibly leave your side?

233
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
Moo Baek...

234
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:26,600
You must stay strong...

235
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,570
for the sake of your late mother.

236
00:15:58,529 --> 00:15:59,559
Step aside!

237
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,268
- Take it down. - Yes, my lord.

238
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:03,100
Go your own ways this instant.

239
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:07,740
Over here.

240
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:10,638
There is another one here. Take it down.

241
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,779
- Yes, my lord. - Go your own ways this instant.

242
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:15,450
(An old vixen of the royal court has been ruining our nation.)

243
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,960
Why are you reading what will only disturb you?

244
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,200
Did you find the culprit?

245
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,740
It was my doing.

246
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,269
What?

247
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:47,039
Why would you do such a thing?

248
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:51,820
- Was it... - Yes.

249
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,590
I set a trap for Prince Susung.

250
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,389
And because of that,

251
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,490
Prince Susung will never be able...

252
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:05,660
to disclose our relationship.

253
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:08,700
And I will take this opportunity...

254
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:10,869
to clear out...

255
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,269
the Queen's Palace.

256
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:31,049
Your Royal Highness, it is time for the morning assembly.

257
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,319
I hear you.

258
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:37,730
Bring the prisoner.

259
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,549
He is Physician Kim Dal Saeng who examined...

260
00:17:56,349 --> 00:17:57,949
the royal taster.

261
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,249
(Bongsa:)

262
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:03,920
(Junior Eighth Rank physician of the Royal Infirmary)

263
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,559
This is the man who fabricated her death...

264
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,299
even though she was alive.

265
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,599
Answer me.

266
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:23,869
Why did you lie about the royal taster being dead...

267
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,579
when she was alive?

268
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:27,440
You will speak the truth.

269
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:31,049
The order came...

270
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,019
from Prince Susung.

271
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,559
Such insolence!

272
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:45,459
How dare you speak lies?

273
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,400
Prince Dosung, lower your voice.

274
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:51,799
Continue.

275
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,640
This question is for Prince Susung.

276
00:18:58,309 --> 00:19:00,079
On the third day of last month,

277
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,380
before you left for your secret outing,

278
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:05,849
did you meet this man at the Royal Infirmary?

279
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,660
Yes, I did. However,

280
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,289
it was for another reason.

281
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:17,660
Can you inform us...

282
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,730
why you met with this man?

283
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,849
What is that?

284
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:36,609
Your Royal Highness.

285
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,650
I received it as a gift from Royal Physician Choi.

286
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,389
It was regarding a private matter.

287
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,190
Can you inform us...

288
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,829
of this private matter?

289
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:09,309
No matter how infuriating it is,

290
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:12,750
you must hold back, Your Royal Highness.

291
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,259
I cannot speak of it...

292
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:28,400
due to it being a private matter.

293
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,539
This is a false accusation.

294
00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:35,139
Prince Susung's conversation with him...

295
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:38,279
cannot prove that they conspired together.

296
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,809
That is true. It is a groundless claim...

297
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,880
with no hard evidence.

298
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,949
Please reconsider the matter.

299
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:45,980
However,

300
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:48,720
anyone would agree that it seems suspicious.

301
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,849
If...

302
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,960
you did not conspire with this man to murder his Majesty,

303
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:56,160
please reveal to the court...

304
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,900
why you met with this man.

305
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,339
All we have are his claims...

306
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:14,848
which is why I believe...

307
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:17,048
that it only seems proper...

308
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:19,278
to interrogate this man...

309
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,049
to determine if he is speaking the truth.

310
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,788
I also believe...

311
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:26,490
that a formal interrogation is appropriate.

312
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,328
Please consider our request.

313
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:32,400
- Please consider our request. - Please consider our request.

314
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:48,078
I will speak up and confess.

315
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,180
You cannot.

316
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:51,750
Let me be the one to confess to the crime.

317
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:54,150
If you confess,

318
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,220
you will be accused of having been behind all the recent events...

319
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,690
including Father's illness.

320
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,788
As if I would not know that.

321
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:03,029
Why are you being this way...

322
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,559
when you know what will happen?

323
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:07,829
Because I cannot...

324
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,699
be a fool of a mother who allows her other son...

325
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,599
to also be framed.

326
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,369
It broke my heart...

327
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:17,410
when they framed Prince Susung,

328
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,079
so how could I also hurt you as well?

329
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,479
I would rather die than see you be hurt.

330
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,579
Mother, please.

331
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:26,380
The truth will come out anyway.

332
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:29,920
There is the silver dagger I dropped in the prison cell.

333
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:31,859
Your confession would not matter...

334
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,460
when there is definitive proof of the crime.

335
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:37,089
Gun is in possession of the silver dagger,

336
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,259
so please do not worry.

337
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,519
Look at him with ants in his pants.

338
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,519
What is on your mind?

339
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:09,589
Is Prince Dosung saying he would confess again?

340
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:12,960
Of course.

341
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:15,869
Now that Prince Susung is cornered,

342
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,239
it seems out of character for Prince Dosung to stay put.

343
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,339
Stop fanning the flame!

344
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,170
That is not what I meant.

345
00:23:24,509 --> 00:23:25,509
We are only in this mess...

346
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,078
because the two brothers share a tight bond.

347
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,348
As if that is news!

348
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:32,950
Then we should find a way to sever that bond between them.

349
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:37,150
Destroying the bond they have would not solve all our problems.

350
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,819
Even if we talk Prince Dosung out of confessing,

351
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:42,889
the Queen...

352
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:46,230
will take it upon herself to confess to the murder.

353
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:51,099
You are being too greedy.

354
00:23:51,869 --> 00:23:53,038
Given the situation,

355
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,839
are you trying to protect both your daughter and grandson?

356
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,240
Once Prince Dosung becomes the King,

357
00:24:00,509 --> 00:24:03,609
Her Highness's matter will settle by itself. No?

358
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,119
Thus, we should focus solely...

359
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,789
on making Prince Dosung succeed...

360
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:13,959
to the throne.

361
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,329
That was always the case.

362
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:18,430
I kept insisting on the idea and supporting him.

363
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,130
However, he hated it and blew all opportunities.

364
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:24,969
Whether he likes the idea or not,

365
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,410
we should drive him into the path of becoming the King.

366
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:31,470
The one who killed the royal taster...

367
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,450
was not Prince Susung, but Her Highness the Queen.

368
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,409
- What? - That is absurd.

369
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,048
- "Her Highness the Queen?" - Nonsense.

370
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:40,680
Be careful of what you say.

371
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:42,150
I am afraid...

372
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:45,190
there was evidence left at the scene.

373
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,960
Bring in the evidence.

374
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:12,679
What is that?

375
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,819
It is Her Highness's silver dagger...

376
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,349
that was left next to the royal taster's body.

377
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:26,559
How can you prove that the silver dagger...

378
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:29,230
belongs to Her Highness?

379
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:30,930
The Office of Royal Attire's craftworker...

380
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:33,970
confirmed that the silver dagger was offered...

381
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:35,509
to Her Highness.

382
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:39,180
There is another evidence proving Prince Susung...

383
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,539
did not kill the royal taster.

384
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:50,519
I am the Guard of the Crown Prince's Palace, Lee Gap Seok.

385
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,660
On the night when the royal taster died,

386
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:56,059
His Royal Highness... No.

387
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:58,660
Prince Susung...

388
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,829
was with me...

389
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:03,099
at his palace.

390
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:10,509
Everyone at the palace, including myself, is aware of it.

391
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,579
If I turn out to be lying,

392
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:15,210
you may kill me.

393
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,819
If you dared lie to slander...

394
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,890
the Queen's Palace,

395
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,220
you must give up your life as promised.

396
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:27,859
Understood.

397
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:35,970
Is what that man said true?

398
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,799
Enough.

399
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,140
Are you truly asking for a confirmation?

400
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:46,609
Everyone here knows Prince Susung...

401
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,979
made a false confession...

402
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,720
in order to protect Her Highness.

403
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,819
Your Majesty.

404
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,848
It is clear now...

405
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,759
that the one behind these incidents...

406
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:02,990
is the Queen's Palace.

407
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,299
He is right.

408
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,799
When His Majesty lost consciousness,

409
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,629
the one testifying...

410
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:11,869
the poisoned dried yellow corvina was from the Crown Prince...

411
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:14,039
was from the Queen's Palace.

412
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:20,109
Until the Queen's Palace's sins are thoroughly uncovered,

413
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,450
please confine Her Highness the Queen.

414
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:26,220
- Please confine her. - Please confine her.

415
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,250
How did you know about the silver dagger?

416
00:28:00,349 --> 00:28:03,220
Do not tell me you searched through my room.

417
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:06,490
Please forgive me.

418
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,190
Bring Gap Seok to me.

419
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,759
Understood.

420
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:17,730
Your Royal Highness. It is I, Gap Seok.

421
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:19,440
Come in.

422
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,880
Are your lips glued together?

423
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,250
I asked the reason you fooled me and went that far.

424
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:39,390
Why can you not answer me?

425
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,589
Did Grandfather order you to do it?

426
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,369
Fine. Do as you fit.

427
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,599
Putting aside Sang Soo,

428
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,440
never did I think you would betray me.

429
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,039
You are no longer my friend.

430
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,009
Then what must I have done?

431
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,180
Was I to simply watch as you were falsely charged...

432
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:08,119
and deposed again?

433
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:12,059
I would have rather died...

434
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,019
than to see that.

435
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,259
That was the only way to save Your Royal Highness.

436
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,230
I did it while risking my life.

437
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,029
A simple acknowledgement...

438
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,240
was enough to save you.

439
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,069
If I did not do it and something happened to you,

440
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:33,409
I... Then I...

441
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:35,079
A man does not cry.

442
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,750
Stop crying at once.

443
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:44,490
You are an eyesore. Leave now.

444
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:48,559
I will not leave until you take back the words that...

445
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:50,130
I am no longer your friend.

446
00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:52,130
I will not take it back.

447
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:56,400
A friend would have given me a heads-up.

448
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:59,440
If I had done that, you would have stopped me.

449
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,839
You knew, and yet...

450
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,640
No, forget it.

451
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,980
Your Royal Highness.

452
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:16,289
What will happen to Her Highness the Queen?

453
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:23,960
Go and find out...

454
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,799
where Kim Dal Saeng has been locked up.

455
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,400
Her Highness left the Queen's Palace just a while ago.

456
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,279
Mother...

457
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:23,920
He is imprisoned in the Royal Infirmary.

458
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:25,019
Let us go.

459
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,380
What happened?

460
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:48,609
What about Kim Dal Saeng?

461
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,420
Did he run away?

462
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,950
My apologies, sir.

463
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,250
It happened out of the blue. Nothing could be done.

464
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,299
At any cost, he must be captured before he leaves the palace.

465
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:09,469
- Understood. - He could not have gone far.

466
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,769
We will catch him.

467
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:13,200
Only when we prove Choi Sang Rok ordered him around...

468
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,769
can Mother be released from confinement.

469
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,380
Your Royal Highness. Over there.

470
00:32:22,579 --> 00:32:23,609
Stop!

471
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:27,049
Hey!

472
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,960
Stop right there!

473
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,779
You cannot die. Wake up.

474
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:57,049
Wake up!

475
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,380
We are too late.

476
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,549
That is enough.

477
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:03,650
Choi Sang Rok...

478
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,259
He was definitely behind this.

479
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:09,190
Running made the poison spread faster, which killed him.

480
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:13,798
Will you just let this slide?

481
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,000
What can I do?

482
00:33:15,329 --> 00:33:16,970
There is no proof he was behind this.

483
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:19,940
Darn it. That darn proof.

484
00:33:20,839 --> 00:33:21,868
Let us leave now.

485
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:22,910
Go ahead.

486
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:25,440
Whether he dies or I do,

487
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:26,980
I will see the end of it.

488
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:30,349
Do you think I am not as upset and angry as you?

489
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,349
If possible, I want to...

490
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,990
behead him right this instant.

491
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:38,588
That is the very reason I will kill him!

492
00:33:38,589 --> 00:33:40,089
Have you forgotten that...

493
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:42,359
only Choi Sang Rok can save Father?

494
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:44,630
That little...

495
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:49,470
Mother...

496
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,900
must have reached Naeseondang.

497
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,738
(Naeseondang)

498
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,650
Will you still put your faith in Prince Susung...

499
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,119
and do nothing despite all of this?

500
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:42,820
Her Highness has been confined for now.

501
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,690
However, she will ultimately...

502
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:47,559
be dethroned for treason...

503
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:50,289
and kicked out of the palace.

504
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:55,469
The only way to save His Highness...

505
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,630
is for you...

506
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:01,269
to become the Crown Prince.

507
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,289
Did you not say he was devoted...

508
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,289
to the point of sacrificing himself for his mother?

509
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:28,159
He has started to waver.

510
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,530
If you are about to say that we should wait,

511
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,929
do not do it.

512
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:34,269
That should be said when time is on our side.

513
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,610
Right now,

514
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,780
this is our last resort.

515
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:11,909
It is I. Are you inside?

516
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,909
Dosung.

517
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,889
- Dosung. - I am sorry,

518
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:26,019
but I wish to be alone now.

519
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,530
I am just worried about you.

520
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,170
Would you please...

521
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:39,440
let me see you, even for just a moment?

522
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:41,099
If I see you now...

523
00:36:44,469 --> 00:36:46,678
I am afraid I would look like a loser again,

524
00:36:46,679 --> 00:36:47,710
so please...

525
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,880
I will see you another time.

526
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,250
All right.

527
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:01,590
If you feel like a drink, let me know anytime.

528
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,328
(Clinic)

529
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:37,859
The medicinal herb merchants and herb gatherers...

530
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,400
Choi Sang Rok has been working with for years...

531
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,829
must frequent the clinic.

532
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,929
Yes, do not worry.

533
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,738
I will look into anyone and everyone...

534
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:49,638
connected to Choi Sang Rok.

535
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:51,538
I will check the medicinal herbs to narrow down the list...

536
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:53,679
of the ones we could use to concoct the antidote,

537
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,280
so find out the name of every herb...

538
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:59,780
he has used or ordered even just once.

539
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:07,789
Wait, excuse me.

540
00:38:08,659 --> 00:38:11,288
- Sorry. Are you an herb gatherer? - Yes, I am.

541
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,059
- Oh, then... - What is the matter?

542
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:23,340
Gosh, she scared me.

543
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:27,409
She should stay at home. What is she doing here?

544
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:29,409
Hey, what do you want?

545
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,150
- Goodness. What a clown. - Gosh.

546
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,119
Hold on.

547
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:35,219
Why is she here?

548
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,760
Should she not have left with Lady Myung Yoon?

549
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:09,219
Darn it. What does this say?

550
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,909
Identify yourself.

551
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:37,849
Darn it.

552
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,110
You.

553
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:13,150
You are the Crown Prince's bodyguard.

554
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,260
But why is His Royal Highness...

555
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,099
looking for my father's ledger?

556
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,659
He is trying...

557
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,399
to find some clues that could lead us...

558
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,340
to the discovery of the poison used on the King...

559
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:35,539
or its antidote.

560
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:39,840
His Royal Highness said His Majesty should regain consciousness...

561
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,849
for us to resolve everything.

562
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:47,050
So if you care about His Royal Highness at all,

563
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:53,159
please help me find the ledger.

564
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:01,300
So, Lady Myung Yoon is at home?

565
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,300
I practically begged her. What on earth is she thinking?

566
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:08,539
Your Royal Highness.

567
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,509
You cannot afford to worry about that now...

568
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,039
Did she look well?

569
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:14,139
Yes.

570
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:16,178
I do not know how she is feeling inside,

571
00:41:16,179 --> 00:41:17,210
but she seemed to be doing fine.

572
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:21,780
How much did you tell her?

573
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,590
I told her the truth about everything.

574
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,320
From how the Queen is now confined...

575
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,630
to the fact that Choi Sang Rok killed Kim Dal Saeng.

576
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,229
Why did you have to tell her that?

577
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:35,630
Then was I supposed to just tell her to hand over her father's ledger?

578
00:41:36,269 --> 00:41:38,098
I had to explain why we were looking for the ledger...

579
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:39,369
You told her about the ledger too?

580
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:41,139
Yes.

581
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,170
It seemed like she was very worried about you.

582
00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:48,309
So I told her to find the ledger if she was that worried.

583
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:52,210
How could you ask her to do something so dangerous?

584
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,079
You must have lost your mind.

585
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,869
(Four)

586
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:26,880
(Three)

587
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:40,659
(One)

588
00:42:57,650 --> 00:42:59,079
Lord Choi is home.

589
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,969
Are you here to see me?

590
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:19,699
Let us go inside.

591
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,300
Someone else was here from the Queen Dowager's Palace.

592
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,940
Hence, I would like to visit the palace tomorrow...

593
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,679
to see the Queen Dowager.

594
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,179
Yes, good idea.

595
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:33,719
Then I shall return to my room.

596
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:47,759
Did anything else happen other than the visitor...

597
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,960
from the Queen Dowager's Palace?

598
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,500
No, my lord.

599
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,150
My goodness. Why were you hiding that book in there?

600
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,519
Hurry up and prepare some paper along with a writing brush and ink.

601
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:08,949
A writing brush, paper, and ink?

602
00:44:18,829 --> 00:44:22,099
I called you here for there is something I wish to give you.

603
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,500
Come closer.

604
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,420
(Five)

605
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:46,618
It is my most treasured piece I have had...

606
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:48,320
since before entering the palace,

607
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:50,860
so I hope this shows you how much I care for you.

608
00:44:51,789 --> 00:44:53,300
I would be so grateful if you accepted this.

609
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:55,699
Here, give me your hand.

610
00:44:57,869 --> 00:44:59,800
I do not like jewellery.

611
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:04,539
If you have nothing else to say, I will be leaving then.

612
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:14,579
Can you not try to understand your father?

613
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,690
- Your father is also... - I...

614
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,119
do not have a father.

615
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:22,590
Well, all right.

616
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:25,559
I understand that you cannot forgive him now.

617
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:27,199
However,

618
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,328
it all started because of me,

619
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:31,170
so if you need someone to blame, you should blame me...

620
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:33,440
and forgive your father.

621
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:36,340
You know very well what he has been through.

622
00:45:37,469 --> 00:45:39,909
- After losing your mother... - After losing her?

623
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,139
You mean, after killing her?

624
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:45,880
What? What do you mean?

625
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:49,920
My mother...

626
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:53,690
died at the hands of her husband who was crazy about his secret lover.

627
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,329
In front...

628
00:45:57,559 --> 00:45:58,889
of her baby, at that.

629
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,500
No.

630
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:05,230
No, that cannot be true.

631
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,300
You must be mistaken.

632
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,170
My father told me so.

633
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:13,038
"Yes, that is true."

634
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:14,840
Yes, that is true.

635
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:17,909
- I killed your mother. - "I killed your mother."

636
00:46:20,949 --> 00:46:21,980
So please...

637
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,119
do not tell me again to forgive my father.

638
00:46:26,590 --> 00:46:27,860
No one...

639
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,130
can forgive their father...

640
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:33,159
when he is the one who killed their mother.

641
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,360
What is the matter?

642
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:08,230
Lady Myung Yoon is at the Queen Dowager's Palace.

643
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:24,079
My lady.

644
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,519
Your Royal Highness.

645
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:37,130
Oh, Your Royal Highness.

646
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:39,630
I am here for I have an urgent matter to discuss with you.

647
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:45,400
Could you please give me a moment?

648
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:48,170
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

649
00:47:48,969 --> 00:47:49,969
Sang Soo.

650
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:52,538
Is there a place where Lady Myung Yoon can stay for a moment...

651
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:54,079
without being seen?

652
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,079
There is a vacant room in the court maids' quarters.

653
00:47:59,449 --> 00:48:00,880
Then take her there now.

654
00:48:03,219 --> 00:48:05,989
Wait there. I will meet you there shortly.

655
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:08,690
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

656
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:32,579
My lady, I understand that you wish to help the Crown Prince,

657
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:36,119
but Lord Choi is still your father.

658
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,519
What I am saying is,

659
00:48:40,389 --> 00:48:43,030
if you manage to treat His Majesty and bring him back to life,

660
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,230
then Lord Choi will be...

661
00:48:45,559 --> 00:48:47,500
He will get the punishment he deserves.

662
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:48,800
My lady.

663
00:48:49,699 --> 00:48:51,029
Why are you being like this? You are scaring me.

664
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:52,269
Listen to me carefully.

665
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,840
As I explained to you at home,

666
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:57,110
I put my life on the line and entered the palace...

667
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,239
to put a stop on my father's evil deeds.

668
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,280
However, you do not need to risk your life.

669
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:05,150
- I suggest you go ahead and... - And as I have said to you,

670
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:06,880
I will always stay right by your side,

671
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:09,449
no matter what happens.

672
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,320
Oh Wol, are you inside?

673
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:24,969
Do not come out.

674
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,500
Stand guard.

675
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:29,969
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

676
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:45,389
Why are you looking at me as if I am some vermin?

677
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:47,590
Do you not think you should apologize first?

678
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:50,730
Why should I apologize?

679
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:55,059
You lowborn fool. You do not even know what you did wrong.

680
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:56,969
My goodness.

681
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,800
Look at you boasting thinking you are a nobleman.

682
00:50:00,099 --> 00:50:01,099
You little...

683
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,239
- Hush. - Hey, get this off my face. Hey.

684
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:08,039
Be quiet.

685
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:14,250
Your Royal Highness. Are you not happy to see me at all?

686
00:50:15,019 --> 00:50:16,619
I thought I would never see you again.

687
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:20,360
When I saw you earlier,

688
00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:23,690
I felt as though I was dreaming.

689
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,500
Then...

690
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,530
why are you looking at me like that?

691
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:31,900
Why are you clad in the court lady uniform?

692
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,340
To stay in the palace and help you,

693
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:40,079
I should do my best not to be noticed by the people in the palace.

694
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,149
I brought my father's journals...

695
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:47,750
I do not need your help,

696
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:50,250
so please leave the palace at once.

697
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:53,459
Your Royal Highness.

698
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,960
Get changed and come out.

699
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,630
Please hear me out first.

700
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,599
I do not want to listen to what you have to say.

701
00:51:04,969 --> 00:51:07,340
If you know how I felt when I decided to get you out of here,

702
00:51:08,869 --> 00:51:10,369
you cannot be here now.

703
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:13,610
My father...

704
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,079
killed my mother.

705
00:51:26,489 --> 00:51:28,389
He killed my mother because of the Queen Dowager.

706
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,690
Knowing that, how could I think of him as my father?

707
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:32,559
Hence,

708
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,860
I have decided to cut all ties with him.

709
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:41,639
I am no longer Choi Myung Yoon. From now on, I am Baek Gu.

710
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:45,110
And I will live as Baek Gu until the day I die.

711
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,349
- My lady. - Queen Dowager and Choi Sang Rok...

712
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,710
are no longer just your enemies.

713
00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:56,079
They are also my enemies who took my mother's life.

714
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:58,619
Help me get back at them...

715
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,760
It is I.

716
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:43,130
Come in.

717
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:52,969
Are you all right?

718
00:52:53,739 --> 00:52:54,739
Yes.

719
00:52:55,079 --> 00:52:57,179
I must talk to you about something.

720
00:52:58,510 --> 00:52:59,550
Let us sit down.

721
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,550
It is I, Cheol Du. There is urgent news you must hear.

722
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,489
You may enter.

723
00:53:13,659 --> 00:53:14,760
What is it?

724
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:16,829
The Left State Councillor has been attacked.

725
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:18,530
- My grandfather? - Yes.

726
00:53:18,769 --> 00:53:20,399
He is being treated at the Royal Infirmary now.

727
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,670
Is he badly hurt?

728
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:34,219
Grandfather, are you all right?

729
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:35,619
Yes.

730
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,659
I apologize for causing you concern.

731
00:53:40,989 --> 00:53:45,289
It was just a graze, so do not worry.

732
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:48,960
What about his bones and tendons? Are they all okay?

733
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:52,469
Yes. Thankfully, the wound is not deep. He will recover soon.

734
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:54,469
Thank you. You can go.

735
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:00,409
What happened?

736
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:02,340
Who did this?

737
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:06,150
I apologize,

738
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,219
but I wish to speak with Prince Dosung in private.

739
00:54:11,889 --> 00:54:12,889
Grandfather.

740
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:16,860
It is okay.

741
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:19,230
I will see you later.

742
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,510
What on earth...

743
00:54:35,309 --> 00:54:38,980
do you have to say that you treated Gun so rudely?

744
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,980
He asked Prince Susung to step out for his own sake.

745
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:44,949
Prince Susung will be...

746
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:48,419
in a pickle once he finds out...

747
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:51,590
that Lord Yoon was attacked by his own bodyguard.

748
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,699
The Crown Prince's bodyguard? No way.

749
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,570
Did Gap Seok do this?

750
00:54:57,869 --> 00:54:58,900
Yes.

751
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:00,969
That is correct.

752
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,940
No way.

753
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:06,340
Why would Gap Seok do such a thing?

754
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,409
Well, the person who ordered him to do it would know the reason.

755
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:15,250
Have you forgotten already?

756
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,320
Master Moonhyung was the first person who requested...

757
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:20,219
that the Queen be confined.

758
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:22,820
Tell him already.

759
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:24,860
You may come in now.

760
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:43,610
When he was attacked,

761
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:45,949
the Commander of the Royal Guards was with him.

762
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:51,090
Hurry up and tell him what you saw.

763
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,059
It was the Crown Prince's bodyguard...

764
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:56,829
who attacked Left State Councillor Yoon.

765
00:55:59,429 --> 00:56:00,730
Are you sure...

766
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,360
it was Gap Seok?

767
00:56:05,269 --> 00:56:06,269
Yes, Your Highness.

768
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:23,150
Dosung.

769
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,699
Did they tell you what happened?

770
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,570
They said it was Gap Seok who attacked him.

771
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,809
Do you believe that?

772
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,239
The Commander of the Royal Guards saw it.

773
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:16,300
Your Majesty.

774
00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:17,739
Your Majesty!

775
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:22,440
What are you waiting for? Go and fetch the royal physician now!

776
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:23,610
Yes, sir.

777
00:57:23,949 --> 00:57:24,949
Your Majesty.

778
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:26,550
Your Majesty!

779
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:34,489
His Majesty seems to be in critical condition.

780
00:57:35,659 --> 00:57:36,889
Please go ahead and examine him.

781
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:40,130
What are you waiting for?

782
00:57:40,131 --> 00:57:43,630
First, promise that you will do as I say.

783
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:45,328
What do you mean?

784
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:47,199
Do as I say,

785
00:57:47,769 --> 00:57:49,570
and His Majesty will live.

786
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:51,039
If you refuse,

787
00:57:52,269 --> 00:57:53,639
he will pass away.

788
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,210
Am I wrong?

789
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:03,550
Keep up the great work.

790
00:58:03,789 --> 00:58:05,150
You need not say that.

791
00:58:05,619 --> 00:58:07,920
We are in this together now.

792
00:58:16,829 --> 00:58:18,070
Do not get the wrong idea.

793
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:19,230
Well...

794
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,669
We are just grateful to you. That is all.

795
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:23,710
I do not...

796
00:58:24,739 --> 00:58:26,239
work for you...

797
00:58:28,039 --> 00:58:29,510
or for the Inspector General.

798
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,579
His Majesty is my master whom I serve.

799
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:33,849
We know that,

800
00:58:34,949 --> 00:58:39,249
but you have been helping Prince Dosung until now.

801
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,260
That too.

802
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:43,860
I did it for His Majesty's sake, not for Prince Dosung.

803
00:58:44,659 --> 00:58:49,030
If you threaten me once again using His Majesty's safety,

804
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:52,699
you will pay for it with your lives.

805
00:59:04,179 --> 00:59:05,210
By the way,

806
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:09,280
what made you decide to join hands with the Inspector General again?

807
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:11,750
You should be able to join forces...

808
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:16,460
with your enemy when you share the same goal. That is politics.

809
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:17,760
Yes, absolutely.

810
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,260
That is...

811
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,360
what politics is all about.

812
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:48,420
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

813
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:51,860
Was it because of Father?

814
00:59:57,369 --> 00:59:58,400
Just do...

815
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:00,400
what you ought to do.

816
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:10,980
I will do what I ought to do.

817
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,400
Your Majesty.

818
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,340
The Crown Prince...

819
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:40,710
will be my next King.

820
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:05,829
Everything went according to your plan, Inspector General.

821
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:08,840
Did it seem like Prince Dosung was wavering?

822
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,170
Yes, certainly.

823
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:13,469
It was such a great idea to threaten the Royal Guard Commander...

824
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:15,510
to join hands with us in advance.

825
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,309
How did you come up with such a brilliant idea?

826
01:01:18,449 --> 01:01:19,948
You worked very hard to ensure...

827
01:01:19,949 --> 01:01:22,380
that things would go according to my plan.

828
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:25,289
It is nothing.

829
01:01:27,019 --> 01:01:28,420
Inspector General.

830
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:32,960
I just ask you to never forget how much I contributed.

831
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:37,230
That is something we should discuss once the job is done.

832
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:40,329
It is true that Prince Dosung is wavering,

833
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:42,699
but it is not like he has decided to switch sides completely.

834
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:46,610
Right, that is true.

835
01:01:48,179 --> 01:01:49,840
How we handle this matter from now on is more important.

836
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:52,449
Keep a close watch on Prince Dosung.

837
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:56,280
To do that, you will have to keep him near at all times.

838
01:02:04,929 --> 01:02:06,329
It is I, Yoon Jung Dae.

839
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:08,929
May I come in for a moment?

840
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:13,730
You may come in.

841
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:26,280
I thought I should drop by knowing how upset...

842
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:29,849
and concerned you must be because of what happened to Lord Yoon.

843
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:34,019
Magistrate Yoon, do you not resent me?

844
01:02:35,059 --> 01:02:36,989
- Pardon me? - You must think...

845
01:02:37,829 --> 01:02:39,030
I am a petty-minded fool...

846
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,000
who can only swallow what tastes sweet to me.

847
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:44,469
No, absolutely not.

848
01:02:45,829 --> 01:02:47,670
There were moments when I was hurt...

849
01:02:48,469 --> 01:02:50,840
for I felt as though you were trying to push me away,

850
01:02:51,710 --> 01:02:52,869
but I swear I have never once...

851
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:55,309
thought that of you.

852
01:02:56,909 --> 01:02:58,010
Do you truly mean it?

853
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:03,179
How dare I lie to you?

854
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:06,550
Then...

855
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:11,730
may I trust you and ask you for help once again?

856
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:13,329
I have already...

857
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,159
made it clear to you...

858
01:03:16,929 --> 01:03:19,070
that I would even die if you told me to, Your Highness.

859
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:20,969
Whatever it is,

860
01:03:22,099 --> 01:03:23,400
just tell me what you need done.

861
01:03:24,139 --> 01:03:25,969
I need you to keep tabs on Master Moonhyung.

862
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:28,480
Find out where he goes, what he is up to, and whom he meets.

863
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:31,349
I must find out everything he is up to.

864
01:03:34,349 --> 01:03:38,690
I thought I would never see Your Royal Highness again.

865
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,019
Thank you for being understanding.

866
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:45,690
I am truly grateful for your mercy.

867
01:03:46,429 --> 01:03:48,159
Who would want...

868
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,530
to turn us against each other the most?

869
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,500
I refuse to give them what they want.

870
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:59,009
That is the biggest reason I decided to let go...

871
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:00,610
of my resentment toward you...

872
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:03,210
and how I felt betrayed by you.

873
01:04:04,409 --> 01:04:05,449
However,

874
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:08,849
the guilt of failing to stop Mother's confinement...

875
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:13,989
That guilt still lingers in my heart.

876
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:19,289
So even if it is for my sake, you should stop doing things...

877
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,730
behind my back.

878
01:04:24,329 --> 01:04:25,329
Yes.

879
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:28,939
But about the Left State Councillor...

880
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:29,940
I know...

881
01:04:30,539 --> 01:04:32,139
that you had nothing to do with it.

882
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,679
Frankly, I was quite surprised too.

883
01:04:36,179 --> 01:04:39,610
The Commander of the Royal Guards will not be bribed easily.

884
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,719
So I do not understand he was also...

885
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,789
You know what they do.

886
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:48,090
I am worried about Dosung.

887
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:53,159
Even what happened to Mother is too much to handle.

888
01:04:54,429 --> 01:04:56,159
His maternal grandfather has been attacked on top of that.

889
01:04:58,130 --> 01:04:59,699
He must be extremely upset and anxious.

890
01:05:39,809 --> 01:05:40,980
Oh Wol, are you inside?

891
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:43,510
Yes.

892
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,889
- That is... - Let us talk inside.

893
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:05,130
She nearly married Prince Dosung.

894
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:08,570
She will leave the palace as soon as she is done treating His Majesty.

895
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,340
I will make sure she is not seen until then.

896
01:06:10,469 --> 01:06:13,969
You never know what could happen between a man and a woman.

897
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:19,079
What if she gets pregnant? Then what will you do?

898
01:06:19,849 --> 01:06:20,919
Also,

899
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,780
if Choi Sang Rok finds out, he will obviously try...

900
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:27,389
to use his daughter to control the Crown Prince.

901
01:06:28,489 --> 01:06:29,860
Then what should we do?

902
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:32,360
We must do...

903
01:06:33,659 --> 01:06:36,230
whatever it takes to keep her away from His Royal Highness.

904
01:06:57,420 --> 01:06:59,820
Master Moonhyung met with the Commander of the Royal Guards?

905
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:02,460
Yes. I thought it was odd that he was staying late.

906
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,889
Then I saw him sneaking out alone at this late hour,

907
01:07:05,289 --> 01:07:06,589
so I followed him only to find out...

908
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:08,400
he was headed to the Office of the Royal Guards.

909
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:10,229
Are you sure he met with the Commander?

910
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:13,300
I know the Commander very well, so I recognized him right away.

911
01:07:37,159 --> 01:07:38,960
Your Highness, what brings you by?

912
01:07:39,289 --> 01:07:41,158
What did Master Moonhyung tell you to do?

913
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:42,199
No.

914
01:07:43,230 --> 01:07:44,730
Whom were you ordered to kill?

915
01:07:45,530 --> 01:07:47,840
Pardon me? I do not understand.

916
01:07:49,769 --> 01:07:51,510
You had better tell me the truth!

917
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:53,738
Please do not get the wrong idea.

918
01:07:53,739 --> 01:07:56,239
Whom were you ordered to kill? Where did he send you?

919
01:07:57,980 --> 01:08:00,750
The court ladies' quarters in the Crown Prince's Palace.

920
01:08:01,449 --> 01:08:02,980
So he told you to kill a court lady?

921
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,449
No, not a court lady.

922
01:08:05,789 --> 01:08:08,190
The Inspector General's daughter who is staying there.

923
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:11,130
Did you say...

924
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:13,260
"the Inspector General's daughter?"

925
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:26,970
What...

926
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:29,578
My lady!

927
01:08:29,579 --> 01:08:30,679
My lady!

928
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,779
My lady! No!

929
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:37,050
Oh Wol!

930
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:42,560
My lady...

931
01:09:17,689 --> 01:09:18,689
Oh Wol!

932
01:09:31,239 --> 01:09:32,239
Identify yourselves!

933
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:42,779
Are you all right, my lady?

934
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:50,289
Are you hurt?

935
01:09:51,930 --> 01:09:54,500
No, I am all right.

936
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:05,209
Dosung.

937
01:10:05,210 --> 01:10:06,770
I protect my people.

938
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:10,309
Why are you being like this?

939
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:11,779
To keep my people safe,

940
01:10:12,850 --> 01:10:14,449
I must become Crown Prince.

941
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,270
(Missing Crown Prince)

942
01:11:11,539 --> 01:11:13,510
The Queen Dowager notified me that she would be attending...

943
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:14,880
the memorial ceremony.

944
01:11:15,409 --> 01:11:17,979
I will sneak out the book at all costs.

945
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:19,979
Someone is in the Queen Dowager's chamber.

946
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:21,919
Your maternal grandfather...

947
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,390
sent the assassins to kill Lady Myung Yoon.

948
01:11:24,649 --> 01:11:26,148
Where is Lady Myung Yoon?

949
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:27,789
Search every corner of the palace...

950
01:11:28,489 --> 01:11:29,760
to find her!

951
01:11:30,289 --> 01:11:33,630
We will all die if His Majesty does not regain consciousness.

952
01:11:33,859 --> 01:11:37,399
If more poison is used, His Majesty will pass away.
