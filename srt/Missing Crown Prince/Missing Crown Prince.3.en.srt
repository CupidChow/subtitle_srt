(in this drama are historically irrelevant and fictitious.)

(Production guidelines were strictly followed...)

00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,920
(when filming with children and animals.)

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,929
(Episode 3)

13
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:42,109
Please forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

14
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,159
What are you waiting for? Finish him off.

15
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,719
Your Royal Highness!

16
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,590
Your Royal Highness.

17
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:38,099
Your Royal Highness, you must pull yourself together.

18
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,969
Gap Seok, is it you?

19
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,370
Yes.

20
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:49,609
I will let His Majesty know right away...

21
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,079
and go fetch a physician.

22
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,110
No.

23
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,080
I must...

24
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,520
leave the palace.

25
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:58,879
Pardon me?

26
00:02:58,919 --> 00:02:59,949
We must hurry.

27
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,008
Let me take you to the apothecary now.

28
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,580
No, I told you that I could not go there.

29
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,750
At the moment,

30
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,218
I cannot trust anyone.

31
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:38,419
I understand, but you must get it treated at once.

32
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,389
Oh, dear.

33
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,569
Sir.

34
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,469
If...

35
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,370
something happens, come back here.

36
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,039
I will be waiting.

37
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:58,180
I am telling you this just in case, so do not forget what I said.

38
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:05,050
Take me to Danpungmun.

39
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,750
Danpungmun?

40
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:08,120
Do you think we can sneak out...

41
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:10,490
without being seen?

42
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:15,030
I know there is a small hole dogs use to go in and out.

43
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:16,230
We must make haste.

44
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,939
It is here. This way.

45
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,810
Oh, no. Please be careful.

46
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,430
Where do we go from here?

47
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:54,069
Your Royal Highness.

48
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,870
Sir?

49
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,300
Who...

50
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,310
Sir, it is I.

51
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,319
You really were...

52
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,620
waiting for me.

53
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,819
Did your wound fester? Or...

54
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:18,589
You are covered in blood.

55
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,889
He has been stabbed.

56
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,199
- You must see a physician at once. - No.

57
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,500
I cannot do that.

58
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,100
Why not?

59
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:33,600
There is a reason I cannot tell you.

60
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,079
Could you...

61
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,779
help me?

62
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,980
Okay, please follow me.

63
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:48,449
Thank you.

64
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:51,759
Here, let me carry you on my back.

65
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,399
- Who is she? - I will tell you later.

66
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,129
Let us follow her.

67
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,279
Is she someone we can trust?

68
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,410
Your Royal Highness.

69
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,120
Master Lee.

70
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,449
Master Lee.

71
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,188
How is he?

72
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:31,759
He should be seen by a physician at once.

73
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,528
There is a clinic nearby. We should take him there for now and...

74
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:36,529
Did you not hear what he said? Well...

75
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:40,240
You heard him when he refused to be seen by a physician.

76
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,209
Then what do we do? Just leave him here to die?

77
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,209
The wound is one thing, but he already lost too much blood.

78
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,750
If we stall here, he certainly will not make it.

79
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,879
We do not have time to argue.

80
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,290
If you want to save him, we must take him to the clinic right away.

81
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,800
Oh, dear. What should I do?

82
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:11,699
Please wake up. Please.

83
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:30,419
Your Highness, are you all right?

84
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,389
I pricked myself with a needle. That is all.

85
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,389
You need not make such a fuss about it.

86
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:37,930
As for the Crown Prince,

87
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,899
we will find him soon, so please do not concern yourself with it.

88
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,040
I understand they are eunuchs,

89
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,139
but did they truly have to cause this situation...

90
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,269
for they could not finish him off when they outnumbered him?

91
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,740
I apologize, Your Highness.

92
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:53,639
The head eunuch said...

93
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,649
he was deeply injured. If he cannot find a physician,

94
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,550
he will not make it through the night.

95
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,649
Tell them to thoroughly search every clinic near the palace.

96
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:06,560
We must find the Crown Prince before the King does.

97
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,160
- Yes, Your Highness. - Your Highness.

98
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,100
His Majesty is...

99
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:19,699
The Crown Prince.

100
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,970
Where is the Crown Prince?

101
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,610
Why are you looking for the Crown Prince here?

102
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,839
What did you do to the Crown Prince?

103
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:28,209
Answer my question.

104
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,278
I am asking you what you did to him.

105
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,120
Calm down and take a seat.

106
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,388
Sit down and calmly explain...

107
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,259
Do you not fear the consequences?

108
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,860
Just to conceal your ugly secrets,

109
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,460
you dared...

110
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,399
to hurt the Crown Prince of this country?

111
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:50,740
Is this...

112
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,139
what you want?

113
00:08:55,539 --> 00:08:56,610
Do you...

114
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,840
truly wish to go against me?

115
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:03,178
Hand over the Crown Prince.

116
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:04,679
Give up.

117
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,019
Give up on the Crown Prince,

118
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,449
and everything will go back to how it was in the past.

119
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,590
"The past?"

120
00:09:11,289 --> 00:09:12,690
So, you will kill the Crown Prince...

121
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:15,289
and act as if nothing ever happened...

122
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:18,799
so that you can go on living as the benevolent and wise Queen Dowager?

123
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,070
I must say, you never cease to amaze me.

124
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,169
I understand you can do that,

125
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,240
but every time I see your face,

126
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:34,709
I will want to vomit, so I am afraid I cannot do it.

127
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,549
Watch your mouth,

128
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:38,518
or you will regret it, Your Majesty!

129
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,649
Who will regret their decision?

130
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,860
We shall take this to the end and find out.

131
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:05,379
Your Highness.

132
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:06,779
I am fine.

133
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,480
We do not know what he would do, so follow him at once.

134
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,879
Yes, Your Highness.

135
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:32,768
Listen, Chief Royal Secretary.

136
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:33,798
(Doseungji: Chief Royal Secretary, the head of the Royal Secretariat)

137
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,008
Yes, Your Majesty.

138
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,638
(Doseungji: Chief Royal Secretary, the head of the Royal Secretariat)

139
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:37,939
(Equivalent to the chief presidential secretary)

140
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,249
Go ahead and issue the chwigakryeong at once.

141
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,808
(Chwigakryeong: Emergency order issued...)

142
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,379
(in the face of political upheaval)

143
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:45,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

144
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:58,429
The chwigakryeong? Is that what you just said?

145
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,830
Yes, Your Highness.

146
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:05,169
So, it has come to this after all?

147
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:07,470
I wanted to prevent such a catastrophe at all costs.

148
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:10,980
You must stay strong, Your Highness.

149
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,309
Yes, I must.

150
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,950
I know that I am the only one...

151
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,620
who can protect him.

152
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,628
Summon the Royal Chef.

153
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:36,200
(Daeryeongsuksu: Royal Chef)

154
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,018
This sound is...

155
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,120
It is the chwigakryeong horn.

156
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,850
Something must have happened in the palace.

157
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,549
Bring me my court uniform at once.

158
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:25,579
They are sounding the chwigakryeong horn...

159
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,620
at this late hour?

160
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:36,889
Why did they have to sound the chwigakryeong horn at this hour?

161
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,499
Did the deposed king's remaining followers invade the palace again?

162
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,899
I hear the Crown Prince has been kidnapped...

163
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,569
by some scoundrels.

164
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,269
- "Kidnapped?" - Yes.

165
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,509
The Crown Prince was last seen in the East Palace,

166
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,739
but he has vanished without a trace.

167
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,139
It is possible he sneaked out in disguise again.

168
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,049
I agree,

169
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,789
and a number of other ministers think so too,

170
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,649
but according to the Chief Royal Secretary,

171
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,789
His Majesty is convinced that it is not the case.

172
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:11,899
I also heard...

173
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,629
His Majesty visited the Queen Dowager...

174
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:17,570
and raised his voice at her before the chwigakryeong was issued.

175
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,610
Do you know what this could be all about?

176
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:26,379
I must have an audience with His Majesty.

177
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,379
Where is he now?

178
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,629
Just stay alive.

179
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:52,769
I will find you, no matter what.

180
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,509
I will find you and keep you safe,

181
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,779
so please...

182
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:00,950
Please just stay alive.

183
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,779
Your Majesty.

184
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,220
The Left State Councilor and the ministers...

185
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:09,350
would like an audience with Your Majesty.

186
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:10,789
They may enter.

187
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,809
Did you not hear the chwigakryeong horn?

188
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:31,480
You should be waiting on standby in front of the flag now.

189
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,508
What brings you to the East Palace?

190
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:34,610
Your Majesty.

191
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:37,980
We heard you ordered them to sound the chwigakryeong horn...

192
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,989
because of the Crown Prince.

193
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,990
That is correct.

194
00:14:41,991 --> 00:14:44,518
I understand that he is nowhere to be found at the moment,

195
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,659
but there is no evidence that he was kidnapped,

196
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,629
and I hear there is no witness either.

197
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,229
With all due respect,

198
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,799
I think...

199
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:58,199
he may have sneaked out in disguise again.

200
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,669
I am certain that is not the case.

201
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,508
I am convinced that the Crown Prince has been kidnapped.

202
00:15:02,509 --> 00:15:05,879
Your Majesty, then may we know the reason...

203
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,809
you are so firmly convinced?

204
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,580
Understanding the reason...

205
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,749
will help us...

206
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,860
aid you in your search, Your Majesty.

207
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,960
I ask you...

208
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,259
to please trust my judgment for now...

209
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,500
and support me.

210
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:30,200
Well understood, Your Majesty.

211
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:31,639
Thank you.

212
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,570
Your Majesty, I have a favor to ask of you.

213
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:37,709
You may tell me.

214
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,879
The ministers and I will find His Royal Highness as soon as possible,

215
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,809
so I ask Your Majesty to please revoke the emergency order.

216
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,789
Hearing the sound of the horn all night...

217
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:49,450
and seeing the soldiers on the move...

218
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:52,960
might make the people anxious and keep them up all night,

219
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:55,230
so I am concerned.

220
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,960
Left State Councilor, I understand why you are concerned,

221
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:01,499
but I must ensure the Crown Prince's safety.

222
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,528
Your Majesty.

223
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,199
The chwigakryeong should only be used...

224
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,469
to declare a national emergency.

225
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,169
Your Majesty ought to revoke the order.

226
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,138
Please reconsider.

227
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:13,979
- Please reconsider. - Please reconsider.

228
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,080
That is enough!

229
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,149
The Crown Prince...

230
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,989
vanished in the palace.

231
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,289
If this is not an emergency, what is?

232
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,059
Tell me, ministers.

233
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:30,559
The Crown Prince of this country has gone missing.

234
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,459
Do you not think that it is an urgent matter?

235
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,200
However, Your Majesty, His Royal Highness is...

236
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:39,240
We will find him as soon as we can, Your Majesty.

237
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:43,710
I wish to be alone. Please leave, all of you.

238
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,799
The universe must have helped him.

239
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,869
Then is His Royal...

240
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,739
I mean, is my young master going to be okay?

241
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,039
I think he has turned the corner,

242
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,249
but he has lost a lot of blood, so we cannot be relieved yet.

243
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,609
Then what should we do?

244
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:27,480
Why? Where are you going?

245
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:29,149
Since we cannot reach out to a physician,

246
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,519
I should go and get some medicinal herbs.

247
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,519
I see. I will come with you, then.

248
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,630
You will leave him here alone?

249
00:17:36,329 --> 00:17:39,460
I will be quick. Please keep an eye on him.

250
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:42,500
Wait.

251
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:49,470
You must not tell anyone...

252
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:52,839
that my young master is here. Do you understand?

253
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:56,210
Yes, well understood.

254
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,089
Oh, dear. What is with this mayhem in the middle of the night?

255
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,558
The Crown Prince must just be an excuse.

256
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,389
With all those rebels showing up,

257
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:11,359
I suppose the King wants to tighten discipline in the court.

258
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,630
Do you not find it strange though?

259
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:18,640
What is strange?

260
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,568
If it turns out that he sneaked out in disguise...

261
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:23,039
and was not kidnapped,

262
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,309
it will cause quite the stir, and His Majesty knows that.

263
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:29,910
Why is His Majesty so adamant about it?

264
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:32,250
I must say, I find it very odd.

265
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,450
The Queen...

266
00:18:35,849 --> 00:18:38,759
might know what His Majesty is thinking.

267
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,160
How about...

268
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,960
you ask the Queen about it?

269
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,868
Your Highness, I brought you some snacks.

270
00:18:54,869 --> 00:18:56,670
I told you. I am not hungry.

271
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,210
- Put it away. - Your Highness.

272
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,349
You did not even have dinner.

273
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:02,709
It is important you eat well...

274
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:04,650
to get your energy back at a time like this.

275
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,049
- You may bring it in. - Yes, Your Highness.

276
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:46,359
Are you all right?

277
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,190
- Are you okay? - Gosh.

278
00:19:49,829 --> 00:19:50,859
Are you all right?

279
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,000
- Oh, no! - What happened?

280
00:19:56,569 --> 00:19:57,799
Are you okay? Gosh, no.

281
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,609
- What should we do? - My goodness.

282
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,609
Your Highness!

283
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,240
Your Highness, please snap out of it.

284
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,720
Please calm down.

285
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,819
If you let yourself get distressed like this,

286
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:22,990
it will only fuel the chaos.

287
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:24,960
I apologize, Your Majesty.

288
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,130
I truly am trying to stay calm and keep my cool,

289
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,339
but my heart keeps pounding,

290
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:33,869
and I feel like I cannot breathe.

291
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,039
Your Majesty.

292
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:41,079
Her Highness the Queen Dowager is here.

293
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,579
She may enter.

294
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,450
My Queen, you need to calm down, so stay seated.

295
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:53,490
- However... - It is fine. Do as I say.

296
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,849
Where is Royal Physician Choi Sang Rok?

297
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,679
How come he is not here?

298
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,778
He was on duty last night,

299
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,250
so he left early today.

300
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,319
But now that the chwigakryeong has been issued,

301
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,220
he will be here shortly.

302
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:31,029
As physicians, they are as skilled as he is,

303
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:33,799
so you need not be concerned.

304
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:36,869
Because of the chwigakryeong,

305
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,200
all civil and military officials will assemble shortly.

306
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,410
You should not be here now.

307
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:44,740
I will look after the Queen, so you should go.

308
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,609
Oh, let me fix your belt for you.

309
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,900
What did I tell you?

310
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:09,970
I told you not to do anything,

311
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:13,470
did I not?

312
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:28,450
You are all dismissed.

313
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:34,289
I told you to get out!

314
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,240
Is the Crown Prince alive?

315
00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:54,809
At the moment, he is.

316
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:58,750
But you know it all depends on how you behave yourself.

317
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:00,980
It may be a mere warning this time,

318
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,519
but I guarantee you that one of the people you care for...

319
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,559
will shed blood...

320
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:08,759
next time.

321
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:17,400
What does this all mean?

322
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,900
I do not understand...

323
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,869
what the two of you are talking about right now.

324
00:23:25,309 --> 00:23:26,940
It is better for your own sake to stay in the dark,

325
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,809
so do not pry.

326
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,549
Your Majesty.

327
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:45,730
Head Eunuch, are you there?

328
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,630
Yes, Your Majesty.

329
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,140
Tell the Chief Royal Secretary...

330
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,650
to go ahead and cancel...

331
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,750
the chwigakryeong.

332
00:24:10,289 --> 00:24:11,690
Yes, Your Majesty.

333
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,700
Are we good now?

334
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,430
You should have heeded my warning in the first place.

335
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,240
I will take care of the Royal Taster,

336
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,539
so you need not worry.

337
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:31,609
It seems that the Queen is in utter shock.

338
00:24:32,509 --> 00:24:34,779
Just try to comfort your queen...

339
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,579
and calm her down.

340
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,269
What is this, some kind of prank?

341
00:25:04,509 --> 00:25:06,680
He issued the chwigakryeong and canceled it right away.

342
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:09,279
Who would take his royal orders after this?

343
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:13,450
His Majesty must have doubted it.

344
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,250
I am certain he did not even think...

345
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:20,089
that the Crown Prince would sneak out again...

346
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,690
after all that fuss the last time.

347
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:24,160
But he has done this so many times.

348
00:25:24,829 --> 00:25:26,930
It truly is a big problem.

349
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:29,400
My point, exactly.

350
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,299
Do you not agree?

351
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:53,059
Did you want to see me, Father?

352
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,329
How is the Queen?

353
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,359
She took some medicine, so she will be okay now.

354
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:04,400
Anyway, what happened?

355
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,640
I kept asking Mother, but she will not tell me.

356
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,609
Is it something I should not know?

357
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:15,309
Come...

358
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,119
closer.

359
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,399
- That means Gun is... - The Queen Dowager must be...

360
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,670
hiding him somewhere to hold him hostage.

361
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,839
If not that, he must have fled.

362
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,210
I will go and find Gun at once.

363
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,539
You do not know where he is.

364
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,749
I will interrogate one of the people...

365
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,210
around the Queen Dowager in secret.

366
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,979
I shall interrogate the head eunuch first.

367
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,980
Hush.

368
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,650
What if the Queen Dowager finds out?

369
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,519
I told you...

370
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:05,599
to tame your fiery temper first.

371
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,200
I apologize.

372
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,470
We must ensure the Crown Prince's safety.

373
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,298
Do you not know that we must approach this matter very carefully?

374
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,609
Then what do we do?

375
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,809
We cannot give her the upper hand...

376
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,880
and do as she says.

377
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,420
We must find the Queen Dowager's weakness too.

378
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:30,519
Meet Royal Physician Choi Sang Rok...

379
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,920
and find out some information about the owner of the needle canister.

380
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:37,660
That person is the Queen Dowager's only weakness.

381
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:41,359
However, she can simply desert him.

382
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,099
Now that we know everything,

383
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:48,140
she will try to cut the tail off. Am I wrong?

384
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:50,609
Then she would have deserted him long ago.

385
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,779
And had that been the case, things would not have come to this.

386
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,420
The fact that she let it get to this...

387
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,650
means...

388
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,690
that he is very important to her.

389
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,900
- You are going out again? - Yes.

390
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:19,470
My lady.

391
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,369
Why are you being like this?

392
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:23,940
What if Lord Choi gets home?

393
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,339
That is exactly why I should head out before he gets home.

394
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,680
My gosh. This is driving me crazy.

395
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:31,150
Why? What is driving you crazy this time?

396
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:33,349
You said you pulled it off, and my father does not know.

397
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:34,949
That is right.

398
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:37,220
I barely managed to pull it off without getting caught,

399
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,059
- so if you go out again... - I will be back shortly.

400
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,890
- My lady, please. - I will see you later.

401
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:44,630
Wait.

402
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:46,829
You will go out like this?

403
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,700
Like I said, he thinks I am you.

404
00:28:48,869 --> 00:28:51,599
Are you okay with the family seeing you dressed like this?

405
00:28:52,069 --> 00:28:53,069
Oh, right.

406
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:55,170
Oh, perfect.

407
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,410
There.

408
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,279
This is better, right?

409
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,680
Just kill me before you leave.

410
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:06,979
I mean, I will die anyway,

411
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,549
so I would rather die by your hand than by Lord Choi's.

412
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,230
Oh Wol.

413
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,490
The thing is,

414
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,430
I did not get into the details because I did not want to scare you.

415
00:29:22,829 --> 00:29:25,539
The truth is, that scholar has been stabbed.

416
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:26,769
Sorry?

417
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,940
Who did such a horrible thing?

418
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:34,180
Do not tell me Lord Choi did...

419
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,150
No, right?

420
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,950
No way. That cannot be, right?

421
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,750
I, too, hope that is not the case.

422
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:44,650
Then if that scholar dies,

423
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,819
Lord Choi will become a murderer.

424
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:49,589
That is right.

425
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:52,960
So I must save him for my father's sake.

426
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,200
Yes, okay.

427
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:56,869
You must save him.

428
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,470
I will come up with some excuses so Lord Choi does not find out.

429
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:03,869
Thank you.

430
00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:07,710
So I just need to be home before sunrise, right?

431
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:09,910
Bye.

432
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,519
My lady.

433
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:15,319
No, please do not do this to me!

434
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,319
Do you not recognize me?

435
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,160
I am sure you do.

436
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:56,789
- What brings you to my place? - Your place?

437
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:00,259
So, you are Lord Choi's daughter?

438
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,069
Are you not here to see me?

439
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:07,200
I did miss you,

440
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,309
but from your name...

441
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:11,410
to where you lived,

442
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,140
you did not tell me anything about you,

443
00:31:15,849 --> 00:31:17,279
so how was I supposed to find you?

444
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,579
I am here to see Royal Physician Choi.

445
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,589
Is he inside?

446
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,990
He returned to the palace because of the chwigakryeong.

447
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,359
Come back another time.

448
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,190
The chwigakryeong has been canceled,

449
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,589
so he will return soon.

450
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,730
I must see him today,

451
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:36,130
- so I will wait for him. - You do that. Please excuse me.

452
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,769
Wait.

453
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,670
I understand men and women should stay separated,

454
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:43,640
but it is not like we do not know each other.

455
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,240
Since your father is not home,

456
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,379
it is only right that you tend to his guest as his daughter.

457
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,509
I am sorry. I am in a rush as I have somewhere to be.

458
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,960
She is still so cold to me.

459
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:06,329
But I now know where she lives,

460
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,299
so she cannot run away from me.

461
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:14,369
- A snakebite? - Are you all right?

462
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:16,069
- He got bitten by a snake. - A snake?

463
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:17,969
- Are you all right? - What happened?

464
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,639
- Look at this. - How did this happen?

465
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,608
- Look at the bite mark. - Oh, dear.

466
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:23,649
- A snakebite could kill you. - What should we do?

467
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,109
- What happened? - My gosh.

468
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:28,049
Your Highness.

469
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:30,990
How dare you!

470
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,059
Do you know who he is?

471
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:34,618
Put that dagger away at once!

472
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,058
A venomous snakebite left untreated...

473
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:37,630
could kill him.

474
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:53,808
The blood looks almost black, so it must have been a venomous snake.

475
00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:56,150
- A venomous snake? - A venomous snake?

476
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,980
- My gosh. - Goodness.

477
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,159
What are you waiting for?

478
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,990
Go and get a physician. Hurry!

479
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:11,529
Okay.

480
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,619
I think I managed to stop the venom from spreading,

481
00:33:34,119 --> 00:33:35,649
but you should stay still right here...

482
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,119
until the physician arrives, just in case.

483
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,390
Do you understand?

484
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,669
I was so focused on my studies today...

485
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,109
that I did not realize I got a papercut.

486
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,079
Look, I am bleeding.

487
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:02,980
I am dizzy.

488
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:05,749
I would feel better if I could lean on your shoulder for a moment...

489
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,179
You need acupuncture.

490
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,119
Acupuncture? No, I do not need acupuncture.

491
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:25,969
I have a cold.

492
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,639
This will get rid of a cold, right?

493
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,389
Would you like some?

494
00:34:42,889 --> 00:34:45,119
- You little... - Here.

495
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,320
This is the biggest one.

496
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:51,090
No, Seo Hee.

497
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:54,300
Open your eyes, Seo Hee.

498
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:55,670
Please.

499
00:34:57,469 --> 00:35:00,139
How did you not know you were with a child?

500
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,170
But such a young girl did nothing wrong.

501
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:07,579
Why must she pass away like this?

502
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:10,449
I am sorry, Seo Hee.

503
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:29,629
What brings you to my house, Prince?

504
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,099
It has been a while.

505
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,339
Have you been well?

506
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,340
Yes.

507
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,069
You have been well as well, yes?

508
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,139
Yes.

509
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,880
Nothing can possibly happen to a man about town...

510
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,949
who has nothing to do but drink.

511
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,179
You joke too much.

512
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,420
That reminds me.

513
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:51,789
I met your daughter just a while ago.

514
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,260
You mean Myung Yoon?

515
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,699
Yes.

516
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:10,369
Father.

517
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,980
Why did you try to hurt such an innocent life?

518
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,949
Did you have to go this far?

519
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,670
You...

520
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,500
So it is you.

521
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,440
Do you feel better?

522
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,340
What about my company?

523
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,840
Where is he?

524
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,420
Sir.

525
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,250
Your Royal Highness!

526
00:36:58,889 --> 00:36:59,889
Master Lee.

527
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,829
Are you all right?

528
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:06,059
My chest...

529
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,429
Oh, my apologies.

530
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,799
Luck was on your side. The dagger dodged your heart,

531
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,269
which saved you.

532
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,110
It was not luck.

533
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:18,940
They avoided his vital points on purpose.

534
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,178
What does that mean?

535
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:24,050
I only went there because Sang Soo...

536
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,880
I will inform you later.

537
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:33,590
I will go make some porridge.

538
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,739
How quick-witted.

539
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:49,309
Who on earth is she?

540
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,979
She is the servant of the family I got kidnapped by.

541
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,079
Pardon?

542
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,610
Why is she here?

543
00:37:56,949 --> 00:37:58,880
That is not important right now.

544
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,550
How long have I been in bed?

545
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,889
It has not even been a day.

546
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,429
Where am I?

547
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:15,260
It is a kisaeng house.

548
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:17,030
"A kisaeng house?"

549
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:34,019
Who is he?

550
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:37,320
A lover you have hidden from your family?

551
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:39,320
Goodness, that is not it.

552
00:38:39,559 --> 00:38:42,158
What will you do about the man who chased after you...

553
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,260
day in and out?

554
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,489
Who?

555
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:46,959
You know, the scholar who got bitten by a snake.

556
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,960
Oh, you mean that good-looking scholar?

557
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,468
All his efforts will go to waste.

558
00:38:51,469 --> 00:38:52,469
You are right.

559
00:38:57,269 --> 00:38:58,369
Sang Soo...

560
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,880
It was he who informed you?

561
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,780
Yes. Because Sang Soo gave me notice in advance,

562
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,719
I could save Your Royal Highness.

563
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,380
(Restroom)

564
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:31,769
(Emergency)

565
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,679
Please forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

566
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,718
I am alive, thanks to Sang Soo.

567
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:45,349
That is not true.

568
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,289
How dare he stab Your Royal Highness?

569
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:52,230
I will kill him if we ever meet.

570
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,928
Honestly, people like us...

571
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:00,139
must do as told by those above us.

572
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:01,839
It is just too obvious.

573
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,638
His family must have been used to threaten him.

574
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:06,109
So without a choice...

575
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,280
Shut it.

576
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,309
I got it.

577
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,650
Say no more.

578
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:13,619
Understood.

579
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,849
By the way,

580
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,320
should we not send word to Prince Dosung, at the least?

581
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,719
The moment he learns about this,

582
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,960
he will go straight to the Queen Dowager's quarters.

583
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:28,859
Do not do it. It will only make matters worse.

584
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,300
Is it not already worse?

585
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,368
Your Royal Highness has been stabbed.

586
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:33,900
How can it get any worse?

587
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:54,619
So what brought you here?

588
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,960
The Crown Prince must have shown you...

589
00:40:57,059 --> 00:40:59,230
an acupuncture needle canister.

590
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,829
Do you remember?

591
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,829
Yes, I do.

592
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,500
That day,

593
00:41:07,099 --> 00:41:09,239
I heard you promised to ask...

594
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,038
the Royal Infirmary who had lost it.

595
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,238
(Department and physicians working in the palace)

596
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,980
- So did you? - Yes.

597
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,110
It belonged to Physician Heo Jin Soo...

598
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:20,019
in charge of the Queen Dowager's quarters.

599
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,880
"The Queen Dowager's quarters?"

600
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:25,489
Yes. Is there a problem?

601
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:28,519
It is nothing.

602
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:32,829
By any chance, do you know where he lives?

603
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:42,400
My lord. You have a guest.

604
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,969
My lord?

605
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:47,179
My lord!

606
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:57,250
My lord.

607
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:22,480
Physician Heo is dead.

608
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:30,550
Your Majesty!

609
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:32,960
Your Majesty.

610
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:36,789
Your Majesty...

611
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:48,570
It seems he has taken his own life to protect the Queen Dowager.

612
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,670
I am worried about...

613
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:52,780
what she might do once she finds out.

614
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,179
Do not worry too much.

615
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:57,880
I, too,

616
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:00,579
have taken action in cases like such.

617
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:08,590
Through the Chief Royal Secretary,

618
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,329
I have sent a letter to the Training General.

619
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:15,698
If necessary, the Training General...

620
00:43:15,699 --> 00:43:18,269
will bring his soldiers and wipe all of them out.

621
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,510
You have heard, yes?

622
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:26,210
Father has his own plan.

623
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,710
Do not worry too much, Mother.

624
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:30,849
How can I not worry?

625
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:34,679
It means there can be bloodshed in the palace.

626
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,219
There is a chance you and His Majesty might get hurt.

627
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,989
I am frightened.

628
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:45,428
I keep remembering the face of the court lady coughing up blood.

629
00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:47,829
Why are you saying such weak words?

630
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:50,769
You have Father...

631
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:52,570
and me, do you not?

632
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:04,809
Mother.

633
00:44:04,949 --> 00:44:07,480
I actually have a lady in my heart.

634
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:11,989
Is that true?

635
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:13,760
Yes, Mother.

636
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,959
Which family is she from? How old is she?

637
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,359
Mother...

638
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,130
Tell me at once. I am waiting for your answer.

639
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,070
What is the rush?

640
00:44:24,929 --> 00:44:26,868
You did not like the daughter of the lord living in Pil-dong.

641
00:44:26,869 --> 00:44:28,500
Nor did you like the Great Scholar's niece.

642
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,269
You refused all women, so I would have been worried.

643
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:37,448
I will send a matchmaker at once, and...

644
00:44:37,449 --> 00:44:38,550
Mother!

645
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,149
What is it?

646
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:43,449
I did not tell you until now in fear you might act like this.

647
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,090
Let us settle the Queen Dowager's matter first.

648
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:49,789
Then, I will tell you in time.

649
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:53,799
You are right. The Crown Prince must get married first...

650
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,659
for you to get married.

651
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,239
What is the Crown Prince doing, and where is he?

652
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:04,510
I hope he is safe.

653
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,500
Why are you looking at me like that?

654
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,599
I did not notice last time because of the situation.

655
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:32,570
But I can tell you are trained.

656
00:45:33,699 --> 00:45:36,309
When did you learn medical practices despite being a servant?

657
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,110
I simply learned by watching.

658
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,610
And stop calling me...

659
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,849
a servant. It is not pleasant to hear.

660
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,510
Then tell me your name.

661
00:45:46,219 --> 00:45:49,119
I have no other way to address you without your name.

662
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,750
You know very well I cannot tell you.

663
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:53,820
Then...

664
00:45:54,889 --> 00:45:56,889
May I give you a name?

665
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:59,030
Do as you please.

666
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,269
Your skin is as fair as snow,

667
00:46:06,869 --> 00:46:07,900
so "baek" that means white.

668
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,440
Your face is as round as the moon,

669
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:12,610
so "gu" as in a sphere.

670
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:14,510
- Baek Gu? - Baek Gu.

671
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,039
How does Baek Gu sound?

672
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,210
Is it not perfect, Baek Gu?

673
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:19,619
Do you have a death wish?

674
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:23,489
Baek Gu, you foulmouthed soul.

675
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,150
You gave me the go-ahead.

676
00:46:28,889 --> 00:46:30,289
That hurts, Baek Gu.

677
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,460
Baek Gu.

678
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:36,030
Baek Gu...

679
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:46,139
Anyway,

680
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:49,309
does this not faze you?

681
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:50,809
What do you mean?

682
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,178
You may not be an unmarried daughter of a nobleman.

683
00:46:53,179 --> 00:46:54,549
(A gyusu of a banga: An unmarried daughter of a nobleman)

684
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:57,489
However, as a lady, you have been untying...

685
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,119
the ribbon of my shirt.

686
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:03,860
I am asking if that does not faze you.

687
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:08,360
I am a physician, and all that you are is my patient.

688
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,030
You may be a physician,

689
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,269
but I am more than just a patient.

690
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,610
I am Husband.

691
00:47:17,769 --> 00:47:19,440
You are a relentless one.

692
00:47:19,809 --> 00:47:23,510
Tenacity is a quality all men should have.

693
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:26,050
Do you not agree, Baek Gu?

694
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,119
That was a joke.

695
00:47:31,289 --> 00:47:33,289
It was my way of expressing how sad I am to leave you,

696
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,590
so do not be angry.

697
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:36,860
Leave me?

698
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,929
What do you mean by that?

699
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:40,900
There is...

700
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:42,929
someplace I must go.

701
00:47:43,929 --> 00:47:46,340
You are in no shape to move about just yet.

702
00:47:46,869 --> 00:47:49,610
Your wound might fester and lead to serious problems.

703
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,139
I appreciate your concern,

704
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:53,179
but this cannot wait any longer.

705
00:47:53,409 --> 00:47:54,440
I still advise against it.

706
00:47:54,909 --> 00:47:56,349
I do not know what it is you must do,

707
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:58,809
but nothing is more valuable than your life...

708
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,150
which is why I cannot let you leave.

709
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,380
Even though the person I must meet...

710
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,090
is Royal Physician Choi?

711
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,559
Pardon?

712
00:48:07,219 --> 00:48:08,288
Royal Physician Choi?

713
00:48:08,289 --> 00:48:10,630
Should my condition worsen,

714
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:12,960
I am sure he will treat me accordingly.

715
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,030
Now that you know, may I leave?

716
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:19,130
No, you can never leave.

717
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:20,340
What?

718
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:23,039
Do you have doubts regarding his abilities?

719
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,738
Gosh. No, that is not it.

720
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:28,679
Well, if you are that worried about me,

721
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:31,550
you can come with me.

722
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:33,880
Right, I will...

723
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,789
Pardon?

724
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,320
Why do you suddenly seem flustered and out of sorts?

725
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:40,960
It is nothing.

726
00:48:41,389 --> 00:48:43,959
You said it was urgent. You should get ready to leave.

727
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:45,489
I will leave you to it.

728
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,210
Their fates have gone awry.

729
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,819
If the Crown Prince lives, your daughter will die.

730
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:10,820
And if your daughter lives, the Crown Prince will die.

731
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:14,659
Is there another way?

732
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,159
This time around, I have no way to correct the situation.

733
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:21,360
All you can do is accept her destiny.

734
00:49:22,699 --> 00:49:25,469
Give up on your daughter becoming the Crown Princess.

735
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:28,468
- I cannot do that. - Come on now.

736
00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:29,968
If your daughter becomes the Crown Princess,

737
00:49:29,969 --> 00:49:32,670
either she or the Crown Prince will die.

738
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,179
Do you not believe my words?

739
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,848
Nonsense. How could I not believe you?

740
00:49:40,849 --> 00:49:43,349
However, the Crown Prince is a title,

741
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,389
not a certain person.

742
00:49:46,889 --> 00:49:47,889
What?

743
00:49:48,989 --> 00:49:50,260
Are you saying...

744
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:57,400
Anyway, it is a fact that you saved my life.

745
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,070
I am reluctant to bid farewell...

746
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:02,670
without knowing your name.

747
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:08,739
You will still not tell me?

748
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:10,980
We will never cross paths again,

749
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,579
so why would you want to know the name of this lowly girl?

750
00:50:15,019 --> 00:50:17,989
You may know me as Baek Gu instead.

751
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:23,960
Fate brings people together in mysterious ways.

752
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:27,659
I hear those eventually meet if they are meant to cross paths.

753
00:50:28,429 --> 00:50:29,899
There is no way of knowing...

754
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,530
if fate will have us meet again.

755
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:33,699
That will never happen.

756
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:36,839
There are some people...

757
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,340
who should have never met in the first place.

758
00:50:41,409 --> 00:50:42,579
You have a busy day ahead of you.

759
00:50:43,349 --> 00:50:44,480
You ought to leave first.

760
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,579
No, you should leave first.

761
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,349
Nonsense. I will leave after seeing you go.

762
00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:53,919
Who cares if someone leaves first?

763
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,690
This is hardly something to drag out.

764
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,800
Then,

765
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,170
I will leave first.

766
00:51:08,139 --> 00:51:10,170
Travel safely and take care of yourself.

767
00:51:10,869 --> 00:51:11,909
Thank you.

768
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,340
I wish you safe travels as well.

769
00:51:26,389 --> 00:51:28,960
It is time you went on your way.

770
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,230
I hear you, you brat.

771
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:33,130
Do not rush me.

772
00:51:36,769 --> 00:51:39,369
She did not even look back once.

773
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:40,900
Only you seem to miss her.

774
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:43,238
Still, is it not a disgrace...

775
00:51:43,239 --> 00:51:45,039
for a Crown Prince to fall for a servant?

776
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:47,809
Quiet.

777
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,150
Let us head out.

778
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,940
- My lady. - Tell me he has not arrived.

779
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:23,379
Yes, Lord Choi has not come home yet.

780
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:25,579
No, the young master. The one my people abducted.

781
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,579
Why would he be here?

782
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,049
Did you get caught?

783
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,849
- No, that is not... - Come forth.

784
00:52:30,989 --> 00:52:31,989
He is here.

785
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:33,590
Oh, no.

786
00:52:35,389 --> 00:52:37,030
Come forth.

787
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:42,659
Come forth!

788
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:55,109
We will be in trouble if we get caught.

789
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,139
What do we do?

790
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:58,849
Go to him and ask why he is here.

791
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,579
- Me? - Should it be me?

792
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,819
Of course it should be you.

793
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:04,949
But he knows my face.

794
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,789
You showed him your face?

795
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:11,288
You should have covered your face properly!

796
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:13,059
I had no choice since he already saw me.

797
00:53:13,329 --> 00:53:15,029
Just go to him and ask why he is here.

798
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:16,030
Darn it.

799
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:46,760
The lady over there must be the future Crown Princess.

800
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:10,920
Dang.

801
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:31,710
Please come inside.

802
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:33,480
Sure.

803
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:41,449
They say acclaimed feasts having nothing to eat.

804
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:42,949
Her looks...

805
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:46,149
As if you have the right to judge people's looks.

806
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:49,260
I only say that because her reputation precedes her.

807
00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:50,889
Come on now.

808
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:53,559
I am sure she has a heart of an angel.

809
00:54:55,099 --> 00:54:56,699
Whatever you say.

810
00:55:07,409 --> 00:55:08,739
The aroma is quite nice.

811
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:10,908
What kind of tea is this?

812
00:55:10,909 --> 00:55:11,909
Pardon?

813
00:55:14,349 --> 00:55:16,650
I only served what was given, so...

814
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:19,989
It is jakseol tea.

815
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:30,230
I had something urgent to ask Royal Physician Choi.

816
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:32,670
Do you know when he will be back?

817
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:34,139
Pardon?

818
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:39,610
Actually, I do not.

819
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:45,809
Please leave it be.

820
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,519
- Do not just sit there. - Pardon?

821
00:55:50,219 --> 00:55:51,219
Oh, right.

822
00:56:03,869 --> 00:56:06,400
Is there something you want to say?

823
00:56:09,539 --> 00:56:11,670
Well, that...

824
00:56:12,809 --> 00:56:14,380
Our male servant said...

825
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:17,110
you were here to meet my father.

826
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:20,280
May I ask what it is about?

827
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:22,719
The young master just told you.

828
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:26,619
He has something to ask Royal Physician Choi.

829
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:32,159
Where is my head at?

830
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,098
Of course.

831
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:37,869
You said you came by to ask my father something.

832
00:56:51,079 --> 00:56:54,480
Could he know that he was abducted by this family?

833
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:00,920
The tea has been brewed nicely.

834
00:57:01,389 --> 00:57:04,059
It has a pleasant aroma and taste.

835
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,070
Wait.

836
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,809
What is the meaning of this?

837
00:57:20,179 --> 00:57:22,079
Are you out of your mind? Why are you in the lady's dress?

838
00:57:23,849 --> 00:57:27,420
The young master you abducted is in the guest room.

839
00:57:33,289 --> 00:57:35,489
Their fates have gone awry.

840
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:40,629
If the Crown Prince lives, your daughter will die.

841
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:44,570
And if your daughter lives, the Crown Prince will die.

842
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,710
Did you look into who owns...

843
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:00,380
this needle canister?

844
00:58:01,719 --> 00:58:02,719
Yes, Your Highness.

845
00:58:03,449 --> 00:58:04,519
Who does it belong to?

846
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,789
Forgive me for saying this,

847
00:58:12,329 --> 00:58:13,900
but the owner of this needle canister...

848
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,230
has already taken his life,

849
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:20,940
Your Royal Highness.

850
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:23,840
It was Heo Jin Soo,

851
00:58:24,269 --> 00:58:27,039
the head physician at the Queen Dowager's quarters.

852
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,049
Are you Physician Heo Jin Soo...

853
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:33,650
who examined the dead body of Jong Geum,

854
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,420
the court maid of the Queen Dowager's quarters?

855
00:58:36,849 --> 00:58:38,119
That is correct.

856
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:40,219
It says you only conducted a preliminary examination.

857
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:42,960
Why was there no follow-up?

858
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:44,889
Her death was obviously suicide,

859
00:58:45,429 --> 00:58:46,659
so I deemed it unnecessary...

860
00:58:46,929 --> 00:58:49,829
to discomfort the Queen Dowager by further looking into the case.

861
00:58:50,769 --> 00:58:52,929
That is why I did not continue with a second autopsy.

862
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:40,980
Goodness.

863
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:46,889
You do not seem well.

864
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,659
Maybe you should stay and rest.

865
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:49,889
I cannot.

866
00:59:50,789 --> 00:59:53,659
I would not mind to rest, but there is something I must do.

867
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:01,800
Father.

868
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:03,730
Where are you off to this time around?

869
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:12,539
What did you just say?

870
01:01:12,909 --> 01:01:14,980
If he lives, you will die.

871
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,050
He must die...

872
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:19,349
for you to live.

873
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:22,348
If those are the words of the master, I...

874
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:23,579
Whether you believe him or not,

875
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:26,889
I will do whatever I can to keep you alive.

876
01:01:27,289 --> 01:01:28,320
Father,

877
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:30,388
how can you think of taking a life...

878
01:01:30,389 --> 01:01:31,960
because of the words of someone who reads fates?

879
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,500
How will you pay for all the misdeeds?

880
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:37,368
A father will do anything to save his child.

881
01:01:37,369 --> 01:01:39,900
That man is also someone's precious child.

882
01:01:40,199 --> 01:01:41,968
He also has a father.

883
01:01:41,969 --> 01:01:44,610
How dare you patronize your own father?

884
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,150
You have done enough.

885
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:57,550
Come on.

886
01:01:57,551 --> 01:01:59,150
Did you think I was not aware...

887
01:01:59,449 --> 01:02:01,989
of how you helped him escape and that you were together?

888
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:06,230
There is nothing more you can do anyway,

889
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:08,059
but it is time you kept your head down.

890
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:10,800
Until the bridal selection order is given,

891
01:02:11,469 --> 01:02:13,199
you will stay home.

892
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:29,980
And the Crown Prince?

893
01:02:29,981 --> 01:02:32,389
I handled him as ordered.

894
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:35,860
You will go back to him as day breaks...

895
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:39,829
and keep him there until I give the order.

896
01:02:40,059 --> 01:02:41,098
Of course.

897
01:02:41,099 --> 01:02:43,500
However, with me away from the house,

898
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,199
who will watch Lady Myung Yoon?

899
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:47,900
I strictly told her to stay put,

900
01:02:48,369 --> 01:02:49,969
so I doubt we will have any problems for now.

901
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:10,559
Do you know where?

902
01:03:11,289 --> 01:03:12,829
- Yes, my lady. - And my father?

903
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,559
He just left for the palace.

904
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:26,139
Darn it.

905
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,349
Stay put, will you?

906
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:36,420
I need to think.

907
01:03:36,949 --> 01:03:38,019
Think about what?

908
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:42,190
We should at least try to fathom...

909
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:44,460
who could be keeping us here.

910
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:46,860
Must you think to know that?

911
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,500
Who else could it be but the Queen Dowager?

912
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:52,099
How could she know where we are?

913
01:03:52,599 --> 01:03:54,800
She probably had us followed from the palace.

914
01:03:56,269 --> 01:03:59,639
If that is the case, why did they make a move now...

915
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:01,980
and not at the kisaeng house?

916
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:07,380
Why did they wait until I met with Royal Physician Choi?

917
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:10,949
Of course.

918
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:15,760
They could have been watching Royal Physician Choi's residence.

919
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,230
How did they know I would go to see him?

920
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:19,829
That also makes sense.

921
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:22,179
What will you do with the Crown Prince?

922
01:06:23,719 --> 01:06:24,789
He must be killed.

923
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,530
But His Majesty will see red.

924
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,229
Taking him hostage instead...

925
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:36,059
Have you already forgotten why we agreed to make Myung Yoon...

926
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,630
the Crown Princess?

927
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:41,440
Now,

928
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:43,670
for her to be the Crown Princess,

929
01:06:44,409 --> 01:06:45,670
the current Crown Prince...

930
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:48,579
must die.

931
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:53,579
What is this?

932
01:07:13,769 --> 01:07:14,800
Who are you?

933
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:22,809
How are you here?

934
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:29,179
We must hurry.

935
01:07:32,619 --> 01:07:33,650
Let us go.

936
01:07:35,619 --> 01:07:36,659
Who...

937
01:07:37,829 --> 01:07:39,159
Who exactly are you?

938
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:45,269
Who are you...

939
01:07:46,199 --> 01:07:47,199
really?

940
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:30,710
(Missing Crown Prince)

941
01:08:31,409 --> 01:08:32,679
I am the man...

942
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,750
who has been in love with the Queen Dowager for many years.

943
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:37,919
I must at least know whose side you are on...

944
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,519
to follow your lead.

945
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,219
He now fancies the woman who will soon become the Crown Princess.

946
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:43,889
He cannot say no... when you tell him that you wish...

947
01:08:43,890 --> 01:08:45,858
to make him the Crown Prince.

948
01:08:45,859 --> 01:08:47,529
I helped him escape.

949
01:08:47,829 --> 01:08:50,228
Where did you hide him?

950
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:51,229
My lady.

951
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,569
Is he here?

952
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:56,069
Here comes Lee Gun, the traitor. Tie him up!
