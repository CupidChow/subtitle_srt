00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,209
(Missing Crown Prince)

00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,580
(SUHO)

00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,519
(Hong Ye Ji)

(All characters, locations, organizations, and incidents...)

9
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:44,618
(in this drama are historically irrelevant and fictitious.)

10
00:00:44,619 --> 00:00:45,949
(Production guidelines were strictly followed...)

11
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:47,020
(when filming with children and animals.)

12
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:50,859
(Episode 6)

13
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,630
You have my word...

14
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,100
that I will keep His Majesty safe.

15
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:04,939
Answer the question.

16
00:01:06,469 --> 00:01:07,569
Were you framed...

17
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:09,409
or not?

18
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,250
I...

19
00:01:21,349 --> 00:01:23,420
At the time, I...

20
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,730
I was outside the palace walls.

21
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:35,870
However,

22
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,340
if the Queen spoke of my involvement,

23
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,569
then she must also be right.

24
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,109
Are you admitting your guilt?

25
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,180
At that time, I was outside...

26
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:49,450
the palace walls.

27
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:54,349
Are you pleading guilty or not?

28
00:01:55,989 --> 00:01:57,959
I was outside the palace walls.

29
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:02,730
It seems as though...

30
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,560
we will not get anything else from him.

31
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,229
Should we torture him?

32
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,800
(Goshin: Torture)

33
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:16,039
Please express your thoughts.

34
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,580
He may have committed high treason,

35
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,818
but he was once the Crown Prince of this nation.

36
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:25,918
(Gukbon: Heir to the king)

37
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:28,389
Maybe we should call it a night.

38
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,090
Would this...

39
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,590
not create problems down the road?

40
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,900
Not denying his crimes...

41
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:42,229
should be considered as an admission of guilt.

42
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,340
We should consider Inspector General Choi's guidance.

43
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,900
What if we shed blood...

44
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,310
and His Majesty later on questions what happened today?

45
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:52,609
Who will be able to handle the consequences?

46
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,050
(Hugwa: The unpleasant result or effect of an action)

47
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,599
How is he?

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,240
Is he doing better?

49
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:22,710
Forgive me for saying so,

50
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,939
but unless Her Highness was mistaken,

51
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:27,749
it seems to me...

52
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,780
that she saw him temporarily react to his treatment.

53
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,379
No.

54
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:35,849
I saw it with my own two eyes.

55
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,120
I know what I saw.

56
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:42,689
His Majesty's fingers...

57
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,400
moved like so.

58
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:48,770
Please calm down, Mother.

59
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,169
Was Mother able to sleep last night?

60
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,610
No, she stayed awake all night.

61
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,240
You should rest.

62
00:04:00,349 --> 00:04:02,680
Do you also not believe me?

63
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,080
That is not what I am saying.

64
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:06,549
You are all dismissed.

65
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,789
- Mother! - I wish to be alone.

66
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:11,419
I told you to leave this instant!

67
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
Hold on.

68
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:58,069
Did the Queen truly wish to see me separately?

69
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,910
- Yes. - However,

70
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,509
this is not the way to the Queen's Palace.

71
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,040
Follow me and you will see.

72
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:19,689
You have brought me to the Royal Office.

73
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,458
Why would the Queen be here?

74
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:22,860
(Pyeonjeon: The Palace where the king normally stays)

75
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,230
Please head inside.

76
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,579
What has you startled?

77
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:49,189
You must be aware...

78
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:53,730
that I will soon take this seat.

79
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,360
That is correct, Your Highness.

80
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,269
I thought about it,

81
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:05,939
and it occurred to me...

82
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,839
that when I eventually take the throne and rule Joseon,

83
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,009
I would need someone I could trust...

84
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,550
to assist me by my side.

85
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,079
And those thread of thoughts...

86
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:22,889
led to one being curious.

87
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:25,089
You see,

88
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:27,730
questions tend to keep me up at night.

89
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:29,629
Magistrate Yoon,

90
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,560
I asked to see you to resolve my curiosity.

91
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,800
Please ask me...

92
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,199
anything.

93
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,439
Magistrate Yoon,

94
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,680
are you loyal to me...

95
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:49,949
or are you loyal...

96
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:52,850
to my grandfather?

97
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:58,790
I, Yoon Jung Dae,

98
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:02,958
pledge my loyalty and devotion to you.

99
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,399
(Gyeonmajiro: As loyal as dogs and horses are to their owners)

100
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,899
May I trust...

101
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,139
your loyalty toward me?

102
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,970
I will die if that is what you order...

103
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,910
and live if that is your wish.

104
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,009
Come closer.

105
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,059
I have a favour to ask.

106
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,120
A favour?

107
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,459
That is utterly preposterous.

108
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,829
Your order will be my command.

109
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,600
I will honour it...

110
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:44,269
with my life.

111
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:07,120
Once Prince Dosung is installed as Crown Prince,

112
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,759
Left State Councillor Yoon will first murder my father.

113
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,930
After him,

114
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:15,970
it will be you and Choi Sang Rok.

115
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,639
You should have said...

116
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,250
you had no knowledge of this.

117
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:29,879
What now?

118
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,519
You might be ordered to take poison tomorrow.

119
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,720
But he is still the Crown Prince.

120
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,620
I doubt they will kill him.

121
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,820
The worst they will do is banish him.

122
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,258
After all you went through,

123
00:08:41,259 --> 00:08:42,529
do you still not see who those monsters are?

124
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,960
They framed His Royal Highness...

125
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,669
so that they could end his life.

126
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:52,570
They plotted treason for the purpose of taking his life,

127
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:54,210
so why would they let him live?

128
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:56,169
Your Royal Highness,

129
00:08:57,139 --> 00:08:58,309
once the day breaks,

130
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,809
call Left State Councillor Yoon or Royal Physician Choi...

131
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:04,049
and claim you had no knowledge of this.

132
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,919
Do you hear me?

133
00:09:08,289 --> 00:09:10,759
- What about my father? - To stay alive,

134
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:13,559
the Queen Dowager will protect him.

135
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,129
She could.

136
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,700
However,

137
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,570
I cannot take a gamble when my father's life is at stake.

138
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:05,879
Gun, you must leave.

139
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:09,950
Take Sang Soo first.

140
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:24,830
You must hurry.

141
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:26,399
You are still one to be rash.

142
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,399
How will you handle the repercussions...

143
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,440
once I escape from prison?

144
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,240
Why do you think I wore a mask?

145
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,039
That is not what I meant.

146
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:39,539
Then what...

147
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,279
Should I make my way back to the palace,

148
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,850
we will meet as enemies...

149
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:47,919
and not brothers.

150
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:51,820
Whether we want to or not,

151
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,929
we will aim our swords at each other.

152
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,299
Will you still help me escape while knowing that?

153
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:03,970
Letting you die here cannot be the alternative.

154
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,070
Let us consider the repercussions when we cross that bridge.

155
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,740
You softhearted fool.

156
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,339
Calling me hurtful names...

157
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,879
will not make me change my mind.

158
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:18,120
Let us hurry. We will get caught at this rate.

159
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,720
I ask you...

160
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,490
one last time.

161
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,820
Will you not regret this?

162
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:32,759
You always have to nitpick over the details.

163
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,600
Sure.

164
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,669
I might regret it.

165
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,639
However, I will do my best to protect my family.

166
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,679
I have more to ask,

167
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,379
but that will be reserved for the day I return.

168
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,960
What you did is of grave danger.

169
00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:09,970
- When they talk... - Magistrate Yoon...

170
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,340
will make sure they do not.

171
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,279
Do not worry about Sang Soo.

172
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,289
I will take good care of him...

173
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,019
until he fully heals.

174
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,220
Sure. Take care of him for me.

175
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,970
Dosung.

176
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,799
Please leave already.

177
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:22,639
- Dosung. - What?

178
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:27,879
You are one handsome lad,

179
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:30,149
- my little brother. - Gun.

180
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,450
This is not the time for jokes.

181
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:39,860
It is hard to tell when we will see each other again,

182
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:42,529
so I did not want...

183
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,629
to bid farewell...

184
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:47,230
at the back of your head.

185
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,539
Please stay well and healthy,

186
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,549
Gun.

187
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:07,049
You too.

188
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,149
Be safe and sound.

189
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,460
What is it?

190
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,360
Is the baggage too heavy for you?

191
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,570
Of course not.

192
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,500
That is not it.

193
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,370
I do not know where we are supposed to go.

194
00:15:01,909 --> 00:15:02,909
I am just as clueless.

195
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,840
Let us figure it out.

196
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,909
But we do not have the time.

197
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,278
Once they find out we are gone, they will send officers...

198
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,820
to catch us.

199
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:21,529
Lord Choi.

200
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:24,429
Lord Choi.

201
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,070
My lady.

202
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,509
What is this about?

203
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:39,740
Something must have happened to that scholar.

204
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,210
What do you mean by that?

205
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,549
I overheard Moo Baek talking just now.

206
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:46,950
Something happened at the Department of Justice,

207
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,549
and it seemed like Lord Choi urgently left the house.

208
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:58,799
Why you...

209
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,169
Darn!

210
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:04,700
How did the guards let this happen?

211
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,539
Where is the head guard?

212
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:09,970
Bring me the head guard this instant!

213
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
Yes, my lord.

214
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,080
Lord Yoon.

215
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,750
Lord Yoon, did the Crown Prince escape...

216
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:19,279
My gosh.

217
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,820
How did this happen?

218
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:23,919
Right.

219
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,059
According to one of the guards,

220
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:31,099
he was here...

221
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,100
when the curfew bell rang.

222
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,769
Are you sure about that?

223
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Yes.

224
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:38,799
I doubt he had time to make it out of the palace.

225
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,539
Therefore, he must still be within these walls.

226
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:52,049
Mobilize...

227
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,219
all the soldiers that can be mustered...

228
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,518
and locate the prisoners.

229
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,620
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

230
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,159
We must catch them before they leave the palace.

231
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,259
Have the soldiers thoroughly search within the palace first.

232
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,200
Thoroughly search within the palace!

233
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,470
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

234
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:19,640
Has he still not been found?

235
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,049
He will soon be located, so do not worry.

236
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,680
I know him better than anyone...

237
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,150
which is why I am puzzled.

238
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:30,720
The Crown Prince is not one to bust open those doors...

239
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:32,789
and plan an escape.

240
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,359
I also agree.

241
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:37,129
Someone must have helped him escape.

242
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,160
Someone as in...

243
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:41,299
Was it...

244
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:42,799
Prince Dosung?

245
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,200
Prince Dosung could not have done it alone.

246
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,140
He received help from someone whoever that may be.

247
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,609
Could you find out who?

248
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,779
That, I must.

249
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,279
Your Majesty, it is Court Lady Kim.

250
00:17:58,049 --> 00:17:59,079
Enter.

251
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:08,659
Last night, Prince Dosung was seen...

252
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,490
near Danbongmun.

253
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,559
He resides outside the palace.

254
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,970
It is not odd for him to pass through that gate.

255
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,230
What about it?

256
00:18:16,231 --> 00:18:19,039
Magistrate Yoon borrowed two palanquins,

257
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:22,539
and Prince Dosung was with them.

258
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,809
Magistrate Yoon Jung Dae of Hanseong Magistracy.

259
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,179
But Magistrate Yoon is loyal to Left State Councillor Yoon.

260
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,750
He must have thought it was time...

261
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,018
to jump from a tattered boat into a new one.

262
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:35,690
Or he could have one foot...

263
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,089
in each of those boats.

264
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:41,059
If that is true,

265
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:43,890
he is someone to fear.

266
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:46,759
Prince Dosung who made use of such a person...

267
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:49,170
could be the one to fear more.

268
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,980
Was it you, Prince Dosung?

269
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:05,980
Please speak.

270
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,889
Your grandfather is asking...

271
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,890
if it was you who let the Crown Prince escape.

272
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,019
Yes.

273
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,759
It was I.

274
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:20,500
Why would you choose to do something like that?

275
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:23,230
I made myself perfectly clear,

276
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,940
but you chose to act foolishly!

277
00:19:26,099 --> 00:19:28,009
He may not be your family,

278
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,409
but he is my brother.

279
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,609
If the Crown Prince returns later on,

280
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,980
we might all die.

281
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:39,348
You, the Queen, and me.

282
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:40,380
Then stop it from happening.

283
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,690
Stop Gun from coming back.

284
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:46,460
Have you been coveting power...

285
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,890
without the ability to do so?

286
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,059
Show me...

287
00:19:55,829 --> 00:19:58,240
that you are capable of ruling this country...

288
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:00,869
in my stead.

289
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,109
I will look forward to it.

290
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,789
I will look into it and...

291
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:23,059
She will be the death of me.

292
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,559
I would like to ask something.

293
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:29,268
- What is it? - Is there trouble...

294
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,799
at the Department of Justice?

295
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:32,940
Who are you to ask that?

296
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,640
My brother is an investigator at the Department of Justice,

297
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:37,940
and I came by worried since he did not return home.

298
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:40,940
The soldiers' movement indicate that something happened.

299
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,480
My lady!

300
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:48,349
Wait.

301
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:51,589
You know he has escaped. That should be enough.

302
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,889
Let us go back home now.

303
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,829
We do not know if the one who escaped prison was that scholar.

304
00:20:56,859 --> 00:20:58,929
Had it been someone else,

305
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,400
his lord would not have gone out in a hurry at this hour.

306
00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:03,669
Since you know he is alive...

307
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,240
He might get caught again.

308
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,809
My lady!

309
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:14,578
- Goodness. - Really.

310
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:16,108
Good gracious.

311
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:18,650
Today is surely a blast!

312
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,699
What is it this time?

313
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,969
I did come along as you said it was safer to hide...

314
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,298
in the middle of the city and not of nowhere.

315
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,369
But what?

316
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,309
He was a friend of my father, who was a strolling actor.

317
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,979
But I have not met him since my father passed away.

318
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,150
I wonder if we will be safe.

319
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:54,079
We will use this to make us safe.

320
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:15,369
Let us go inside.

321
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:34,150
Father...

322
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,750
I...

323
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:40,589
will surely return.

324
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:43,529
Until then...

325
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:47,359
Just until then...

326
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:51,230
Please wait for me.

327
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,269
Father.

328
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:58,210
The sinner Lee Gun...

329
00:23:58,609 --> 00:23:59,839
is dismissed from Crown Prince.

330
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,980
Since such a position cannot be vacant even for a day,

331
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,750
Prince Dosung will be proclaimed as the Crown Prince.

332
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,189
Hasten the preparation...

333
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,759
of the Crown Prince proclamation ceremony.

334
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:15,759
And as there needs to be sons in the royal family,

335
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,529
establish a temporary Office of the Royal Wedding...

336
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,598
to welcome a Crown Princess...

337
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,230
with the proclamation ceremony,

338
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,930
and issue a prohibition of marriage.

339
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,038
I refuse.

340
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,298
"Refuse?"

341
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,240
You cannot choose...

342
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,709
to become a Crown Prince or not.

343
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,779
If it cannot be helped,

344
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:35,409
I can simply run away like my brother has.

345
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,410
What are you...

346
00:24:36,411 --> 00:24:37,950
What is the use of becoming the Crown Prince?

347
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:41,279
It is evident I will become the puppet...

348
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,420
as the Queen Dowager is in regent.

349
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,359
That will not last for long.

350
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:50,028
It is only until you succeed to the throne.

351
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:51,559
Let us say I obediently become the Crown Prince.

352
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:54,160
Do you think the Queen Dowager will give up regency...

353
00:24:54,829 --> 00:24:56,970
and put me on the throne?

354
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,940
Even when they know that will get them killed?

355
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,739
Did I not say I would take care of the Queen Dowager?

356
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,279
What if you fail?

357
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,049
I...

358
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,949
do not wish to spend my days in bed like Father.

359
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:15,849
That will never happen.

360
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:18,859
Have faith in me.

361
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,160
If you want me to trust you,

362
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,329
help Father get back on his feet again.

363
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,099
If Father proclaims me...

364
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,569
as the Crown Prince and not the Queen Dowager,

365
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,140
I will be more than willing...

366
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,799
to accept it.

367
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:06,099
Have you still not moved on?

368
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:09,839
If he has not gone beyond the capital,

369
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,809
he will eventually get caught.

370
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:16,509
This is my last request.

371
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:18,819
Mother!

372
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,879
Mother!

373
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,588
- Mother! - No!

374
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:23,819
- Mother! - No...

375
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:26,359
- My son! - Mother!

376
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:27,890
No!

377
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:49,849
- No. - Sang Rok.

378
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:52,180
Do not let go.

379
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,319
Soo Ryeon...

380
00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:57,690
I must go with her.

381
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:00,759
- Soo Ryeon. - You little...

382
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,160
Soo Ryeon.

383
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,630
Sang Rok...

384
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:56,910
You have lost weight in the past few days.

385
00:27:58,579 --> 00:28:02,220
Have you not been up since last night, Sang Rok?

386
00:28:03,289 --> 00:28:04,519
I am all right.

387
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,730
A physician can take care of himself.

388
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,160
But you look pale.

389
00:28:12,759 --> 00:28:14,859
I am fine. Do not worry about me.

390
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:17,200
Go home and get some rest.

391
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,410
Your Majesty.

392
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:24,740
What is it?

393
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,779
I have something to report at once.

394
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:28,880
Come in.

395
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,519
What is it, Head Eunuch?

396
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,089
Tell Her Majesty.

397
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,089
The royal seal...

398
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,059
is missing.

399
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,829
What do you mean the royal seal is missing?

400
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,529
How did this happen?

401
00:28:53,569 --> 00:28:54,798
Let us go to the Office of Royal Affairs.

402
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,469
(Sangseowon: The office in charge of...)

403
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,740
(the Joseon King's royal seal, the royal family's seals, and more)

404
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:16,189
In short, after the Queen made a visit,

405
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:18,900
the chest containing the royal seal and national seal disappeared?

406
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:20,359
Yes, my lord.

407
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,799
Who else knows about this?

408
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:29,309
If you do not wish to die,

409
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:31,368
step aside at once.

410
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:34,910
I am only fulfilling Her Highness' order.

411
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:38,109
Get rid of this man.

412
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:11,109
You may kill him.

413
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,400
This is the last warning.

414
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:29,669
Move aside.

415
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,630
Not before you step on my dead body...

416
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:35,039
can you go past me.

417
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,338
Fire.

418
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,279
(Bangpo: Shooting with a cannon or a gun)

419
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,220
Let him inside.

420
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,739
What did you do with the royal seal?

421
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,339
His Majesty is here.

422
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,768
I ask you to please sit down.

423
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:14,480
I am asking you what you did with the royal seal!

424
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,750
I know nothing about it.

425
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,680
Your Highness.

426
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,220
Your Majesty!

427
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,799
My Queen.

428
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,599
Yes, Your Majesty. I am right here.

429
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:38,569
The royal seal.

430
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:41,640
The royal seal...

431
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:54,849
Darn it.

432
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:02,160
Father, this is utterly disrespectful!

433
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:03,960
Stop it, right this instant!

434
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:07,329
Darn you...

435
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:19,339
Where is it?

436
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,380
Hand over the royal seal at once!

437
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,390
Your Highness.

438
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,660
Without the royal seal,

439
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,690
we cannot get anything done.

440
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,160
Do you realize that it is a very serious matter?

441
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,960
We cannot give out rice to people in need,

442
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:44,730
which means they will starve to death.

443
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,140
If that happens,

444
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:51,170
you may not be able to avoid punishment.

445
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:55,650
No matter what you say, my answer will not change. I know nothing.

446
00:32:58,849 --> 00:32:59,849
Darn it.

447
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,450
Bring her in!

448
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,420
Your Highness!

449
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,630
Father.

450
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:14,430
Your Highness, you caused this.

451
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:16,670
Tell me.

452
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Where did you hide the royal seal?

453
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:27,210
I know nothing.

454
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:29,609
Father!

455
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:34,950
You witch!

456
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:37,990
How dare you roll your eyes at me?

457
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,460
Tell me the truth at once!

458
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,558
My lord, please.

459
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,859
Please, Father.

460
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,160
His Majesty is here.

461
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,170
Why are you being like this?

462
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:56,740
Hand over the royal seal at once,

463
00:33:57,140 --> 00:33:58,980
or this witch here will be tortured...

464
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,940
until she spills the truth.

465
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,450
Where is it?

466
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,389
Darn it.

467
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:18,630
Take her at once.

468
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,429
Torture her until she tells you where the royal seal is.

469
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:24,130
Yes, my lord.

470
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,238
Please spare me. Please!

471
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,669
I really know nothing, my lord!

472
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,039
- Please spare me... - Stop!

473
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,679
That is enough!

474
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,189
Palace Guard Commander, how dare you!

475
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,288
(Gyeomsabokjang: Commander of the Palace Guards)

476
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:45,760
Such insolence.

477
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:49,329
You are to let her go and leave the room at once!

478
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:54,329
What are you looking at?

479
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,269
You dared to disrespect me.

480
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,439
Will you do the same to His Majesty and the royal court too?

481
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,670
Your Highness, that is not the case.

482
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,670
Your Highness.

483
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,940
Where is the royal seal?

484
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,039
Tell me now...

485
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:44,809
for we can still get this all sorted out.

486
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:49,389
You are so cruel.

487
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:54,460
Are you doing this for you wish to see me dead?

488
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:58,159
What do you mean? That is absurd.

489
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,300
Once Prince Dosung is installed as Crown Prince,

490
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:05,269
you will assassinate His Majesty. I know all about your plan.

491
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,739
What are you talking about?

492
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,308
Why would I assassinate His Majesty?

493
00:36:12,309 --> 00:36:13,780
Do not think you can deceive me!

494
00:36:15,309 --> 00:36:17,380
The conversation you had with the Crown Prince in the prison.

495
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,519
I heard it all.

496
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:25,619
If you must kill him,

497
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,190
you ought to kill me too.

498
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,610
They say the royal seal is gone.

499
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,739
- Did you know? - Pardon me?

500
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,579
The royal seal?

501
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,079
I suppose you did not know.

502
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:51,409
I had no idea.

503
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:55,079
What was the Office of Royal Affairs doing?

504
00:36:55,989 --> 00:36:57,449
How could they misplace the royal seal?

505
00:36:57,719 --> 00:36:59,190
Apparently,

506
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,960
Her Highness the Queen paid a visit before it went missing.

507
00:37:02,329 --> 00:37:03,889
My mother?

508
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,630
Then did my mother...

509
00:37:07,429 --> 00:37:09,099
Do you know where it could be?

510
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:13,198
No, this is all too sudden.

511
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,500
Try to think where it could be.

512
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:16,209
We need the royal seal...

513
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,539
for you to be installed as Crown Prince.

514
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,710
Then we have nothing to worry about.

515
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,579
As you know, many people want me to be installed as Crown Prince.

516
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:30,119
And they all want something,

517
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:33,219
so we will find it soon.

518
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,730
Now, please excuse me.

519
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,500
When the deposed Crown Prince sneaked out in disguise,

520
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,469
he was stabbed. You must know about it.

521
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,800
I do not know what it is that you want to say,

522
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,500
but I am not interested in hearing it.

523
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,940
Do you know who treated his wound?

524
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:55,280
It was...

525
00:37:55,849 --> 00:37:57,010
my daughter, Myung Yoon.

526
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,489
I am engaged.

527
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,360
So I suggest you give up and find someone else.

528
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,090
Was your daughter...

529
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,800
engaged to Gun?

530
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,099
No.

531
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,038
They did not even know each other in the past.

532
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:20,639
- Then how... - A few coincidences...

533
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,739
brought them together.

534
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:26,408
Your daughter clearly told me that she was engaged.

535
00:38:26,409 --> 00:38:28,340
It is true that she is engaged.

536
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:29,909
However,

537
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,179
my daughter, Myung Yoon, is not engaged to the deposed Crown Prince.

538
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,250
She will become the Crown Princess,

539
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:41,289
which means whoever gets the Crown Prince title...

540
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:44,090
will marry Myung Yoon.

541
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,539
If you want Myung Yoon to yourself,

542
00:38:56,909 --> 00:38:58,340
proclaim the position as Crown Prince.

543
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,780
Becoming the Crown Prince of this nation...

544
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,380
and marrying the Crown Princess...

545
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:09,789
can only be done with the royal seal.

546
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,219
Do not forget that.

547
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:32,739
Come here.

548
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,000
What is taking them so long?

549
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:55,559
I wonder if something happened.

550
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,530
It is him. Get him!

551
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:29,829
- Get him! - Get him!

552
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,070
Catch him!

553
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:36,570
- He went that way! - Get him!

554
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:42,280
- Get him! - Go after him!

555
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:45,679
- Stop! - Get him!

556
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,179
- Stop right there! - Hey!

557
00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:51,849
Stop!

558
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,189
Get him!

559
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,658
- Do not lose him! - Go!

560
00:40:55,659 --> 00:40:56,690
Stop right there!

561
00:40:57,829 --> 00:40:59,400
- Stop! - Get him!

562
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,900
- Stop! - Catch him!

563
00:41:04,769 --> 00:41:05,800
- Hey! - You little...

564
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:08,900
Hey, go!

565
00:41:08,901 --> 00:41:09,909
There he is.

566
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:12,169
- Stop right there. - Stop!

567
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,179
Go after him.

568
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,820
You fools!

569
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:28,219
I am the Crown Prince's bodyguard,

570
00:41:28,289 --> 00:41:30,759
Lee Gap Seok!

571
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,059
There he is. Go after him!

572
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,329
- Get him! - Go after him!

573
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,099
- Hey. - Get him!

574
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,969
Darn it.

575
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,110
- Hey! - Catch him!

576
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:48,880
Hey!

577
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:12,369
Come at me.

578
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,510
Oh, dear.

579
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:29,909
My goodness.

580
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,519
The stab wound festered a little. That is all.

581
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:39,519
You are acting as though I am gravely injured.

582
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:42,320
Are you really all right?

583
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:43,389
No.

584
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,829
It hurts so much that I feel like I am dying.

585
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,360
Your Royal Highness.

586
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:50,329
Call me Young Master.

587
00:43:50,429 --> 00:43:51,900
Yes, Young Master.

588
00:43:53,769 --> 00:43:56,309
My goodness. I really think...

589
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:59,380
you should see a physician.

590
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:03,150
Why not just say you will take me to the Royal Infirmary?

591
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,820
I had not run around like that for a while, so I am tired.

592
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:13,360
I need to lie down. You should get some rest too.

593
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:16,190
Gosh.

594
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:18,090
Oh, boy.

595
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,900
Gosh. My goodness.

596
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:11,650
Your Royal Highness.

597
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,558
Is everyone ready?

598
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:27,400
I picked out only those I can trust. They are on standby now.

599
00:45:27,559 --> 00:45:30,530
He hid there once in the past, so he is already familiar with the place.

600
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,369
Also, it will be convenient to contact Prince Dosung from there.

601
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:37,210
I cannot think of...

602
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,269
a better hiding place.

603
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,710
I agree.

604
00:45:42,849 --> 00:45:44,610
It is a kisaeng house, not an ordinary residence.

605
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,780
There will be many eyes watching,

606
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,179
so move as discreetly as possible.

607
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:50,849
I will heed your advice.

608
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,699
Excuse me. That young lady...

609
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:05,400
who comes here to treat those who are injured or ill.

610
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:07,738
Is she not here today?

611
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:09,510
- Who... - Well, you know...

612
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,809
Oh, her.

613
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:15,739
No, I have not seen her for the past few days.

614
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:17,749
Then do you happen to know where she lives...

615
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:20,880
No, I mean... Do you know where I can go to meet her?

616
00:46:20,949 --> 00:46:22,719
How would I know?

617
00:46:25,489 --> 00:46:27,389
It is about time she paid another visit,

618
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,159
so come back tomorrow if you must meet her.

619
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:31,860
Gosh.

620
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:33,500
Oh, boy.

621
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:44,010
Do not go this way. Go this way.

622
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:45,769
The rest of you...

623
00:46:45,809 --> 00:46:46,840
That man is...

624
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,579
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

625
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:17,739
(I do not know where I am headed...)

626
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:42,260
(From your unfilial daughter, Myung Yoon)

627
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,158
Oh Wol, you got enough sleep.

628
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:09,289
Wake up already.

629
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,530
I was not asleep.

630
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:21,469
I am sorry for waking you up.

631
00:48:23,909 --> 00:48:25,909
Get changed quickly and go back to sleep.

632
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:31,250
My lady, what are you planning to do this time?

633
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:34,750
I am running away.

634
00:48:36,449 --> 00:48:37,489
"Running away?"

635
00:48:50,829 --> 00:48:53,940
For a month until the Crown Princess selection process is over.

636
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:55,969
I will go hide somewhere just for a month.

637
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,539
Even so, you cannot run away from home.

638
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:01,739
Why must you do this to me?

639
00:49:03,579 --> 00:49:04,650
I am sorry.

640
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:06,449
Oh Wol, the thing is,

641
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:10,289
once they prohibit marriages and begin the selection process,

642
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:13,289
I may have no choice but to obey Father.

643
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,630
I will be locked up in this room...

644
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:18,690
and will be dragged to the palace eventually.

645
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,929
It is not like you are the type to let anyone force you into marriage.

646
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,169
You would rather bite your own tongue and die...

647
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,869
than let someone force you into marriage.

648
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,070
Right, that is true.

649
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:33,038
Then I shall just stay here...

650
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:36,138
and bite my tongue and die when I am told to marry the Crown Prince...

651
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,179
Gosh.

652
00:49:39,949 --> 00:49:41,320
Okay, fine.

653
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:44,219
But I am coming with you.

654
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:47,159
We cannot be apart for a month.

655
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:50,230
You cannot last a day without me.

656
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:54,260
Well, that is not really true,

657
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,629
but I will let you know right away as soon as I get there.

658
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:01,038
No, we must go together now.

659
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:02,070
No.

660
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,408
I need you to buy me some time...

661
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:06,070
for me to sneak out safely.

662
00:50:07,179 --> 00:50:08,780
Then you have to let me know.

663
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,510
If you do not, I will tell Lord Choi everything...

664
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,480
and look for you.

665
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:18,219
All right. We must hurry.

666
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,960
I must leave before Father returns.

667
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:28,159
I understand the Queen Dowager is anxious,

668
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,630
but the issue of finding the Crown Prince...

669
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,900
is now out of our hands. There is nothing we can do.

670
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:36,340
My gosh.

671
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,809
I thought you had left for the day.

672
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:41,440
I guess you came back because of the deposed Crown Prince.

673
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,420
I must say, you do not look so well.

674
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:54,559
If the Queen Dowager sees you, she will be concerned.

675
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:57,760
I suggest you take some herbal medicine.

676
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:00,329
Yes.

677
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,059
Thank you for your concern.

678
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:07,599
While making mine, I shall make you an herbal decoction too.

679
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,639
Magistrate Yoon, we need you to stay healthy...

680
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:13,110
so that you can continue...

681
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:15,380
to give Prince Dosung the support he needs.

682
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,449
Yes.

683
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:23,489
I shall be leaving, then.

684
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:05,829
You must not tell anyone...

685
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,630
that my young master is here.

686
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:09,599
Do you understand?

687
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:29,849
What? Why is he sneaking into my house?

688
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,449
If he enters through here, he will reach the main garden.

689
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:35,760
Is he here to see me?

690
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:38,889
No way.

691
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,099
He does not know who I am.

692
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:43,900
Then what brings him to my place?

693
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,030
Who is it?

694
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,369
Are you a ghost?

695
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:34,519
What should I do?

696
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,519
If I go back in now, I may not be able to leave again.

697
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:42,619
Yes.

698
00:53:45,389 --> 00:53:47,800
Help!

699
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,698
- Help me! - Please be quiet.

700
00:53:50,699 --> 00:53:52,599
Help!

701
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:55,500
Put me down! Let me go!

702
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:03,409
My gosh. Is that Oh Wol?

703
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:45,789
Darn it.

704
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,699
Have you lost your mind?

705
00:54:57,829 --> 00:54:59,929
How could you do this unless you have completely lost your mind?

706
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,400
- Please hear me out first... - Be quiet.

707
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:05,538
Take her home at once.

708
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:07,539
We do not know what else he would do.

709
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,149
Just in case he does something else,

710
00:55:10,150 --> 00:55:13,110
we need a weapon so that we can fight him.

711
00:55:14,449 --> 00:55:15,920
So, is this the "weapon" you thought of?

712
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:19,920
Kidnapping an innocent woman and using her?

713
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:22,019
She is not innocent...

714
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:23,760
for she is our enemy's daughter.

715
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:28,459
I told you to take her home at once. Must you keep listing excuses?

716
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,960
It is not like I wanted to do this.

717
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,570
This is the only way we can leave unscathed.

718
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,709
If we are holding his daughter hostage,

719
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:38,739
- they cannot hurt us... - Like I said, we cannot do this!

720
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:44,980
I cannot allow such a despicable act.

721
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:47,650
Do as I say.

722
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:49,980
I refuse.

723
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,150
What did you say?

724
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,420
Even you...

725
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,559
are looking down on me because of my current situation?

726
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,559
I do not care what you say. I cannot do it.

727
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:02,929
It is my duty to protect you, and I ought to do my job,

728
00:56:03,969 --> 00:56:06,329
so please let me have my way this time.

729
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:10,739
- Open the sack. - Not right now.

730
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:14,739
I will let her go once we pass the fortress gates safe and sound.

731
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,010
Is that so? Then I will do it myself.

732
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:25,619
- Step aside. - I cannot.

733
00:56:28,519 --> 00:56:29,559
Please do not do this.

734
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,090
No!

735
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,530
Move aside.

736
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:37,598
- I carried her all the way here. - Help!

737
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:38,699
Do not do this.

738
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:53,550
Goodness. What is it? You scared me...

739
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:55,749
- Hey, Missy. - Come out.

740
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,019
I must keep the momentum going.

741
00:56:58,119 --> 00:56:59,489
Do you need another beating?

742
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:00,820
It is urgent.

743
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,230
Are I not like her slave, at this rate?

744
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:15,340
Hey, go that way.

745
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:25,849
Go that way. You go this way.

746
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:41,730
- Let go. - Why are you being like this?

747
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:43,530
- Let go. - I cannot.

748
00:57:44,469 --> 00:57:46,800
Seriously, you cannot do this.

749
00:57:47,099 --> 00:57:49,239
Hurry! Find them!

750
00:57:49,369 --> 00:57:50,539
- Let go. - No.

751
00:57:55,579 --> 00:57:56,949
Who are those men?

752
00:58:00,449 --> 00:58:02,219
Did you think you could get away with kidnapping someone?

753
00:58:04,349 --> 00:58:05,619
Hey, that must be it. Go and check.

754
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:06,820
Yes, sir.

755
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,888
- Oh, no. - Gosh, what was that?

756
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:13,059
Hey, get them.

757
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:47,400
Gosh, where did they take her?

758
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:13,519
Goodness. What the...

759
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:27,599
You little...

760
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,379
Hey, let us go.

761
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,979
Come on! We are leaving. Come along, quick.

762
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,679
- Hey. - Get up. Hurry.

763
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,389
Hey, we cannot beat them. Hurry!

764
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:48,618
- Hey, come on. - Gosh, my back.

765
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:50,489
- Darn it. - Be quiet.

766
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:54,030
I think they were a gang of bandits.

767
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:56,860
I will step out and take a look around just in case.

768
01:00:06,809 --> 01:00:07,840
Calm down.

769
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:19,989
My lady!

770
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,730
You are Baek Gu.

771
01:00:35,239 --> 01:00:36,369
The lady you serve is...

772
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:43,710
So, are you...

773
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:46,679
Royal Physician Choi's servant?

774
01:01:31,659 --> 01:01:33,289
(Missing Crown Prince)

775
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,229
We lost the Crown Prince...

776
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:37,099
near the Yeonhwabang around the Jongmyo Shrine.

777
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:39,799
I have an idea that may help you...

778
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,599
pass through the fortress gates without getting caught.

779
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:43,940
The deposed Crown Prince and I are enemies now.

780
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:47,538
If Myung Yoon is seen with the deposed Crown Prince,

781
01:01:47,539 --> 01:01:50,340
everything will go down the drain.

782
01:01:50,679 --> 01:01:52,649
Postpone the Crown Prince's investiture?

783
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:55,619
Are you suggesting we forge the royal seal and the national seal?

784
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:58,619
I will protect you, no matter what.

785
01:01:58,719 --> 01:01:59,949
So stay with me.
