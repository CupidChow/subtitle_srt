00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,438
(All characters, locations, organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:02,909
(in this drama are historically irrelevant and fictitious.)

3
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:03,910
(Production guidelines were strictly followed...)

4
00:00:03,911 --> 00:00:04,980
(when filming with children and animals.)

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,689
(Ilgyeong: The 10 hours from 7pm to 5am were divided into 5 watches.)

6
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:24,160
("Ilgyeong" refers to the 1st watch of the night, from 7 to 9pm.)

7
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:41,079
(Episode 1)

8
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:30,329
Do you still feel tightness in the chest, Your Highness?

9
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,099
I had started feeling better after taking the medicine you gave me,

10
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,769
but the same symptoms returned sometime in the evening.

11
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:44,680
It could be caused by the turbulent weather,

12
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,579
so please try to relax and put your mind at ease, Your Highness.

13
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:50,719
I will do so.

14
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:53,689
Are there any other symptoms?

15
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:56,689
No. I feel fine otherwise, thanks to you.

16
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:58,790
I am much obliged, Your Highness.

17
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,730
Then I will now go and make an herbal decoction for Your Highness.

18
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,449
(Queen Dowager Sosu)

19
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:12,360
(Haejong, the current King)

20
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,900
Your Majesty.

21
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:20,169
What are you doing out here?

22
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:22,610
I was feeling anxious for some reason,

23
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,409
so I came out to get some fresh air.

24
00:03:25,979 --> 00:03:29,509
Anyway, how is the Queen Dowager?

25
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:31,479
Her pulse is on the rapid side,

26
00:03:31,949 --> 00:03:33,549
but you need not be concerned.

27
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,650
I am relieved to hear that.

28
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:38,219
Your Majesty.

29
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,090
What is the matter?

30
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,430
I have bad news. A group of rebels has invaded the palace.

31
00:03:45,129 --> 00:03:46,500
Is the situation urgent?

32
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,968
We are under attack. Also, I believe...

33
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:51,099
some of the palace guards on duty were in on it.

34
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,400
You should go inside now and take shelter.

35
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,730
(Gangnyeongjeon)

36
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,740
(Gangnyeongjeon)

37
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,420
Hurry. The palace guards will be here in no time.

38
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,509
See you on the other side.

39
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,290
Come on.

40
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,199
The soldiers will arrive any moment now.

41
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,100
If you wish to be spared, put down your sword and beg for your life.

42
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,540
I did not come here,

43
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:35,939
expecting to walk out of here in one piece, Joong Young.

44
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:37,980
Identify yourself!

45
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,250
You are...

46
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,349
He led the deposed king's Royal Guards.

47
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,319
(Pyeju: A deposed king)

48
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,128
I heard you died while fleeing with the deposed king.

49
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:58,259
I was resurrected to slay you scoundrels who stole the throne...

50
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:03,529
and you, the ultimate traitor.

51
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,870
Shut your mouth.

52
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,338
The deposed king you served...

53
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:07,969
kicked out his mother and killed his own sibling.

54
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,609
Addicted to carnal pleasures, he extorted from his own people.

55
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,180
He was a foolish tyrant.

56
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,749
Do you not know that?

57
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,180
Shut your mouth at once!

58
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,550
Whatever excuses you make,

59
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:20,689
it does not change the fact that you are traitors who stole the throne.

60
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,759
Now, you will pay for it.

61
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,959
Die.

62
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,829
The royal physician is hurt. Go and fetch a physician at once.

63
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,169
Your Majesty, you should...

64
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,329
I am fine. Go and fetch a physician.

65
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,639
Now!

66
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:47,839
Your Majesty.

67
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,339
You need not worry about me.

68
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:53,480
The East Palace. Send someone to the East Palace at once...

69
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,279
and make sure the Crown Prince is safe.

70
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,149
Commander of the Royal Guards, go to the East Palace...

71
00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:02,819
and make sure the Crown Prince is okay.

72
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,389
Your Royal Highness!

73
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,859
- Where is the Crown Prince? - What is the matter?

74
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,459
Is the Crown Prince inside?

75
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes, he is. What is the matter?

76
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,970
Your Royal Highness!

77
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,110
His Royal Highness is asleep. Please leave.

78
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,080
Your Royal Highness.

79
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,349
He is fast asleep at the moment,

80
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,649
so I suggest you come back in the morning.

81
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,109
You are the Crown Prince's secretary and bodyguard.

82
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,440
(Sejagungbyeolgam: Crown Prince's secretary and bodyguard)

83
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,350
Why are you here?

84
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,620
Where is His Royal Highness?

85
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,249
Tell me the truth at once!

86
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,350
Well...

87
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:11,889
The thing is...

88
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,860
"A scholar from the countryside who was in town for the state exam..."

89
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:18,500
"was wondering around in Gurigae in the middle of the night..."

90
00:09:19,029 --> 00:09:21,369
"after having a drink with a friend of his."

91
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,428
(Gurigae: Near Euljiro in Seoul in present days)

92
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:26,599
"All of a sudden, four men showed up and started pummeling him."

93
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,038
("Collection of Folktales")

94
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,209
- How scary. - My gosh.

95
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,679
Then they threw him into a sack and said,

96
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,679
"Say one more word, and we will beat you to death!"

97
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,319
- Goodness. - Gosh, that is scary.

98
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,389
- They threatened him like that. - They threatened him.

99
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,418
- Those scoundrels. - Oh, dear.

100
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,089
(Then they started running, with the scholar on their shoulders.)

101
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,490
"Then they started running, with the scholar on their shoulders."

102
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,100
"The dumbfounded scholar had no idea where they were taking him."

103
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:57,230
Oh, boy. They kidnapped him.

104
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,969
- Goodness. Be quiet, will you? - Be quiet!

105
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,508
- My gosh. - Goodness gracious.

106
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:03,809
- So? - All right, focus.

107
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,580
"After running like that for a while, they let him out."

108
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:09,609
"When he came out of the sack,"

109
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,350
"he saw a fancy mansion before his eyes."

110
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,418
Then he entered the room...

111
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:16,919
and saw a beautiful lady wearing nothing but her undergarments!

112
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,089
- Oh, my! - My goodness.

113
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:23,230
The rest of the story is in this book.

114
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,829
- What? - If you are curious,

115
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,158
- What is he saying? - come and buy a copy.

116
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:28,099
- Hey! - Come on!

117
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,669
- You cannot do this. - We have to buy it?

118
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,798
- How petty. - Gosh.

119
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,070
- Hey, how could you do this? - You are so mean!

120
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:40,439
("Collection of Folktales")

121
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,549
I will take a hundred copies.

122
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,250
Meet me at midnight...

123
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,590
at the pavilion in Namsangol.

124
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,059
I have one question though.

125
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:54,690
What happens to the scholar?

126
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,529
Does he sleep with that beautiful woman?

127
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:58,629
I bet he does. Am I right?

128
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,129
I see. So he sleeps with her.

129
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:04,600
What?

130
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,970
This way.

131
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,419
One moment.

132
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,500
Say hello.

133
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,969
This is the hidden son of His Majesty, who was unfairly...

134
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:37,899
banished after being forced out of the throne by the traitors.

135
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,470
Prince Haesung.

136
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:07,000
I heard you came from Jeolla Province.

137
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,370
- Yes, my lord. - I am glad you are here.

138
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,700
He must have told you all the details already,

139
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,269
so I shall get straight to the point.

140
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,509
If you help me raise military funds...

141
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,740
to assist me in starting my own army,

142
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,610
you can live a life filled with wealth and prosperity...

143
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:25,980
alongside me, as soon as I reclaim the throne.

144
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,990
Military funds? How much would you need?

145
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:30,220
Would a thousand nyang do?

146
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
A thousand nyang?

147
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:37,659
What is the matter? Is it too little?

148
00:12:40,929 --> 00:12:43,669
It is not a small amount of money, but the more, the better.

149
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,039
Then...

150
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,870
how about 10,000 nyang?

151
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,809
We should have met sooner.

152
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:55,879
Your loyalty will surely go down in history.

153
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:57,779
We are much obliged, my lord.

154
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:01,590
By the way, where is the money? Did you bring the money?

155
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:03,419
Well...

156
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,360
I left it at the place where I am staying.

157
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,529
Let us go there now. Where are you staying?

158
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:13,928
Maybe not today. I can bring it to you tomorrow.

159
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:15,029
No.

160
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,399
I must save my father as soon as possible.

161
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,110
With that money, I can raise an army right away...

162
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,639
and take down those traitors who stole the throne from my father...

163
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,649
What are you doing?

164
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,789
- Gun. - What?

165
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:40,720
This scoundrel dared to call Father a traitor.

166
00:13:41,889 --> 00:13:44,200
As his son, how could I stand back and do nothing?

167
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,399
My gosh. You and your temper.

168
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:48,830
Even so, how could you punch him?

169
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,798
We should have coaxed them into telling us who is behind them.

170
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,470
Do you actually think these rats are planning a coup?

171
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:55,440
Can you not tell?

172
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:59,710
They are just swindlers who steal money from the pockets...

173
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:02,480
of clueless wealthy people in the countryside.

174
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,450
Am I wrong?

175
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,279
Who are you?

176
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:14,159
I am none other than...

177
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:19,600
the Crown Prince of Joseon.

178
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,729
- Oh, my. He is the Crown Prince. - Gosh. Crown Prince?

179
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:23,699
- I have never seen him before. - Why is he so handsome?

180
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,799
(Lee Gun, Crown Prince)

181
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,639
Such insolence.

182
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:29,039
You had better beg for forgiveness at once.

183
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,980
How dare you lie that you are a royal and speak of a coup?

184
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,779
You deserve to die a hundred times.

185
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:36,080
- What shall we do? - What do you want to do?

186
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,350
The thing is, we have to fight them anyway.

187
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:41,950
- Then I will take the guy in green. - I will take the one in pink.

188
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,620
We will throw a punch on the count of three.

189
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,960
- One, two... - One, two...

190
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,230
- Oh, boy. - Goodness.

191
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,899
Darn it. He is a good fighter.

192
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,500
You drive me nuts.

193
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,809
- Please calm down. - I am hurt.

194
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:18,720
- Hey, go and fight. - No, you first.

195
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,190
- Darn you! - Get out of my way.

196
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,500
Why, you little...

197
00:15:27,799 --> 00:15:28,870
What the...

198
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,779
Get him.

199
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,590
Nice, I actually punched him. I did it.

200
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,820
Hey, Dosung. Your brother is dying here.

201
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,340
I must say, I did not expect you to be such a good fighter.

202
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:07,669
My gosh. Had we actually gotten into a fight...

203
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,768
Who knows what would have happened?

204
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:12,008
Hey, you are dead meat now. I did not hit you.

205
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:13,778
- Your Royal Highness. - I really did not hit you.

206
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:15,610
All I did was push your face a little. That is all.

207
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,250
Hey, you hit him. I did not hit you at all.

208
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,690
Hand them over to the Police Bureau.

209
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:22,789
Yes, Your Highness.

210
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,119
Your Highness, please have worthy on us!

211
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,329
"Mercy," not "worthy."

212
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,229
Please have mercy on us!

213
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,299
Hey, seriously.

214
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,730
What are you waiting for? Take them.

215
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:35,928
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

216
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:38,668
Your Highness, please take our lives!

217
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:39,969
Hey, I do not want to die.

218
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,439
Hey, I am just saying.

219
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,539
- What if he really kills us? - No, he will not kill us.

220
00:16:50,679 --> 00:16:52,279
You said you were sure they were planning a coup.

221
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,950
But we caught those swindlers, regardless.

222
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:57,990
Fine. I am very proud of you, my dear brother.

223
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,888
(Prince Dosung, Crown Prince's half-brother)

224
00:17:00,889 --> 00:17:03,289
Fine, I admit I made a mistake this time.

225
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,558
Rumor has it that some are hiding...

226
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,799
in the slums just outside the South Gates,

227
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:08,569
so we should search that area.

228
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:11,699
Like I said, I admit I made a mistake this time.

229
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,869
I did not say anything.

230
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:15,740
We should get going too.

231
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:18,140
You will return to the palace looking like that?

232
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,079
What is wrong with the way I look?

233
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,649
Oh, my! Very nice.

234
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:27,279
My gosh! How nice is this?

235
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:28,890
My goodness.

236
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:32,119
Have you lost your mind?

237
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,589
I know that you like to have fun,

238
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,759
but did we have to come to a kisaeng house in this situation?

239
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,930
We are here because of the situation we are in now.

240
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,730
I brought you here because I have a plan,

241
00:17:42,099 --> 00:17:43,670
so just follow me quietly.

242
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:53,279
Do you truly mean it?

243
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,380
- Yes. - Must I do this?

244
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,950
Is this the only option we have, brother?

245
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,420
Yes. There is no other option, brother.

246
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:10,559
Even so, I am not a clown. I have to wear makeup?

247
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,559
Then what? Will you return to the palace looking like that?

248
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:17,430
If Father and Mother see you, they will faint.

249
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:20,339
Also, if they ask you what happened,

250
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,940
what will you say?

251
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:23,869
If you tell them the truth,

252
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,210
you will never be allowed to leave the palace again.

253
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:30,150
Fine, do whatever you want.

254
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:33,849
Okay, fine.

255
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,250
Here, go ahead and put it on my face.

256
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
Goodness.

257
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,900
You should have dodged.

258
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:51,069
I cannot believe you let those rats punch you.

259
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:56,109
What on earth happened that you have lost your nimbleness?

260
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,538
Try letting those teachers at the Tutorial Office lecture you...

261
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:01,279
from sunrise to sundown until you get blisters on your buttocks.

262
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,980
You will end up like me too.

263
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:05,279
It is not like you do everything you are told to do.

264
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:08,788
You could be smart about it like you were at the Royal Family School.

265
00:19:08,789 --> 00:19:10,119
I want to,

266
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,858
but they keep talking about the Royal House, the country,

267
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:15,358
and the safety of Joseon.

268
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,390
(Jongmyosajik: The Royal House and the country)

269
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:18,299
How could I be smart about it?

270
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,268
It is not easy being a crown prince.

271
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:23,599
My point, exactly.

272
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,200
Despite that,

273
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:27,740
I have never once you heard you say you want to quit.

274
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,309
If I suffer a little,

275
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,880
the people of Joseon can live more comfortably,

276
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:35,450
so how could I quit?

277
00:19:39,849 --> 00:19:42,220
You little... I am your elder brother.

278
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,449
I did not say anything.

279
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,859
The way you were looking at me just now...

280
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,160
Whatever, forget it.

281
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,059
Anyway, this is enough, is it not?

282
00:19:52,599 --> 00:19:53,660
Stop.

283
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,328
It is too heavily scented.

284
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:57,069
Stay still, will you?

285
00:19:57,269 --> 00:19:59,339
If we want to return to the palace before they wake up,

286
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:00,970
we must hurry.

287
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:06,980
Be gentle, okay?

288
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,549
I have not even touched your bruise yet.

289
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:10,809
Goodness. You are such a crybaby.

290
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,990
(Yoon Yi Kyum, Left State Councilor)

291
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:23,690
I hear the Crown Prince is nowhere to be found.

292
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,529
Based on what the Crown Prince's secretary has told me,

293
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,900
I believe he went out in disguise.

294
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:29,569
He went out in disguise?

295
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:31,869
You mean, he left the palace?

296
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:37,369
I understand that he is still immature,

297
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,740
but at this critical time...

298
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,809
He must understand the weight of the crown.

299
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,980
I am gravely concerned.

300
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,990
Such insolence. Watch what you say.

301
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:53,420
The Crown Prince is thoughtful enough.

302
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,690
If he is thoughtful,

303
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:59,558
he should never secretly sneak out of the palace in disguise.

304
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,170
That is not important now.

305
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:03,500
Magistrate.

306
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,240
Are you not worried about the safety of the Crown Prince?

307
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:07,970
What?

308
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,069
Clearly, I am saying this out of concern.

309
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,309
We do not have time for this.

310
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,150
We ought to send out the soldiers at once...

311
00:21:17,579 --> 00:21:19,549
and find His Royal Highness.

312
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:24,420
His Royal Highness has returned.

313
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,029
There was an incident last night.

314
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:35,730
Do you know about it?

315
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,500
Yes.

316
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:41,710
Then you must also know how many people...

317
00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:45,640
were worried and anxious because of you.

318
00:21:46,109 --> 00:21:50,309
I deeply apologize for causing you concern, Father.

319
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:57,419
Why did you sneak out in disguise without even telling me?

320
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,420
(Jamhaeng: Going out in disguise)

321
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:01,490
I was curious about the lives of the people.

322
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,489
To assess public sentiment...

323
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,829
You have got to be kidding me!

324
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:21,809
Was that the only reason?

325
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:23,549
Yes.

326
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,789
What is this scent?

327
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:39,528
I smell makeup. Do you not?

328
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:40,700
(Jibun: Makeup)

329
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,779
Oh, my apologies.

330
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,509
It is not makeup.

331
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,349
My perfume pouch broke.

332
00:22:58,819 --> 00:23:00,750
It must be what you are smelling.

333
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,558
The Queen Dowager...

334
00:23:09,559 --> 00:23:12,460
stayed up all night, waiting for you.

335
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,230
Follow me at once.

336
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,470
Yes, Your Majesty.

337
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,750
At this critical time,

338
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:33,919
he dared to sneak out in secret...

339
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,420
to spend the night with a woman?

340
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:38,089
Is it because he has the Namin Faction's blood in him?

341
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:41,359
I am concerned about the safety and the future of our country.

342
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:43,430
So am I.

343
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:44,829
However,

344
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,400
it is not like we can install someone else as Crown Prince.

345
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,269
If it is necessary,

346
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,700
it must be done.

347
00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:00,539
We have Prince Dosung, the Queen's son.

348
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,308
(Yoon Yi Kyum, Prince Dosung's maternal grandfather)

349
00:24:04,309 --> 00:24:05,819
My goodness.

350
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,680
That is enough. Let us go.

351
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,990
At the moment, our priority is to take care of the traitors.

352
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:15,490
We are all concerned, you see.

353
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,660
Come along.

354
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,410
Where were you all night? What did you do?

355
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,750
Tell me.

356
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,880
I went to see Dosung.

357
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,249
Dosung?

358
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,750
Why did you have to see him, all of a sudden?

359
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,819
I felt bad, knowing he lives alone outside the palace walls,

360
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:50,729
and I wanted to see how he was doing.

361
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,799
(Queen, Prince Dosung's mother)

362
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,269
The two brothers are very close.

363
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,299
It truly is nice to see, Your Majesty.

364
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:01,339
They are too close.

365
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:03,710
I think they even went to a kisaeng house together.

366
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,079
Pardon me?

367
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,980
Crown Prince, is that true?

368
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:09,779
We went there because...

369
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:12,920
If you tell them the truth,

370
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:15,450
you will never be allowed to leave the palace again.

371
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:19,890
I am sorry.

372
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,028
So you sneaked out in disguise...

373
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:23,859
to spend time with girls?

374
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,660
Do you take your responsibilities as the Crown Prince that lightly?

375
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,829
Shall I crown Prince Dosung instead of you?

376
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:32,970
Your Majesty, you are being too harsh.

377
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,940
Calm down and talk to him instead of flying into a rage.

378
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,809
He used to live freely outside the palace walls, so I bet...

379
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,579
he has been feeling trapped and frustrated.

380
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,250
I am certain that he will not do it again.

381
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,420
You always defend and coddle him like this.

382
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,518
No wonder he cannot get his act together.

383
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:52,960
His behavior is out of control.

384
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,358
He is the Crown Prince of Joseon.

385
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:56,629
(Gukbon: Crown Prince)

386
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,059
Please treat him with kindness.

387
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:03,930
The rebels who support the deposed king...

388
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,400
are vying for the chance to overthrow His Majesty.

389
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:10,710
You must not leave the palace on your own again.

390
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,109
Do you understand?

391
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,740
Yes, Your Highness.

392
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,579
From now on,

393
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:19,180
I will always seek Father's permission first.

394
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,950
What did you say?

395
00:26:21,349 --> 00:26:23,789
Clearly, you have not learned your lesson yet.

396
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:27,190
Why? Do you wish to visit the kisaeng house again?

397
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,490
That is not the reason.

398
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:30,089
Shut your mouth!

399
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,869
How about we marry him off?

400
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:39,739
If he has a reason to stay in the palace,

401
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,509
he will not sneak out to wander around.

402
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,109
Then by any chance,

403
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,609
is there a family you wish to marry him off to?

404
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:50,279
Yes, there is.

405
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,150
You must be thinking of Royal Physician Choi Sang Rok.

406
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,779
Correct.

407
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,519
Your Majesty, if it were not for him,

408
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,920
you could have gotten hurt last night.

409
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,160
Correct.

410
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:05,799
I have always been aware of his deep loyalty,

411
00:27:06,259 --> 00:27:07,500
but he is not a military official.

412
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:10,529
I did not know he would get stabbed to keep His Majesty safe.

413
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,670
It is a subject's duty to protect his king.

414
00:27:14,069 --> 00:27:16,170
The problem is that they all expect to be compensated...

415
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:17,940
for merely doing their duty.

416
00:27:19,109 --> 00:27:21,308
However, Royal Physician Choi made the greatest contribution...

417
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:23,650
out of everyone in the Restoration Group,

418
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:27,220
yet he is still working faithfully as a royal physician.

419
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,750
I believe he is the only one...

420
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:31,119
in the Restoration Group who is not greedy...

421
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:33,720
for money or power.

422
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:38,160
It seems like the Queen and I are in agreement.

423
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:41,259
What do you think, Your Majesty?

424
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:44,900
Knowing that he is a man of high integrity,

425
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,639
we will not need to worry about his family...

426
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,640
trying to control the Crown Prince even after he ascends the throne,

427
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:53,440
so I think it is the best choice we can make.

428
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,049
Then now that the three of us are in agreement,

429
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,719
we should soon issue a decree regarding...

430
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,880
the appointment of the Crown Princess.

431
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,318
Yes.

432
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:05,160
I will discuss the matter with the ministers and decide on the date.

433
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
Sorry to interrupt.

434
00:28:08,529 --> 00:28:09,630
Do you not wish to hear...

435
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:12,160
my opinion on the matter?

436
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:13,799
I told you to shut your mouth.

437
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:15,869
Yes, Your Majesty.

438
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:19,400
Royal Physician Choi's daughter is very beautiful and elegant.

439
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:21,268
Even before she reached the marriageable age,

440
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:23,210
there were so many families eyeing her.

441
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,910
I hear matchmakers keep visiting her.

442
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,019
Dream on. You are being ridiculous.

443
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:35,618
Stop talking such ridiculous nonsense.

444
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:37,720
Hey! What nonsense?

445
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,358
Now that you have seen my bare skin,

446
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:42,758
you must take care of me. Am I wrong?

447
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:43,789
Shut it.

448
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,729
Clench your teeth.

449
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,799
- Why? - All right.

450
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,940
Be gentle!

451
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:54,399
Do not be such a crybaby!

452
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,209
I told you not to drink because it could fester.

453
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,210
My goodness.

454
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,079
Come on.

455
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,680
I must drink, or there would be nothing to look forward to!

456
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,880
Why?

457
00:29:04,349 --> 00:29:06,150
Will you marry me if I quit drinking?

458
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:09,819
Forget it. As if I can expect a dog to never poop again.

459
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,190
My lady, please.

460
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,720
People can hear you.

461
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:17,390
It is okay. They all know already anyway.

462
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,529
They would not even believe it if I tried to act like a lady now.

463
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,430
This is done. Next!

464
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,129
Missy!

465
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,670
Gae Ttong, what is it?

466
00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:28,508
They are back. They are trying to take my father.

467
00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:31,109
What? Those scoundrels. I shall teach them a lesson.

468
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,910
- Come along. - What?

469
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,450
Wait up, my lady!

470
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,778
My gosh.

471
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:40,250
I promised my wife that I would never gamble again.

472
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:41,950
Please let me go.

473
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,848
Just one more game, okay?

474
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:45,319
It is a big game.

475
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:47,088
Look.

476
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:49,789
Why do you think I had to cut off my own finger?

477
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:51,660
Please let me go.

478
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:54,930
Hey, your left hand is fine.

479
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:57,368
Just play one game with us, okay?

480
00:29:57,369 --> 00:29:58,900
I will make sure you can win big.

481
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:00,269
- Pardon me? - Hey!

482
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:02,369
- "Hey?" - Goodness.

483
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,910
This is not the clinic.

484
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:10,809
I told you never to show up again.

485
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:12,449
Are your ears plugged?

486
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,379
Did you not hear what I said?

487
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,890
My lady, calm down and talk it out.

488
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,490
- Gosh. - Hey.

489
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,660
Here we go again.

490
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,629
- Come at me. - Hey, teach her a lesson.

491
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,960
- Bring it on. - Whack her.

492
00:30:35,569 --> 00:30:36,970
- You little... - Gosh!

493
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:47,250
Darn it.

494
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:10,339
Why, you little...

495
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,480
Hey, you piece of...

496
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:24,450
- Hey, let us go. - Okay.

497
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:32,729
- You rats. - Father!

498
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,799
Gosh, my child.

499
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,599
You had better not show up again.

500
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:41,099
What?

501
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,339
It is not like you can come here every day to guard them.

502
00:31:44,609 --> 00:31:46,039
They will come back again, you know.

503
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,380
So what is the point?

504
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,920
Father.

505
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,190
Father...

506
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:02,789
Gosh, that darned wench.

507
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:04,890
She always has to punch me in the same spot.

508
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:07,160
Next time,

509
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,599
I will gouge her eyes out.

510
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:11,670
What did you say about my eyes?

511
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:13,140
Goodness.

512
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:15,440
What now?

513
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,410
Come out.

514
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,109
Gosh, I just got here.

515
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,150
Come out, where?

516
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:37,288
If you guys pass out before I do,

517
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,960
you must stop bothering Gae Ttong's father.

518
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,798
But if I lose,

519
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,730
I will not care what you do to Gae Ttong's father.

520
00:32:44,269 --> 00:32:45,599
- Understood? - "You guys?"

521
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:47,440
Not just me?

522
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:49,809
You want to go up against all of us here?

523
00:32:50,609 --> 00:32:51,910
Have you lost your mind?

524
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,740
If you are intimidated, go drop dead.

525
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,950
I am a little intimidated, but I do not want to drop dead.

526
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,549
Where did you learn to talk like that?

527
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
Fine.

528
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:05,019
Let us do this.

529
00:33:21,069 --> 00:33:22,140
Nice.

530
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:36,690
My goodness.

531
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,000
- What are you staring at? - You are so small.

532
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,339
And yet, you can hold your liquor.

533
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:28,039
Quit talking nonsense, and drink.

534
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:29,968
- I lost. - What?

535
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:31,110
I lost, all right?

536
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,309
From now on,

537
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:35,309
I will call you missy.

538
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:36,849
"Missy," my foot.

539
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,549
Others will point fingers at you for calling me that.

540
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,719
Who cares?

541
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:43,349
You are better at fighting and drinking than me.

542
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,719
That makes you missy.

543
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:47,159
Am I not right, guys?

544
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,519
Altogether.

545
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,860
- Missy. - Missy.

546
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,360
- Missy. - Missy.

547
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,170
- Missy. - Missy.

548
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:58,369
Fine.

549
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,099
Then, everyone...

550
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,269
is to stick their heads on the ground.

551
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,780
- Right now? - No, scratch that.

552
00:35:08,309 --> 00:35:09,848
Pour me a glass, will you?

553
00:35:09,849 --> 00:35:12,449
Come now. Stop, my lady.

554
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:14,550
You are already drunk.

555
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,920
Do not worry, Oh Wol.

556
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:18,960
I am not one bit drunk.

557
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:23,289
What will she do if the lord finds out?

558
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,059
- Gosh, seriously. - Gosh.

559
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,550
Is it that bad?

560
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:44,879
Your daughter Myung Yoon...

561
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,719
was born to bring catastrophe and become a widow.

562
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,319
Other bad events can be prevented by exorcism.

563
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,218
But the so-called widow's fate,

564
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:58,030
one that gets her husband killed, cannot be avoided.

565
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,230
If Myung Yoon marries His Royal Highness as is,

566
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:06,839
His Royal Highness will die early,

567
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,239
and Myung Yoon will become a young widow.

568
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:12,579
Is there no way out of it?

569
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:18,549
There is one way.

570
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:21,420
But I wonder if you can execute it.

571
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:23,650
What is it that I must do?

572
00:36:24,389 --> 00:36:27,189
There is a possibility everything you have achieved until now...

573
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,059
can go down altogether.

574
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,960
Will you be okay with it?

575
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:38,400
Because I did not listen to your words,

576
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,309
my life was a fiery pit.

577
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:44,809
I do not wish...

578
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,510
to live another life filled with regret.

579
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:52,250
Please tell me.

580
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,090
- Goodness. - Oh, no.

581
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,260
Wait.

582
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:10,130
Good grief.

583
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,630
What? Did she sober up already?

584
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:45,170
Good gracious.

585
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,539
Sober up, my foot.

586
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,340
Even so, my lady,

587
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,340
you are indeed amazing.

588
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:00,078
I am not drunk at all, you hear me?

589
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,719
I got it, so can you get up?

590
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:04,789
You should wash your feet before bed.

591
00:38:05,789 --> 00:38:06,820
My feet?

592
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:09,030
I should wash them.

593
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:13,400
Let us wash them before going to sleep.

594
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,630
Gosh.

595
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,130
What? Oh Wol.

596
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,570
- Yes? - Oh Wol...

597
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:21,699
What is it?

598
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,769
My feet are nowhere to be seen.

599
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:26,179
Where are my...

600
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:29,150
Where are my feet? I wonder where they are.

601
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:35,219
Take off your socks, and you will find your feet.

602
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,150
So here they are.

603
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,719
Good grief.

604
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:44,530
Gosh.

605
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:49,130
I am thirsty, Oh Wol.

606
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:50,928
I am about to die from thirst.

607
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:53,339
All right, I will bring some water shortly.

608
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,739
But this, too, is water.

609
00:38:56,269 --> 00:38:57,840
- Do not drink it. - All right.

610
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,210
Seriously...

611
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,309
Wait.

612
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,380
Wait a bit, Myung Yoon.

613
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,949
Wait. Wait for her, Myung Yoon.

614
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,960
My lady!

615
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,030
This is bad, my lady!

616
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,698
His lord is looking for you.

617
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:24,369
- My father? - Yes.

618
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:25,500
What now?

619
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,469
Do I look drunk?

620
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,539
Your face is...

621
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,238
Is it as red as a tomato?

622
00:39:31,239 --> 00:39:33,610
It is as red as a tomato and redder than the reddest.

623
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,349
What will you do, my lady?

624
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:39,449
His lord will definitely find out today.

625
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,150
Right.

626
00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:43,849
Here I go.

627
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,019
My lady!

628
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:56,769
Father.

629
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:02,269
Did you have a safe trip?

630
00:40:03,309 --> 00:40:04,309
Yes, I did.

631
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:11,909
I heard you went outside of the South Gates again.

632
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:13,550
Yes.

633
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:16,219
Stop going to the clinic from now on.

634
00:40:17,389 --> 00:40:19,519
Why all of a sudden?

635
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:22,190
I did not say anything about it as it was nothing bad.

636
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:26,099
However, from now on, you must be more prudent about your behaviors.

637
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:27,760
I have told you before.

638
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:30,300
You are the future Crown Princess.

639
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,769
People may start talking about you,

640
00:40:32,969 --> 00:40:34,440
so stop going to the clinic.

641
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,940
One cannot choose to become the Crown Princess herself.

642
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,780
There is no certainty I will be selected as one.

643
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:44,750
I want to continue to work at the clinic.

644
00:40:45,449 --> 00:40:46,820
Please allow it.

645
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,190
- Myung Yoon. - Yes, Father?

646
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:52,489
You have...

647
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,820
already been chosen as the Crown Princess.

648
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:56,760
Pardon?

649
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,199
The bridal selection order will be issued for the procedure.

650
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,730
However, His Royal Majesty has already decided.

651
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:03,530
Keep that in mind.

652
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,980
My lady!

653
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:17,480
Did his lord find out?

654
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,849
But how did he?

655
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,750
You do not look red anymore.

656
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:23,820
Was it the smell?

657
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:25,420
No, you do not smell of alcohol.

658
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:30,489
Pardon? The Crown Princess?

659
00:41:31,829 --> 00:41:33,059
Is that true?

660
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,599
Gosh.

661
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
The Crown Princess...

662
00:41:37,269 --> 00:41:38,969
My lady is the Crown Princess.

663
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:43,039
Congratulations, my lady.

664
00:41:45,139 --> 00:41:46,409
What is it?

665
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:48,940
Why are you sighing about such a happy occasion?

666
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,510
You usually do not keep your dignity.

667
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:55,989
Laugh if you are happy about it, just like me.

668
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:02,419
Are you happy?

669
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,659
Of course, I am.

670
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,360
My lady will become the Crown Princess.

671
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,800
That means when the Crown Prince becomes the King,

672
00:42:10,969 --> 00:42:12,769
my lady will become Her Royal Majesty.

673
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:14,969
In short, this country's queen.

674
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,409
This feels like a dream.

675
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,709
The lady I serve will have...

676
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,409
the highest status among all women in this country.

677
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,449
- Oh Wol. - Yes?

678
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,348
When I enter the palace,

679
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:32,489
you will have to as well.

680
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:34,989
Then, you cannot get married.

681
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,659
You will have to grow old all alone. Are you fine with that?

682
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:42,329
Gosh. What is the use of getting married?

683
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,368
Even if I give birth and raise children,

684
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:46,769
they, too, will live as servants their whole lives.

685
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:50,908
Whatever. I want to enter the palace with you...

686
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:55,110
and live the rest of my life in luxury.

687
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:56,210
You see, I...

688
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,549
My lady. You will take me, yes?

689
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:03,149
Without you, I am useless.

690
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,949
So you will take me, yes?

691
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,059
I am already excited!

692
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,460
By the way, my lady.

693
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,369
I am very curious.

694
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,199
You are, too, right?

695
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,639
I am talking about His Royal Highness.

696
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,539
What he is like, and how he looks.

697
00:43:29,309 --> 00:43:30,849
What if he is good-looking?

698
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:34,049
The children you and His Royal Highness will have...

699
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,579
will be so handsome and pretty.

700
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,550
How many children will you have?

701
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,959
I am in this poor state...

702
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,260
because of my master.

703
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,130
But someone is enjoying fishing.

704
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:53,639
I wonder why life is so unfair.

705
00:43:55,469 --> 00:43:56,539
Gap Dol.

706
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,440
Thanks to that master, you are no longer a servant.

707
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:02,880
You are now the Guard of the Crown Prince's Palace.

708
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:05,110
Have you forgotten about those?

709
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,749
It is Gap Seok, not Gap Dol.

710
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:09,949
Yes, Gap Dol.

711
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,389
Did I not give you that name when I dismissed you...

712
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,360
as a servant?

713
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:21,558
Because Your Royal Highness drank all of my mother's milk,

714
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:23,828
I barely had any to drink.

715
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:26,639
Hence, I cannot remember things well.

716
00:44:27,969 --> 00:44:30,039
You always bring that up whenever you are in a pinch.

717
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:32,570
Do you not think that is cheap?

718
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:36,309
Oh, the fish took the bait.

719
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:38,409
Here I go.

720
00:44:40,019 --> 00:44:41,619
Gosh, it must be a big one.

721
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:43,619
- Come and help. - Yes.

722
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,320
What is this?

723
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:49,389
Hold on.

724
00:44:50,059 --> 00:44:51,260
Here we go.

725
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:55,960
What is...

726
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:04,309
Is that a ghost? A water ghost?

727
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,610
It is not a ghost but a dead body.

728
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:12,250
- "A dead body?" - Yes.

729
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,449
Good grief, Your Royal Highness!

730
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:23,090
Stop making a fuss. Go call over some people.

731
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,869
Did you know the girl?

732
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:05,099
(Autopsy)

733
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:11,639
Yes.

734
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:13,480
Please do not feel too bad.

735
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:15,340
Let me know...

736
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:17,210
once the autopsy is complete.

737
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:18,849
Of course.

738
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:42,170
I have committed a mortal sin.

739
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:45,340
Do you like yakgwa?

740
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,480
Pardon?

741
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:55,579
Have some.

742
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:05,289
It is all right since I ate it first.

743
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,440
I hope I am not overstepping my bounds,

744
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,739
but may I take this to my mother?

745
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:22,009
In a few days' time, I will be taking my regular break.

746
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:23,109
(Sunhyuil: A regular day-off every 10 days)

747
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:25,380
I hid the yakgwa to take it to my mother...

748
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:27,650
and younger sibling.

749
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:31,750
You are a sweet girl.

750
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,929
Prepare some yakgwa for this girl.

751
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:41,159
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

752
00:47:43,699 --> 00:47:46,440
Have your mother and younger sibling enjoy them as well.

753
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:47,969
Do you hear me?

754
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,440
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

755
00:48:07,989 --> 00:48:09,059
Your Royal Highness.

756
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:11,230
I received word from the Office of Palace Physicians.

757
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,199
She took her own life.

758
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:15,230
(Jajin: Suicide)

759
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:16,429
It was suicide?

760
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:18,170
Yes.

761
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:23,469
Jong Geum was not the type to commit suicide.

762
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:25,670
A girl who hid a yakgwa...

763
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,710
to bring to her family...

764
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:29,880
would not have taken her own life.

765
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:31,650
Right.

766
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,590
Where are you headed?

767
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:42,260
(Autopsy Report)

768
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:47,260
(Suicide)

769
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,929
(Jong Geum, court maid of the Queen Dowager's quarters)

770
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,539
(Recorder Heo Jin Soo)

771
00:49:03,809 --> 00:49:04,849
Your Royal Highness.

772
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,118
Are you Physician Heo Jin Soo...

773
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:13,619
who examined the dead body of Jong Geum,

774
00:49:13,789 --> 00:49:15,219
the court maid of the Queen Dowager's quarters?

775
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,459
That is correct.

776
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,058
It says you only conducted a preliminary examination.

777
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:19,359
(Chogeom: A preliminary examination)

778
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,730
Why was there no follow-up?

779
00:49:21,329 --> 00:49:22,659
Her death was obviously suicide,

780
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:24,500
so I deemed it unnecessary...

781
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,900
to discomfort the Queen Dowager by further looking into the case.

782
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,369
It is why I did not continue with a second autopsy.

783
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:32,710
You are sure...

784
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:34,710
she committed suicide?

785
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,940
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

786
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:40,619
It says here that another court maid...

787
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:43,250
of the Queen Dowager's chambers took her own life.

788
00:49:43,389 --> 00:49:44,419
(Recorder Heo Jin Soo)

789
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:47,190
You led the autopsy in that case as well.

790
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:51,760
- Is that true? - Yes.

791
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:54,099
Does it not seem weird that two of her court maids...

792
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:56,469
took their own lives?

793
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:58,070
Forgive me for saying this,

794
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,340
but I am not an officer of the Police Bureau...

795
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:05,510
- but a physician. - Such insolence!

796
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:12,808
All I did was examine the dead body...

797
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:15,349
and determine the death as a suicide.

798
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:19,519
It is a human being that died. Surely, you were curious.

799
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:21,659
During an autopsy, it is imperative...

800
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,360
that one remains objective.

801
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:27,829
I only let the dead body speak to me.

802
00:50:37,969 --> 00:50:38,969
I see.

803
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:41,079
I hear you loud and clear.

804
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,448
You are dismissed.

805
00:50:43,449 --> 00:50:44,480
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

806
00:50:52,989 --> 00:50:54,019
Your Royal Highness.

807
00:50:54,489 --> 00:50:57,090
Does this not seem oddly suspicious?

808
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:06,800
We will know more...

809
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:09,300
once we look further into the matter.

810
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,320
Your Royal Highness.

811
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:30,429
I will keep digging.

812
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,360
Your Royal Highness.

813
00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:13,030
What brings you by all the way out here?

814
00:52:13,539 --> 00:52:16,139
Once I heard you stopped by the Office of Palace Physicians,

815
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:19,980
questions I had regarding the matter suddenly dawned on me.

816
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:22,639
It is why I conducted a second autopsy.

817
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,309
Did you find something?

818
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:27,550
Forgive me for saying this,

819
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:29,949
but I agree with the preliminary report.

820
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:31,750
She took her own life.

821
00:52:34,219 --> 00:52:36,090
Is there no possibility of it being a homicide?

822
00:52:36,829 --> 00:52:38,260
Someone could have...

823
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,929
made it look like a suicide after her death.

824
00:52:41,429 --> 00:52:43,800
There are no defensive wounds or any other wounds for that matter.

825
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,030
And judging by the water in her lungs,

826
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,840
it seems likely that the poor girl committed suicide.

827
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,948
However, since I could have missed something,

828
00:52:59,949 --> 00:53:01,219
I will conduct a third autopsy...

829
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,250
should you still have doubts.

830
00:53:03,619 --> 00:53:05,949
Do not bother. I doubt that will change anything.

831
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:09,460
You were not able to find evidence of foul play,

832
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:11,360
so who could possibly do a better job?

833
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,230
I am humbled, Your Royal Highness.

834
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:16,260
I appreciate your consideration.

835
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:19,469
You must be busy, so do not let me keep you.

836
00:53:31,449 --> 00:53:32,909
I guess we were wrong to question her death.

837
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,550
She must have taken her own life.

838
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:37,849
Stop talking and come with me.

839
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:21,699
I have a feeling that we are wasting our time.

840
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:48,119
Buyong Pavilion, second watch of the night.

841
00:54:57,269 --> 00:54:59,599
It is way past the second watch of the night.

842
00:54:59,869 --> 00:55:01,500
We should head back down.

843
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:04,969
Sure. Let us do that.

844
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:02,889
Your Royal Highness, did you see what I saw?

845
00:57:04,329 --> 00:57:05,730
Could my eyes be playing tricks on me?

846
00:57:07,829 --> 00:57:09,900
What will you do about this?

847
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,300
We should immediately take this to His Majesty.

848
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:17,369
Your Royal Highness?

849
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:39,130
What is that?

850
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,529
That is an acupuncture needle canister...

851
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:48,170
carried around by physicians.

852
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:57,780
Not all needle canisters are the same, Your Royal Highness.

853
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:00,820
There are those valuable which are made from ivory.

854
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,719
Some are made from bamboo or royal foxglove wood.

855
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:10,590
And like mine,

856
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:13,059
some are made from cupronickel.

857
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:17,230
Your Royal Highness.

858
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:24,638
Can one easily obtain a canister like this one?

859
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,639
I am afraid not.

860
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,710
I received it...

861
00:58:27,579 --> 00:58:29,340
when I first joined the Royal Infirmary...

862
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:32,409
as a gift from Royal Physician Choi.

863
00:58:55,139 --> 00:58:56,199
Your Royal Highness,

864
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,340
your evening meal has arrived.

865
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:00,809
I am not feeling well and do not have the stomach for it.

866
00:59:01,409 --> 00:59:02,880
I shall call a physician.

867
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:07,679
I only feel a slight tightness in the stomach,

868
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:09,519
so do not fret.

869
00:59:10,550 --> 00:59:12,320
Of course, Your Royal Highness.

870
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,559
Please come back quick, Your Royal Highness.

871
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,409
Anyway, where are you headed?

872
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:36,480
To someone with extensive knowledge regarding needle canisters.

873
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,150
Pardon? And who may that be?

874
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:43,150
Darn.

875
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:10,679
You are home from work, Father.

876
01:00:10,949 --> 01:00:12,309
Moo Baek, are you there?

877
01:00:16,349 --> 01:00:17,389
Did you call for me, my lord?

878
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:19,789
Do not ever...

879
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,960
let Lady Myung Yoon step inside the clinic again.

880
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:25,630
But Father...

881
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:27,599
Yes, my lord.

882
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:29,059
Come with me.

883
01:00:38,139 --> 01:00:39,809
I do not intend to marry.

884
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,550
- What? - I...

885
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,179
I am aware of my own fate.

886
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:55,619
I heard the man I marry would meet an untimely death.

887
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,789
Am I wrong?

888
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:03,599
So how could I possibly...

889
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:07,539
become the Crown Princess?

890
01:01:09,969 --> 01:01:12,569
I wish to spend my life aiding you...

891
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:14,179
working at the clinic.

892
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,780
That is admirable of you,

893
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,609
but I have a way.

894
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:20,749
(Bibang: A secret method)

895
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:21,920
I will take care of everything,

896
01:01:22,449 --> 01:01:25,750
so just do as I say and follow my lead.

897
01:01:26,219 --> 01:01:28,559
I have never gone against you,

898
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,360
but this will be that one time.

899
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,889
And I just said I would take care of things.

900
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:35,500
Squash your pointless worries...

901
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,670
and get ready to move into the palace.

902
01:01:37,969 --> 01:01:39,530
- But Father... - I must rest.

903
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:41,840
You are dismissed.

904
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:29,380
Handle the affair well, and I will pay you that much more.

905
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:33,619
However, a single mistake will not be allowed.

906
01:02:33,789 --> 01:02:35,760
- Do you understand? - Do not worry.

907
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:37,459
So that it does not backfire,

908
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,730
the affair will be neatly managed.

909
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:42,230
I will hold you to those words.

910
01:02:42,699 --> 01:02:43,699
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

911
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:57,349
My lady, where are you going?

912
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:00,550
Do not ask if you are not following me out.

913
01:03:28,539 --> 01:03:31,010
The night air is chilly. You should head inside, my lady.

914
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:33,250
Can you not turn a blind eye?

915
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:34,948
I apologize.

916
01:03:34,949 --> 01:03:38,289
Then, can you at least tell me what my father...

917
01:03:38,949 --> 01:03:40,690
is planning to do?

918
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:44,690
You, of all people, will be aware of it.

919
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:46,860
Tell me what it is.

920
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:49,929
Forgive me, but I cannot tell you.

921
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:53,768
However, please know...

922
01:03:53,769 --> 01:03:55,940
that everything is for your own good.

923
01:03:56,670 --> 01:03:57,840
Can you promise me...

924
01:03:58,139 --> 01:04:00,980
that what he plans to do will not hurt others?

925
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:08,019
I only say that because I have my suspicions.

926
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,590
Why else would I have chosen the option to run away?

927
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:16,320
My father must be stopped.

928
01:04:17,789 --> 01:04:19,960
If he chooses a dangerous route for my sake,

929
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:21,428
how could I live in peace...

930
01:04:21,429 --> 01:04:23,199
even after I become Crown Princess?

931
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,030
Help me.

932
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:28,869
Please.

933
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:20,050
Royal Physician Choi is not home at the moment.

934
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:21,960
Do you not know when he will be back?

935
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:23,590
He will at least be back by the end of the day.

936
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:28,558
Good work. Let me pour you a glass.

937
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:29,559
Thank you.

938
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:54,519
Master Lee?

939
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:56,189
- Why you... - Master Lee?

940
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:57,889
Get over here!

941
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:03,059
Master Lee?

942
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:05,699
Master Lee?

943
01:06:06,199 --> 01:06:07,230
Your Royal Highness.

944
01:06:08,369 --> 01:06:09,670
Master Lee!

945
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:21,339
(We thank Seo Beom Sik, Cho Jin Se, and Kim Won Hun...)

946
01:07:21,340 --> 01:07:23,480
(for their guest appearance.)

947
01:07:54,039 --> 01:07:55,839
(Missing Crown Prince)

948
01:07:55,840 --> 01:07:57,178
Are you sure it is the Crown Prince?

949
01:07:57,179 --> 01:07:58,980
It does not seem to be the Royal Highness.

950
01:07:59,349 --> 01:08:00,749
We have no idea...

951
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:02,150
of what kind of danger His Royal Highness is in.

952
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,419
But you are telling me you have found no traces of him.

953
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:05,518
How can you suddenly tell me...

954
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:06,989
to give up hope on the Crown Prince?

955
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:08,158
You must choose.

956
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:10,089
Is it the Crown Prince...

957
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:11,730
or the throne?

958
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:14,399
- Please reconsider, Your Majesty. - Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

959
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:15,558
Do you believe that killing me...

960
01:08:15,559 --> 01:08:17,970
will keep your dirty hidden affair from surfacing?

961
01:08:18,029 --> 01:08:20,369
He will choose to give up on the Crown Prince.

962
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,470
Did my father order you...

963
01:08:23,239 --> 01:08:24,340
to kill me?
