(when filming with children and animals.)

12
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,420
Are you hurt?

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,590
No.

14
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:55,189
I am all right.

15
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,960
(Episode 15)

16
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,829
- Dosung. - I protect my people.

17
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,469
- Why are you being like this? - To keep my people safe,

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,609
I must become Crown Prince.

19
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:16,650
- Let go. - Come with me.

20
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,680
Let go of her hand.

21
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:23,790
Did you not hear me? I protect my people.

22
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:34,269
Do you not see this blood?

23
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:39,239
We should examine her wound first.

24
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,170
Step away.

25
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,180
I cannot do that.

26
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:52,750
Oh Wol.

27
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:55,318
My lady.

28
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,390
- Are you all right? - My lady.

29
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,290
- My lady. - Come here.

30
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:02,230
Lie down.

31
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,300
My lady, this blood...

32
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:11,168
Oh, no.

33
00:02:11,169 --> 00:02:12,469
Is it a serious injury?

34
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,270
No, it is nothing serious.

35
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,740
Hurry up and lie down.

36
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:18,539
Whose fault is it that she got hurt?

37
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:20,139
Lower your voice.

38
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,810
As you know, Lady Myung Yoon...

39
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,379
will be put in a more precarious situation if someone hears you.

40
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,650
Her wound might be pretty deep.

41
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,020
Let us get her treated first.

42
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,930
I will get her treated.

43
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,430
You need to stop your maternal grandfather.

44
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,530
What do you mean?

45
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:41,030
Your maternal grandfather...

46
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,169
sent the assassins to kill Lady Myung Yoon.

47
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,469
The Commander of the Royal Guards confessed everything already.

48
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,240
You may check and confirm it yourself.

49
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,439
The method you chose...

50
00:02:53,139 --> 00:02:54,180
was wrong.

51
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:57,479
You could not protect anyone in the end.

52
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:00,949
Not Father, Mother, or Lady Myung Yoon.

53
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,590
However,

54
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,860
I will become Crown Prince and protect everyone whom I cherish.

55
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:07,460
You said yourself...

56
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,960
that you were not attached to the Crown Prince title, did you not?

57
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,030
If you truly meant it,

58
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,229
step down now.

59
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,569
In life,

60
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:21,038
there are moments when you ought to do things you do not want to do.

61
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:23,069
Are you saying you need the Crown Prince title...

62
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,310
even if it will hurt everyone around you?

63
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,449
Just be honest with me.

64
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,689
Are you doing this to punish Choi Sang Rok?

65
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,159
Or is it because...

66
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:41,590
you cannot give up on Lady Myung Yoon?

67
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,310
Are you all right?

68
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,580
Yes, it is just a graze.

69
00:03:57,909 --> 00:03:58,909
Come with me.

70
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,680
I will get you treated in my chamber...

71
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:02,050
- and take you home. - I...

72
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,650
will not go anywhere.

73
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,520
I came here to treat His Majesty,

74
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:10,889
so until His Majesty regains his health,

75
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:13,889
I will not leave the palace.

76
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:16,389
No, it is too dangerous.

77
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:17,698
If you get caught,

78
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,860
even your father or the Queen Dowager cannot protect you.

79
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,569
Do you truly not know that?

80
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,370
None of it matters at all if His Majesty...

81
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,470
can regain his consciousness.

82
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,170
Why are you so reckless?

83
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,610
Gun, you are just as reckless.

84
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:35,649
Why would you let her risk her life for something that will not happen?

85
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,220
How could you be sure that it would not happen without even trying?

86
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,050
Even the royal physicians could not do it.

87
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,759
Anyone would agree that it is impossible,

88
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,360
so I cannot let her sacrifice herself for it too.

89
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,199
Do you think I care for Lady Myung Yoon...

90
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,769
less than you do?

91
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:58,600
As long as I am alive,

92
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,509
she will never be sacrificed.

93
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,110
Keep that in mind and return to your chambers.

94
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:05,939
I refuse.

95
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,790
Please give me some time.

96
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:17,019
I will do everything in my power to treat His Majesty.

97
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,029
If I fail to treat him, I will give up and leave.

98
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,500
Leave the palace before sunrise.

99
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,629
If you do not leave the palace until the morning comes,

100
00:05:31,569 --> 00:05:32,670
I will...

101
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,170
let your father know myself.

102
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,899
Thank goodness you only suffered a minor injury.

103
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,500
I apologize for causing you concern.

104
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,170
I am sorry you had to experience such a terrible incident.

105
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:10,339
No, do not be sorry.

106
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:13,008
I must have become slow...

107
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:14,750
for I have been neglecting my training.

108
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,378
Did my grandfather send them...

109
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,420
Yes, that is correct.

110
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,889
Your grandfather...

111
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,589
probably could not accept the fact that Choi Sang Rok's daughter...

112
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:29,829
was by Your Royal Highness' side.

113
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,329
I completely understand, so let us stop talking about it.

114
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,439
Dosung said...

115
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,170
he would forgive your father once he became Crown Prince.

116
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:44,939
Were you not hurt when I said I was against it?

117
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,740
Yes.

118
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:48,579
I was hurt.

119
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,089
I suppose you have your reason,

120
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,589
but you will not tell me, and it hurts my feelings.

121
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:02,230
If Dosung becomes Crown Prince,

122
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:04,660
the Left State Councilor...

123
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,129
will assassinate my father.

124
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,300
Only then can he put Dosung on the throne.

125
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,170
Is that so?

126
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,338
He can join forces with the Queen Dowager...

127
00:07:18,339 --> 00:07:20,110
and give Dosung the Crown Prince title,

128
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:24,350
Dosung cannot ascend the throne...

129
00:07:25,649 --> 00:07:27,389
until my father passes away.

130
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,470
You said...

131
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,110
you told my father and the Queen Dowager as well.

132
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:51,740
How come you have not told Prince Dosung yet?

133
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:53,810
I could not tell him.

134
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,149
"Your maternal grandfather..."

135
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,449
"will kill my father to make you King."

136
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,319
How could I say that to him?

137
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:07,589
Right, I understand.

138
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:09,560
But the more you try to hide it,

139
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,129
the deeper the misunderstandings will become.

140
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,870
What can I do?

141
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:17,970
Rather than leaving Dosung forever scarred,

142
00:08:18,769 --> 00:08:19,769
I would prefer...

143
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,910
to be remembered as a bad brother for my peace of mind.

144
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,080
You must...

145
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:35,320
truly cherish Prince Dosung.

146
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:38,519
He is my one and only brother.

147
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,759
I envy him for having a brother like you.

148
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:50,840
I did not ask you to kill her.

149
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,870
All you had to do was carry her out of the palace.

150
00:08:54,309 --> 00:08:57,480
Why did you have to bring your sword and cause all this?

151
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,179
You fools.

152
00:08:59,309 --> 00:09:00,849
I apologize, my lord.

153
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:01,980
My lord. It is I, Gap Seok.

154
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,220
You may go now.

155
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,879
You may come in.

156
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,139
His Royal Highness is asking for you.

157
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:31,009
No, Your Royal Highness.

158
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:34,480
I swear, I had no intention of killing her.

159
00:09:35,179 --> 00:09:37,919
It is simply unacceptable that Choi Sang Rok's daughter...

160
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,480
is allowed to stay by Your Royal Highness' side,

161
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,548
so I was trying to make her leave the palace...

162
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,059
Whether you tried to kill her or kick her out,

163
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:46,689
you broke your promise when you gave me your word...

164
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:48,090
that you would never go against my wishes again...

165
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,129
behind my back.

166
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:53,230
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.

167
00:09:53,929 --> 00:09:54,970
However,

168
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:59,370
please understand that I cannot neglect my duty...

169
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:01,539
as your loyal vassal.

170
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,309
How is it your duty...

171
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,979
to kill an innocent woman?

172
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,009
Your Royal Highness.

173
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,649
Choi Sang Rok's daughter is not innocent.

174
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,849
Did you not hear why Lady Myung Yoon decided to come to the palace?

175
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,159
To treat His Majesty? Do you truly believe that?

176
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,620
Do you really think Choi Sang Rok's daughter...

177
00:10:20,789 --> 00:10:24,500
would do something that goes against her father's wishes?

178
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,700
Yes.

179
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:27,469
I trust her.

180
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,600
She is the daughter of your sworn enemy...

181
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,669
who tried to assassinate His Majesty and got you deposed...

182
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,610
by framing you for the assassination attempt.

183
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,179
Do not let them deceive you.

184
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,349
Letting yourself develop feelings for such a woman...

185
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,148
is an unfilial and disloyal act. Never forget that.

186
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:46,149
Stop.

187
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,649
That is enough.

188
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,319
Your Royal Highness,

189
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,059
you will go on to become the King of Joseon.

190
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:56,989
Do not let a mere woman...

191
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,600
That woman will bring Father back to consciousness.

192
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,299
I understand you wish to believe that.

193
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:08,570
However, that will not happen.

194
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,639
I will not look idly on this issue involving the traitor's daughter...

195
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:15,110
who is trying to deceive Your Royal Highness.

196
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,850
What will you do if I insist on keeping her by my side?

197
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:23,320
- Your Royal Highness. - Answer my question.

198
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,090
I asked you what you would do.

199
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:30,129
To protect Your Royal Highness,

200
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,600
I will kick her out ten thousand times if I must.

201
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,299
And you would take her life if you must?

202
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,539
If I must get blood on my hands...

203
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,340
to guide you to the right path...

204
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,470
Yes.

205
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:44,679
I will gladly do so.

206
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,279
Grandfather.

207
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:52,149
I did not know that you were just like the Left State Councilor.

208
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,979
Your Royal Highness.

209
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,590
You are saying you would kill Lady Myung Yoon to protect me,

210
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:00,059
and the Left State Councilor would assassinate my father for Dosung.

211
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:02,029
How are you any different from him?

212
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,659
Your Royal Highness.

213
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:07,799
How could you make such a preposterous remark?

214
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,100
- I was simply... - Please return to Mungyeong.

215
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,240
- Your Royal Highness. - I will figure out what to do,

216
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,639
so do not do anything for me.

217
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:19,710
Please do nothing.

218
00:12:38,929 --> 00:12:41,700
Do not tell me again to forgive my father.

219
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,470
No one...

220
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:46,139
can forgive their father when he is the one...

221
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,110
who killed their mother.

222
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,950
When did you get here?

223
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:01,149
I heard Myung Yoon was here.

224
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,690
It is all my fault.

225
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:10,759
I should have held back...

226
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:13,299
no matter how much I missed you.

227
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:15,970
Because we met again here,

228
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,769
all of this happened.

229
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:22,840
Do not beat yourself up.

230
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:24,940
Even if it had not happened that day,

231
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:27,710
it would have happened eventually.

232
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,450
You know that I came here running...

233
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,480
for I missed you so much too.

234
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,149
Sang Rok.

235
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,259
I understand you must feel tormented now,

236
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,169
but we are almost there.

237
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,240
Stay strong and hang in there just a little longer.

238
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:21,399
- Let go. - Come with me.

239
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,970
Let go of her hand.

240
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,509
I ask you to please...

241
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:32,639
call off the wedding.

242
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:43,590
Once he clears his name and is officially reinstated,

243
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,059
you...

244
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,600
will not have to marry me.

245
00:14:57,269 --> 00:14:59,139
Do you think I care for Lady Myung Yoon less...

246
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,570
than you do?

247
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:06,340
As long as I am alive, she will never be sacrificed.

248
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,879
Keep that in mind and return to your chambers.

249
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:40,109
I made copies...

250
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,850
of my father's most recent journals and ledger.

251
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,679
I went through everything...

252
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,019
but could not find anything about the antidote.

253
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,620
It must be in the book I saw...

254
00:15:51,789 --> 00:15:53,389
in the Queen Dowager's Palace.

255
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,600
Where is Myung Yoon? Is everything okay?

256
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:09,309
She is visiting the temple.

257
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,240
She said to give you this letter when you got home.

258
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,620
I suppose she has managed to appease her anger toward me,

259
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:28,960
seeing how she left me this letter.

260
00:16:30,059 --> 00:16:31,460
It seems like she will stay there for a few days.

261
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:33,730
You should go and stay with Myung Yoon.

262
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,929
Would you not feel uneasy if I were not here?

263
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,840
It looks like I will have to stay in the Royal Infirmary for a while.

264
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,710
So do not worry about me. Go and stay with her.

265
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,640
What brings you by at this hour?

266
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,670
I am here to offer my morning greetings.

267
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,210
"Morning greetings?"

268
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:24,950
What has gotten into you?

269
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,759
A few days ago,

270
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,220
I saw Prince Gwangchang in my dream.

271
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:37,759
It kept bothering me, so I looked into it and learned...

272
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,859
that you never got to hold a proper memorial ceremony for him.

273
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,028
I know it is late,

274
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,400
but I believe it is only right that we hold a memorial ceremony for him,

275
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,469
so I have told those at Jeongeopwon to prepare for it.

276
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,608
(Jeongeopwon: A Buddhist nunnery)

277
00:17:51,609 --> 00:17:53,140
Would you please attend the ceremony?

278
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,880
This is too sudden.

279
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:00,650
Right, I understand.

280
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:02,589
However,

281
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:05,059
what happened to Prince Gwangchang...

282
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,619
has nothing to do with the other things going on now.

283
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:09,660
It is about the Royal House.

284
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:14,500
I should have taken care of it sooner.

285
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:17,500
I am sorry that it took me this long.

286
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:21,069
Please think about it...

287
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,970
and let me know whether or not you would be there.

288
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:24,980
Well...

289
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,809
I will be off, then.

290
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:48,599
Get ready to go to Jeongeopwon.

291
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,170
I suggest you consult Inspector General Choi first.

292
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,769
Have you forgotten what happened at Botaam Hermitage?

293
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,608
It is Gwangchang's memorial ceremony.

294
00:18:56,609 --> 00:18:57,670
Do not stop me.

295
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,390
What are you doing?

296
00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:20,130
Where is Lady Myung Yoon?

297
00:19:22,069 --> 00:19:23,069
No.

298
00:19:23,569 --> 00:19:24,869
Where are you hiding her?

299
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:33,240
She is in a safe place, so do not worry.

300
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,349
They are determined to have her killed.

301
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:39,019
If she stays in the palace, they will find her and kill her.

302
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,650
They were not trying to kill her.

303
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,919
To make her leave the palace...

304
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,358
Why pull a sword on a woman if they had no intention of killing her?

305
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:46,690
It makes no sense!

306
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,660
If you are truly concerned about Lady Myung Yoon,

307
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:52,559
tell me where you are hiding her.

308
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,599
Tell me at once.

309
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:01,369
Forget it.

310
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,369
I will find her.

311
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,640
I will search every corner of the palace and find her at all costs.

312
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:09,849
Just wait and see.

313
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,880
Dosung.

314
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:34,710
I searched everywhere but could not find her.

315
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,740
Search every corner of the palace to find her!

316
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,809
Find her at all costs!

317
00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:40,309
Yes, Your Highness.

318
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,089
Prince Dosung has ordered Cheol Du to find Lady Myung Yoon.

319
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,420
What should we do now?

320
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,259
Your Royal Highness.

321
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:56,589
Bring Cheol Du to me.

322
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,660
Goodness.

323
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,930
What is this?

324
00:21:08,869 --> 00:21:09,940
Why did you call me here?

325
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,410
It is about Lady Myung Yoon.

326
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,679
Shall I tell you where she is?

327
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,180
- You truly know where she is? - Yes.

328
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:19,079
Where is she?

329
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,359
My gosh. Gap Seok, you really are...

330
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:55,950
Goodness. Oh, boy.

331
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:00,490
We did not know where to keep him, so we brought him here.

332
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,460
I will take good care of him.

333
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:06,630
He may act up when he wakes up,

334
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,029
so I should stay here too.

335
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:21,039
Oh, my.

336
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:36,190
You must have been very surprised.

337
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:39,630
Lady Myung Yoon can be a little aggressive at times,

338
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,069
but she does not do that to everyone,

339
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:44,130
so do not worry too much.

340
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,400
- Yes, ma'am. - Please speak casually to me.

341
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:52,180
We will see each other often from now on.

342
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,410
Why would you see him?

343
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,449
Lady Myung Yoon and the Crown Prince...

344
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:00,779
love each other. So of course, I will see him often.

345
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:05,288
This place will be Lady Myung Yoon's home in the future.

346
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:08,230
That will not happen, so do not even dream of it.

347
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:09,529
Why not?

348
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,660
You do not need to know.

349
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:17,900
Anyway, I heard this was where the Queen lived.

350
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,470
May we stay here?

351
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:24,980
The Queen's court maids are also confined at the moment.

352
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,640
No one will come here, so it is safe for the time being.

353
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,519
Just be careful when the royal guards are patrolling the area.

354
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,450
I see. Will do.

355
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:39,390
My gosh. You explained everything in such a kind manner,

356
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,390
while someone is busy picking on me.

357
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:45,399
Gosh, I cannot help but compare you two.

358
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,559
You are comparing me to him?

359
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,700
The Queen Dowager notified me that she would be attending...

360
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:51,230
the memorial ceremony.

361
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,140
That is good news.

362
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,970
I will sneak out the book at all costs.

363
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,710
Must you do it yourself?

364
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,779
How about we send Gap Seok?

365
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,079
He is a man,

366
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:06,519
so he cannot enter the Queen Dowager's Palace.

367
00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:09,949
More importantly, I know where the book is,

368
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:11,319
so I can find it right away.

369
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,029
Thank you for your concern,

370
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,930
but please trust me, Your Royal Highness.

371
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:24,430
You must be careful.

372
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:26,869
All right?

373
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:29,210
Yes, I will be careful.

374
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,910
Cheol Du!

375
00:24:36,579 --> 00:24:37,609
Cheol Du!

376
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,390
Cheol Du is with me.

377
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:51,759
I found a letter in this book.

378
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:55,329
A letter between my father and his spy.

379
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,170
Do you know who the spy is?

380
00:24:57,269 --> 00:24:58,768
I do not know the details...

381
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:01,609
for I only read the first bit as my father suddenly entered,

382
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,980
but I believe it is one of Prince Dosung's closest aides.

383
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,380
Are you saying Cheol Du is working for Choi Sang Rok?

384
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,180
Just be honest and say that you wish...

385
00:25:12,619 --> 00:25:14,319
to cut off my limbs!

386
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,920
It is possible that it is not Cheol Du.

387
00:25:16,089 --> 00:25:19,720
However, if what Lady Myung Yoon read is true,

388
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,659
and if the spy is one of your closest aides, Cheol Du may be...

389
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,200
I know Cheol Du very well.

390
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:29,629
He may be ignorant, but he would never betray me.

391
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:31,599
I, too, never even imagined that Sang Soo...

392
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:33,640
could stab me.

393
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,539
And I never imagined that you would do this.

394
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:40,940
I...

395
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,909
When my grandfather was attacked...

396
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,980
and even when they locked up my mother,

397
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,990
I still trusted you.

398
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:53,789
I must not become Crown Prince by getting you ousted,

399
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:56,490
so I did everything in my power...

400
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,029
to avoid becoming Crown Prince, but you...

401
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,769
were opposed to me becoming Crown Prince even when I said...

402
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:05,170
I would protect Mother and save Lady Myung Yoon.

403
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,200
Just admit it.

404
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:11,140
Admit that you wish to keep the Crown Prince title.

405
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:14,180
Just admit that you want her all to yourself...

406
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,808
even if she was mine!

407
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,150
Shut your mouth!

408
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:24,119
How dare you run your mouth like that when you know nothing?

409
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,960
What is it that I do not know?

410
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,490
If there is something I do not know, you can tell me now!

411
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,170
Forget it. I do not even wish to know.

412
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,869
Hand over Cheol Du at once.

413
00:26:40,569 --> 00:26:42,339
Once Father regains his consciousness,

414
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,710
and we punish the Queen Dowager and Choi Sang Rok,

415
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,980
I will voluntarily ask Father...

416
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,650
to relieve me from my post.

417
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,579
Do you truly think...

418
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:57,618
that Father will accept that request?

419
00:26:57,619 --> 00:27:00,289
For now, you can criticize me all you want. I will put up with it.

420
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:01,829
However,

421
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,630
I will make sure...

422
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,369
Father regains his consciousness with Lady Myung Yoon's help.

423
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:12,700
I will not forgive...

424
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,109
anyone who gets in my way,

425
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:19,210
even if it is you.

426
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,549
I will release Cheol Du as soon as this situation is sorted out.

427
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,720
This time, I will not let you have your way.

428
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,920
Do you think I will give up?

429
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,230
Wait and see. I will be sure...

430
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,599
to marry Lady Myung Yoon and make her my Crown Princess.

431
00:27:56,609 --> 00:27:58,549
(Prince Gwangchang)

432
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,619
Someone is in the Queen Dowager's chamber.

433
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:50,799
His Royal Highness sent these plants for the Queen Dowager.

434
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,339
Wipe them thoroughly.

435
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:41,380
(Five)

436
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,359
(Five)

437
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,240
Oh, no.

438
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:33,240
(Five)

439
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,700
(Five)

440
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,269
You did it.

441
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,779
Well done.

442
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,109
Do not get me started.

443
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,209
I was so scared when Court Lady Kim showed up suddenly.

444
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,880
It nearly made me jump out of my skin.

445
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,650
You must have been so anxious, Oh Wol.

446
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,719
I have had to lie from time to time because of Lady Myung Yoon,

447
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,189
but I have never stolen anything before,

448
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,229
so I got scared to death,

449
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,630
- but then I came back to life. - Watch your mouth!

450
00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:32,258
You are before His Royal Highness.

451
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:34,730
Gap Seok. Check if that man...

452
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:37,329
is alive and well.

453
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,529
Understood.

454
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:48,309
We must hurry before they realize the book has been swapped.

455
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,349
Is what we need truly in this book?

456
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:53,118
Yes.

457
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,180
It has the medicines needed for the antidote...

458
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,420
and how to make poison from the poison-feather bird.

459
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,490
However,

460
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,829
the amount of each medicine needed to be used is not written on it.

461
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,599
Hence, the mixing ratio for the antidote is unknown.

462
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:12,440
As you make them with all possible ratios you can think of...

463
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:16,809
What is it?

464
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,710
Is it too reckless?

465
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,039
No, that is not the case.

466
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:22,548
To confirm if the ratio is correct...

467
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:24,509
and if the antidote is effective,

468
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,220
it must be tested.

469
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:30,119
We cannot possibly test it on His Majesty, can we?

470
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:35,990
Gap Seok.

471
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:38,430
Go and bring Court Lady Oh.

472
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,700
Head inside.

473
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,410
We need to borrow your rat.

474
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:01,049
I was informed of the situation on my way here.

475
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,890
I can get as many rats as needed.

476
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:05,390
Do not worry.

477
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,119
Thank you.

478
00:33:37,819 --> 00:33:39,789
(Two)

479
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,759
(One)

480
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,470
(Two)

481
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,640
(One, Two)

482
00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:05,210
(Three)

483
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,690
(Four)

484
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:30,670
All the rats that were brought are dead.

485
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:34,039
I will go and catch more rats.

486
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,179
That is not necessary.

487
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,949
You are to catch them.

488
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,550
Pardon?

489
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,190
Am I to do it alone?

490
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,820
I am going to travel in disguise.

491
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,260
What?

492
00:34:48,261 --> 00:34:50,159
I have already talked with the Royal Guard Commander.

493
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,900
For Lady Myung Yoon to enter and leave the King's Palace,

494
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:57,300
the Head Eunuch must also be brought to our side. No?

495
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:19,960
Should you not have gone with him?

496
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:24,359
What if something happens to him while he is alone?

497
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,559
If I do not guard the Crown Prince's Palace,

498
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,428
people will easily find out...

499
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:29,968
His Royal Highness is not here.

500
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:31,070
I have no other choice.

501
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,170
Putting the others aside,

502
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:37,368
what if Prince Dosung comes by?

503
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:40,409
That is why you must impersonate His Royal Highness well.

504
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:42,079
Goodness.

505
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,579
Copy me.

506
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:49,349
I want to be alone. Please leave.

507
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:53,859
"I want to be alone. Please leave."

508
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,860
Really?

509
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:57,928
- I want to be alone. - "I want to be alone."

510
00:35:57,929 --> 00:35:59,159
- Please leave. - "Please leave."

511
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,130
"I want to be alone. Please leave."

512
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,570
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

513
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:37,699
Have everyone leave except for you.

514
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:55,689
I will become the Crown Prince.

515
00:36:55,690 --> 00:36:56,719
And...

516
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,320
I will marry Lady Myung Yoon.

517
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,260
Why did you suddenly have a change of heart?

518
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:06,800
Is that important right now?

519
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,969
The fact that...

520
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,469
I have made up my mind is important, no?

521
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,868
But that mind of yours changes ever so often,

522
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,110
which is why I am asking.

523
00:37:20,179 --> 00:37:21,979
Does that mean you cannot trust me?

524
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,010
Correct.

525
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,949
I cannot trust you.

526
00:37:25,449 --> 00:37:29,619
Before you prove that you will not betray us again,

527
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:32,250
I, too, cannot trust you.

528
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,489
Prince Susung has already made...

529
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:43,369
preparations to mobilize the military to be on the safe side.

530
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:46,070
The moment he sends notice,

531
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:48,138
the Head of the Guards and Training General...

532
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:49,670
will order their men.

533
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,710
Is that not enough?

534
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:04,190
Your quarters' Court Maid Sun Ok.

535
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,590
She is...

536
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:10,359
Prince Susung's spy.

537
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,499
(Ganja: A person investigating in secret...)

538
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:15,158
(and providing it to the competition)

539
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:17,900
Have I proven myself now?

540
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:20,670
If so,

541
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:23,239
release Mother...

542
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:25,639
from confinement first.

543
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:39,059
- Your Highness! - Oh, dear.

544
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:47,099
Please return.

545
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,569
You do know Her Highness cannot meet anyone...

546
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,070
during confinement.

547
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,900
Move at once.

548
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,239
- Prince Dosung! - Mother.

549
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,609
Please go back inside, Your Highness.

550
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,210
I am scared someone might witness this scene.

551
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:16,590
Wait a little longer.

552
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,760
You will soon be released.

553
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,059
Despite knowing you are simply comforting me,

554
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:25,269
I feel grateful and reassured...

555
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:27,570
by those words.

556
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,840
The words I said were not to comfort you.

557
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:33,480
- I was promised... - "Promised?"

558
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:35,809
Prince Dosung.

559
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,408
Do not tell me you made a deal with them.

560
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,420
I...

561
00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:42,219
will become the Crown Prince.

562
00:39:42,349 --> 00:39:44,948
No! You must not become one at any cost!

563
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:45,989
Mother.

564
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:47,789
Why are you against it?

565
00:39:49,059 --> 00:39:51,889
What is the reason I must not become the Crown Prince?

566
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,630
I hate the idea.

567
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,239
I do not want you to become the Crown Prince for my sake.

568
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,138
Nor do I want to see you brothers fight over the position.

569
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:04,239
I hate it all.

570
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,679
It is not for you.

571
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,649
I want to become the Crown Prince out of my own will.

572
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:13,049
You know His Majesty wishes...

573
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,550
your brother to become the King.

574
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,050
That does not matter.

575
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,889
To rescue and protect you, Mother,

576
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,760
I will become the Crown Prince.

577
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:25,659
Prince Dosung...

578
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:59,089
If you can make Dosung ascend the throne...

579
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:01,429
No. If you can become the King's grandfather...

580
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,570
and take power over the sovereign,

581
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,599
you will not care even if your daughter becomes a widow,

582
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:11,739
and you will hurt my father without feeling an ounce of guilt.

583
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,010
No.

584
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,380
Do not do it, Young.

585
00:41:18,579 --> 00:41:19,579
Your Highness.

586
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,519
Please calm down, Your Highness.

587
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:26,420
I must stop him.

588
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,489
Prince Dosung must not become the Crown Prince.

589
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:36,800
You cannot.

590
00:41:37,269 --> 00:41:38,769
Please calm down, Your Highness.

591
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,300
Where is Father?

592
00:41:45,139 --> 00:41:47,980
You made the right decision.

593
00:41:50,179 --> 00:41:53,949
But is something bothering you?

594
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:55,949
Actually, Mother...

595
00:41:57,019 --> 00:42:00,820
was adamantly against me becoming the Crown Prince.

596
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:05,900
Is there a reason I am not aware of?

597
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,029
Just thinking about the Queen Dowager...

598
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:15,039
and Choi Sang Rok must make her blood boil,

599
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:17,269
so why would she...

600
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:19,579
be thrilled...

601
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:22,380
about you joining their side and becoming the Crown Prince?

602
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:25,480
She has suffered at their hands,

603
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:27,219
so her opposition is understandable.

604
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:30,719
Also, she could be concerned...

605
00:42:30,989 --> 00:42:32,518
about Prince Susung's safety.

606
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:34,619
I am also concerned for my brother's safety.

607
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,460
That is why...

608
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,960
I need you to promise that you will not harm him...

609
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:43,369
after I become Crown Prince.

610
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,239
I will promise it and then some.

611
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,710
I promise...

612
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:52,539
to leave him unharmed.

613
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,210
That is right.

614
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:02,920
Will you truly...

615
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:07,289
let Prince Susung live?

616
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,329
Do not be ridiculous.

617
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:12,960
Of course he will be killed.

618
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:33,078
Are you sure the Head Eunuch's family is here?

619
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:34,079
Yes.

620
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,250
In exchange...

621
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,590
for the rights to the freighter, Lord Choi had the ringleader...

622
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:40,388
keep them confined.

623
00:43:40,389 --> 00:43:42,159
(Jowoonseon: A boat used to carry shipment)

624
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,730
Anyway, why are you here in person?

625
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:46,630
If your identity is revealed,

626
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,530
that will put Lady Myung Yoon in danger.

627
00:43:48,699 --> 00:43:51,570
If your master gets wind of what we are doing,

628
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:53,440
you will need me to salvage the situation.

629
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:57,909
Anyway, I appreciate you telling me.

630
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,510
Just be good to Lady Myung Yoon.

631
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:05,309
If you...

632
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:07,780
betray or abandon her,

633
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,849
- I will... - You will what?

634
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:13,019
Come for my neck?

635
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:18,389
I should be good to her since I do not want that.

636
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,300
Greetings, my lord.

637
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:24,829
There he is.

638
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:16,849
I think I found it.

639
00:45:30,829 --> 00:45:33,139
Legitimate transactions are recorded in these ledgers.

640
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:47,250
What is that?

641
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,280
It is a gakpil.

642
00:45:49,849 --> 00:45:54,460
(Gakpil: A sharp writing supply made from bamboo, horn, or ivory)

643
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:00,230
Identify yourselves.

644
00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:07,369
Get them.

645
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:21,949
Who are you people?

646
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:23,550
Knowing who I am will shock you.

647
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:30,129
Your Royal Highness.

648
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:33,099
I hear you have taken the Head Eunuch's family.

649
00:46:36,369 --> 00:46:37,769
Answer me.

650
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:45,440
The transaction of smuggled goods...

651
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:47,340
were written with a gakpil.

652
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:52,210
Should it be the Police Bureau or the Department of Justice?

653
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,880
Since you deal in smuggling,

654
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:56,590
the Department of Justice it is.

655
00:46:57,090 --> 00:46:59,420
I will bring the family to you.

656
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:02,860
Do not just sit there and bring them here.

657
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:04,389
- Yes, master. - Yes, master.

658
00:47:29,789 --> 00:47:32,090
All you have to do is keep quiet.

659
00:47:32,519 --> 00:47:33,559
Then,

660
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,730
I will turn a blind eye...

661
00:47:37,289 --> 00:47:39,800
to the smuggling and tax evasion.

662
00:47:42,329 --> 00:47:44,869
I am honored by your generosity, Your Royal Highness.

663
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:49,539
If you are that grateful, grant me a favor.

664
00:47:53,739 --> 00:47:54,840
Do you also...

665
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:56,780
handle medicinal herbs?

666
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:20,969
Apart from Sun Ok, you are all dismissed.

667
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:34,550
No one is to approach this room.

668
00:48:35,349 --> 00:48:36,789
Yes, Court Lady Kim.

669
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:13,590
It seems as though His Majesty will soon be back on his feet.

670
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:16,159
But that is not what we want.

671
00:49:16,429 --> 00:49:18,289
You could poison him some more.

672
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,130
If I administer more poison,

673
00:49:20,699 --> 00:49:22,730
he might never regain consciousness.

674
00:49:23,769 --> 00:49:26,900
Are you saying he will never regain consciousness...

675
00:49:29,269 --> 00:49:31,309
or that he will pass away?

676
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:34,510
He will pass away.

677
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:37,880
Let us poison him again.

678
00:49:50,829 --> 00:49:51,860
Have you lost your mind?

679
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,698
In broad daylight? Someone could see you!

680
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,570
I must talk to His Royal Highness this instant.

681
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:59,170
Did something happen?

682
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,940
Go back to the Queen Dowager's palace.

683
00:50:11,579 --> 00:50:15,579
When will His Royal Highness be back?

684
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,949
He said he would make haste,

685
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:20,690
but I cannot guarantee when he will return.

686
00:50:23,889 --> 00:50:25,629
Maybe we should wait for him...

687
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:27,960
No, if we sit on this information...

688
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:30,300
and something happens to His Majesty,

689
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,199
we will regret it for the rest of our lives.

690
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,300
I, at least, should make a move.

691
00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:36,940
Let us join you.

692
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:39,670
You should not vacate the palace as well.

693
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:42,380
Until His Royal Highness returns,

694
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:44,650
keep a close eye...

695
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:47,219
on their movements.

696
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:52,289
The soldiers are on standby.

697
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:53,988
Once the Training General takes charge...

698
00:50:53,989 --> 00:50:55,989
of the Royal Commandery Division and the Border Defense Council,

699
00:50:56,190 --> 00:50:58,059
I will seize control of the Three Internal Offices...

700
00:50:58,190 --> 00:50:59,590
and open the palace gate.

701
00:50:59,929 --> 00:51:00,960
We must...

702
00:51:01,699 --> 00:51:03,670
quickly make our move...

703
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:06,570
before they are able to defend themselves.

704
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,199
Do not worry, my lord.

705
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:11,070
Do not forget...

706
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:13,579
that His Majesty's life...

707
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,650
and the fate of the royal family depend on your actions.

708
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,309
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

709
00:51:56,849 --> 00:51:58,989
Goodness me.

710
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,719
I see it was all an elaborate scheme.

711
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:04,529
They are traitors who have been plotting treason.

712
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:05,530
(Tachogyeongsa: A way to make enemies reveal themselves)

713
00:52:05,531 --> 00:52:07,559
Arrest them all!

714
00:52:07,699 --> 00:52:08,730
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

715
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,489
Get searching.

716
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,849
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

717
00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:52,110
I have found the list of names...

718
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,209
that proves their act of treason.

719
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:57,609
(Sabaltongmun: A list of names written in the shape of a bowl...)

720
00:52:57,610 --> 00:53:01,320
(that conceals the name of the mastermind)

721
00:53:14,829 --> 00:53:17,500
Take these traitors and lock them up...

722
00:53:17,929 --> 00:53:19,499
at the Department of Justice.

723
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,539
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

724
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:25,610
What will happen...

725
00:53:26,409 --> 00:53:28,110
to Master Moonhyung?

726
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,479
As if I would know.

727
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,510
Could he...

728
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:35,348
Could he be told to drink poison?

729
00:53:35,349 --> 00:53:37,119
As if I would know!

730
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,320
Your Royal Highness.

731
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:44,929
What is with the ruckus at this hour?

732
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:47,860
Your Royal Highness, we are in big trouble.

733
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,369
Now that we have the sabaltongmun,

734
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:53,968
not even the great Jang Hyun Mok...

735
00:53:53,969 --> 00:53:55,739
will be able to weasel his way out of it.

736
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:57,269
Of course.

737
00:53:57,809 --> 00:53:58,809
However,

738
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,210
I doubt Prince Susung will sit idly by...

739
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:03,650
when his grandfather could lose his life.

740
00:54:05,349 --> 00:54:07,079
What can he do about it?

741
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,389
Sun Ok...

742
00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:12,849
They must know about her.

743
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:16,789
Sorry? I do not follow.

744
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:18,659
They used Sun Ok...

745
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:20,960
to bait us.

746
00:54:25,969 --> 00:54:28,800
Are we making progress on the antidote?

747
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:37,050
Why will it not move?

748
00:54:38,679 --> 00:54:41,679
My lady, this one must have also died.

749
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:48,789
Are you making progress?

750
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:53,500
I see that you are back.

751
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,469
The right blend seems to be crucial.

752
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:00,699
May I see the book?

753
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:17,820
Give me light.

754
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:25,860
What is that?

755
00:55:25,929 --> 00:55:26,960
It is a gakpil.

756
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,638
(Copper, pine nuts...)

757
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:36,570
One thousand pil of silk from Ming...

758
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:38,670
among other things.

759
00:55:40,309 --> 00:55:41,440
Come over here.

760
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:46,820
Do you see it?

761
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,190
Pardon?

762
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,860
Look closely.

763
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,500
(3 hob of arrowroot flour and 3 cups of water)

764
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:09,539
Your Royal Highness, I see it!

765
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:12,469
My lady!

766
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:50,449
It is a letter from your father. Go ahead and read it.

767
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,618
(Have you been well?)

768
00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:03,659
Your family has been relocated to a safe place.

769
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,380
Your Royal Highness...

770
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:10,789
Prince Susung...

771
00:59:11,989 --> 00:59:13,690
is currently with His Majesty.

772
00:59:17,429 --> 00:59:18,630
Should I announce you?

773
00:59:23,099 --> 00:59:25,929
Prince Dosung is here.

774
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:41,219
Let him enter.

775
00:59:44,889 --> 00:59:46,050
Please enter.

776
00:59:55,829 --> 00:59:56,969
Let him enter.

777
00:59:57,630 --> 00:59:59,170
He just left.

778
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,039
Your Royal Highness.

779
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:06,739
His Majesty...

780
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:00,860
Father.

781
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,869
Can you see me?

782
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:15,840
Father.

783
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:18,349
It is your son, Gun.

784
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:20,920
Do you...

785
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:23,550
recognize me?

786
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:38,699
Father?

787
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:27,050
(Missing Crown Prince)

788
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:29,980
Inspector General Choi is almost at the King's quarters.

789
01:02:30,219 --> 01:02:31,920
Just by checking his pulse,

790
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:34,819
my father will know that His Majesty is in recovery.

791
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:36,559
Please spare my grandfather's life.

792
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:39,760
You of all people know that he is innocent.

793
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:42,629
Rather than Prince Susung who is affiliated with a scandal,

794
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:44,900
Prince Dosung is more suitable as Crown Prince.

795
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:47,940
Therefore, Prince Dosung will be installed as such.

796
01:02:47,969 --> 01:02:51,139
For that reason, Prince Susung will be dismissed from the palace.

797
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:53,539
They did not commit treason, but...
