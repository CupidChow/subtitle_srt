(in this drama are historically irrelevant and fictitious.)

(Production guidelines were strictly followed...)

11
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:46,850
(when filming with children and animals.)

12
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:48,649
What is this?

13
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,020
(Episode 4)

14
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:08,510
Who are you?

15
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,849
How are you here?

16
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,489
We must hurry.

17
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:27,989
Let us go.

18
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:31,359
Who...

19
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,500
Who exactly are you?

20
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:36,370
Who are you really?

21
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,939
Speak the truth this instant!

22
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,879
Can you first let go of me?

23
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,439
First, tell me who you are.

24
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,609
Who are you?

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,950
Fine.

26
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:56,489
Then at least tell me how you knew I was being held here.

27
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,319
My lady informed me,

28
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:02,730
and all I did was follow her command.

29
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:05,400
Everything you did for me so far...

30
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,770
was ordered by your lady.

31
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:10,639
Is that it?

32
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,610
- Yes. - How did your lady know...

33
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,439
to send you my way every time I was in danger?

34
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,379
Did I ever cause you trouble?

35
00:02:22,979 --> 00:02:25,849
Like you said, all I did was help you.

36
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,919
So why are you on my case?

37
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:31,960
I must at least know whose side you are on...

38
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,930
to follow your lead.

39
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,930
Can we please leave?

40
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,800
We will be captured again at this rate.

41
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,139
You can take it up with her...

42
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:50,280
but after we leave this place.

43
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,229
We should rest for a while.

44
00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:19,199
Are you all right?

45
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,969
The pain is bearable, so do not worry.

46
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,180
Allow me to attend to your wound.

47
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,250
Forget it.

48
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,080
It is not like I want to do this.

49
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,120
So do not bother.

50
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,819
No one asked for your help.

51
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:38,389
Please do not be childish.

52
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,788
- What? - If this is not childish behavior,

53
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:41,960
I do not know what is.

54
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,699
You acting this way will not make me tell you who I am.

55
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,870
Gosh.

56
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,810
Wait...

57
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,018
You are a physician,

58
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:42,649
a decent horseback rider, and know how to fight.

59
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,920
On top of that, you have a way with words.

60
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,689
There is no female servant in Joseon who is anything like you.

61
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:50,399
Please get some sleep.

62
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,199
Your energy must be restored.

63
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:54,170
For one last time,

64
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,470
I ask you this.

65
00:05:00,069 --> 00:05:01,110
Was it really your lady...

66
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,540
who put you up to this?

67
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:06,079
Yes.

68
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:10,949
Your lady ordered you to help me,

69
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,750
and none of this was done...

70
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:16,290
of free will?

71
00:05:18,589 --> 00:05:19,589
That is correct.

72
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:25,560
Fine.

73
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,300
You are dismissed.

74
00:05:28,529 --> 00:05:29,569
I ought to rest.

75
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:08,939
I should not have let my guard down.

76
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:11,310
I should have been more careful,

77
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:12,980
and I am to blame.

78
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,750
Please forgive me.

79
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,980
She is someone you answer to, after all.

80
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:21,189
How could you have gotten in her way?

81
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,259
I am to blame for not keeping my daughter in check.

82
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,128
If I find out where she has taken him...

83
00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:28,230
And how would you do that?

84
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:30,929
By torturing her to speak?

85
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,360
(Goshin: Torturing)

86
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:37,939
Father.

87
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,839
It is I, Myung Yoon.

88
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,149
Are you not ashamed?

89
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,050
Do you believe that killing me...

90
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,920
will keep your dirty hidden affair from surfacing?

91
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,660
If that is not enough,

92
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:02,629
I will kill anyone and everyone who knows...

93
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,729
about the secret.

94
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,370
What a devious, despicable monster.

95
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,939
Do you know anything about this acupuncture needle canister?

96
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:17,040
I gave this out to the physicians at the Royal Infirmary.

97
00:07:17,139 --> 00:07:18,879
I wish to find the owner of this canister.

98
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,509
Would you be able to help me?

99
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:23,180
All I did was help you.

100
00:07:23,579 --> 00:07:25,319
So why are you on my case?

101
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,350
I must at least know whose side you are on...

102
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,290
to follow your lead.

103
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,959
Do not forget.

104
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:36,660
The lives of the King, the Queen,

105
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,629
and Prince Dosung depend on what comes out of your mouth.

106
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,100
Yes,

107
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,939
I helped him escape.

108
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:51,509
He is a man of great fortune...

109
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,879
judging by how you seem to save his life every time.

110
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,749
If luck had favored him,

111
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,378
he would not have been abducted in the first place.

112
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,649
He was abducted for your sake.

113
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,420
I am aware of it.

114
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:07,730
I know you made a difficult choice for my sake.

115
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:09,889
And knowing that...

116
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:13,329
is the reason I helped him escape.

117
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,829
You have spent your whole life saving the lives of people.

118
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:18,639
And I could not sit around...

119
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:23,980
and let you get blood on your hands for my sake.

120
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,049
Because I am aware of who you are,

121
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,690
I will not find fault with your past actions.

122
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
However,

123
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:40,460
this is as far as you will go.

124
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,960
Where did you hide him?

125
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:48,899
I asked...

126
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,470
what you did with him.

127
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:55,110
How can you ask me to hurt the person...

128
00:08:55,509 --> 00:08:57,309
that I helped to safety?

129
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:59,179
Are you actually that clueless?

130
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:02,850
The moment he lives and speaks of the truth,

131
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,778
your chances of becoming the Crown Princess and...

132
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:05,779
I will not participate...

133
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,220
in the bridal selection order.

134
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:11,460
Whether it was by force or not, I was in bed with another man...

135
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,669
You are dismissed.

136
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,070
- Father. - I told you...

137
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:28,370
to remove yourself!

138
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,940
Father.

139
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,579
The earth and skies know...

140
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,049
that I have lost my right to be Crown Princess.

141
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:39,349
How could you even think to fool them?

142
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,549
Moo Baek, are you out there?

143
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,690
Escort the lady to her room.

144
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:43,919
I...

145
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,389
am terrified.

146
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,428
I plead with you...

147
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:51,960
because I cannot dare to handle the repercussions.

148
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:55,370
How could I possibly dare to marry the Crown Prince...

149
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,769
while knowingly deceiving him?

150
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,570
I...

151
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,139
will spend my life by your side caring for the sick.

152
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,139
For trying to deceive the royal family,

153
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:08,679
and for hurting an innocent man,

154
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,450
I will repent my sins by condemning myself to solitude.

155
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,289
That being said, I ask that you do not pursue this man.

156
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,080
Lord Choi can be harsh.

157
00:10:40,909 --> 00:10:42,409
As if you did anything wrong.

158
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,549
Of course I am to blame.

159
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,019
This all happened because of me.

160
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,049
Nonsense.

161
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:54,329
This only happened because Lord Choi...

162
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,590
had that scholar abducted.

163
00:10:55,929 --> 00:10:59,029
If I had not been born with a disastrous fate,

164
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,470
my father would not have chosen to abduct a man for my sake.

165
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,469
My lady,

166
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,139
you said you did not believe in our fates being written.

167
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:11,980
I do not.

168
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,909
I do not believe it at all.

169
00:11:16,309 --> 00:11:18,720
However, judging by the mess I got in before marriage...

170
00:11:19,419 --> 00:11:21,490
proves that I am not destined to walk a bed of roses.

171
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,090
My lady...

172
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,330
Do not worry too much.

173
00:11:32,029 --> 00:11:34,398
I will stand guard all night outside the lady's room and...

174
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,399
No.

175
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,600
But that is the only way to find the Crown Prince.

176
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,139
She is a clever girl.

177
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,110
If she catches wind of herself being watched,

178
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,179
she will not make any moves.

179
00:11:47,649 --> 00:11:49,850
Then, what do you propose I do?

180
00:11:50,379 --> 00:11:51,519
We shall let her be...

181
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,419
until she feels safe enough...

182
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,960
to visit the Crown Prince.

183
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,980
Your Majesty.

184
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:31,519
The Chief Royal Secretary...

185
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,589
(Doseungji: Chief Royal Secretary)

186
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,758
met an untimely death.

187
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,189
(Doseungji: Chief Royal Secretary)

188
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,259
What do you mean by that?

189
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,230
An untimely death?

190
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:42,629
How...

191
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:45,669
How could this have happened?

192
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,740
It happened last night,

193
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,980
and I have yet to be informed of the details.

194
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,919
Did you speak to another...

195
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,649
about what we discussed?

196
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,320
I do not know what you mean by that.

197
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:09,090
The other day, I told you that I sent word...

198
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:12,058
to the Training General through the Chief Royal Secretary.

199
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,329
(Hunryeondaejang: The Training General)

200
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,669
Did you speak of that to anyone else?

201
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:19,340
Why will you not answer me?

202
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,169
Did you speak of it or not?

203
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:23,340
Truth be told,

204
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:27,309
constant worries were keeping Mother up at night...

205
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:29,250
that I told her to calm her down.

206
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,149
If the Queen knew,

207
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,490
then the Left State Councilor knew as well.

208
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,059
Is that why the unthinkable happened?

209
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:43,460
The Chief Royal Secretary is dead.

210
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,470
He died before he could relay the message...

211
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,539
to the Training General.

212
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,440
Were you the one who told Grandfather?

213
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,109
Tell him what?

214
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,649
You are the only one I told about Father sending a message...

215
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,049
to the Chief Royal Secretary.

216
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:11,419
I ask because Grandfather seems to know that as well.

217
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,659
Well, I...

218
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,689
Father was here to visit me,

219
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,330
and with the Crown Prince gone,

220
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,229
he seemed to be worried...

221
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,928
about there being trouble within the palace...

222
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:22,570
- which is why... - The Chief Royal Secretary is dead!

223
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,700
Do not forget you are addressing the Queen.

224
00:14:26,139 --> 00:14:27,970
Please lower your voice.

225
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,080
Someone killed the Chief Royal Secretary...

226
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,279
to stop His Majesty from rallying the troops.

227
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:39,980
That someone has to be either Father, Mother, me,

228
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,450
or you, Grandfather.

229
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,690
Only those four people know that such an order was given...

230
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:47,590
to the Chief Royal Secretary.

231
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,490
Father!

232
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,029
Why did you do it?

233
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:53,399
Was it as per the Queen Dowager's orders?

234
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,499
What did you receive...

235
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,069
in exchange for doing her dirty work?

236
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,070
That is correct.

237
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:01,169
I did receive something.

238
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:06,580
Are you curious about what I received in return?

239
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:12,519
A promise that you and your mother would be kept alive.

240
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,619
You two do not have a single clue...

241
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,960
how terrifying the Queen Dowager can be.

242
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,629
Do you know how the former king was deposed?

243
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,330
If she puts her mind to it,

244
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:29,629
she could have His Majesty deposed in a heartbeat.

245
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,539
Do you believe...

246
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,970
that someone like her will think you are out of reach?

247
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,309
My priority is not His Majesty or the Crown Prince.

248
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:42,610
It is you...

249
00:15:43,549 --> 00:15:45,048
and Her Highness.

250
00:15:45,049 --> 00:15:48,189
Father, how could you speak such words?

251
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,490
Your Highness,

252
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,620
you must be smart about this.

253
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:55,529
Siding with His Majesty...

254
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:58,199
will not help Prince Dosung in any way.

255
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,230
Father,

256
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,070
please watch your words.

257
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,699
And I am telling you...

258
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,269
that the Queen Dowager gave me her word.

259
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,039
If we stay put and do nothing,

260
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,079
Prince Dosung will be made Crown Prince.

261
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,110
No.

262
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,749
I have no intention...

263
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,278
of being a puppet like you...

264
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,819
who does the Queen Dowager's bidding.

265
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,820
Prince Dosung.

266
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,519
That is enough.

267
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:24,220
You are frustratingly naive.

268
00:16:24,919 --> 00:16:27,758
His Majesty is lost at the moment...

269
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,190
since the Crown Prince's life is at stake.

270
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:33,628
But how can you not know that your situation...

271
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:35,229
is entirely different?

272
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,229
What do you mean that we are different?

273
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,500
You...

274
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,939
have me behind you.

275
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,639
What do you mean by that?

276
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:49,009
The Queen Dowager?

277
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,149
Once Prince Dosung becomes King,

278
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:59,259
we can simply eliminate her.

279
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,470
Gosh.

280
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,339
Why are you out here?

281
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:52,680
I wanted to get some fresh air.

282
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,809
Are you feeling better?

283
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:59,079
Yes, I am as good as healed.

284
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:20,569
Of course she is fairer than that young maiden.

285
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,809
What?

286
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:27,849
Are you not waiting for that Baek Gu girl?

287
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,579
Why would I wait for her?

288
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,319
How did it go for you?

289
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:38,220
Were you able to contact Sang Soo?

290
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:06,450
So this is where we meet again.

291
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,559
They say continuous coincidences...

292
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,559
are the result of them being inevitable.

293
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,259
Judging by how we continue to cross paths...

294
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,029
makes it seem...

295
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,769
like our fates are entwined.

296
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,940
Can you find it in you to acknowledge me?

297
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,409
One might think...

298
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,579
that I am bothering a lady I have just met.

299
00:19:40,019 --> 00:19:41,589
Someone must be sick again.

300
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:43,049
I will get going.

301
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,529
Can you please step aside? People are watching.

302
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:52,430
You are the same as you were back at home.

303
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,029
Not even the winter wind would be this chilling.

304
00:19:57,569 --> 00:19:58,869
I must say this is upsetting.

305
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,140
Do you not know why I crave your attention?

306
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:04,809
I know why.

307
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,480
I am aware of your feelings for me.

308
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,250
Then you are giving me the cold shoulder...

309
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,519
because you are not interested in me.

310
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:15,890
I am already set...

311
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,420
to marry another.

312
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,328
For that reason,

313
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:23,160
you should find another lady to court.

314
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:14,849
My lady, please take a look at Ae Sim.

315
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,849
Why? Is she sick?

316
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,749
She must have severe indigestion...

317
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,849
because she has tightness in her chest and a headache.

318
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,189
She has acute indigestion,

319
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,660
and I must perform acupuncture.

320
00:22:14,569 --> 00:22:15,569
My lady.

321
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,180
Is he here?

322
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,269
- Where is he? - I am just as clueless.

323
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,339
As you can see, he must have already left.

324
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,140
If you do not believe me, look around all you want.

325
00:23:03,589 --> 00:23:05,259
The Crown Prince had already taken off.

326
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,160
It seems as though we have lost him.

327
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,230
We were not quick enough.

328
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:16,170
I apologize.

329
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,410
Find out where Prince Dosung currently is.

330
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:37,650
Was it as per the Queen Dowager's orders?

331
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,558
What did you receive...

332
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:42,129
in exchange for doing her dirty work?

333
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,430
That is correct. I did receive something.

334
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:49,869
A promise that you and your mother would be kept alive.

335
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,239
You two do not have a single clue...

336
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,210
how terrifying the Queen Dowager can be.

337
00:23:58,009 --> 00:23:59,410
Do you believe...

338
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,480
that someone like her will think you are out of reach?

339
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:07,680
Please allow me to intrude.

340
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:20,059
What brings you all the way here?

341
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,529
I was returning from a house call when I heard you were here.

342
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,098
Hence, I have stopped by.

343
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:26,299
Is that so?

344
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,440
Take a seat.

345
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:39,950
By the way, do you make house calls, even to a kisaeng house?

346
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:44,490
A physician travels to any place patients are.

347
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:47,818
That must be why people...

348
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,960
look up to you and like you.

349
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,069
Right. Would you like a glass?

350
00:24:55,269 --> 00:24:56,400
No.

351
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:00,170
I will leave after asking you a question.

352
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,740
By any chance,

353
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:08,309
do you have feelings for Myung Yoon?

354
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:12,220
I am talking about my daughter.

355
00:25:17,789 --> 00:25:19,390
Did he really leave?

356
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,089
No way. He could not have without a word.

357
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,000
He could not have, could he?

358
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,869
Is he not scared, or is he a fool?

359
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:40,779
It will be the end of him if Father finds out.

360
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:42,380
What is he thinking?

361
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:45,919
Fine. I cannot wait until he returns.

362
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,380
I will teach him a lesson!

363
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:52,589
Forget it.

364
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,289
I hope nothing happens to him.

365
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,609
Kill me, Your Royal Highness.

366
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,910
There is no need.

367
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,619
I heard everything from Gap Seok.

368
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,689
Lift up your head now.

369
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:22,890
No.

370
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,758
I should have served Your Royal Highness with my life.

371
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,589
And yet, I have harmed you.

372
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:30,529
I deserve to die.

373
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:34,460
Do not forgive me of my sin. Please kill me.

374
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,799
All right.

375
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,069
I have many questions for you.

376
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,569
After hearing your answers...

377
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:45,079
will I decide to kill or keep you alive.

378
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,940
For now,

379
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,480
answer my questions.

380
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,259
What did you say just now?

381
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,460
Not only did the Chief Royal Secretary die...

382
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:09,868
but the court lady of the Queen's palace...

383
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:11,369
was also poisoned to death?

384
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:12,839
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

385
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:16,869
Mother...

386
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:20,240
Is Mother safe?

387
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,309
Yes. However...

388
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,250
having received a great shock,

389
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,789
she is still in distress.

390
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:32,960
Since then, Court Lady Kim of the Queen Dowager's quarters...

391
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,730
has been in contact with the Left State Councilor.

392
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,130
That means the matter of the Queen's palace...

393
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:41,460
was executed...

394
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:45,339
by the Queen Dowager, targeting the Left State Councilor's betrayal.

395
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:49,670
You should be extra careful.

396
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,640
Once they find out you helped me survive,

397
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,808
they will kill you.

398
00:27:54,809 --> 00:27:57,049
I do not care what happens to me.

399
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,849
However, even though I am spying on the Queen Dowager's quarters,

400
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,190
nothing is happening.

401
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,619
It seems they do not know of this.

402
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:10,160
That is a relief.

403
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,200
I must inform you, Your Royal Highness.

404
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,529
The Queen Dowager met a man...

405
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,730
at Buyong Pavilion again.

406
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,099
"A man?"

407
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,210
To meet a man...

408
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,470
when Physician Heo died.

409
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:26,639
Are you sure?

410
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,640
Yes.

411
00:28:27,641 --> 00:28:29,910
A court lady of the Queen Dowager's quarters who witnessed it told me.

412
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,019
There is no doubt.

413
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:42,859
The court lady of the Queen Dowager's quarters...

414
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,099
must be on her side.

415
00:28:46,059 --> 00:28:47,359
How can we believe her?

416
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,528
It could be another trick or trap.

417
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,839
Your Royal Highness. That very court lady...

418
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,940
is the one who informed you...

419
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:58,980
against the Queen Dowager.

420
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:15,689
Your Royal Highness.

421
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,789
Simply because we serve the Queen Dowager...

422
00:29:17,329 --> 00:29:19,299
does not mean we are on her side.

423
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,670
Many follow her orders to save...

424
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:25,269
their pathetic lives like mine...

425
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,868
or act like they obey her.

426
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:30,809
I, too, do not think...

427
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,680
everyone in the palace is the Queen Dowager's people.

428
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,809
However,

429
00:29:35,849 --> 00:29:38,049
if that court lady's words are true,

430
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,990
the man I have seen is...

431
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:54,930
Your heart is beating slowly.

432
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:58,299
We must correct it first. Allow me to apply acupuncture.

433
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,170
Go ahead.

434
00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:18,450
The deposed king only kept disloyal vassals by his side,

435
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:20,819
so I thought he was a bad judge of character.

436
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,059
But I suppose he was right about you, after all.

437
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,960
The truth is, Prince Gwangchang...

438
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:28,098
had the filthy blood of your secret lover...

439
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:29,299
Shut your mouth.

440
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,299
It looks like you truly wish to get killed.

441
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,740
You are going to kill me anyway. Am I wrong?

442
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:13,079
Apply a 1.5 acupuncture...

443
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,980
on the blood passageway.

444
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:21,849
Stop.

445
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:28,630
Everyone but the physician is to leave.

446
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:30,190
Your Majesty!

447
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,259
Please give us privacy.

448
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:39,799
Understood, Your Majesty.

449
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,460
If you run your mouth,

450
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,359
your tongue will be cut off...

451
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,769
and your eyes will be dug out.

452
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:11,369
Understood?

453
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,140
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

454
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:16,710
Come closer.

455
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,319
Why are you doing this?

456
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,450
You have endured well until now, no?

457
00:33:04,849 --> 00:33:07,460
- Just a bit more... - I cannot do it any longer.

458
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,029
I tried to endure it one way or another.

459
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,660
But whenever I close my eyes,

460
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:17,529
I am reminded...

461
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,200
of Physician Heo and the Chief Royal Secretary.

462
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,779
It makes it impossible for me to breathe.

463
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,960
Soo Ryeon.

464
00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:47,500
Sang Rok.

465
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:58,140
Can we not run somewhere far away and live in hiding?

466
00:33:58,569 --> 00:33:59,980
Let us do that.

467
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:02,150
All I need is you.

468
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,750
You told me I was all you needed, no?

469
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:09,650
Do you think I have not thought of that?

470
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,389
When you married the late king and became the Queen...

471
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,190
When you were incarcerated by the deposed king...

472
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:21,559
And when you were reinstated as the Queen Dowager...

473
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:27,039
I always thought of running away with you.

474
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,869
It is not too late to run away now.

475
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,909
Let us run away, no?

476
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,178
We may be able to get out of the palace.

477
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:37,179
However,

478
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,219
they will chase after us until the very end.

479
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,348
We will be found and killed.

480
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:45,760
I do not care.

481
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,889
Even if it is for a single day,

482
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,829
if I can live...

483
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:57,130
peacefully...

484
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,199
by your side as your wife,

485
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,638
I will be more than happy to die right now.

486
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:06,880
How can you talk of dying so lightly?

487
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,610
That is denying my 30 years of life.

488
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,750
Sang Rok.

489
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,519
All those years...

490
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:15,889
Do you know how difficult it was for me to survive the years of misery?

491
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:22,389
Of course, I will not let you die.

492
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:40,309
Even if they cut my head off and hang it on the main street,

493
00:35:42,949 --> 00:35:44,880
I will be sure to keep you safe.

494
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:14,909
Now that Yoon Yi Kyum, the Left State Councilor, is on our side,

495
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,679
there is nothing the King can do. Am I wrong?

496
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,119
But can we trust the Left State Councilor?

497
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,589
I believe we can trust him...

498
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,389
until Prince Dosung is installed as the Crown Prince.

499
00:36:26,789 --> 00:36:29,960
As long as he wants to see Prince Dosung on the throne,

500
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,860
he will not be able to betray us.

501
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,230
But will Prince Dosung...

502
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,929
obey us without rebelling?

503
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,598
He truly cares for the Crown Prince as if he is his own brother.

504
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:43,039
When a man falls in love,

505
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:45,840
many things change.

506
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,480
He can suddenly abandon things he thought he could never abandon...

507
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:52,420
and can do things he thought he would never do.

508
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,690
Not every man in the world...

509
00:36:56,889 --> 00:36:58,849
loves as deeply as you do.

510
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,389
Do not worry.

511
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,159
I already checked, so I know.

512
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,230
Who is the woman Prince Dosung fancies?

513
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,570
How could you be so sure?

514
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,269
My daughter, Myung Yoon.

515
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,400
Myung Yoon? But she will be the Crown Princess...

516
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,710
Then...

517
00:37:19,711 --> 00:37:22,409
Since he now fancies the woman who will soon become the Crown Princess,

518
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:26,050
he must become the Crown Prince to make her his.

519
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,618
Hence, he cannot say no...

520
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:31,250
when you tell him that you wish to make him the Crown Prince.

521
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:34,159
Myung Yoon can surely...

522
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:37,789
make Prince Dosung turn his back on the Crown Prince.

523
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,159
Simply turning his back on him will not do.

524
00:37:44,769 --> 00:37:46,400
She should make him stab him in the back.

525
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:56,409
If it is not Physician Heo,

526
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:59,750
does it mean the needle canister belongs to someone else?

527
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,179
Gosh, I am so hungry.

528
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:04,389
You must be starving too.

529
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:10,289
Why did Physician Heo have to take his own life that day, of all times?

530
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:13,260
- Why? - Shall we go and get some food?

531
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,059
It is getting late, but...

532
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,199
You should not go to bed on an empty stomach.

533
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:20,599
You need to take your medicine too.

534
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:54,739
Gosh.

535
00:39:02,449 --> 00:39:04,110
Decoct your own medicine.

536
00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:10,889
Are you mad at me?

537
00:39:11,389 --> 00:39:12,389
Why would I be?

538
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:14,559
So you are mad at me.

539
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:16,690
Did I keep you waiting long?

540
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,800
Why would I wait for you?

541
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:21,860
Then why are you still here?

542
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:28,969
Where have you been wandering around all day?

543
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:30,409
"Wandering around?"

544
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,039
You went out in that state. What if something else happened?

545
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:36,280
You have not learned your lesson even after suffering like crazy?

546
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,579
- "Suffering like crazy?" - Forget it.

547
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:40,419
I do not care whether you live or die,

548
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,179
so do whatever you want.

549
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:44,719
My Baek Gu.

550
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,690
I suppose you were very worried about me.

551
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,460
Yes.

552
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,029
You are still recovering from your stab wound,

553
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,268
but you disappeared without a word,

554
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,900
and I heard nothing from you for over an hour.

555
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:02,769
Of course, I was worried thinking you might be dead.

556
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,250
Be careful until your wound fully heals,

557
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,650
and do not forget to take your medicine on time.

558
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,619
I wish you health and wellness.

559
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,489
I am sorry.

560
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:23,829
I had to go somewhere urgently...

561
00:40:24,929 --> 00:40:26,360
and did not think how worried you would be.

562
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:32,869
I apologize. Please forgive me now.

563
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:41,139
If you are truly sorry,

564
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:43,750
you must promise me first.

565
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:47,019
- Promise you what? - Promise me...

566
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,519
you will never go out again until I tell you that it is safe.

567
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,389
Sure. I promise.

568
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,800
But...

569
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,170
I have a favor to ask of you.

570
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,139
What is it?

571
00:41:06,539 --> 00:41:09,440
Can I go out just once more?

572
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:12,369
- Why, you... - I am still recovering, you see.

573
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,880
Darn it.

574
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,320
Just once more. Please?

575
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,489
(Physician Heo Jin Soo's funeral)

576
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,869
My gosh.

577
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,198
Oh, dear.

578
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:40,570
Gosh, my goodness.

579
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:41,739
Oh, boy.

580
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,570
My gosh.

581
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,980
No...

582
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:54,119
Gosh.

583
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:00,389
My goodness.

584
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:04,929
Do you want to be caught and called a thief?

585
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:16,969
Get moving, will you?

586
00:42:24,579 --> 00:42:25,610
- No... - My goodness.

587
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:44,969
Oh, dear.

588
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,409
Wait.

589
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,960
Do you want to be caught and called a thief?

590
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:32,170
Do not be scared.

591
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:35,039
I am right here.

592
00:44:36,179 --> 00:44:37,210
It is not that.

593
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:41,119
I have never performed an autopsy,

594
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:43,889
so I could be wrong.

595
00:44:44,889 --> 00:44:45,920
Like I said,

596
00:44:46,489 --> 00:44:47,820
we just need to figure out if he truly...

597
00:44:48,659 --> 00:44:49,929
took his own life or was murdered.

598
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:53,299
Based on the location of the livor mortis...

599
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:54,859
(Livor mortis: Postmortem stain)

600
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,170
He did not take his own life.

601
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:08,909
Look.

602
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,820
I believe someone poisoned him...

603
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:15,679
and hung him to make it look like he killed himself.

604
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:22,619
Why are you so surprised...

605
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,260
to hear that I must see Dosung?

606
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:25,730
You cannot meet him now.

607
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,459
Everyone in the palace knows...

608
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:30,198
that the two of you are very close.

609
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:33,339
So they must have someone tailing Dosung too.

610
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,968
Since you know that, why...

611
00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:38,369
At the moment, Dosung is the only one I can trust.

612
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:41,239
Even so, it is too risky.

613
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,709
If he shows up with someone on his tail...

614
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:44,780
I know that Dosung...

615
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:48,219
is certainly capable of giving them the slip.

616
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:51,319
But how are you going to let him know when and where...

617
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,690
you wish to meet him?

618
00:45:57,659 --> 00:45:58,860
I have this.

619
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:04,500
How will he know where to meet you through this?

620
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:54,078
I think we should have...

621
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,979
a secret spot...

622
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,750
that only the two of us know.

623
00:46:58,820 --> 00:46:59,960
A secret spot?

624
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:18,039
(Joseon Tongbo)

625
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:23,250
You must never lose it.

626
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:26,010
In an emergency, we will use it as the token of our promise.

627
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:29,690
- The token of our promise? - Correct.

628
00:47:29,949 --> 00:47:31,550
If one of us...

629
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:33,659
sends this to the other person,

630
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,960
it means we will meet here.

631
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,630
In secret. No one else can know about it.

632
00:47:40,929 --> 00:47:42,199
What is with you? You are scaring me.

633
00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:44,429
"Scared?" Why are you scared?

634
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:46,340
Why do we need a secret spot all of a sudden?

635
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,670
And what is with this halved coin?

636
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,639
I already explained everything. Why are you asking this again?

637
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:54,939
It is because I do not understand. Why do we need this?

638
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:55,980
Do you not know...

639
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:58,809
that people are dying in the palace, accused of treason?

640
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:03,190
Father could be accused of treason too,

641
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,989
so we should prepare ourselves for the worst-case scenario.

642
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,349
Gun.

643
00:48:42,289 --> 00:48:43,630
Are you hurt?

644
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:45,760
How come you did not send a messenger sooner?

645
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:50,099
Did you want to see your brother losing his mind?

646
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:54,269
We should go inside.

647
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:04,849
In any case,

648
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,550
I should have found you first.

649
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,219
Forgive me, Gun.

650
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,389
Do you truly mean it?

651
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:17,159
Sorry?

652
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:19,090
I am asking you if you are still on my side.

653
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:20,630
Gun.

654
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,629
I heard the Left State Councilor...

655
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,469
already joined hands with the Queen Dowager.

656
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:27,369
What is it that you want to hear?

657
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,510
Because my grandfather betrayed you,

658
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:32,868
you wish to know if I am now on the Queen Dowager's side too?

659
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:33,980
Are you?

660
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:38,250
Why did you want to see me if you could not trust me at all?

661
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:41,880
To see if I would hand you over to them?

662
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:44,489
Did you want to check and find out for yourself?

663
00:49:53,059 --> 00:49:55,099
It narrowly missed the heart.

664
00:49:56,469 --> 00:49:57,570
This is...

665
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,739
the outcome of trusting those...

666
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,670
whom I thought I would never doubt even in my dreams.

667
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:06,940
And is that why...

668
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:10,809
you are suspecting your only brother too?

669
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:18,489
I could die in your stead,

670
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:24,630
but I did not want to die because of you.

671
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,399
Do you understand?

672
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,729
No, I do not.

673
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,530
No, I will never understand!

674
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,869
I do not care even if I have to die because of you.

675
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:39,979
I will follow you to the afterlife if you tell me to,

676
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:41,110
so why would you...

677
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:46,750
I am sorry, Dosung.

678
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,690
I hear the construction of the temporary palace...

679
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,158
near the fortress in Mount Bukhan is now complete.

680
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:02,030
(Haenggung: A palace built for temporary accommodation)

681
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:06,070
I will go there myself and check.

682
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,969
Consider yourselves informed.

683
00:51:10,469 --> 00:51:12,940
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

684
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,050
He suddenly wishes to visit the fortress in Mount Bukhan?

685
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,690
He must be on pins and needles these days.

686
00:51:24,889 --> 00:51:26,959
I am sure he is not going there just for formalities' sake.

687
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,860
He is not going there to visit the temporary palace.

688
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:31,459
He wants to visit the soldiers in the Military Training Corps.

689
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,130
Then what should we do now?

690
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,800
We certainly do not have the power...

691
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:37,598
to fight the King's army.

692
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,768
We cannot beat him through military means. We must find another way.

693
00:51:40,769 --> 00:51:42,670
But he is doggedly determined.

694
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:45,269
Is there a way to take him down?

695
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:52,780
I believe it is time...

696
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:54,849
to use the last resort.

697
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:00,388
You mean Royal Physician Choi Sang Rok...

698
00:52:00,389 --> 00:52:02,090
was the Queen Dowager's secret lover?

699
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,090
At first, I could not believe it either.

700
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:07,699
But I kept racking my brain,

701
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,630
and it was the only plausible answer I could think of.

702
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,429
Is there evidence?

703
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,840
The acupuncture needle canister.

704
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,610
It was found in Buyong Pavilion...

705
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,610
where she had her secret rendezvous.

706
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:25,309
Do you happen to know anything about this acupuncture needle canister?

707
00:52:28,949 --> 00:52:32,449
I gave this out to the physicians at the Royal Infirmary.

708
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:35,690
Where did you get it?

709
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,829
Yes, I know about it too.

710
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:41,929
I visited Choi Sang Rok to ask him if he knew who owned the canister...

711
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,969
as per Father's order.

712
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,900
He probably told you it was Physician Heo's.

713
00:52:47,139 --> 00:52:49,199
And when you visited Physician Heo to ask him about it...

714
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,139
He was already dead.

715
00:52:54,179 --> 00:52:55,280
Correct.

716
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:59,179
Hence, I could not investigate further.

717
00:53:01,119 --> 00:53:03,919
To conceal who he really was,

718
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,690
Choi Sang Rok cut off his tail.

719
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:10,360
Gun, Physician Heo took his own life.

720
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:15,529
No, he did not take his own life. He was murdered.

721
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:16,699
Are you sure about that?

722
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:19,070
I do not know about other things,

723
00:53:20,369 --> 00:53:23,170
but I am certain he did not kill himself. He was murdered.

724
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:27,139
However, the fact that he was murdered...

725
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,179
cannot serve as evidence that Choi Sang Rok is her secret lover.

726
00:53:34,150 --> 00:53:35,980
The two of them were the only physicians...

727
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,519
who were allowed to enter the Queen Dowager's chambers.

728
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:41,920
The day Choi told you that the canister belonged to Heo,

729
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:43,760
Heo...

730
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,960
was murdered.

731
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:50,699
Could it really be a coincidence?

732
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,739
No. If Choi Sang Rok is not her secret lover,

733
00:53:55,769 --> 00:53:57,739
he must know who her lover is.

734
00:53:58,570 --> 00:53:59,939
It is one of the two.

735
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,039
Gun. However,

736
00:54:01,809 --> 00:54:03,448
all we have is circumstantial evidence.

737
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:05,079
We do not have concrete proof.

738
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:08,780
If Choi Sang Rok keeps denying it, then what are we going to do?

739
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,590
We must find a way to make him confess the truth.

740
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:15,619
Can we find a way to do that?

741
00:54:17,789 --> 00:54:18,960
Do you trust me?

742
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:22,960
Yes. Unlike you, I am not untrusting.

743
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:30,510
Then how about we work together on this, like the old days?

744
00:54:33,409 --> 00:54:36,010
Sure. Just tell me what to do.

745
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:39,448
How long do you think it would take...

746
00:54:39,449 --> 00:54:42,880
for you to return to the palace, then go to the Public Dispensary?

747
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:46,690
About half a day, I would say.

748
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:50,929
Then you should get moving.

749
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:07,340
I heard you asked for me, Your Majesty.

750
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:09,309
Yes.

751
00:55:09,579 --> 00:55:13,250
I stayed up thinking all night,

752
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:19,250
but you were the only one I could think of.

753
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:22,019
I suppose I have come to rely on you a lot...

754
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,989
without even realizing it.

755
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:27,460
I am much obliged, Your Highness.

756
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:31,599
No one in the Internal Court is kinder...

757
00:55:32,769 --> 00:55:34,469
and more affectionate than you.

758
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:35,739
That is why...

759
00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:39,139
I mustered up the courage...

760
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:44,079
to ask you for one last time to join hands with me.

761
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:49,820
Queen, as of this moment, I will talk to you...

762
00:55:51,250 --> 00:55:53,019
not as the Queen Dowager,

763
00:55:53,619 --> 00:55:57,429
but as another woman just like you,

764
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,630
so I ask you to please...

765
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:04,000
consider me one of your fellow women and hear me out.

766
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:05,869
Yes, Your Majesty.

767
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,969
The King must have already told you...

768
00:56:10,269 --> 00:56:12,439
about my secret lover.

769
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,579
Pardon me?

770
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:15,879
Well, that is...

771
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,849
Yes, it is true.

772
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:22,150
There is a man whom I have fancied for a long time.

773
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:25,820
We have fancied each other since a young age.

774
00:56:25,889 --> 00:56:27,889
In fact, we were engaged.

775
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:32,760
However, I suppose we were not destined to be husband and wife.

776
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,799
I was chosen to marry the late king.

777
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:37,428
(Seondaewang: Late King)

778
00:56:37,429 --> 00:56:39,170
Thus began my life in the palace.

779
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:42,340
Many years later,

780
00:56:43,639 --> 00:56:45,969
we met again.

781
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:50,250
Ten, twenty years...

782
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,079
Thirty years.

783
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:57,949
My love for him...

784
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:00,789
was what enabled me...

785
00:57:01,989 --> 00:57:04,829
to endure everything and hold out all those years.

786
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:08,230
I shed so many tears.

787
00:57:10,369 --> 00:57:11,630
I cried and cried.

788
00:57:12,699 --> 00:57:15,300
I tried to take my own life...

789
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:18,110
several times.

790
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:24,150
You see, I do not care what happens to me.

791
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:29,550
If everyone wants to hurl stones at me,

792
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:33,690
tell them to go ahead for I am prepared to be stoned to death.

793
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,360
However, I cannot see him suffer.

794
00:57:40,429 --> 00:57:42,530
He did nothing wrong.

795
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:45,829
All he did was put his life on the line...

796
00:57:45,969 --> 00:57:48,969
to protect the woman he loved.

797
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:51,139
He did nothing wrong at all.

798
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:54,439
Your Majesty, please calm down.

799
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:58,349
Queen, I do not need power, money, or anything for that matter.

800
00:57:58,679 --> 00:58:02,079
I only wish to be with him. That is all I want.

801
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:05,090
I cherish him more than my own life,

802
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,289
so I want and am ready to give up my all...

803
00:58:08,489 --> 00:58:10,489
to protect him. That is all.

804
00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:11,960
Your Highness.

805
00:58:17,969 --> 00:58:19,030
Queen.

806
00:58:19,769 --> 00:58:21,139
Help me, please.

807
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:24,969
If you earnestly plead with the King, he will listen to you.

808
00:58:26,539 --> 00:58:28,638
The last thing you want is another bloodbath in the palace...

809
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:31,679
for you do not want to see the King or Prince Dosung get hurt.

810
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:34,150
I surely know that.

811
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,449
If I could get the King's permission,

812
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,150
the Crown Prince will return to the palace,

813
00:58:41,019 --> 00:58:42,090
and I...

814
00:58:44,789 --> 00:58:46,130
I will leave.

815
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:49,599
I will leave the palace. He and I...

816
00:58:52,099 --> 00:58:53,570
will leave quietly.

817
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,510
We will spend the rest of our lives...

818
00:58:57,969 --> 00:58:59,210
in a place where no one can find us.

819
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:04,309
We will live in hiding as if we are dead.

820
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:07,380
Please persuade the King...

821
00:59:08,949 --> 00:59:11,119
to let me leave the palace.

822
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,129
Because of my father,

823
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:20,629
(Gachin: Father)

824
00:59:20,630 --> 00:59:23,059
His Majesty has been distancing himself from me,

825
00:59:24,699 --> 00:59:27,539
so I cannot help you even if I want to.

826
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,210
Then...

827
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:37,380
we should do this.

828
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:50,960
Your Majesty.

829
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:54,659
Her Highness the Queen is here.

830
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:58,869
She may enter.

831
01:00:26,889 --> 01:00:28,099
What brings you here?

832
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:31,699
I heard you had not been eating.

833
01:00:31,969 --> 01:00:33,230
So I...

834
01:00:33,869 --> 01:00:37,139
prepared a few dishes that could bring back your appetite.

835
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:45,610
Queen.

836
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:48,679
When you lie,

837
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:52,349
it shows on your face. Did you know that?

838
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:53,760
Pardon me?

839
01:00:54,659 --> 01:00:58,190
How could I dare to lie to Your Majesty?

840
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:04,099
If you are here to talk to me about something,

841
01:01:05,269 --> 01:01:06,369
go ahead and say it.

842
01:01:07,139 --> 01:01:08,369
No, Your Majesty.

843
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:12,110
I really am here for I prepared a meal for you.

844
01:01:17,579 --> 01:01:18,809
Fine.

845
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,449
They may bring in the food.

846
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:25,889
Giddyap!

847
01:02:59,849 --> 01:03:02,579
Your Majesty, please try the food.

848
01:03:24,710 --> 01:03:25,940
Have some more.

849
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:29,880
You must eat well to recover quickly. All right?

850
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:31,679
Here, open wide.

851
01:03:38,289 --> 01:03:39,289
Here.

852
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:54,539
I heard the royal physician would be here today.

853
01:03:55,269 --> 01:03:56,570
The royal physician?

854
01:03:56,739 --> 01:03:59,440
Oh, go to the back.

855
01:04:18,929 --> 01:04:19,989
My lady.

856
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:24,070
Lord Choi wants you to visit a patient.

857
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,769
Where is the patient?

858
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:28,239
I will take you there.

859
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:30,369
The patient needs urgent care, so we should hurry.

860
01:05:20,389 --> 01:05:22,420
Why are you not asking me anything?

861
01:05:23,289 --> 01:05:25,630
Will you answer truthfully?

862
01:05:27,059 --> 01:05:29,059
Are you not here because you already know everything?

863
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:30,630
Call me foolish.

864
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:36,539
I suppose I wanted to hear you deny it even until this moment.

865
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:42,179
The man the Queen Dowager met at Buyong Pavilion.

866
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:44,980
Was it you?

867
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:50,019
Yes, it was I.

868
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:55,690
I am the Queen Dowager's... No.

869
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,929
I am the man who has been in love with the woman...

870
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:01,360
named Min Soo Ryeon for many years.

871
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:02,929
I am her lover.

872
01:06:11,369 --> 01:06:12,409
Giddyap!

873
01:06:14,309 --> 01:06:15,340
Giddyap!

874
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:19,679
How could you be so confident?

875
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:22,448
You had a secret affair with the Queen Dowager...

876
01:06:22,449 --> 01:06:24,889
and took many lives just to conceal it.

877
01:06:25,750 --> 01:06:29,320
Do you think your so-called "love" can be forgiven?

878
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,328
I can and will do worse things to protect the woman...

879
01:06:33,329 --> 01:06:35,699
with whom I have been in love for 30 years.

880
01:06:36,199 --> 01:06:37,260
Shut your mouth!

881
01:06:38,199 --> 01:06:39,899
The moment you decided to have an affair with her,

882
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,538
you disrespected His Majesty...

883
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,300
and insulted the Royal House.

884
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:47,109
How dare you speak of love?

885
01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:49,980
She was my fiancee.

886
01:06:50,849 --> 01:06:53,880
Even way before she fell prey to the old king,

887
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,820
she was mine.

888
01:06:58,619 --> 01:07:01,659
I suppose you want to get the Queen Dowager killed too.

889
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:03,789
Fine.

890
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:07,289
I will make sure even your souls cannot meet again.

891
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:10,399
I will behead you two and cut you to pieces.

892
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,029
Then I will scatter your remains all over the mountains...

893
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:13,670
so you would get eaten by wild animals!

894
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:35,820
(Public Dispensary)

895
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,110
Here comes Lee Gun, the traitor. Tie him up!

896
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:50,319
(Missing Crown Prince)

897
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,659
They took His Royal Highness.

898
01:09:52,829 --> 01:09:54,599
You know that they are after me.

899
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:55,698
It is pointless.

900
01:09:55,699 --> 01:09:58,198
Father has collapsed.

901
01:09:58,199 --> 01:10:01,238
- Bow to the Queen Dowager. - Bow to the Queen Dowager.

902
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:03,899
I hereby appoint Choi Sang Rok as Inspector General.

903
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:05,469
Cancel it at once!

904
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:06,810
Before I slay all of you.

905
01:10:06,909 --> 01:10:08,109
Go ahead and slay me.

906
01:10:09,579 --> 01:10:11,079
Please die.

907
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:13,108
I do not know how I would pay for being such an unfilial son...

908
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:14,879
once I die.

909
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,920
Are you really going to die like this?
