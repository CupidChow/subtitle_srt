(in this drama are historically irrelevant and fictitious.)

(Production guidelines were strictly followed...)

11
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:48,820
(when filming with children and animals.)

12
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:52,020
(Episode 8)

13
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:03,899
Young Master.

14
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,700
Your Royal...

15
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,040
Gap Seok.

16
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:12,439
Young Master.

17
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:15,849
Young Master...

18
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:27,359
(Your Royal Highness)

19
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:33,000
(We should make a run for it, no?)

20
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,310
(No)

21
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,340
(But we might not get another chance.)

22
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,780
(I said no.)

23
00:01:48,849 --> 00:01:49,849
Goodness.

24
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:51,878
It hurts badly!

25
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,250
It hurts.

26
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,420
Your Royal Highness.

27
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,489
Do not just stand there. Get them on their feet.

28
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:00,859
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

29
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,829
Young Master...

30
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,530
What now?

31
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,030
Get them!

32
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,199
No...

33
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,469
Young Master.

34
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:51,580
- We should go. - What about my lady?

35
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:52,939
Hurry.

36
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,280
- But she... - I get it, okay?

37
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:58,919
Gap Seok will escort her.

38
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,849
- What are you doing? - Darn it.

39
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:10,258
Go after him. The rest will follow me.

40
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:11,259
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

41
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,589
(Clinic)

42
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,189
I apologize for bringing you here when you need to recover.

43
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:21,389
I could not think of another place that would be safe for us.

44
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,889
I doubt it.

45
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,929
You probably brought us here...

46
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,360
since they would not think we would be hiding...

47
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,870
where they originally found us.

48
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,769
Wait here.

49
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,079
Come over here.

50
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,829
How are you feeling?

51
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,069
I am all right.

52
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,639
Gap Seok will have escaped with your lady,

53
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,410
so do not worry too much.

54
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,240
You saw how nimble he is.

55
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,480
Truth be told, his fighting skills exceed mine.

56
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:43,209
Is it too cold?

57
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:44,839
I am all right.

58
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:49,110
I apologize for troubling you like this.

59
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:50,720
Try to get some sleep.

60
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:52,449
I also need to rest.

61
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,100
You are like a puppy who needs to relieve itself.

62
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,100
What?

63
00:07:43,769 --> 00:07:46,669
You are only making me dizzy, so sit still.

64
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,569
I am pacing because I cannot bring myself to just sit around.

65
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,879
I am not sitting around because I am at ease.

66
00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:56,910
I am not at ease, to say the least.

67
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,949
No one told you to follow us.

68
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,689
Who are you blaming?

69
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,959
Why did Oh Wol get sick?

70
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:06,389
We had to stay in a cave...

71
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:09,360
- and shabby huts like this... - No one told you to come.

72
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,759
You persistently followed us even though we told you to go.

73
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:14,870
Persistently?

74
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,698
It is not like we wanted this.

75
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:19,769
Why did you follow us, then?

76
00:08:22,839 --> 00:08:24,008
It is because we did not know...

77
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:25,778
you were scoundrels who kidnapped women.

78
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:27,040
As if I am the only one.

79
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,879
Your father kidnapped someone first.

80
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:31,420
Not only did he kidnap my young master,

81
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,389
he also tried to have him killed.

82
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,490
If we are scoundrels, that makes your father a murderer!

83
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:19,559
Your hands are as cold as ice.

84
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,070
Baek Gu, can you hear me?

85
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,440
This must be hard for you too.

86
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:11,779
Will you be all right?

87
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,529
What could have hurt you so badly?

88
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,559
Was it my father?

89
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,830
I wish to be by your side.

90
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:39,470
I may not be much of a help to you, but let me stay by your side...

91
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:41,870
and aid you as the servant Baek Gu.

92
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,379
I know I cannot be forgiven,

93
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,980
but just let me stay by your side.

94
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,779
How are you feeling?

95
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,580
Are you still cold?

96
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,549
No, I feel much better.

97
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,990
I apologize.

98
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,529
I am relieved to hear that you are feeling better.

99
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,480
Do you still wish to come with me?

100
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,450
- Pardon? - You almost died last night.

101
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,950
You may find yourself in another risky situation,

102
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:35,919
- so... - I will go with you.

103
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,429
If it is all right with you,

104
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,029
I would like to ask your lady...

105
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,668
and have you become a commoner.

106
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:54,268
(Myeoncheon: Allowing a slave to become a commoner)

107
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:55,440
What are your thoughts on that?

108
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:00,110
I say this because you are a talented girl.

109
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,250
Once you become a commoner,

110
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:05,519
you will get to live freely doing whatever you want to do.

111
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:08,090
Fortunately, I have the money to pay for it,

112
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,659
so let me know if that is what you want.

113
00:14:17,529 --> 00:14:19,159
I appreciate your offer,

114
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:22,128
but escaping this place is a priority,

115
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,669
and we must find the others.

116
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,870
It does not seem like the right time to discuss my class.

117
00:14:28,169 --> 00:14:29,240
May I answer you...

118
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,909
some other time?

119
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:33,840
You are right.

120
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:37,110
Are you able to move?

121
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,649
Yes.

122
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,840
Should we not try to find the royal seal?

123
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,379
To install the new Crown Prince, we need the seal to...

124
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,710
We must postpone the coronation as much as we can.

125
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,919
Once Prince Dosung is installed as Crown Prince,

126
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,950
Left State Councilor Yoon...

127
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,090
could kill His Majesty so that Prince Dosung can be King.

128
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,230
Do you believe what the deposed Crown Prince said?

129
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:25,629
Yes, that is why I am not looking...

130
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:29,330
for the royal seal.

131
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,600
To safely leave the palace as we planned...

132
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,940
Your Majesty.

133
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,539
Left State Councilor Yoon is here.

134
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,850
Let him enter.

135
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,190
This is the royal seal.

136
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,860
Did the Queen hand it over?

137
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,609
How dare you deceive Her Majesty?

138
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,440
Is this not a forgery?

139
00:16:45,309 --> 00:16:47,039
Who cares if it is a forgery?

140
00:16:48,379 --> 00:16:50,609
It will be known as the royal seal...

141
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,879
if you say that it is.

142
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,149
It might work with the royal seal,

143
00:16:57,389 --> 00:17:00,460
but that will not be the case with the national seal.

144
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:02,489
What if the Emperor notices...

145
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:04,088
that the seal on the document is a forgery?

146
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,769
How are you planning on handling his fury?

147
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:10,099
What should we do, then?

148
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,769
Should we all die?

149
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:17,410
I have put my life on the line for this mission,

150
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,009
but you do not seem...

151
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,710
that invested in it.

152
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,618
If things go south,

153
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:31,049
I will be slayed for committing treason,

154
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,858
which is why I am ready to pull out my sword...

155
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:35,730
and fight to the death.

156
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:37,960
Should I do...

157
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:40,160
just that?

158
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,410
"Office of Astrology has confirmed..."

159
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,880
"that the first day of the next month is auspicious."

160
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,149
"That is why the coronation of the new Crown Prince..."

161
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:56,410
"will take place on that day."

162
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:58,949
"It is a celebratory event..."

163
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:01,690
"to which we welcome the heir to the throne,"

164
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,789
"so expedite the installation of the Office of Investiture..."

165
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:07,618
"and make sure nothing is overlooked..."

166
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,089
"while preparing to welcome our new Crown Prince."

167
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,700
- Absolutely, Your Majesty. - Absolutely, Your Majesty.

168
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,480
What is this about?

169
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,608
Your Highness,

170
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,109
it is Court Lady Cho.

171
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,420
Your Highness, congratulations.

172
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,990
A day has been set for the Crown Prince coronation.

173
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,559
- Are you sure? - Yes.

174
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,930
Magistrate Yoon has left to bring Prince Dosung to the palace.

175
00:18:47,829 --> 00:18:48,829
Your Highness,

176
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:52,099
could something be troubling you?

177
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,150
Please die.

178
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,579
If I obey you and die,

179
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:09,390
Father will be your next target.

180
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,190
Am I wrong?

181
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:14,289
Because as long as Father is alive,

182
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:18,299
Dosung cannot become King.

183
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,259
My lord, I have brought the prisoners.

184
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:57,529
I must see them in person, so bring them inside.

185
00:19:58,099 --> 00:19:59,140
Pardon?

186
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,069
Of course.

187
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,690
Leave the prisoners and excuse yourselves.

188
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:19,789
Pardon?

189
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:26,930
I said you were dismissed!

190
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:41,109
Gap Seok.

191
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,819
I hope you are not injured.

192
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,319
I am fine.

193
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:50,319
How did you know we would be captured?

194
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,589
More importantly, how did you get in here?

195
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,890
I sneaked in last night when no one was here.

196
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,970
Then,

197
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:03,899
have you been hiding here all night?

198
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,940
Yes.

199
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,599
I waited for him while fighting off sleep...

200
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:11,210
and as soon as the village head...

201
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,279
finally entered,

202
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,309
I took him hostage.

203
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,250
You rescued me once again.

204
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,319
You did well.

205
00:21:22,789 --> 00:21:24,119
There is another door over here.

206
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,559
Shall we, Young Master?

207
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,630
Hold on. What about my lady?

208
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,809
But...

209
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,150
Wait...

210
00:21:59,589 --> 00:22:01,990
- That man... - He is Choi Sang Rok's bodyguard.

211
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,200
Is he?

212
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,730
Yes.

213
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:13,099
I will go with his lord.

214
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:15,710
Just leave, will you?

215
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,069
Because of you...

216
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,979
I will make sure I do not cause trouble.

217
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,309
No. Rather, I will be of help.

218
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
What help?

219
00:22:25,881 --> 00:22:27,249
That man and I...

220
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,518
have been close since childhood.

221
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,789
If needed, use me as a hostage.

222
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,559
His lord's wound.

223
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:38,660
It could get infected again.

224
00:22:38,829 --> 00:22:41,500
I can look after him right away only when we are together, no?

225
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:44,329
I am...

226
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,400
good at fighting too.

227
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:48,768
That man taught me martial arts.

228
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:51,069
I can fight dozens of men.

229
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,250
Allow me to follow you.

230
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,250
Do not follow us.

231
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,220
Come with us.

232
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,529
- Baek Gu. - Young Master?

233
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,430
Thank you, Hwang Gu.

234
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,470
I mean, my lord.

235
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,140
And so? Where did you hide it?

236
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,589
You sure are amazing.

237
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,818
How did you know we would get kidnapped?

238
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,829
It is something we must not lose.

239
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,258
And so, it was simply to be prepared for the worst.

240
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,700
You think of all possibilities.

241
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,599
But why are you taking that girl?

242
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,700
She still serves Lord Choi.

243
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,470
- Even if she is a servant... - Yes, a servant.

244
00:23:57,809 --> 00:23:59,440
Against her will,

245
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,910
she was born as a family's servant.

246
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:06,319
And that family's head turned out to be Choi Sang Rok.

247
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:09,319
But that is not her fault, is it?

248
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,490
Gap Seok.

249
00:24:13,089 --> 00:24:14,160
I will...

250
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:16,460
get my revenge.

251
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:20,759
I will take everything that belongs to Choi Sang Rok...

252
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,670
and destroy him.

253
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,609
When my rage engulfs everyone in that family,

254
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:33,539
I hope...

255
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:35,549
that girl is not there.

256
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,619
When I bring down Choi Sang Rok,

257
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,250
I do not want her to get dragged in and killed.

258
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:52,059
Do you like Baek Gu that much?

259
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,068
Did you not listen to me? That is not what I...

260
00:24:58,069 --> 00:25:00,799
Whether that is or is not the case, let us all go together.

261
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,509
That is all that matters, no?

262
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:05,240
Carry this now.

263
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,440
Here.

264
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,250
All right.

265
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,049
Good.

266
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:14,119
Let us go.

267
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:19,460
Baek Gu is waiting for us.

268
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,460
This way. Please get on.

269
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:33,869
What? Are you scared I will refuse to go?

270
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,279
You are to follow me.

271
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:43,450
- Me? - Yes.

272
00:25:43,849 --> 00:25:46,450
Were you not always jealous of Gap Dol?

273
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,750
Take this chance to earn a title.

274
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:51,420
Thank you, my lord.

275
00:25:54,359 --> 00:25:55,689
That is fine, yes?

276
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,630
When you succeed to the throne,

277
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,000
everything in Joseon will become yours.

278
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,829
You can assign anyone as your guard.

279
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,169
Do as you please.

280
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:09,539
Then, forget the palanquin. It does not feel comfortable.

281
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:11,779
Let us ride horses.

282
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:13,039
Well...

283
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,380
But there is a custom...

284
00:26:15,509 --> 00:26:18,049
in the palace welcoming the Crown Prince.

285
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:26,490
Did you not tell me to do as I pleased?

286
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,890
Were you not being sincere?

287
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,730
Move aside!

288
00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:33,430
Prince Dosung is making his way!

289
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,000
Hurry!

290
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:37,799
Move aside!

291
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:41,599
Prince Dosung is making his way!

292
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,069
Hurry!

293
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:45,880
Move aside!

294
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,880
Prince Dosung is making his way!

295
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,250
Hurry!

296
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,779
Move aside!

297
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:59,160
Prince Dosung is making his way!

298
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:01,889
It is not easy being a crown prince.

299
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,160
My point, exactly.

300
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:05,500
Despite that,

301
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:07,299
I have never once heard you say you want to quit.

302
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,829
If I suffer a little,

303
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,538
the people of Joseon can live more comfortably,

304
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:14,900
so how could I quit?

305
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,750
You little... I am your elder brother.

306
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,950
Prince Dosung is making his way!

307
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,390
Hurry!

308
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,690
Move aside!

309
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:35,789
Prince Dosung is making his way!

310
00:27:41,829 --> 00:27:45,799
It seems the apricot flowers will bloom early this year, Your Majesty.

311
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:49,410
Everything has its own time.

312
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,809
I am worried it will wilt away...

313
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,640
if the flowers bloom too quickly.

314
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,789
Do not worry.

315
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,660
To return your devotion,

316
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:10,930
this tree must be trying its best.

317
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:18,000
It seems to need sunlight.

318
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:19,970
Place this where it is sunny.

319
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:21,369
Yes, Your Majesty.

320
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,119
Is that the apricot flower...

321
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,119
the Queen Dowager takes care of like...

322
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:37,450
she took care of Prince Gwangchang?

323
00:28:39,019 --> 00:28:40,019
Yes.

324
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:42,259
Give it to me.

325
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,589
May I ask why?

326
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,609
I thought anything you touched...

327
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,009
got destroyed.

328
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,519
But this one survived.

329
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:09,049
Please give it back.

330
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,519
Her Majesty holds dear to that treasure.

331
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,660
"Treasure?"

332
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:19,059
I thought you were only interested in love between men and women.

333
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,029
But you must also love this tree.

334
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:25,000
You are crossing the line!

335
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,799
"Crossing the line?"

336
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:31,910
Did you just say I was crossing the line?

337
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,828
What do you think you are doing?

338
00:29:51,829 --> 00:29:56,569
You dared to frame the kingdom's Crown Prince without hesitation.

339
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:00,368
And I thought...

340
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:02,869
nothing could hurt you, Court Lady Kim.

341
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:06,680
I guess I was wrong.

342
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,410
I will visit you often...

343
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,720
now that I have moved into the palace.

344
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,289
I shall see you again.

345
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,440
- Are you all right? - Yes, Your Majesty.

346
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:40,079
Do not worry. It is only a small cut.

347
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,980
He simply did it to make you lose your temper.

348
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:48,180
Do not let him get to you, Your Majesty.

349
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:50,920
If he bothers you too much,

350
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,289
I will talk to the Left State Councilor.

351
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,059
Did you ask for me?

352
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,670
You heard an urgent message came from the Mokchon village head, yes?

353
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:05,940
Yes.

354
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:08,140
Judging by his traveling South,

355
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:10,239
he must be going...

356
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,140
to his grandfather in Mungyeong.

357
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,578
I believe an urgent message has already been sent to Mungyeong.

358
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:17,049
Gosh, you.

359
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,779
I know that too.

360
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:22,750
But just capturing him is not enough, is it?

361
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:25,619
Does that mean...

362
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,890
I will take care of the aftermath.

363
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,000
Giddyap!

364
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:56,089
- Goodness, girl. - Sir.

365
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:58,789
What happened?

366
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:08,299
Return to Moo Baek at once,

367
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,170
and tell him to go to Mungyeong.

368
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:11,329
Yes, my lord.

369
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:15,910
And Myung Yoon?

370
00:32:18,109 --> 00:32:19,380
Is she safe?

371
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,779
Yes, my lord.

372
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,048
Did the man you were with not harass her...

373
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:26,480
to get revenge?

374
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,250
No. Those men believe...

375
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:32,858
I am the family's young lady.

376
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:33,960
What about you?

377
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,460
Were you fine all along?

378
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,960
Yes. I am all right.

379
00:32:46,869 --> 00:32:48,200
In your eyes,

380
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,039
how did it seem?

381
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,279
What are you talking about, my lord?

382
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,848
Is it true that Myung Yoon ran away from home to avoid...

383
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,180
being selected as a crown princess candidate?

384
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:00,380
Yes, my lord.

385
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,650
She said she would return home...

386
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:04,618
as soon as the ban on marriage was lifted.

387
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:06,019
By any chance, did His...

388
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,730
Forget it.

389
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,740
The tutors from the Tutorial Office are here.

390
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,599
What brings you by?

391
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,868
Is there a reason you keep missing your tutorial sessions?

392
00:33:50,869 --> 00:33:53,369
(Seoyeon: Education program for Crown Prince)

393
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,299
I fell asleep.

394
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,710
You see, these...

395
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,539
Nothing puts me to sleep quicker than these do.

396
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,180
How could you treat...

397
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:06,619
the Confucian classics with precious teachings in such a manner?

398
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:12,619
Is this kingdom...

399
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,389
in this mess now because...

400
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,960
such teachings were upheld so well?

401
00:34:25,769 --> 00:34:26,769
I was just joking!

402
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:34,309
Your Highness, it seems like you are curious about good governance.

403
00:34:34,809 --> 00:34:37,780
That is what we will study in tomorrow's session.

404
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,250
- Sure, whatever. - With that said,

405
00:34:42,619 --> 00:34:44,889
you seem to dislike coming all the way to the Yeongyeongdang Hall,

406
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:49,530
so we will come to the Crown Prince's Palace tomorrow.

407
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,039
What is the matter?

408
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:03,139
Your Highness. It is I, Joong Young.

409
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,460
Make way!

410
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,130
What is happening?

411
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:34,860
Look, how could he...

412
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,099
Stop him at once. What are you all waiting for?

413
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,880
My goodness.

414
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,360
Oh, dear!

415
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:04,590
We should tell everyone to leave at once, should we not?

416
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:06,130
Yes, we should.

417
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:09,570
All of you, leave at once!

418
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:11,800
What are you waiting for?

419
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,369
Make them leave. All of them!

420
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,000
And lock the gates.

421
00:37:15,269 --> 00:37:16,269
Now!

422
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,079
Should I make my way back to the palace,

423
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,650
we will meet as enemies...

424
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:03,848
and not brothers.

425
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:05,889
Letting you die here cannot be the alternative.

426
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,619
Please stay well and healthy,

427
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:09,389
Gun.

428
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,860
I will do my best to protect my family.

429
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,000
You too.

430
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,199
Be safe and sound.

431
00:38:17,469 --> 00:38:18,469
Wait!

432
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:20,570
Come on! Faster!

433
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,469
Prince Dosung betrayed...

434
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,340
the Confucian principles.

435
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,280
Please punish him.

436
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:04,610
- Punish him! - Punish him!

437
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,190
Prince Dosung betrayed...

438
00:39:09,489 --> 00:39:12,118
the Confucian principles. Please punish him!

439
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:14,159
- Punish him! - Punish him!

440
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,659
They are all...

441
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:24,530
petitions demanding that Prince Dosung be punished.

442
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:27,469
Such a preposterous incident...

443
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:30,170
is unprecedented in the history of Joseon.

444
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,809
It will and should never happen again.

445
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,510
Since His Majesty is still lying in his sickbed,

446
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,610
Prince Dosung resorted to such measures out of utter frustration.

447
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,750
What he did was wrong,

448
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,218
but if you think of it as the outcome of his sincere filiality,

449
00:39:43,219 --> 00:39:44,749
it is understandable.

450
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,460
Prince Dosung will soon be installed as Crown Prince.

451
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,289
He should set an example for all scholar-officials in the kingdom.

452
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,859
But instead, he disgraced all the scholar-officials...

453
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,098
studying Confucianism.

454
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:56,900
I wholeheartedly agree.

455
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:00,069
Of all people, he ought to stay away from superstitions...

456
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:02,039
and irrational beliefs that could lead the people astray.

457
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,239
How dare he let a shaman enter the sacred palace grounds?

458
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:07,079
Calm down, all of you.

459
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:10,050
I will make sure Prince Dosung pledges never to do it again...

460
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,820
so that we can prevent another incident like this,

461
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:15,019
so I hope we can let him go unpunished this time.

462
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,750
Your Majesty, however,

463
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:21,619
he has been skipping all of his lectures and tutorial sessions too.

464
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,529
I also heard Prince Dosung...

465
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,929
harassed one of your court maids.

466
00:40:27,429 --> 00:40:28,559
Is it true?

467
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,739
Your Majesty.

468
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,139
I, Kim Dae Seung, put my life on the line to say this.

469
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,380
Please revoke the plan to install Prince Dosung as Crown Prince!

470
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,559
Do not look at me like that.

471
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,289
I will never let you deceive me again.

472
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,900
You dared to take down His Majesty the King,

473
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,829
using me, his wife,

474
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,070
and set up the kind Crown Prince to get him ousted.

475
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:09,239
Every time I see your face,

476
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:12,679
I will want to vomit, so I am afraid I cannot do it.

477
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,049
If things go south, I will be slayed for committing treason.

478
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,079
Shut your mouth!

479
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,149
The moment you had such a secret rendezvous with Choi,

480
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,419
you lost your dignity as the Queen Dowager...

481
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,320
and became this witch who has gone crazy over a man.

482
00:41:24,349 --> 00:41:25,889
You do not think I can slay you?

483
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,119
Take my life.

484
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,488
To safely leave the palace as we planned...

485
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,360
All the moments you spent with me.

486
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,099
Were they all a show...

487
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:37,730
and full of lies?

488
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,500
Anyone with a heart would not be able to do such a thing.

489
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:45,309
Only a beast could do such a thing!

490
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:00,619
Are you tormented?

491
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:16,670
Now, even I do not know who I am anymore.

492
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:19,480
How did I become like this?

493
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:23,909
How did I become such a spiteful woman?

494
00:42:24,349 --> 00:42:25,349
No.

495
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:27,579
You have not changed one bit.

496
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:31,349
If you had changed,

497
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,960
you would not even be tormented like this.

498
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,059
I still remember it so vividly.

499
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:41,130
How you looked when you used to visit me.

500
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:44,130
You...

501
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,699
have not...

502
00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:49,369
changed one bit.

503
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:16,969
I am sorry,

504
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,269
and thank you.

505
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:22,639
I really am almost there,

506
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:26,039
so wait just a little longer.

507
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:28,110
Sang Rok.

508
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,449
This time, I will be sure to pass the state exam.

509
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:33,849
We will get married, and as for everything I have put you through...

510
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:38,190
I promise you I will make it up to you for the rest of my life.

511
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:50,800
I understand we have not had a proper wedding ceremony yet,

512
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:55,300
but I started thinking of you as my husband long ago.

513
00:43:57,269 --> 00:43:59,639
I thought you felt the same way as I did,

514
00:44:00,909 --> 00:44:02,710
but I suppose I was wrong.

515
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,750
No. Of course, I feel the same way.

516
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:09,389
Ever since the moment I started to fancy you,

517
00:44:10,449 --> 00:44:12,788
I have never once doubted that you were my woman. You know that.

518
00:44:12,789 --> 00:44:15,719
Then why say you will make it up to me as if you are indebted to me?

519
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,059
I have simply been doing my duty as your wife.

520
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,730
I will be leaving, then.

521
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:31,939
I made a foolish remark again.

522
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,340
That is not what I meant.

523
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,679
Did I hurt your feelings?

524
00:44:44,489 --> 00:44:45,590
Next time,

525
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:48,590
I will visit you first.

526
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,929
Wearing the official hat decorated with the royal flowers...

527
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,859
and carrying my birth chart from my family to my bride-to-be.

528
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,569
(Sajudanja: A letter from a groom's family containing his date of birth)

529
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,500
I will come knocking on your door.

530
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,480
Sang Rok.

531
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,309
I suggest you hurry up and get married.

532
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:43,250
I have been telling you for a while...

533
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:45,809
that you should get married first...

534
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:49,079
if you do not wish to lose Lady Soo Ryeon.

535
00:45:50,989 --> 00:45:52,250
I will marry her.

536
00:45:52,489 --> 00:45:53,819
As soon as I pass the state exam...

537
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,190
And what if you do not pass the exam?

538
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,590
Then will you not marry her?

539
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:01,058
I will be sure to pass the exam this time.

540
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:02,659
If you are sure you will pass the exam,

541
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:06,699
it will not matter even if you get married first.

542
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,239
The exam is just around the corner.

543
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:12,039
Nothing will happen in the next few days.

544
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,679
Bad things...

545
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:19,349
always happen suddenly and unexpectedly.

546
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,289
If you keep putting it off,

547
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:27,519
you may lose Lady Soo Ryeon forever.

548
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:32,260
He should pass the exam with the highest score.

549
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,659
I mean, that would be nice.

550
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:45,308
I understand this is my second marriage, but she is still Queen.

551
00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:47,179
(Gyebi: Made Queen through a king's remarriage)

552
00:46:47,239 --> 00:46:50,749
Hence, the proper procedures and formalities must be followed.

553
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:54,320
Your Majesty, you have chosen my daughter...

554
00:46:54,349 --> 00:46:56,079
for you think so highly of her when she lacks in many ways.

555
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,819
I am so grateful to you that I do not even know...

556
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,389
how to express my gratitude.

557
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,860
However, my daughter...

558
00:47:03,789 --> 00:47:06,300
is engaged.

559
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:13,469
Is that so?

560
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:28,750
What are you waiting for? Hurry up and greet His Majesty.

561
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:30,719
Yes.

562
00:47:44,699 --> 00:47:45,869
My gosh.

563
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:48,500
The ground is cold.

564
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:52,869
I am pleased enough that I got to see you today,

565
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,980
so you need not do this.

566
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:59,150
Yes, Your Majesty.

567
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:22,000
Find out who her fiance is.

568
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,139
Yes, Your Majesty.

569
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:27,510
Let us go!

570
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:43,759
My lady. We should let Young Master Sang Rok know, should we not?

571
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,489
The exam is around the corner.

572
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:47,129
My lady, even so...

573
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:49,130
Even if he finds out now,

574
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:52,030
there is nothing he can do.

575
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:55,698
The distraction could make...

576
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,610
the ten years of hard work go to waste.

577
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:03,610
Then what will you do now?

578
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:06,420
I must...

579
00:49:07,219 --> 00:49:09,519
hold out until the state exam is over,

580
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:12,590
no matter what.

581
00:49:25,369 --> 00:49:29,199
Here comes His Majesty the King!

582
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:09,679
Young Master Sang Rok!

583
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,349
Young Master.

584
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,049
What brings you here?

585
00:50:14,050 --> 00:50:16,218
We received a royal order to send Lady Soo Ryeon's birth chart...

586
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:17,789
by the end of the day.

587
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:21,559
Once that is done, it is all over.

588
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,059
What should we do?

589
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:26,730
Bad things...

590
00:50:26,731 --> 00:50:28,730
always happen suddenly and unexpectedly.

591
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:30,598
If you keep putting it off,

592
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:33,900
you may lose Lady Soo Ryeon forever.

593
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,199
- Sang Rok. - Yes.

594
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:13,139
You must hurry up and leave before anyone sees you.

595
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:04,489
You dared to deceive me...

596
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:07,828
and tried to steal my woman.

597
00:52:07,829 --> 00:52:09,300
You deserve to die.

598
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:13,840
You realize the graveness of your crime, do you not?

599
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:15,139
I...

600
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,239
never once coveted or stole what was not mine.

601
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,050
Lord Min's daughter and I have been in love...

602
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:26,179
for a long time,

603
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:30,320
and we are engaged. She is my fiancee.

604
00:52:30,489 --> 00:52:32,649
How dare you!

605
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:35,118
Go ahead and twist his legs!

606
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:36,190
- Yes, my lord! - Yes, my lord!

607
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,070
My lady.

608
00:52:50,269 --> 00:52:51,309
Your Majesty!

609
00:52:52,139 --> 00:52:54,039
Please spare him, Your Majesty.

610
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:55,239
Soo Ryeon.

611
00:52:55,739 --> 00:52:57,579
Do not do this. You must leave.

612
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:01,150
Your Majesty, he did nothing wrong.

613
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:03,320
It is all my fault.

614
00:53:03,489 --> 00:53:06,320
Stop! I told you to leave!

615
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:09,888
Must I bite my tongue and die to make you leave?

616
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:12,488
I see that he can still run his mouth like that.

617
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:13,900
What are you all waiting for?

618
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,400
Your Majesty.

619
00:53:21,969 --> 00:53:24,768
I committed this unforgivable sin for I am foolish.

620
00:53:24,769 --> 00:53:27,340
Please take pity on him.

621
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:28,909
Just this once...

622
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,880
Please show him mercy just this once.

623
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,090
Please spare him.

624
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,559
Spare him, you say?

625
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:07,750
If I do spare him,

626
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:15,460
what will you give me in return?

627
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:57,329
Your Majesty.

628
00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:00,300
The criminal is here.

629
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,690
Take off your clothes.

630
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:05,519
Soo Ryeon.

631
00:58:05,619 --> 00:58:06,619
Back off!

632
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:08,219
Soo Ryeon.

633
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:10,559
Back off!

634
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:11,789
Sang Rok.

635
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:13,359
- Go away. - Soo Ryeon.

636
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,400
Sang Rok.

637
00:58:17,769 --> 00:58:18,769
Soo Ryeon.

638
00:58:19,269 --> 00:58:20,300
No, wait...

639
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:21,599
Sang Rok.

640
00:58:22,369 --> 00:58:23,400
Soo Ryeon.

641
00:58:24,139 --> 00:58:25,139
Soo Ryeon.

642
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:27,079
No, please...

643
00:58:28,739 --> 00:58:29,809
Sang Rok.

644
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,179
Go away!

645
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:36,619
Soo Ryeon...

646
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,760
- Soo Ryeon. - Sang Rok.

647
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,559
Wait, Soo Ryeon!

648
00:59:21,329 --> 00:59:22,359
Go away.

649
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,670
Soo Ryeon.

650
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:26,400
Soo Ryeon.

651
00:59:30,909 --> 00:59:31,940
Sang Rok...

652
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,639
Soo Ryeon.

653
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:36,639
Soo Ryeon.

654
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:41,119
Wait, Soo Ryeon.

655
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:09,340
Sang Rok...

656
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:27,730
When we met again...

657
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,800
after many years,

658
01:00:32,869 --> 01:00:34,469
I would have given up on you...

659
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:37,869
if you had changed.

660
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:43,280
Because you have not changed at all,

661
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,849
I am still by your side.

662
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:51,690
Sang Rok.

663
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:12,369
Why did you do such a thing?

664
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,179
Do you not wish to become Crown Prince?

665
01:01:16,809 --> 01:01:20,650
What about the things you told me yesterday? Was it all a lie?

666
01:01:20,849 --> 01:01:22,119
Look, Magistrate Yoon.

667
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,488
Yes, Your Highness.

668
01:01:24,489 --> 01:01:26,719
Why do I have to dirty my hands...

669
01:01:27,289 --> 01:01:28,760
to become Crown Prince?

670
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:30,119
Dirty your hands?

671
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:32,929
What do you mean?

672
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:37,300
The royal seal is fake,

673
01:01:37,969 --> 01:01:39,599
and so is the national seal.

674
01:01:41,070 --> 01:01:43,199
We might be able to get away with it for the time being,

675
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,710
but if someone questions the authenticity,

676
01:01:46,539 --> 01:01:48,579
and if the Emperor hears it,

677
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,010
how will that make me look?

678
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:54,480
You are bound to get indigestion when you eat too quickly.

679
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,820
Once we get rid of the deposed Crown Prince,

680
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:01,460
who else...

681
01:02:02,989 --> 01:02:04,789
can become King in this kingdom, other than me?

682
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:13,530
You see,

683
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:16,139
I do not want a single dent...

684
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,539
in my path to the throne.

685
01:02:22,710 --> 01:02:25,780
I did not realize the depth of Your Highness' foresight in this matter.

686
01:02:26,010 --> 01:02:27,519
Your foolish vassal here...

687
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:30,519
made the mistake of jumping to conclusions.

688
01:02:32,389 --> 01:02:36,389
Magistrate Yoon, please put your useless concerns to rest...

689
01:02:37,329 --> 01:02:39,159
and find the deposed Crown Prince as soon as possible.

690
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:42,199
- Giddyap! - Giddyap!

691
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:52,468
(Magistrate's Office)

692
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:54,010
It is an edict from Her Majesty the Queen Dowager.

693
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:57,550
(Edict)

694
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,480
You are to leave now!

695
01:03:02,481 --> 01:03:03,519
- Yes, my lord! - Yes, my lord!

696
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,860
Come out and greet your guests!

697
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:21,239
Come out!

698
01:03:31,949 --> 01:03:33,050
Grandfather.

699
01:03:34,619 --> 01:03:36,050
It is I, Gun.

700
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:38,889
I am here.

701
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:51,230
Grandfather.

702
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:52,929
Your Royal Highness.

703
01:03:53,969 --> 01:03:54,969
"Royal Highness?"

704
01:03:55,099 --> 01:03:56,670
Your Royal Highness the Crown Prince.

705
01:04:05,579 --> 01:04:06,679
You have...

706
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:09,750
been through so much.

707
01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:28,969
(We thank Ahn Suk Hwan for his special appearance.)

708
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:00,940
(Missing Crown Prince)

709
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,538
I am Myung Yoon, the daughter of Royal Physician Choi,

710
01:05:03,539 --> 01:05:05,638
who was behind your kidnapping.

711
01:05:05,639 --> 01:05:08,709
Do not bring up your father again in front of me.

712
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:10,578
His Majesty is in critical condition.

713
01:05:10,579 --> 01:05:11,979
It means that...

714
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:14,679
no one except Choi Sang Rok can treat him.

715
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:16,949
I have made up my mind to become Crown Prince as per their wish.

716
01:05:17,349 --> 01:05:19,690
Please forgive me for leaving...

717
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,559
without even saying goodbye.

718
01:05:21,659 --> 01:05:23,989
Lee Gun is guilty of high treason. Tie him up!

719
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:26,789
The deposed Crown Prince has been arrested.
