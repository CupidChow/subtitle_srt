00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,140
(Missing Crown Prince)

00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,080
(SUHO)

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,750

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,689

(Kim Min Kyu)

7
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,880
(Missing Crown Prince)

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,148
(All characters, locations, organizations, and incidents...)

9
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,478
(in this drama are historically irrelevant and fictitious.)

10
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,648
(Production guidelines were strictly followed...)

11
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:48,890
(when filming with children and animals.)

12
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:52,619
Father.

13
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:57,000
Can you see me?

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,670
Father.

15
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,409
It is your son Gun.

16
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,239
Do you recognize me?

17
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,280
Father.

18
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,519
He looked at me.

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,430
I am sure he recognized me.

20
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,730
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

21
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,930
Your Royal Highness?

22
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:35,599
Come on in.

23
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,379
Father...

24
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,450
opened his eyes.

25
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:56,959
Father, can you hear me?

26
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:04,099
He might need some time, so let us wait.

27
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:08,128
His eyes may be open, but he is not fully conscious...

28
00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:09,469
He is conscious.

29
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,069
I am certain he recognized me.

30
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,370
Father, it is your son, Gun.

31
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:16,840
Do you recognize me?

32
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:21,750
Can you see me?

33
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,879
If you see me,

34
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,789
please blink your eyes once more.

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,030
Did you see that?

36
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:42,530
Father blinked.

37
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,668
He recognized me.

38
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:48,210
Yes, I am certain he recognized you as well.

39
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,479
I saw it as well.

40
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:56,610
Please muster more strength.

41
00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:02,219
You should not give up, Father.

42
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,968
He opened his eyes, but he went back to sleep?

43
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,479
What does that mean?

44
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,448
Could he not regain consciousness?

45
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:28,750
- Hey! - Hey!

46
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,020
- I mean, what? - What you say can come true.

47
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,750
How dare you jinx us by blabbering?

48
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,360
Do you wish to be gagged like him?

49
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,830
Guard Lee.

50
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,599
Where is His Royal Highness?

51
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,870
Forgive us.

52
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,639
Due to the sabaltongmun being discovered,

53
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,839
we have not been able to find a way...

54
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,509
that could exonerate Master Moonhyung.

55
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,978
He probably had everyone write their names...

56
00:04:03,979 --> 00:04:05,979
worried that some would change their minds.

57
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,688
We are stuck on this matter.

58
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:09,090
Do not worry too much.

59
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:13,159
I think I have found a way to save Father's life.

60
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,829
Do you mean that?

61
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,930
Forgive me.

62
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:24,240
I could not stop myself.

63
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:25,470
It is all right.

64
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:27,610
He will soon be back on his feet,

65
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:30,170
so please do whatever you can...

66
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,610
to stall the sentencing.

67
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:34,980
Yes, I will give it my all.

68
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,949
However,

69
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,649
I am not sure as to how they were able to set a bait.

70
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,790
Would you perhaps know?

71
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:54,329
Are you here to blame me?

72
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,339
Just ask the question.

73
00:04:58,269 --> 00:04:59,800
Ask if I caused this.

74
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,639
- Did you? - Yes.

75
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,139
It was me.

76
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,910
I told them to be prepared for the military attack...

77
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,279
that you could order.

78
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:16,220
Do not look at me that way.

79
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,660
Just like you cherish your grandfather,

80
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,389
Mother is also precious to me.

81
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:23,529
Father...

82
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:25,860
is doing better.

83
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:33,139
Are you saying he regained consciousness?

84
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:34,439
It was brief,

85
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,569
but he recognized me.

86
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,639
What is the matter? Why are you performing acupuncture?

87
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:10,209
What happened?

88
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,039
His pulse started racing a few moments ago,

89
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,480
and his situation worsened.

90
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:18,250
Why is he responding differently to the same antidote?

91
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:21,350
It worked the first time.

92
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,990
He was not able to speak, but he recognized me...

93
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,660
and blinked as his way of answering me.

94
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,129
It is true.

95
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,730
I ask you this.

96
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,500
Can you guarantee that my father...

97
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:37,639
will regain consciousness?

98
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:41,209
I am sure of it.

99
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:45,138
Father will regain consciousness.

100
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:46,439
When have you ever said...

101
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:50,079
that you did not believe he would wake up?

102
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,980
If there is even a sliver of hope,

103
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,689
we should not give up.

104
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,560
If you give up on him that easily...

105
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,189
I am not giving up on him.

106
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,259
I am trying to protect Mother.

107
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,159
I cannot let her be sacrificed again.

108
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,768
By that, do you mean my grandfather and Sun Ok...

109
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:10,470
are expendable?

110
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,810
Whatever you say...

111
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:17,810
will not change my mind.

112
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,039
I cannot gamble...

113
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,149
my family's life on the unknown.

114
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:24,680
Do you remember what I said the day you broke me...

115
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:27,819
out of prison?

116
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,290
Will you not regret this?

117
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:33,990
You always have to nitpick over the details.

118
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:39,930
Sure. I might regret it.

119
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,470
However, I will do my best to protect my family.

120
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,970
I have more to ask,

121
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:51,579
but that will be reserved for the day I return.

122
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,850
I will finally ask that question.

123
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,310
Am I also a part...

124
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,980
of that family?

125
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,350
Why will you not answer me?

126
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,620
Do you not consider me as family?

127
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,860
You disregarded me...

128
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,969
as your family first.

129
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,230
Do not be unreasonable.

130
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:19,268
I have never thought that way.

131
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:20,670
Then how could you...

132
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,439
have taken a liking to the woman your brother almost married?

133
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:38,259
I asked your father to set our wedding date soon,

134
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,519
so know that.

135
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,450
I have something to tell you.

136
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,649
I cannot marry you.

137
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,820
I already...

138
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,990
have feelings for the Crown Prince.

139
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,429
He openly said he would not forgive your father.

140
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,240
How do you expect to marry him knowing that?

141
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,999
I have never even dreamed of it.

142
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,870
I did not want to force your hand in marriage.

143
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,080
However, I will protect you through marriage...

144
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,049
even if that means...

145
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,210
you will resent me your whole life.

146
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,250
But it is not what I want.

147
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,990
I will protect myself.

148
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,320
Can you also protect...

149
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,230
your father...

150
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,899
and my parents?

151
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:56,269
The only way to protect them all...

152
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,570
is through our marriage.

153
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,919
Dosung is only acting out due to stress,

154
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,590
so please be understanding.

155
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:51,720
I request that you be understanding of him too.

156
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:56,830
A good beating is what screws his head back on straight.

157
00:10:57,259 --> 00:11:01,070
My being too nice and understanding of him...

158
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,269
is why he is acting out.

159
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,799
In my opinion,

160
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,240
you will probably lose if there was ever a scuffle.

161
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:14,379
Have you been going easy on him to prevent bruises?

162
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,710
How did you know that?

163
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,860
I will tend to Father from here,

164
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,859
so get some rest.

165
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,330
You should instead, for I am all right.

166
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,240
For me,

167
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,110
being with you and Father...

168
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:45,309
is the same as resting.

169
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:52,419
Being with you is how I rest as well.

170
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,970
I cannot let you risk your life.

171
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,239
If you stand opposed,

172
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,679
I will do it by myself.

173
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:21,178
- Lady Myung Yoon... - Until I find the right antidote...

174
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,678
for His Majesty,

175
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:25,519
I will never give up.

176
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,519
What is it?

177
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,960
Do you think I am not capable?

178
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:36,590
You win.

179
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,330
In return,

180
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:42,669
you will not think about running away ever again.

181
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,870
Why would I run away?

182
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:48,839
Once His Majesty recovers,

183
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,240
I will be hugely rewarded.

184
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,350
What do you wish as your reward?

185
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,220
I will request...

186
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:02,090
that even women should be allowed to be physicians.

187
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,519
Joseon's first female physician.

188
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:07,628
He would also have to grant me a house...

189
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:09,428
that could be my clinic.

190
00:13:09,429 --> 00:13:11,500
Fine. I will make it happen.

191
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,629
A plaque will also be bestowed.

192
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,240
How about Baekgu Clinic?

193
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:24,379
I believe Hwanggu Clinic has a better ring to it.

194
00:13:58,539 --> 00:13:59,610
Your Royal Highness.

195
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,279
What is it?

196
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,090
The Queen Dowager will dismiss the morning assembly...

197
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,750
and interrogate the sinners herself.

198
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:15,629
(Chinguk: An interrogation conducted by the king)

199
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:48,960
Halt!

200
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,299
Confess to who led the rebellion,

201
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:57,970
and you will keep your lives.

202
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,570
Speak of the one...

203
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,269
you wanted as king.

204
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,850
We are not traitors.

205
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,909
We were serving His Majesty...

206
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,649
by trying to rid the palace of traitors like you.

207
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,460
Keep burning them until the traitors talk.

208
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:21,928
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

209
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:24,399
(Nakhyeong: Burning the skin with heated iron rods)

210
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:51,879
King Yeongjo stated...

211
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,648
that the law was always considered...

212
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:56,190
when sentencing someone.

213
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:57,788
Even though...

214
00:16:57,789 --> 00:17:00,090
one's confession is deemed satisfactory,

215
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,529
it will always be flawed if the law was not upheld.

216
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,328
Burning and crushing...

217
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,558
were to forever be banned.

218
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,699
(Apseul: Placing heavy stones on one's lap)

219
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,599
So how could you order for them to be burned?

220
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:13,140
He also stipulated...

221
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,839
that torture during interrogations should only be conducted once a day,

222
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,539
twice should the crimes be serious.

223
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,079
It was to prevent lives from being taken.

224
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,980
Meanwhile, King Jeongjo,

225
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,818
when sentencing the subject of an interrogation,

226
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,190
delayed the sentencing of punishment...

227
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:30,150
for those who confessed...

228
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:32,589
and those who were on the brink of death.

229
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:36,829
Please reconsider.

230
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,899
Everything Prince Susung said was within reason.

231
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,200
Please reconsider.

232
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,069
Please reconsider!

233
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,490
Continue the punishment.

234
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,960
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

235
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,109
Your Majesty,

236
00:18:26,109 --> 00:18:28,608
they did not commit treason, but...

237
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,950
The deposed king!

238
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,720
We serve the deposed king.

239
00:18:58,809 --> 00:18:59,980
We...

240
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:03,450
were plotting to reinstate...

241
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:07,619
the deposed king.

242
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,049
Dosung.

243
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:43,089
We need to talk.

244
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:46,589
Please spare...

245
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:49,089
my grandfather's life.

246
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:55,200
You, of all people, know that he is innocent.

247
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,038
Father will soon regain consciousness.

248
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,140
Until then,

249
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,839
please have his sentencing delayed.

250
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:09,279
For me...

251
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,880
Not my grandfather, but for me.

252
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:15,849
Help me this once.

253
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:20,859
Dosung.

254
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:33,599
Your Royal Highness.

255
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,309
How did it go?

256
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,109
Lady Myung Yoon...

257
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:16,309
went with the Head Eunuch to obtain more medicinal herbs.

258
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:34,730
He must want to be alone.

259
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:51,279
Father.

260
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,289
What must I do from now on?

261
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,559
Father.

262
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,579
Father...

263
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,880
Father...

264
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:29,250
Father...

265
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,259
Father...

266
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:51,509
Father.

267
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,980
Father...

268
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,660
I need to go outside.

269
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,670
Allow me to accompany you.

270
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,299
No. You are to head to the Crown Prince's Palace.

271
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,470
Take care of Lady Myung Yoon.

272
00:23:56,539 --> 00:23:59,339
Understood. Do not worry, and make your trip.

273
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:38,180
I have somewhere to go.

274
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:42,288
You cannot leave the chamber, Lady Myung Yoon.

275
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:43,849
It will not take long.

276
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:46,220
You cannot leave.

277
00:24:46,259 --> 00:24:48,690
I do not know what it is, but leave once you have...

278
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,690
His Royal Highness's permission once he returns.

279
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,759
It is to save His Royal Highness's grandfather.

280
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:11,980
I must meet Grandfather.

281
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,518
Please move.

282
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:15,619
Meet Master right now,

283
00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:18,619
and it is doing as they please. How do you not know that?

284
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:19,960
Master stopped others...

285
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,960
from driving you as this incident's mastermind...

286
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:25,960
by becoming a traitor with a false statement...

287
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,859
about trying to restore the deposed King.

288
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,068
Do you truly not realize what his intentions were?

289
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:32,339
I do. However...

290
00:25:33,569 --> 00:25:36,670
I cannot let Grandfather get hurt because of me.

291
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,339
I will meet Grandfather...

292
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,680
and ask him to take back his false statement.

293
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,558
We cannot let Master's sacrifice go to waste.

294
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,759
If you wish to go,

295
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:55,829
kill us first.

296
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,799
Even if we banish him,

297
00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:04,730
he will die at the place of exile from old age.

298
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,440
Is there a need to make him take the deadly poison?

299
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:14,210
This is not to let Jang Hyun Mok live.

300
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,349
I do not want your hands...

301
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,150
to get stained with blood again.

302
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:22,920
I am well aware of your worries.

303
00:26:23,819 --> 00:26:26,519
However, that man Yoon Yi Kyum...

304
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:28,890
will not back down easily this time.

305
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,960
Your Majesty. Lady Myung Yoon wishes to have an audience with you.

306
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,339
How did you enter the palace?

307
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,980
I used the pass Her Majesty gave me.

308
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,919
Do you not know you must not use it recklessly?

309
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,019
Take a seat.

310
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,859
Court Lady Kim. Bring us a table of refreshments.

311
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:02,630
Yes, Your Majesty.

312
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:05,960
Oh, yes. Do tell them to serve us omija tea.

313
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,460
Understood.

314
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:19,180
We were offered omija from Mungyeong.

315
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:21,009
It tasted nice.

316
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,910
As it is good for the body, take some on your way back.

317
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,279
I have something to tell you.

318
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,650
I see. Please tell me. Do not hold back.

319
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:33,519
Please let...

320
00:27:34,359 --> 00:27:35,630
Master Moonhyung live.

321
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:39,529
Were you not at the temple?

322
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,599
How did you know about Master Moonhyung?

323
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:44,299
I went to buy a new brush,

324
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:46,539
then heard the rumors going around the market.

325
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:48,739
With that, you came straight here?

326
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,038
- Yes. - It is none of your business.

327
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,480
Go back home at once.

328
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,710
Myung Yoon must have come with some thought in mind.

329
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,650
Let us listen to her more.

330
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:05,720
I will marry...

331
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,920
Prince Dosung.

332
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,669
What is it that you want?

333
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,509
I told you, did I not?

334
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:24,470
Let Master Moonhyung live.

335
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:27,109
You have nothing to do with Master Moonhyung.

336
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,949
Is Prince Susung behind this?

337
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,019
His Royal Highness knows nothing about this.

338
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,318
Prince Susung would not have...

339
00:28:37,319 --> 00:28:39,519
sent Myung Yoon here regarding such incident.

340
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,459
Then why are you requesting to let Jang Hyun Mok live?

341
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:45,058
You have no business whether he lives or dies.

342
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:46,460
I want to stop...

343
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,799
your wicked acts, Father.

344
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,069
Stop killing people.

345
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,769
Stop sinning.

346
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,609
That is all I ask from you, Father.

347
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,410
Wait outside for a moment.

348
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:26,400
Your daughter's request is reasonable.

349
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:28,970
It is not out of criticism...

350
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,940
but concern from filial affection.

351
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:34,140
Let Jang Hyun Mok live,

352
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,650
and she will marry Prince Dosung.

353
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:39,279
It is for the better, no?

354
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,319
We may accept her condition.

355
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:46,160
But will Yoon Yi Kyum accept it right then and there?

356
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,490
We must persuade him one way or another.

357
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,660
Once Myung Yoon marries Prince Dosung,

358
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:55,400
we, too, can take a breather. Am I not right?

359
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,349
We will do as you want.

360
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,990
However, you must keep your promise of marrying...

361
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,789
Prince Dosung.

362
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:20,220
And you must let Master Moonhyung live...

363
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,130
if you wish to become the King's father-in-law.

364
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,359
I will stay at the temple for a few more days.

365
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:30,499
I will return home after getting myself together.

366
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,970
- Until then... - All right.

367
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,240
In return, I will inform Prince Dosung.

368
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,339
Keep that in mind.

369
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:53,490
I am telling you to only exile him to a place like Jeju Island.

370
00:30:54,289 --> 00:30:56,059
Where is my answer?

371
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:01,229
Jang Hyun Mok is a great sinner.

372
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,230
He got arrested for treason...

373
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,129
trying to restore the deposed King.

374
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,339
Does that imply you must kill him?

375
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:15,349
If you insist on killing Master Moonhyung,

376
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,750
I will understand it as wanting to kill Gun as well.

377
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,349
With that, I will do the sword dance.

378
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,890
If you are fine with it, kill Master Moonhyung.

379
00:31:31,329 --> 00:31:34,098
- Please pardon the great sinner... - Please pardon the great sinner...

380
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:36,829
- Jang Hyun Mok. - Jang Hyun Mok.

381
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:41,640
- Please pardon Jang Hyun Mok. - Please pardon Jang Hyun Mok.

382
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:44,410
Jang Hyun Mok is indeed a criminal.

383
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,839
However, he has done great deeds for the country.

384
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:49,450
Letting him live,

385
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:53,480
but exiling him to the borders seems to be reasonable.

386
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,690
What do you think, Left State Councilor?

387
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,829
I agree with the Inspector General.

388
00:32:11,569 --> 00:32:13,400
Please take it into consideration.

389
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,539
- Please take it into consideration. - Please take it into consideration.

390
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,579
Strip the criminals of their positions and privileges.

391
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:25,318
Exile them to places such as Jeju, Geoje, and Jindo...

392
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:27,079
and completely separate them from each other.

393
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,819
Build thorny walls around their dwellings.

394
00:32:29,049 --> 00:32:31,588
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

395
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:33,190
(Wirianchi: Confining convicts in homes surrounded by thorny walls)

396
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:40,430
Thank you.

397
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,000
The date for my wedding...

398
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,210
with Lady Myung Yoon will be decided by the end of the month.

399
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:52,039
No.

400
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:54,740
This incident has made me even more determined.

401
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,410
I will...

402
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,779
punish Choi Sang Rok and the Queen Dowager no matter what.

403
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:03,250
Then the wedding will be called off,

404
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:05,319
and both you and Lady Myung Yoon will become miserable.

405
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,720
Do you think I will let that happen?

406
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,759
Do as you please.

407
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:12,599
I will do things my way too.

408
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:18,000
Is that why you decided on your own to move ahead with the wedding?

409
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,210
Lady Myung Yoon has already agreed.

410
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:25,109
You did not know?

411
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,130
What happened?

412
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,170
Thankfully, he could avoid execution by poison.

413
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:51,799
They decided to exile him to Jeju.

414
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,869
I am truly relieved to hear this.

415
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,170
By the way,

416
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,109
did you tell Dosung that you would marry him?

417
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,180
Do not tell me...

418
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,879
that you are jealous.

419
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,149
(Gangsaem: To be jealous)

420
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,559
Why would I be jealous?

421
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,960
No, it is not that. I heard you suddenly agreed to marry him,

422
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,099
so I was wondering what was going on.

423
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,400
I was simply trying to buy some time until His Majesty woke up.

424
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:29,408
I suppose it worked.

425
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:31,170
So you told him you would marry him?

426
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:35,210
At the moment, our priority is to save your grandfather.

427
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:39,380
If His Majesty regains consciousness before he leaves for Jeju...

428
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,250
Your Majesty.

429
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:50,030
His Majesty woke up again.

430
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,360
Father.

431
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,559
Can you see me?

432
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,170
Do you recognize me?

433
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:17,050
Your Royal Highness. It is I, Joong Young.

434
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:19,389
You may enter.

435
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,260
Father woke up again.

436
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,900
Your Royal Highness, Inspector General Choi is on his way here.

437
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,468
Inspector General Choi? Why, all of a sudden?

438
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:36,969
He has been overseeing the Royal Infirmary...

439
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,380
since His Majesty regained his consciousness.

440
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:41,638
I made up some excuses so they would not be suspicious,

441
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,550
but they must have reported it to Inspector General Choi.

442
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:46,179
That means he is coming here because he thinks something is up.

443
00:35:46,849 --> 00:35:47,919
What should we do?

444
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,419
The Head Eunuch quickly summoned...

445
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,250
the court maids and eunuchs in the King's quarters.

446
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,260
Father.

447
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:59,959
At the moment, they cannot find out that you woke up.

448
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,969
I know it will not be easy, but act like you are still unconscious.

449
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:11,670
Inspector General Choi has arrived.

450
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:15,139
Please hurry up and cover His Majesty's face.

451
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,349
If my father checks His Majesty's pulse,

452
00:36:17,909 --> 00:36:20,250
he will know right away that His Majesty is recovering.

453
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:24,019
Is there a way to slow down his pulse using acupuncture?

454
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,630
I will announce your arrival.

455
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:38,070
Please wait here for a moment.

456
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,510
Is...

457
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,139
someone in the room?

458
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,179
His Majesty is inside.

459
00:36:54,019 --> 00:36:55,050
Let His Majesty know.

460
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:03,489
Your Majesty.

461
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,969
Inspector General Choi is here.

462
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,239
His pulse has become a little weak,

463
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:00,440
but it is not worrisome.

464
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:08,349
However,

465
00:39:09,219 --> 00:39:11,219
His Majesty's condition could worsen at any time,

466
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:14,159
so the treatment sessions should never be skipped.

467
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,829
Well understood, my lord.

468
00:39:51,929 --> 00:39:54,230
He left. You may come out now.

469
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,019
Father.

470
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:15,050
You can open your eyes now.

471
00:40:17,389 --> 00:40:18,389
Father.

472
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,039
I think he fell asleep again for I went overboard with the needles.

473
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,409
I apologize.

474
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:42,110
It is okay.

475
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,449
We did not get caught, and that is enough.

476
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,150
I suppose Father fell asleep while acting like he was asleep...

477
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,920
not to get caught.

478
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,940
You should force yourself to get some sleep.

479
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,980
You have not slept in days.

480
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,909
I will go and guard His Majesty's chambers.

481
00:41:19,949 --> 00:41:21,050
Have you lost your mind?

482
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,349
What were you thinking, leaving Oh Wol there alone?

483
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:24,920
Your Royal Highness.

484
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,989
They are taking Master Moonhyung to his place of exile.

485
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:32,559
Your Royal Highness.

486
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,070
Make way!

487
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:44,869
Make way!

488
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,750
This scoundrel is worse than vermin.

489
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,618
Let us kill this traitor!

490
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:58,288
- Yes! - Yes, we must!

491
00:41:58,289 --> 00:42:01,259
If we spare such a traitor, there will be another revolt,

492
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,629
which will cause chaos!

493
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:05,029
- Yes! - Kill the traitor!

494
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,828
- Yes, kill him! - Kill the traitor!

495
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:10,328
There will be another revolt, and it will cause chaos.

496
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:11,928
Kill that traitor!

497
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:12,969
- Kill him! - Darn you!

498
00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:14,869
- Kill him! - Whack him!

499
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:17,309
- Kill him! - Traitor!

500
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,389
No.

501
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,260
Let go!

502
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:36,389
- No, Your Royal Highness. - Let go!

503
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,130
Your Royal Highness!

504
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:47,239
Grandfather.

505
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:52,239
Guards, what are you doing?

506
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,980
Stop them at once!

507
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,110
- Stop them! Now! - Step back.

508
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,549
- Stop! - Step back!

509
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,279
- My gosh! - Go away!

510
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,920
- Grandfather. - Go!

511
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:08,219
Grandfather. It is I, Gun.

512
00:43:09,289 --> 00:43:10,789
Please open your eyes!

513
00:43:12,659 --> 00:43:14,630
Get him off the wagon. Now!

514
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:15,859
Yes, sir!

515
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,530
(Hamgeo: A prisoner wagon)

516
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:46,099
Grandfather.

517
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,760
Grandfather.

518
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,969
Grandfather!

519
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,260
Grandfather!

520
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,519
One of the offenders died while being transported.

521
00:44:44,989 --> 00:44:46,260
Magistrate Yoon.

522
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:49,059
You ought to find out who is responsible for this.

523
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,760
I will do my best.

524
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:02,769
Listen, ministers.

525
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:05,710
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

526
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,679
The King is still in critical condition,

527
00:45:09,449 --> 00:45:11,809
yet unsavory incidents keep happening in and outside the palace.

528
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:15,619
The precarious future of the country truly concerns me.

529
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,420
Hence, I would like to officially appoint the Crown Prince...

530
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,920
for the sake of national security.

531
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:25,260
Prince Susung and Prince Dosung...

532
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,960
are the only sons of the King.

533
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,469
I have thought long and hard about this matter.

534
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:34,400
Rather than Prince Susung who is affiliated with a scandal,

535
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,070
Prince Dosung is more suitable as Crown Prince.

536
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:38,839
Hence, we will choose an auspicious day...

537
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,710
to install Prince Dosung as Crown Prince.

538
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:49,449
And therefore,

539
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:52,690
the Queen is to be released from confinement,

540
00:45:54,659 --> 00:45:55,760
and Prince Susung...

541
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:58,929
will be banished from the palace.

542
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,119
Your Highness.

543
00:46:28,659 --> 00:46:31,260
You have suffered so much.

544
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,699
Once Prince Dosung is installed as Crown Prince,

545
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:37,670
only bright days await Your Highness.

546
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:41,570
So, please stay strong as the Queen.

547
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,210
You must stay strong and healthy.

548
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:57,349
That is what you say to someone you would never see again.

549
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,489
I will look for you...

550
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,159
as soon as my father wakes up again,

551
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:05,429
so we will meet again soon.

552
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:24,110
Let me know...

553
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:26,550
as soon as you arrive safely.

554
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,840
Moo Baek!

555
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:33,250
There are many eyes watching. Please hurry.

556
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,969
I thought my father...

557
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:55,500
could miraculously wake up like what you and my brother said,

558
00:48:56,239 --> 00:48:59,440
so I held back and did not tell anyone that you were in the palace.

559
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,739
I waited because I believed in you...

560
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,650
when you said you wanted to try your best before giving up,

561
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,449
but you failed in the end.

562
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,219
So I suggest you do as I say from now on.

563
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:14,820
I did not fail. I just need more time.

564
00:49:15,889 --> 00:49:17,429
I have not given up yet.

565
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:18,989
Do you still not get it?

566
00:49:20,329 --> 00:49:22,130
Do you think they will spare my brother?

567
00:49:22,929 --> 00:49:24,429
If you do not give up,

568
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:28,699
my brother will die.

569
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,010
If you care about your brother that much,

570
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,710
stop being so obsessed with me first.

571
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,510
His Royal Highness and I...

572
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:42,019
cannot be together in this lifetime,

573
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:45,389
but I am already his.

574
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:48,119
He is the one who should stop being obsessed with you,

575
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,059
not I.

576
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,829
The man who loved you first...

577
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,960
and wanted to marry you. It was not him.

578
00:49:58,199 --> 00:49:59,300
It was me.

579
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:04,170
So you do not care whom I love?

580
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:07,739
If I did not care,

581
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:11,849
I would not be hurting this much.

582
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:15,750
The fact that my brother...

583
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:18,920
is the man you love...

584
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,420
hurts me so much.

585
00:50:30,099 --> 00:50:31,400
But no matter how much I am hurting,

586
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,099
I will marry you.

587
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,469
And I will always protect you,

588
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:38,510
even if I must sacrifice my life to do so.

589
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,139
I will see you on our wedding day.

590
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,829
Father.

591
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,440
I...

592
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:09,809
must leave the palace now.

593
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:13,039
Always take your medicine on time.

594
00:51:18,949 --> 00:51:19,949
I...

595
00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:23,190
will see you again soon.

596
00:51:24,889 --> 00:51:25,949
You must stay strong...

597
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,119
until the day we can meet again.

598
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:44,840
What brings you here?

599
00:51:56,789 --> 00:51:59,349
Is that everything Inspector General Choi told you to do?

600
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:02,288
I also sent the things Court Lady Kim dropped off...

601
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:06,289
to a court lady named Jong Geum and Physician Heo.

602
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,769
Why are you staring at me like that?

603
00:52:14,139 --> 00:52:15,139
It is nothing.

604
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:18,510
I am here to say my farewells, so please let her know.

605
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,110
I have been curious about something,

606
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,449
so I came here, using my farewells as an excuse.

607
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:30,650
What is it? Tell me.

608
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:32,190
The person...

609
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:34,559
who ordered to have my grandfather killed.

610
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:37,789
Who was it?

611
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:42,760
I know it was not you. I can guess that much.

612
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,269
Was it Inspector General Choi?

613
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:47,440
Or...

614
00:52:48,369 --> 00:52:49,570
was it the Left State Councilor?

615
00:52:52,139 --> 00:52:55,409
Court Lady Kim has already revealed that you bestowed valuable gifts...

616
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:58,110
upon Jong Geum and Physician Heo's families after they died.

617
00:52:59,849 --> 00:53:01,678
You probably did the same thing to the others...

618
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:04,150
who were sacrificed because of you.

619
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:09,389
I also know that seizing power is not what you are after.

620
00:53:10,059 --> 00:53:11,590
Once Dosung ascends the throne,

621
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:13,929
you would want to move to the temporary palace in Anju...

622
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,869
to take care of Prince Gwangchang's grave for the rest of your life.

623
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,699
But you are afraid Dosung would change his mind,

624
00:53:20,199 --> 00:53:22,070
so you want him to marry Lady Myung Yoon...

625
00:53:22,539 --> 00:53:24,110
to hold her hostage.

626
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:29,510
All of your evil deeds were done to those...

627
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:32,150
who had figured out your plan or tried to get in your way.

628
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,550
If you were an evil person...

629
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:38,150
who killed anyone and everyone to obtain power,

630
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:41,059
I would have exposed your sins long ago...

631
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:43,090
and put an end to all this.

632
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:44,559
Then...

633
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,360
would you...

634
00:53:47,199 --> 00:53:49,260
forgive me and Inspector General Choi...

635
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:51,670
and accept us?

636
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:53,440
If you do that,

637
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,199
I will install you...

638
00:53:57,469 --> 00:53:59,539
as Crown Prince instead of Prince Dosung,

639
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,179
- and Lady Myung Yoon will also... - No.

640
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:06,150
Just because I understand you,

641
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:08,619
it does not mean I can forgive you.

642
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:11,719
Because of you,

643
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,619
so many lives were lost already.

644
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,760
I do not think I will hear your answer today,

645
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,130
so let me ask you one last favor.

646
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:24,530
I wish...

647
00:54:25,769 --> 00:54:27,070
to take Sun Ok with me.

648
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:29,239
Could I have your permission?

649
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,380
Yes, you may take her.

650
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:48,489
I...

651
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:50,929
never wanted...

652
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,429
to hurt you.

653
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,500
I believe...

654
00:54:57,099 --> 00:54:58,469
that answers my question.

655
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:34,230
I cannot believe you let yourself get this drunk in broad daylight.

656
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,730
I must say, living like this is not bad.

657
00:56:37,969 --> 00:56:39,199
Right, Gap Dol?

658
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,670
I am Gap Seok.

659
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:42,900
All right, Gap Dol.

660
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:54,219
Gosh, you are so drunk!

661
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:00,190
He spent the whole day at the kisaeng house again?

662
00:57:03,059 --> 00:57:04,260
Do you not think it is strange?

663
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:09,030
Do you think Prince Susung would actually behave like this?

664
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:16,909
What is Myung Yoon up to?

665
00:57:17,139 --> 00:57:18,440
She was stuck in her room all day.

666
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:21,480
But she just heard about an emergency patient in the slums,

667
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,879
so she went out.

668
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,750
- At this late hour? - I apologize, my lord.

669
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,280
From now on, I will not let her go out so late.

670
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:29,980
It is okay.

671
00:57:30,789 --> 00:57:33,019
She must have a lot on her mind since her wedding is coming up.

672
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,460
Once she is married, she cannot do such a thing.

673
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:38,360
So just let her do whatever she wants for the next few days.

674
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:53,110
My lady.

675
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:01,050
Your Royal Highness, have you been keeping well?

676
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:03,420
You did this the last time too.

677
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,590
You have a knack for surprising me.

678
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,820
I apologize.

679
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:10,389
I did not want my father to see me,

680
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:12,559
so I had to come unannounced.

681
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,829
I suggest you two talk inside.

682
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:23,639
Let us go inside.

683
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,280
Has His Majesty's condition improved at all?

684
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:36,780
I keep sending him his medicine through the Head Eunuch,

685
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:38,949
but no. Not yet.

686
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:46,429
Moo Baek will let you know right away if he shows improvement.

687
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,730
You need not come here as it is dangerous.

688
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,829
The truth is,

689
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:53,699
I dropped by because I wanted to see you...

690
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:56,500
before I left to go and stay with my mother's maternal family.

691
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:57,969
Your mother's maternal family?

692
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:00,280
What do you mean, all of a sudden?

693
00:59:00,539 --> 00:59:03,340
I firmly trust that His Majesty will regain his consciousness.

694
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:04,679
However,

695
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:08,079
it does not look like it will happen before my wedding,

696
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,989
so I have decided to leave the Capital.

697
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:14,519
I will go to a place where no one knows me...

698
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:18,460
and live with patients who need my help.

699
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:21,030
I understand what you are saying,

700
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:24,328
but how will you manage alone in a place you are not familiar with?

701
00:59:24,329 --> 00:59:26,999
I have Oh Wol, and Moo Baek will come with us.

702
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,400
You know that is not what I meant.

703
00:59:29,139 --> 00:59:30,139
I...

704
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:33,780
I cannot let you go.

705
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,989
I was already dragged to the wedding ceremony once, and that is enough.

706
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:47,519
I do not want to go through that again.

707
00:59:49,789 --> 00:59:50,789
All right.

708
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,460
Then go there and wait for me.

709
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:54,260
Be it your relative's home or somewhere in the mountains.

710
00:59:55,099 --> 00:59:56,460
I will find you.

711
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:58,730
No.

712
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:03,809
If you look for me, my father will find out.

713
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,510
That will not happen.

714
01:00:05,909 --> 01:00:06,980
My father...

715
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:10,139
is a scary man. Have you forgotten all about it?

716
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,449
If we are meant to be,

717
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:21,190
we might meet again.

718
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,130
Just think of it that way and let me go.

719
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,070
If you would allow me,

720
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:43,309
I would like to say my farewells with due respect to you.

721
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,030
Your Royal Highness.

722
01:01:45,510 --> 01:01:46,570
What is the matter?

723
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:58,250
What is the reason for this unannounced visit?

724
01:01:58,750 --> 01:01:59,750
Do not tell me...

725
01:02:00,489 --> 01:02:02,059
you come bearing bad news about my father.

726
01:02:17,869 --> 01:02:18,869
Gun.

727
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:22,239
Father.

728
01:02:35,289 --> 01:02:36,289
Gun.

729
01:02:37,929 --> 01:02:38,960
Father.

730
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:42,030
It is I,

731
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:44,969
Gun.

732
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,329
You have been through so much.

733
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:54,999
(Missing Crown Prince)

734
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,768
We should let Dosung know...

735
01:03:56,769 --> 01:03:58,738
that Father has fully recovered.

736
01:03:58,739 --> 01:04:01,440
They say you must deceive your allies before deceiving your enemy.

737
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:03,179
Leave tomorrow and go far away.

738
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:04,880
If you stay here, you will die.

739
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:07,780
I heard you sent a letter to the Tiger Hunters.

740
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:10,420
Did the Queen Dowager send you?

741
01:04:10,650 --> 01:04:14,820
Traitor Choi Sang Rok! You are to be tied up!

742
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,760
If you want the Queen Dowager to be spared,

743
01:04:18,130 --> 01:04:19,460
kneel down at once.

744
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,230
Get down on your knees right this instant!
