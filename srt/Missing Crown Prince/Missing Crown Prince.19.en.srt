(All characters, locations, organizations, and incidents...)

00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,478
(in this drama are historically irrelevant and fictitious.)

10
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,648
(Production guidelines were strictly followed...)

11
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:48,750
(when filming with children and animals.)

12
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,630
That is it.

13
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,130
You are pregnant.

14
00:00:58,899 --> 00:00:59,929
Sang Rok.

15
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,609
Soo Ryeon.

16
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,909
(Episode 19)

17
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,400
The night air is cold. Why did you come out?

18
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:12,539
Are you admiring the moon?

19
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,810
If we get caught while on the run,

20
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:19,780
we will both die.

21
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,419
Why are you suddenly bringing up what we both know?

22
00:02:25,219 --> 00:02:28,919
You are pregnant now. I cannot get our child killed.

23
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,960
The baby is listening in my womb, so please stop.

24
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,229
Even if we manage to run away without getting caught,

25
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,930
our child will have to live in hiding forever as fugitives' child.

26
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,240
I cannot let that happen.

27
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,870
I know.

28
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,909
It did nothing wrong other than being born to fugitive parents.

29
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,719
It is such a cruel fate for the child.

30
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:01,590
What can we do though?

31
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:06,460
There is nothing we can do for the child.

32
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,460
We should...

33
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,900
return to the palace.

34
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,240
- Sang Rok. - Let us return.

35
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,779
We will go back and survive no matter what.

36
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,780
Sang Rok.

37
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,280
- Please... - I will do whatever it takes...

38
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,509
to make sure our child can survive.

39
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,250
I will kill everyone if I have to.

40
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,490
I will make sure...

41
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,719
our child can live at all costs.

42
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,319
The two of us can find our way from here on, so you should go.

43
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:14,090
- Will you be all right? - We are almost there.

44
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,889
I am afraid someone might see us. Hurry up and go.

45
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,230
I will keep her safe,

46
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,670
so do not worry.

47
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,970
I trust that you will take good care of her.

48
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:29,240
- I will contact you. - Okay.

49
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:39,350
- Your Majesty. - Gosh.

50
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:43,220
Let us go.

51
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,800
That is enough. You should get going.

52
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,439
You are burning up.

53
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:02,639
You have a high fever.

54
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:06,739
I am just a little tired because I walked for a while.

55
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,349
If you are unwell, the child will also feel unwell.

56
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,778
Do you not know that?

57
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:12,420
If you are worried about our child, hurry up and leave.

58
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:14,889
If a problem arises,

59
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:17,120
what will happen to the child?

60
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,060
Fine.

61
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:22,029
This is done.

62
00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:25,959
But about the King...

63
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:30,470
He will watch your every move.

64
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:35,170
Would it be possible to make a move without getting caught?

65
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:37,139
Do not worry.

66
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,209
I have a plan.

67
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,449
More importantly,

68
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,720
how did the King regain consciousness overnight?

69
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,850
That is what I do not understand.

70
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,620
How did it happen without me knowing...

71
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,430
I checked and made sure that the book was still there.

72
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,970
(Five)

73
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,439
My gosh.

74
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:11,139
Who did this?

75
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:16,949
It was Myung Yoon.

76
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,250
Myung Yoon? When did she do this?

77
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:21,149
On the day of Prince Gwangchang's memorial ceremony,

78
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:23,250
you were not at your palace.

79
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,389
(Five)

80
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:41,040
However, we cannot be sure that it was Myung Yoon.

81
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,138
Perhaps, it was someone else...

82
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,939
Out of everyone who had a reason to visit your palace,

83
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,910
she was the only one who would recognize this book and needed...

84
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,120
to view what was in it.

85
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,529
Was it you?

86
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,470
Did you...

87
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,939
take the book?

88
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,970
Yes, it was me.

89
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:21,180
Do you truly not realize what you have done?

90
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,550
I simply did what I had to do.

91
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,649
Cornering your own father into a deadly situation?

92
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,749
Is that what you had to do as my child?

93
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,620
I did it because I am your child.

94
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,519
As your child,

95
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,160
I believed that it was my duty to right your wrongs.

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,029
Do you hate me that much?

97
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:45,870
To the point that you would side with them to get me killed?

98
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,509
Do you...

99
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,670
hate me that much?

100
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,110
Yes.

101
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,139
I hate you.

102
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,449
I absolutely hate you and resent you.

103
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,120
When I think about Mother, I am filled...

104
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,589
with bone-deep sorrow and resentment.

105
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,129
As of this moment, you are not to leave the house.

106
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:14,829
You must stay in your room. You are grounded.

107
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:16,430
I refuse.

108
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,870
- What did you say? - I said, "I refuse."

109
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,339
Until His Majesty fully recovers,

110
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:27,040
I will visit the palace every day.

111
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,480
If you keep trying to stop me,

112
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:32,620
I will...

113
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,820
move out.

114
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,889
Moo Baek, are you outside?

115
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:45,100
Lock Myung Yoon in her room.

116
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:47,429
Make sure she does not even step out of her room.

117
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:51,440
Please let her go.

118
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:57,240
How dare you. After scheming with Myung Yoon...

119
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:59,139
to deceive me,

120
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:02,210
you are daring to disobey me now?

121
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,320
You may take my life.

122
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:11,960
Please let her go, and I will do...

123
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,759
everything you say.

124
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,360
If you order me to die, I will gladly take my own life.

125
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,460
So please...

126
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,799
let Lady Myung Yoon go.

127
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,159
You may go.

128
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,769
The moment you leave this room,

129
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,110
you are...

130
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,480
no longer my daughter.

131
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,490
Your Royal Highness.

132
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,750
Your Royal Highness, how did you find me here?

133
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,649
Did you bring him here?

134
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:58,690
No, I...

135
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:01,289
- I ran into her on my way here. - Yes.

136
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:03,889
We ran into each other, apparently.

137
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,799
You must go to the palace now.

138
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,529
Is His Majesty unwell?

139
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,549
Did you sleep well last night?

140
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,049
Yes, I did.

141
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,320
It seems that the fever has gone down,

142
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,019
but it will spike again if you push yourself too hard,

143
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:35,830
- so please... - Understood.

144
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,000
I will take it easy.

145
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,269
I think he is still having difficulty breathing.

146
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,740
Can it not improve with some herbal medicine or acupuncture?

147
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:47,808
Is it very uncomfortable?

148
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:48,909
No, it is fine.

149
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,539
Do you not see that I am fine?

150
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,508
I heard you cough when I came to greet you in the morning...

151
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:57,979
You said you had to go to the Crown Prince Tutorial Office.

152
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:01,288
(Seoyeon: Education system for Crown Prince)

153
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:03,220
- Yes. - Then get going.

154
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,730
Yes, Your Majesty.

155
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,299
Buyong Pavilion.

156
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,909
Get going. What are you waiting for?

157
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,279
Yes, Your Majesty. I will be off, then.

158
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,019
Buyong Pavilion.

159
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,058
Your Majesty. Please forgive me for saying this, but...

160
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:43,960
If you must ask for forgiveness, do not say it.

161
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,830
I told the Head Eunuch...

162
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:53,539
to arrange a room for you to stay.

163
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,840
I would like you to stay there for the time being...

164
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:00,110
and check in on me every morning and evening.

165
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:02,909
Could you do that for me?

166
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

167
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,820
What do you mean?

168
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,460
Please forgive me for saying this,

169
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,029
but many members of the Seoin Faction...

170
00:14:17,929 --> 00:14:19,960
were supporters of Yoon Yi Kyum,

171
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:22,629
so they are having a hard time with the investigation.

172
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,799
I did expect it to happen,

173
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,809
but this may be our last chance to uproot the problem,

174
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:30,639
so we must not make a single mistake.

175
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,480
Yes.

176
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:35,149
We will do our very best.

177
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,980
As you are well aware,

178
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,018
Yoon Yi Kyum will not give up...

179
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:40,419
just because he is behind bars now.

180
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,159
We do not know what they would do if we gave them more time,

181
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,220
so please hurry.

182
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,970
You do not seem well.

183
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,799
Do you feel unwell?

184
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,940
No.

185
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:05,210
I am fine, so do not worry about me.

186
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,009
- I am worried about you... - I am fine too.

187
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,149
You know I like to play and spend time idly.

188
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,690
Anyway, why did you ask for me?

189
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,289
He wishes to see you.

190
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,230
Who?

191
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,999
Your maternal grandfather wants to see you.

192
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,029
No, I refuse.

193
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:30,500
- I do not want to see him. - Dosung.

194
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,469
He is still your grandfather.

195
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,309
What my so-called grandfather did to my own father...

196
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:38,379
Mother.

197
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:41,979
Do you not resent Grandfather?

198
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,450
I resent him too.

199
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,548
Even just thinking about the cruelty of it...

200
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:47,350
makes my heart race and smothers me.

201
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,350
But what can I do?

202
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,960
He is my father and your grandfather.

203
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,029
Just once.

204
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:01,830
Please meet him just once.

205
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,600
We do not know when he will be sent into exile.

206
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,070
Once that happens, you may never see him again.

207
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,809
Please, do it for my sake.

208
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,450
It may be your last chance to see him again, so meet him just once.

209
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,549
Please?

210
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,080
Dosung.

211
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,879
I was told that you were confined to your residence.

212
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:48,250
Can you be out and about freely like this?

213
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,549
I am here with His Majesty's permission.

214
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,590
Father allowed you to visit the palace?

215
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:55,889
Yes.

216
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,190
I was told to visit the palace today...

217
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,559
so that the new Inspector General can take over my duties.

218
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:04,089
What brings you here, Your Highness?

219
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:10,230
Are you here to see your maternal grandfather?

220
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,509
The Namin Faction will be sure to kill your maternal grandfather.

221
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,880
After that,

222
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,579
they will go after the Queen...

223
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,349
and Your Highness.

224
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,588
(Hoe, Ogyeong, Paok)

225
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:10,629
(Escape between 3am and 5am on the 1st)

226
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,130
Who sent it?

227
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,400
It was probably...

228
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,880
Prince Dosung.

229
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:30,210
I knew you would come to see me.

230
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:31,650
I...

231
00:18:31,651 --> 00:18:33,619
How could you do such a horrendous thing?

232
00:18:34,349 --> 00:18:36,690
- Prince Dosung. - Even if you are blinded by power,

233
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,660
you cannot do such a thing and still call yourself human.

234
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:42,630
Do you not fear the sky?

235
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,359
How dare you try to assassinate my father?

236
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,098
Please hear me out first.

237
00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:51,140
What more did you want?

238
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:52,799
It is not true!

239
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,740
I was framed for it.

240
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,769
Just like the Queen Dowager,

241
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,140
the King framed me...

242
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:02,949
so that he could banish me from the palace for the Crown Prince's sake!

243
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,920
Do you expect me to believe that?

244
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,348
Try to come up with believable excuses if you wish to deceive me.

245
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,259
I did it...

246
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:15,558
only for you and the Queen...

247
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,630
It was for my sake...

248
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,430
that you tried to kill my father?

249
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,029
It was for Mother's sake that you tried to kill her husband?

250
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,008
Prince Dosung, I was only trying to protect the family...

251
00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:32,039
Stop!

252
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,009
Please, that is enough.

253
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,450
Because of you, Mother is in such a precarious situation now.

254
00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:40,049
You still have something to say?

255
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:46,190
I only came here because Mother practically begged me to.

256
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,660
This is the last time.

257
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:52,029
I do not wish to see you again.

258
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,529
What do you want...

259
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,900
this old man to do?

260
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,210
Confess to everything you did...

261
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,380
and beg for forgiveness.

262
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,049
That is the only thing...

263
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:14,619
you can do, Grandfather.

264
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:39,309
(Buyong Pavilion)

265
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:26,758
Why did the new Inspector General call you here?

266
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,960
He tried to sound me out, using the takeover as an excuse.

267
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:32,730
I suppose he wishes to make a notable contribution.

268
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,430
Even now, he must be keeping a watchful eye on us.

269
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,670
So is it okay that we are meeting like this?

270
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:42,240
They already know about it anyway.

271
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:43,939
If they were going to take issue with it,

272
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,539
they would have exposed it already.

273
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:48,779
- Even so, you should be careful... - How are you feeling?

274
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,049
Are you all right?

275
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,150
Do you feel any discomfort?

276
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:55,690
No, I am fine.

277
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,289
Anyway, I heard Myung Yoon was in the bedchamber again.

278
00:22:00,789 --> 00:22:02,029
What is going on?

279
00:22:02,589 --> 00:22:05,299
You still have not had a chance to talk to her?

280
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,299
Myung Yoon is...

281
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:13,069
no longer my daughter.

282
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:15,339
Sang Rok!

283
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:18,839
This is why I told you to clear up the misunderstanding first.

284
00:22:19,109 --> 00:22:20,308
What are you thinking,

285
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:23,410
letting her believe that you killed her mother?

286
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,980
It cannot be undone.

287
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:29,089
It is not like she would believe me now...

288
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,220
if I told her that I did not kill her mother.

289
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,559
So, why did you say that to her in the first place?

290
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,589
Do you think Myung Yoon will be at ease...

291
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,730
if the misunderstanding about me is cleared up?

292
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:41,029
Do you not think that she will be...

293
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:44,170
even more conflicted between me and the Crown Prince?

294
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:47,269
Even so,

295
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:50,440
letting her think that her father killed her mother...

296
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,779
is too cruel.

297
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,778
Why do you not realize...

298
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:57,450
that you are making her live in misery by doing this?

299
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,750
If you refuse to tell her the truth, I will tell her.

300
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,690
No.

301
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,630
She will not believe me either.

302
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:14,970
I will ask Master Geowoo to tell her.

303
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,740
She will believe Master Geowoo.

304
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,970
Leave her be.

305
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,769
We will let Myung Yoon...

306
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,440
stay with the Crown Prince.

307
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,750
- Sang Rok. - She must stay by his side.

308
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:32,079
Only then will she survive...

309
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,490
even if our plan fails.

310
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,349
Myung Yoon.

311
00:24:10,589 --> 00:24:12,160
Even after everything that happened,

312
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,619
you sneaked into the palace for a secret rendezvous?

313
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,028
I am ashamed and disgusted...

314
00:24:17,029 --> 00:24:19,598
that we are breathing the same air.

315
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,329
Watch what you say.

316
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:23,699
You are speaking before Her Majesty the Queen Dowager.

317
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,740
To me, she is just my despicable father's secret lover,

318
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:28,839
who caused my mother's death.

319
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,069
Have you forgotten already?

320
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:32,279
I told you that you were no longer my daughter.

321
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:33,910
How dare you call me your father?

322
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,180
Why are you being like this? Please...

323
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,349
We should go.

324
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,619
What are these flowers for?

325
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,699
Did you find them on the ground again?

326
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,599
Oh, how did you know?

327
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:06,369
They are very beautiful.

328
00:26:06,569 --> 00:26:09,369
The spring flowers are in full bloom outside.

329
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,710
Let us go outside.

330
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,108
But what if someone sees us?

331
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:14,809
Then we will hide among the flowers.

332
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,049
You look...

333
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,450
just as beautiful as a flower.

334
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:23,519
My lady.

335
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:26,119
My lady?

336
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:28,789
My lady?

337
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,230
"When the spring breeze starts to blow,"

338
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,169
"the plum, cherry, apricot, peach,"

339
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,569
"and pear trees in the palace..."

340
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:45,079
"begin to bloom one by one."

341
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:48,450
"The shepherd's purse..."

342
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:50,950
"and samaras in the mountains..."

343
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:52,779
"also say..."

344
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:55,490
"that the spring breeze..."

345
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,690
"came for you."

346
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:05,899
No, it is "The spring breeze came for me."

347
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,829
Exactly. It came for you.

348
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:14,670
"Spring Breeze" is...

349
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:18,109
such a perfect poem for this scenery, is it not?

350
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:23,180
Yes.

351
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:34,319
Here comes the spring breeze.

352
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:45,640
Winter is gone, and spring is here now,

353
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:49,609
so we can worry about the cold, snowy days later on.

354
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,750
The thing is,

355
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,250
I saw my father...

356
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,220
and the Queen Dowager in front of Buyong Pavilion.

357
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,960
You did?

358
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,660
He is supposed to be confined to his residence, but he is here.

359
00:28:15,869 --> 00:28:19,240
Should we not let His Majesty know right away?

360
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:20,339
All right.

361
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:22,670
I will let him know when I see him later.

362
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,950
- Is everything ready? - Yes, my lord.

363
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:13,190
But must you do it?

364
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,089
I apologize.

365
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,799
I am worried what would happen to Lady Myung Yoon.

366
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:22,900
Please forgive me.

367
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,140
My plan must succeed for Myung Yoon's sake.

368
00:29:31,009 --> 00:29:32,380
If you are thinking...

369
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:34,980
that I must fail for Myung Yoon to be with the Crown Prince,

370
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:36,880
then you are wrong.

371
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:40,549
Whether I succeed or not,

372
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:45,019
Myung Yoon is already a traitor's daughter.

373
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,819
The Crown Prince...

374
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,259
cannot marry her...

375
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:51,660
no matter how much he wishes to.

376
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,730
Of course, I believe that the Crown Prince...

377
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:00,569
will not kill Myung Yoon even if I fail.

378
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,140
She will be spared,

379
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,279
but she will have to live in hiding for the rest of her life...

380
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:09,809
even if she gets lucky and avoids becoming a slave.

381
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:14,980
Do you think Myung Yoon will want to live like that?

382
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:19,960
If you understand what I am saying,

383
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:22,559
you should pray that my plan will succeed...

384
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:25,500
for Myung Yoon's sake.

385
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,730
It has been a while since I told you to investigate...

386
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:34,269
Yoon Yi Kyum and Yoon Jung Dae for framing the Crown Prince,

387
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,609
but I have yet to receive a report from you.

388
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:40,579
And how come no one is discussing the deaths...

389
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:42,680
of Kim Dal Saeng and Heo Jin Soo at the Royal Infirmary?

390
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:47,220
Yoon Yi Kyum, Yoon Jung Dae, and Choi Sang Rok.

391
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:50,650
Are you trying to protect them for you all belong to the same faction?

392
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,789
Who is your King?

393
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,259
Shall I replace everyone from the Seoin Faction...

394
00:30:56,289 --> 00:30:59,130
with those from the Namin Faction to make you listen to me?

395
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,869
I expect you to submit a report...

396
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:06,670
with the criminal's confession by tomorrow!

397
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,038
- Yes, Your Majesty! - Yes, Your Majesty!

398
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:11,869
(Gongcho: A suspect's statement containing a confession)

399
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,490
Father!

400
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,190
- Father! - Your Majesty!

401
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:32,299
I am fine. Leave, all of you.

402
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,200
Your Majesty, you must get your pulse checked first.

403
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,569
Please understand.

404
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,669
- Please understand. - Please understand.

405
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,940
I told you all to leave!

406
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:12,039
Your Majesty, your pulse is so unstable that I can hardly feel it.

407
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:15,469
You need absolute rest at the moment...

408
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:18,109
That means I will not die right away.

409
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:22,380
- Your Majesty. - Fine, I will be careful.

410
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:25,618
You must detach yourself from the state affairs for the time being.

411
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:28,220
Thank you for your help. You may leave now.

412
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:32,859
Your Majesty.

413
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:36,159
You must not take that medicine.

414
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,859
Are you there, Head Eunuch?

415
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:39,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

416
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,430
I need some rest.

417
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:47,440
Leave now.

418
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:53,440
Is he that unwell?

419
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,279
Yes.

420
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,450
His Majesty needs rest.

421
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,049
However, he has been overworking himself for days.

422
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,960
It is only natural for his health to deteriorate.

423
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:07,420
What should we do?

424
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:12,900
Your Royal Highness.

425
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,399
Actually...

426
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,000
Your Royal Highness. It is I, Gap Seok.

427
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:20,069
Come in.

428
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,549
Greetings to Your Royal Highness.

429
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,329
It has been a while.

430
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,308
When the Queen Dowager wedded the former King...

431
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:03,609
and moved into the palace

432
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:07,380
your father made a bad decision.

433
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:14,159
He tried to take his life by jumping off a cliff.

434
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:19,230
The one who saved your father back then was your mother.

435
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:22,929
With that encounter, the two got married.

436
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,439
Your father became a doctor by mastering...

437
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,899
medical techniques from his father-in-law,

438
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,639
who worked at the Royal Infirmary.

439
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:33,880
It would have been great if it ended there.

440
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,678
Learning about Soo Ryeon's miserable life...

441
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:39,650
as the Queen Dowager became...

442
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,250
the source...

443
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:44,719
of all troubles.

444
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,090
Your Majesty!

445
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,829
Your Majesty! No!

446
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,199
Soo Ryeon!

447
00:34:58,599 --> 00:34:59,739
Court Lady Kim!

448
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:03,769
Court Lady Kim!

449
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,050
This way.

450
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,558
When the Queen Dowager was on the verge of death...

451
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:21,789
because of the constant ill-treatment from the deposed King,

452
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:26,199
your father hid Her Majesty in his house.

453
00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:30,530
Did you just say the Queen Dowager?

454
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,300
My apologies to shock you, my lady.

455
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:34,570
No, it is all right.

456
00:35:35,269 --> 00:35:36,570
But you are holding a sword.

457
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:42,610
I will explain in detail over time.

458
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:44,510
With that in mind today...

459
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,559
When your father had gone to your mother to explain the situation,

460
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:32,329
the assassins sent by the deposed King...

461
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:35,699
had already invaded the main building of your house.

462
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,090
Let us go.

463
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:15,670
My lady!

464
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,110
When your father returned to the room,

465
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,909
the assassins mistook your mother for the Queen Dowager...

466
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,980
and had taken her life already.

467
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,219
Go.

468
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:29,250
You must stop them.

469
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,750
Do not talk.

470
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,219
First,

471
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,019
let me see your wound.

472
00:37:35,889 --> 00:37:36,889
As long as...

473
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,730
they know you hid the Queen Dowager,

474
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,099
we are not safe.

475
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,769
They will try to kill all of us.

476
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,900
Our dear Myung Yoon.

477
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:51,210
To save her,

478
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,280
you must stop them.

479
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:24,090
Had your father not listened to your mother,

480
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:27,860
gone after the assassins, and stopped them,

481
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,400
not only your father...

482
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:34,599
but also you would not have survived.

483
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:36,940
Your father...

484
00:40:37,869 --> 00:40:39,510
To save you,

485
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,550
he had given up on your mother.

486
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:44,480
He...

487
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:46,780
did not...

488
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,820
kill her.

489
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:52,219
I do not believe you.

490
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,159
When I asked if he had killed Mother,

491
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,059
Father...

492
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:05,670
clearly said he did so.

493
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:07,969
Because your mother died because of him,

494
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:13,039
your father thinks he killed her...

495
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,980
and lived...

496
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:19,750
reproaching himself all his life.

497
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,789
He is a poor soul.

498
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:29,730
I feel sorry for you.

499
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:34,400
Your mother too.

500
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:36,869
And even...

501
00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:39,400
your father.

502
00:41:42,809 --> 00:41:44,070
What...

503
00:41:46,679 --> 00:41:49,349
must we do with this karma?

504
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,139
Thank you for coming all the way here.

505
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,909
Do not worry about it, Your Royal Highness.

506
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:27,420
- Escort him. - Understood.

507
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,219
This way, please.

508
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,960
Is His Royal Highness and Lady Myung Yoon's fate that bad?

509
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,969
Their fates have already taken different paths.

510
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:49,139
By different paths,

511
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:52,510
do you mean they cannot be together?

512
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:56,579
His Royal Highness is gifted with the fate of becoming the King,

513
00:42:57,179 --> 00:42:58,210
while...

514
00:42:58,849 --> 00:43:03,090
there is no wealth nor honor in Myung Yoon's fate.

515
00:43:05,389 --> 00:43:07,219
Do you understand now?

516
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:49,570
Your Royal Highness.

517
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:53,800
There is nothing I can do for you,

518
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:00,239
but why do you keep giving...

519
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,239
and giving?

520
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:04,510
I have not given you anything.

521
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,250
Do you not hate my father?

522
00:44:09,219 --> 00:44:10,449
If I were you,

523
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,420
I would hate him with every fiber of my body.

524
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:16,730
But still, you invited Master Geowoo here...

525
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:19,829
to clear the misunderstanding I had about my father.

526
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:36,079
How about a drink?

527
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,289
Let us drink.

528
00:45:04,539 --> 00:45:07,579
There is something I have been indulging in.

529
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:09,609
(Byuk: Enjoying something to the extreme)

530
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:11,509
That would be you.

531
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,719
(Byuk: Enjoying something to the extreme)

532
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,719
You have developed a strange habit.

533
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,788
They say spikes form in your mouth...

534
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:23,159
if you do not read every single day.

535
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:24,530
As for me,

536
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,630
the same happens if I do not get to see you smile...

537
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:31,269
- at least once every day. - My gosh.

538
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:34,039
One might think you coated your lips with honey.

539
00:45:34,139 --> 00:45:36,570
Honey is what is on your lips.

540
00:45:37,670 --> 00:45:39,369
How could they be that sweet?

541
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,280
Someone might hear you.

542
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:48,679
You...

543
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:52,889
are what I indulge in.

544
00:46:38,869 --> 00:46:42,039
No. I meant what shape these looked like.

545
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,539
They look like petals.

546
00:46:44,769 --> 00:46:46,980
You are right. They are apricot petals.

547
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:49,239
The apricot petals you like.

548
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,170
Gosh.

549
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:26,179
My lady!

550
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:31,649
Why do you look so surprised?

551
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:32,889
Surprised? No, I am not.

552
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:34,860
You kept threatening me,

553
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:36,760
so I expected you to look like a goblin,

554
00:47:37,289 --> 00:47:39,429
but you are actually quite beautiful.

555
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:40,530
What?

556
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:47,038
You may be a physician,

557
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:48,599
but I am not just your patient.

558
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:52,340
I am also your husband.

559
00:47:57,579 --> 00:48:00,519
There is no way of knowing what will happen between two people.

560
00:48:00,949 --> 00:48:03,889
I hear those who are meant to be will end up together.

561
00:48:04,789 --> 00:48:06,259
Who knows? Fate could...

562
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,090
bring us together again.

563
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:13,199
You are simply the first woman I have ever loved...

564
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:16,469
after entering this world.

565
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:23,469
So I ask you to please remember me...

566
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:25,969
as a man who loved you,

567
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,750
not as the Crown Prince.

568
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,190
Until the petals that fall...

569
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,590
make a mountain of their own...

570
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:48,500
I will remember you forever.

571
00:48:57,869 --> 00:48:59,780
You and the Crown Prince cannot be together.

572
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:06,750
I know that you have a good heart...

573
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:10,889
and am aware of all that you did to help me get better.

574
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:12,550
That is why I am grateful.

575
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:15,719
If there is anything you want,

576
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:19,929
I truly would love to grant every request.

577
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,500
I am honored, Your Majesty.

578
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:26,969
However, I cannot allow you...

579
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,639
to be with the Crown Prince.

580
00:49:33,139 --> 00:49:35,610
It is not just because of your father.

581
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:37,849
The Crown Prince...

582
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,780
needs people he can rely on.

583
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:44,989
Those who can aid him in tough situations.

584
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:51,889
Do you understand what I am saying?

585
00:49:55,699 --> 00:49:56,769
Yes, Your Majesty.

586
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:01,400
I will leave as soon as you recover.

587
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:05,670
Do you not resent me...

588
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,510
for saying this?

589
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:11,150
Hardly, Your Majesty.

590
00:50:11,949 --> 00:50:13,749
I am worthy of dying,

591
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:15,849
but you showed boundless generosity.

592
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,519
For that, I am deeply grateful.

593
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,190
The universe is cruel.

594
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:29,599
Why is it that someone like you...

595
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:34,070
had to be born as Choi Sang Rok's daughter?

596
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:55,360
Last time, we were on the opposite sides of these bars.

597
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,130
Back then,

598
00:51:00,329 --> 00:51:02,559
you told me to kill myself for the sake of the others.

599
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,070
I am sure you remember that.

600
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:10,909
For Dosung who you truly cherish,

601
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:14,280
you will confess to all of your crimes...

602
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,579
and be punished accordingly.

603
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:31,029
Do you not know...

604
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:32,929
that if I am found guilty of high treason,

605
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,230
Prince Dosung and the Queen...

606
00:51:36,699 --> 00:51:39,369
will no longer be able to secure their positions?

607
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,468
Even if I were of the Namin Faction,

608
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:45,110
they would not be left in peace.

609
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:49,440
If you truly wish the best for Prince Dosung,

610
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,610
you should take the initiative...

611
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:55,119
and have me released.

612
00:51:58,219 --> 00:51:59,349
Is it your wish...

613
00:52:00,389 --> 00:52:02,019
to make me a tyrant like the deposed king...

614
00:52:02,590 --> 00:52:04,529
who killed his own family?

615
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:07,329
(Pyemosalje: Expelling one's mother and killing a younger sibling)

616
00:52:07,829 --> 00:52:08,929
To me,

617
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,929
Father and Joseon...

618
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:17,039
mean more to me than the Queen and Dosung.

619
00:52:20,539 --> 00:52:23,349
I will see you again at the interrogation.

620
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,849
Could...

621
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:34,719
Could he have meant that?

622
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:20,269
Inspector General Choi?

623
00:53:30,409 --> 00:53:32,480
Are you the one who broke us out?

624
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,380
Yes.

625
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,090
Why?

626
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,219
Because the enemy of my enemy...

627
00:53:41,289 --> 00:53:42,989
is a friend.

628
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,698
What is this?

629
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:55,669
- It is poison. - What?

630
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:57,009
You betrayed me once,

631
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:59,980
and I cannot guarantee that you will not betray me again.

632
00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:01,409
Consume it.

633
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,550
How dare you?

634
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:09,750
Why did you break us out if this is what you had in mind?

635
00:54:09,989 --> 00:54:11,320
Agree to the coup,

636
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:15,789
and I will give you the antidote.

637
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:18,789
Did you say a coup?

638
00:54:18,929 --> 00:54:20,400
I am puzzled as to why you are shocked.

639
00:54:20,599 --> 00:54:22,400
What other option do we have...

640
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,530
if we wish to survive?

641
00:54:26,099 --> 00:54:28,469
It is a path we have already taken once.

642
00:54:29,769 --> 00:54:32,409
What is stopping us from doing it a second time?

643
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:37,750
Who will ascend the throne?

644
00:54:43,219 --> 00:54:44,219
Who else...

645
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:47,960
but Prince Dosung?

646
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,760
Now,

647
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:25,730
say what it is you need.

648
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:37,070
I will need the aid...

649
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:39,940
of the Seoin Faction.

650
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,280
The palace is still crawling...

651
00:55:43,579 --> 00:55:45,750
with rats who sided with the sinners!

652
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,518
Am I wrong?

653
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:48,979
The Inspector General will speak!

654
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,649
Forgive me for saying this,

655
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:53,319
but those who have been hindering the investigations...

656
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:56,059
are currently present in the royal court.

657
00:55:56,730 --> 00:55:58,989
The Seoin Faction must be punished, Your Majesty.

658
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:00,799
That is wrong, Your Majesty.

659
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:03,500
Namin scholars were in charge of guarding the prison.

660
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:04,698
Have the Namin Faction...

661
00:56:04,699 --> 00:56:07,300
take responsibility and punish those involved!

662
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:10,368
- What are you saying? - How dare you?

663
00:56:10,369 --> 00:56:12,808
- That is preposterous. - It is outrageous.

664
00:56:12,809 --> 00:56:15,738
- You know he is right. - How dare you blame us?

665
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:18,150
- But he was right. - Such nonsense.

666
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,880
Enough!

667
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,550
Even though we are in this mess,

668
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:27,659
you are busy arguing among your factions.

669
00:56:27,789 --> 00:56:29,960
I deeply deplore...

670
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:35,300
- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty?

671
00:56:35,659 --> 00:56:37,269
- Your Majesty. - Your Majesty.

672
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,198
- Your Majesty! - What happened?

673
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:40,239
- Your Majesty... - Get a physician.

674
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:48,139
Bring me Lady Myung Yoon.

675
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,710
Lady Myung Yoon left...

676
00:56:50,849 --> 00:56:52,480
as soon as the gates opened...

677
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:54,579
to visit her residence, Your Royal Highness.

678
00:56:58,989 --> 00:57:00,050
Father.

679
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,440
My lady.

680
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:30,250
What I wanted to achieve...

681
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:33,489
must now...

682
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:38,760
be done...

683
00:57:39,329 --> 00:57:42,960
by you as the Crown Prince.

684
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:48,300
Are you prepared...

685
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:52,670
for what is to come?

686
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:59,110
Yes, Father.

687
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,989
I...

688
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,860
have faith in you.

689
00:58:13,929 --> 00:58:16,659
I will do my best.

690
00:58:17,969 --> 00:58:19,500
Bring me...

691
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,940
the Queen...

692
00:58:24,969 --> 00:58:26,210
and the ministers.

693
00:58:35,019 --> 00:58:36,420
Help me up.

694
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:52,400
The Crown Prince will approach.

695
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:02,579
A father passing the crown to his son...

696
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:05,408
is sanctioned by the skies as an honorable act.

697
00:59:05,409 --> 00:59:07,448
(Jeonwi: A king passing the crown to his heir)

698
00:59:07,449 --> 00:59:08,980
Due to my illness,

699
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:12,550
I will not be able to fulfill my official duties.

700
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,860
The state affairs I must deal with...

701
00:59:15,989 --> 00:59:17,760
only leaves me more worried.

702
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:21,359
That is why I will have the Crown Prince take over...

703
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,129
and focus on my recovery...

704
00:59:23,130 --> 00:59:24,699
while resting in peace.

705
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,139
The Crown Prince, Gun,

706
00:59:27,969 --> 00:59:29,169
who is smart, modest,

707
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:30,969
good as a brother and son, generous, and benevolent...

708
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:34,139
is qualified to ascend the throne,

709
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:38,848
so I officially announce his accession to the throne.

710
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:40,919
(Daebo: The royal seal)

711
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,480
(Seonwi: Abdication of the king)

712
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,259
The ministers and officials of the royal court...

713
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,389
will accept my sincerity...

714
01:00:25,929 --> 01:00:28,659
and help each other as one...

715
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:32,900
to bring peace to our nation.

716
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:59,289
I apologize.

717
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:01,460
How could you even say such a thing?

718
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:04,269
Now that I have abdicated from the throne,

719
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:07,900
the Namin Faction...

720
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:11,469
will not...

721
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:13,670
let you and Dosung...

722
01:01:14,679 --> 01:01:17,849
live in peace.

723
01:01:18,809 --> 01:01:21,320
Forgive me for not being able...

724
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,920
to protect you.

725
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:36,030
His Majesty shall now enter.

726
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:31,219
He has ordered you to stand up.

727
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:39,059
We greet His Majesty.

728
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:43,130
- We greet His Majesty. - We greet His Majesty.

729
01:02:45,099 --> 01:02:48,670
Father will be referred to as "sangwang" out of respect.

730
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,968
The former king...

731
01:02:50,969 --> 01:02:52,969
will head to Onyang Temporary Palace to focus on his recovery.

732
01:02:53,139 --> 01:02:54,179
It will be your duty...

733
01:02:54,909 --> 01:02:56,808
to prepare for the journey.

734
01:02:56,809 --> 01:02:59,349
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

735
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,989
How should we address the Queen?

736
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:06,190
The Queen...

737
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:09,460
committed a mortal sin by killing the royal taster...

738
01:03:09,889 --> 01:03:12,190
who attempted the murder of the former king.

739
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:15,429
As it is customary of the royal house,

740
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:17,530
Queen Yoon will be deposed...

741
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:20,400
and will be confined to her private residence.

742
01:03:25,710 --> 01:03:27,679
Prince Dosung will also be deposed,

743
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,408
stripped of his title, and forced out of Hanyang!

744
01:03:30,409 --> 01:03:33,209
(Munoechulsong: A punishment of stripping one's title...)

745
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,920
(and forcing them out of Hanyang)

746
01:04:18,829 --> 01:04:20,559
(Missing Crown Prince)

747
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:23,429
Do not just stand there and protect Her Majesty.

748
01:04:23,699 --> 01:04:25,300
The Grand Queen Dowager...

749
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:28,070
has been murdered tonight.

750
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:30,268
Is this the reason you wanted to be King?

751
01:04:30,269 --> 01:04:32,610
To remove both your mother and brother?

752
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:35,539
Be grateful that I did not order you to take poison.

753
01:04:35,909 --> 01:04:37,780
Order that instead.

754
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,279
If I wish to be King,

755
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:41,320
I must lead a rebellion.

756
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:44,690
It will be my brother and not my father who I dethrone.

757
01:04:44,949 --> 01:04:46,750
I will be King.
