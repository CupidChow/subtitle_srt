(Episode 18)

13
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,239
If you wish to spare her life,

14
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,349
you will kneel.

15
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,200
Head Eunuch, are you here?

16
00:01:36,269 --> 00:01:37,670
Yes, Your Majesty.

17
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,810
The Queen Dowager seems to be in great shock.

18
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,769
Escort her to her chamber.

19
00:01:42,939 --> 00:01:44,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

20
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,260
Commander of the Royal Guards,

21
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:06,299
arrest the Commander of the Palace Guards and his men.

22
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,270
Until I specify otherwise,

23
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:11,469
the palace gates are to be guarded...

24
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:14,409
so that not even a rat can escape. Do you understand?

25
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:16,409
Yes, Your Majesty.

26
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,908
There will be a cabinet meeting.

27
00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:20,109
(Jogye: A royal cabinet meeting...)

28
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,109
(where issues are discussed with the king)

29
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,210
Follow me inside.

30
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:21,340
I am aware of the many incidents...

31
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:24,810
that transpired while I was bedridden.

32
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,378
The Crown Prince of this nation...

33
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,719
was deposed after being falsely accused.

34
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,919
His maternal grandfather...

35
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,490
Jang Hyun Mok was murdered.

36
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,460
What have you been doing...

37
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,560
that allowed such tragic events to take place?

38
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,900
If you can speak, at least explain yourselves.

39
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:48,030
And you call yourself my loyal subjects?

40
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,900
- We deserve to die, Your Majesty. - We deserve to die, Your Majesty.

41
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,409
You are to all hand in your resignation.

42
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,680
Anyone involved in these crimes will be stripped of their titles.

43
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,649
Anything implemented or planned...

44
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,620
that was against my wishes...

45
00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:07,889
has been repealed, so know that.

46
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:11,159
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

47
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,489
Prince Dosung's installation of Crown Prince...

48
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,159
will also be revoked.

49
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,589
Prince Dosung,

50
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,629
you are to leave the palace as soon as the assembly is over.

51
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

52
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,949
Magistrate Yoon, step forward.

53
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:46,759
Bring in the sinners.

54
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:47,959
Yes, Your Majesty.

55
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,740
These men are responsible...

56
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,750
for murdering Jang Hyun Mok while being transported.

57
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:12,779
Speak of the person who gave you the order.

58
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:18,959
It was Magistrate Yoon, Your Majesty.

59
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:23,959
Magistrate Yoon, do you have any words?

60
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:31,198
I do not deserve to live, Your Majesty.

61
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,839
Arrest Magistrate Yoon who ordered the murder...

62
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:36,008
of Jang Hyun Mok.

63
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:37,009
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

64
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:52,920
Left State Councilor, step forward.

65
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,269
Falsely accusing the Crown Prince...

66
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:05,639
and framing him is a crime of grave nature.

67
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:10,540
Left State Councilor Yoon Yi Kyum...

68
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:11,939
shall also be arrested.

69
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,040
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

70
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:21,750
The Queen cannot be considered to be innocent in this matter...

71
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,990
which is why she will be confined to the Queen's Palace.

72
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,029
Royal Physician Choi Sang Rok, step forward.

73
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,540
Physician Kim Dal Saeng of the Royal Infirmary...

74
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,469
fabricated the autopsy report of my royal taster...

75
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,740
and framed the Crown Prince. Is this correct?

76
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

77
00:06:48,209 --> 00:06:49,609
The poison taken...

78
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,050
by Physician Kim Dal Saeng and the Queen's royal taster...

79
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:53,849
seems to have come from the Royal Infirmary.

80
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,790
- Do you also admit to that? - Yes,

81
00:06:57,189 --> 00:06:58,359
Your Majesty.

82
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,088
The Royal Infirmary is involved...

83
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:01,959
with every transgression that occurred within the palace.

84
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:03,490
Choi Sang Rok...

85
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:06,699
will be stripped of his position and privileges as a punishment...

86
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:09,329
and will be confined to his residence.

87
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,338
I am humbled...

88
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:13,568
(Saktalgwanjik: Being stripped of privileges)

89
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:15,810
by your boundless generosity,

90
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,279
Your Majesty.

91
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,930
Censor and Deputy Education Director, step forward.

92
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:48,268
You remained loyal to your King...

93
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:50,470
and aided the Crown Prince until the very end.

94
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,279
Censor Kim Dae Seung will be promoted to Chief Censor,

95
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,008
and Deputy Education Director Lee Guk Ju...

96
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:56,379
will be promoted to Chief Scholar.

97
00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,279
- We are humbled by your generosity. - We are humbled by your generosity.

98
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,790
Step forward if your name is called.

99
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,860
Kim Sung Hyun as Left State Councilor.

100
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,860
Jung Ho Young as Inspector General.

101
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:08,588

102
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:10,258
Seo Jae Woo as Training General.

103
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,698
And Park Gui Duk as Chief Royal Secretary.

104
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,959
I hereby appoint you as your King.

105
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,470
- We are humbled by your generosity. - We are humbled by your generosity.

106
00:08:17,769 --> 00:08:19,398
I order investigations into the deaths...

107
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,438
of the late Chief Royal Secretary,

108
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:22,969
Physician Heo Jin Soo, and Physician Kim Dal Saeng...

109
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,209
which I expect to be conducted with your utmost effort.

110
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,809
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

111
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:30,279
Once the truth behind their deaths is revealed,

112
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:32,019
Royal Physician Choi Sang Rok,

113
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,190
Left State Councilor Yoon Yi Kyum,

114
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,049
and Magistrate Yoon Jung Dae will be interrogated.

115
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,919
Make sure you are prepared.

116
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,519
I will...

117
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:43,089
personally interrogate them.

118
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,360
(Chinguk: An interrogation conducted by the king)

119
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,799
Your Majesty,

120
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:51,899
Inspector General Choi has been stripped of his title...

121
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,240
and confined to his residence.

122
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,909
Your Majesty, are you all right?

123
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,359
Your Highness, Left State Councilor Yoon...

124
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,200
is being held at the Department of Justice.

125
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,509
Your Highness, why will you not say anything?

126
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:29,070
If you remain silent,

127
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,340
it might not end with you being confined to your palace.

128
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:36,080
The incident regarding the royal taster will resurface.

129
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:37,879
You must have a plan...

130
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,549
for when the truth comes to light.

131
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,190
My queen.

132
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,570
Your Majesty!

133
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:04,179
There is no need to be shocked.

134
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:07,509
My queen.

135
00:10:11,419 --> 00:10:13,379
I missed you, my queen.

136
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,549
Your Majesty,

137
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,659
please do not say this is a dream.

138
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:32,799
Enough.

139
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,370
You are naturally low on energy...

140
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,240
and will faint at this rate.

141
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,080
The joy is immeasurable.

142
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:45,850
My queen,

143
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,549
do you trust me?

144
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:53,289
Yes, I do.

145
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,529
The sky may crumble,

146
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:58,159
but my faith in you will never falter.

147
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,659
If you trust me,

148
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:03,299
do not falter and remain patient...

149
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,169
no matter what happens next.

150
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,439
Can you do that?

151
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,639
Yes, Your Majesty.

152
00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:12,080
I will wait.

153
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,710
I...

154
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,179
will always wait for you...

155
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,120
until the day I die.

156
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,669
Your Highness.

157
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:40,070
Please get a hold of yourself, Your Highness.

158
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,110
Why are you making a fuss?

159
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,579
Did you forget...

160
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,980
that we were ordered by His Majesty to behave ourselves?

161
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:47,139
Your Highness...

162
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,009
You are dismissed.

163
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,829
I know it has been hard for you.

164
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:03,960
Please do not say that.

165
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,899
Instead, please forgive your foolish son...

166
00:12:07,669 --> 00:12:09,569
for not being able to protect you.

167
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:13,100
Now that everything is back to how it should be,

168
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:16,570
you should return to your position...

169
00:12:16,909 --> 00:12:20,539
and assist your brother well like you have been doing.

170
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,679
Yes, Father.

171
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:31,960
Do you have anything to say?

172
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:36,690
Are you upset about the fact you would have been installed...

173
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,700
as Crown Prince tomorrow?

174
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,528
No, Father. I would never.

175
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:42,899
Then why do you seem glum...

176
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,138
on a joyful day like today?

177
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:48,570
I am not worthy of the Crown Prince title...

178
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,610
nor am I confident enough to bear the weight of it.

179
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,649
The life of a normal prince does not bother me at all.

180
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,710
I do not care about what happens to me, but...

181
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,820
What is it that you wish to say?

182
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,350
Lady Myung Yoon...

183
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:06,119
What happens to her is none of your concern.

184
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,959
But Father, Lady Myung Yoon...

185
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,360
Her father is guilty of high treason.

186
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:12,158
How dare you mention her in front of me?

187
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:13,230
I apologize,

188
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,229
but maybe you could consider the good deeds she has performed...

189
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,769
and be generous enough to...

190
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:19,399
Enough!

191
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,870
I already said...

192
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:24,279
that whether she lived or died was none of your concern.

193
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,980
Do not mention her to me ever again.

194
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,750
Dismiss yourself...

195
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,990
and prepare to leave for your private residence.

196
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,059
Of course.

197
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:04,619
I will inform the Royal Infirmary to send over a physician.

198
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,648
No.

199
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:08,120
Have you forgotten that it answers to Choi Sang Rok?

200
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,519
Bring me her instead.

201
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:13,959
Are you talking about Lady Myung Yoon?

202
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,690
No one knows of my condition better than she does.

203
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:18,799
Of course.

204
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,668
I will bring her in as soon as possible.

205
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:24,600
The Queen Dowager's people may still reside in the palace,

206
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,500
so be discreet.

207
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,269
Your Majesty.

208
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,740
Court ladies and eunuchs of the King's Palace...

209
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,610
have been gathered.

210
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,149
Head out first.

211
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,679
Yes, Father.

212
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,740
How did the two end up falling for the same woman?

213
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:00,070
And to make it worse, she is...

214
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:52,620
Have every one of them...

215
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,059
kicked out of the palace.

216
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:56,389
Yes, Your Majesty.

217
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,059
Drag them out of here!

218
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,200
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

219
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:02,970
Off you go.

220
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,440
Where is the Royal Chef?

221
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,750
Crown Prince,

222
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:26,059
thoroughly investigate everyone involved in the incident,

223
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:29,090
and have the Royal Chef be punished by decapitation.

224
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,299
Yes, Your Majesty.

225
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:44,779
Make way for His Majesty!

226
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,259
Have you been well?

227
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,170
For some reason,

228
00:17:11,029 --> 00:17:12,869
you seem more pallid than I.

229
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,108
Could you have developed a terrible illness?

230
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:20,078
If you have something to say, just say it.

231
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,779
I believe I have been respectful enough,

232
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,920
so allow me to speak.

233
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,920
Give up on Inspector General Choi,

234
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,490
and I will let the Queen Dowager Palace be intact.

235
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,129
His transgressions are better known to you...

236
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,130
than probably anyone else.

237
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,429
You will do as I say.

238
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:43,929
Your Majesty, I am this country's...

239
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:48,239
Yes, you are the Queen Dowager, the nation's elder.

240
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,469
And I am the one...

241
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:51,210
You sat me on the throne,

242
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:54,579
and then showed me you could also drag me off it.

243
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,750
Do you know what went through my mind...

244
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:01,049
while I remained incapacitated?

245
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:05,190
That I would return the same amount...

246
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,559
of torment and misery.

247
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,490
I pledged...

248
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:11,859
and pledged.

249
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:16,200
Is the royal transmitter outside?

250
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,169
Yes, Your Majesty.

251
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:21,969
(Seungjeongsaek: An eunuch who relayed the king's message)

252
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,669
Is the Head Court Lady outside?

253
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,140
Yes, Your Majesty.

254
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:29,150
And the royal taster as well as the Royal Chef?

255
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,109
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

256
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,160
As of today, these people will manage your affairs.

257
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,829
You are to inform me...

258
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:45,160
of her every move. Do you understand?

259
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,799
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

260
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,700
You are all dismissed.

261
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,710
Make your choice.

262
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,849
Would you rather be confined to the garden...

263
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,319
or...

264
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:08,750
maintain your title even though it will be meaningless?

265
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,359
But despite the choice you make,

266
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:15,129
know that you will only do as told...

267
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,430
from this moment on.

268
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:21,229
Must you go this far?

269
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,900
I am far from done.

270
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:25,700
The humiliation I felt...

271
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,210
while bedridden as a living corpse.

272
00:19:28,539 --> 00:19:30,809
The tears of blood shed by the Crown Prince.

273
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,609
The suffering Prince Dosung had to endure.

274
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:37,150
The threats made against the queen that rendered her helpless.

275
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:38,879
The cruel acts you performed...

276
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,578
in collusion with Left State Councilor Yoon...

277
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,420
and Magistrate Yoon!

278
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:45,690
I have not even begun to punish you...

279
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,930
for all those heinous crimes.

280
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:50,390
Then,

281
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:54,799
punish me accordingly!

282
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,099
Hold me responsible!

283
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:02,609
Just picturing your face alone...

284
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,170
makes me want to vomit.

285
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,079
So do not provoke me.

286
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,779
Do not even breathe loudly.

287
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,950
You are to lead a quiet life.

288
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:17,619
Do not do anything.

289
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:22,390
If you even lift a finger without my approval,

290
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,759
you will see the blood of the person...

291
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,329
you cherish the most.

292
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:39,039
I almost forgot. As my last act of mercy,

293
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,809
I will let Court Lady Kim continue to serve you.

294
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:18,119
Your Majesty.

295
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,849
Take a step back for a better future.

296
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,720
There will come a day for you to get even.

297
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:27,289
No.

298
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:31,700
He said I reaped what I sowed.

299
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,269
I have committed sins.

300
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,940
To wish to be forgiven after all that...

301
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,209
would mean I am a fool.

302
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,240
Your Majesty.

303
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:48,150
Why would you jump to such a conclusion?

304
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:51,950
No matter how upset and unjust you feel,

305
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,289
do not grow weak.

306
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:59,119
There is nothing that feels unjust or upsetting.

307
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:02,160
I have sinned.

308
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:05,460
It is only right to pay...

309
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,099
for those sins, no?

310
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,029
However,

311
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:18,539
all of it started because of me.

312
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,910
It all built up because of me.

313
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,450
Sang Rok's only sin...

314
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:36,089
was being unable to cut off a pitiful woman.

315
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:41,499
The fact that I cannot take responsibility...

316
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,900
for all the sins alone.

317
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,970
That is what breaks my heart.

318
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:52,509
Your Majesty...

319
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,069
It is I.

320
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,609
Come in.

321
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,819
As you said, Father woke up.

322
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:39,089
You were right, and I was wrong.

323
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:44,029
You came to hear this, yes?

324
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:45,400
Sit down.

325
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,000
I have nothing more to say to you.

326
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,069
Now that Father has woken up,

327
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,539
everything has changed, has it not?

328
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,809
Nothing has changed.

329
00:23:59,539 --> 00:24:01,009
It has returned to its original place.

330
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,619
That is why I am preparing to leave for the private residence.

331
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,049
You still seem crossed.

332
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,960
Let us talk again another time.

333
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,160
Take care on your way.

334
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,329
What will you do about Lady Myung Yoon?

335
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,339
Do you think Choi Sang Rok will stop with just self-confinement?

336
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:35,809
No, he will not.

337
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,220
There are more hidden crimes than exposed ones.

338
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,018
The moment more evidence is found, he will receive graver punishment.

339
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:44,250
You know well.

340
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,190
So should you not worry about Lady Myung Yoon first?

341
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,789
You made Lady Myung Yoon risk her life to treat Father.

342
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,028
And yet, are you abandoning her now?

343
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:56,729
I told you I would protect her at all costs, did I not?

344
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,499
What if Father does not let you?

345
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,039
Why would Father hurt Lady Myung Yoon?

346
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:04,740
That will not happen. Do not worry.

347
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,679
For your sake,

348
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,849
Father even confined Mother.

349
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,220
Do you think such a person...

350
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,549
would let Lady Myung Yoon, Choi Sang Rok's daughter, be?

351
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:18,118
You know so little about Father.

352
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,420
You are the one who knows so little about him.

353
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,329
Dosung.

354
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,089
Your pulse feels better.

355
00:25:58,299 --> 00:26:00,599
However, you need absolute rest.

356
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,529
There are many overdue matters.

357
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,209
I must take care of them, do I not?

358
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,239
Your Majesty knows the best that you do not have...

359
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,838
the energy to do it.

360
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,049
Then, I will make the energy to carry out my task.

361
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,950
Your Majesty. Forgive me for saying this.

362
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,220
However, when we met again at the private residence,

363
00:26:24,589 --> 00:26:28,328
did you not say you would not take that medicine again?

364
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:29,930
Hush.

365
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:33,160
You promised not to bring that up, did you not?

366
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,069
Your Majesty. Such medicine...

367
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,240
will make you energetic for only a while.

368
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,108
It will harm your body in the end.

369
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:43,109
I know.

370
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,279
I will do as you say.

371
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,349
Now leave.

372
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,549
The King has woken up.

373
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:58,890
Now that I am confined in my house,

374
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,890
tell the others to refrain from going outside as well.

375
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:05,630
And have the remaining patients in the clinic leave.

376
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,460
Understood.

377
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,899
Call Myung Yoon over for me.

378
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,068
Lady Myung Yoon went to Madam's grave with Oh Wol.

379
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:14,669
She went to her mother's grave?

380
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,740
Yes. Lady Myung Yoon went to bid her last farewell...

381
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,980
as she did not know...

382
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:21,980
when she could return after the marriage tomorrow.

383
00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:24,879
She did it for nothing.

384
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,880
Does that mean...

385
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,689
the marriage has been called off?

386
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,920
It is only natural.

387
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,359
The King has woken up.

388
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:40,930
Master. You have a letter from the palace.

389
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,829
Have you met with my father?

390
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:18,970
Yes. He needs rest.

391
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:22,140
Thank you.

392
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,410
I owe it to you. So, thank you.

393
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,980
That is not true, Your Royal Highness.

394
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:31,849
Let us head inside.

395
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,890
What is this?

396
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,289
It is a hairpin.

397
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:12,220
I imagined it would suit you.

398
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,529
Where did you get this?

399
00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:21,529
I found it on the ground.

400
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,430
- What? - It is the truth.

401
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,710
I do not know who it is,

402
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,839
but she lost an invaluable belonging.

403
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,210
What do you think this is?

404
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:36,809
Did you not say it was a hairpin?

405
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:40,720
No. I meant what shape these looked like.

406
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:44,789
They look like petals.

407
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,420
You are right. They are apricot petals.

408
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,960
The apricot petals you like.

409
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,000
I see. Apricot petals.

410
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,200
Do you not like it?

411
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,670
No.

412
00:29:59,769 --> 00:30:01,240
It is truly beautiful.

413
00:30:22,089 --> 00:30:23,490
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

414
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,960
I will treasure it.

415
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:27,900
It is like the apricot petals...

416
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,269
have fallen on your head.

417
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,769
Do not cry however happy you are.

418
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:39,410
You are...

419
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,880
the prettiest when you smile.

420
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,930
I...

421
00:30:58,029 --> 00:30:59,930
will forever be...

422
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:02,799
Your Royal Highness's woman...

423
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:06,039
until the day I die, no matter where I am and what I do.

424
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,710
I know what you are thinking.

425
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:15,349
However, worrying about tomorrow that has not come is foolish.

426
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:17,849
Thus,

427
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,220
let us forget about it for a while.

428
00:31:21,349 --> 00:31:22,420
Forget about everything.

429
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,690
Let us only think about this moment.

430
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:27,859
Just looking at you...

431
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:31,690
is enough for me.

432
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,029
It makes me happy.

433
00:31:35,369 --> 00:31:36,430
I hope...

434
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,900
you are the same as me.

435
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:45,380
Your Royal Highness.

436
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,390
Your Royal Highness.

437
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,529
You should get going.

438
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,099
They must be looking for you at His Majesty's palace.

439
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:29,570
Sang Rok.

440
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,840
I saw them on my way here.

441
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,780
While watching them,

442
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,380
I was reminded of the two of us.

443
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,750
The time when looking at each other...

444
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:46,789
made us happy enough.

445
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,059
Whose fault do you think it is that we have ended up in this mess?

446
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:58,170
The late king's disgusting greed? The laws? Our dignity?

447
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:00,699
Yes.

448
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:04,909
It is true that such things pressured us and trampled us down.

449
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,349
However,

450
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,420
I believe it was because...

451
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,150
no one acknowledged our love...

452
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,190
or tried to help us.

453
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,989
I cannot let them...

454
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,800
walk the thorny path that we had to take.

455
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:30,300
I understand how you feel,

456
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,670
but you know there is nothing we can do.

457
00:35:34,739 --> 00:35:35,739
That is not true.

458
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,880
Sang Rok.

459
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,380
Let us...

460
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,320
give up,

461
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:50,519
Sang Rok.

462
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,269
Choi Sang Rok...

463
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:12,840
has entered the palace again?

464
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:14,940
He disobeyed the order not to leave his house,

465
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:17,110
so we will arrest him right away.

466
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,420
No, leave him be.

467
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:26,019
Let him squirm for one last time...

468
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:30,760
so that we can get rid of all the rats that remain in the palace.

469
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:32,159
Yes, Your Majesty.

470
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,730
Anyway, I heard the Crown Prince...

471
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,699
brought the petitions from the Royal Secretariat.

472
00:36:37,969 --> 00:36:39,070
Yes, Your Majesty.

473
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,820
It will take forever to go through them all.

474
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,590
I ought to help lessen Father's workload.

475
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,360
If only you could help me...

476
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,030
Forget it. I should just go through them myself.

477
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:10,530
Hang in there.

478
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:13,038
I am studying hard to learn to read, so...

479
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:15,500
Your Royal Highness, Choi Sang Rok would like to speak with you.

480
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,539
Let him enter.

481
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,059
Your Royal Highness.

482
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,460
I must speak with you about an urgent matter.

483
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:40,159
Wait outside.

484
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,099
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

485
00:37:50,039 --> 00:37:51,070
Gosh.

486
00:37:51,909 --> 00:37:52,909
Darn it.

487
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,909
I have no idea why he is here.

488
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:58,780
It does not matter why he is here. We must kick him out at once.

489
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:03,049
Why would he waste his time dealing with such a scoundrel?

490
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,959
Because he is Lady Myung Yoon's father.

491
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,960
Hey.

492
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,230
If you have something to say, go ahead and say it.

493
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:15,260
I am quite busy.

494
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:20,099
Can you...

495
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:23,969
keep Myung Yoon safe?

496
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,610
Do not tell me...

497
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:30,409
you came here thinking I would answer that question.

498
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,920
What are your true intentions behind bringing up her safety?

499
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,590
I do not have an ulterior motive.

500
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:42,429
I am literally asking you if you think you can...

501
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,288
protect my daughter, Myung Yoon.

502
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:47,099
Even if I decide to have mercy on you and answer that question,

503
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:49,769
I...

504
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,669
think of you as my sworn enemy...

505
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,969
who got my grandfather killed,

506
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:56,710
so how would you believe me?

507
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,069
If I could not trust you...

508
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,138
(Bulgudaecheonjisu: One's sworn enemy)

509
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:00,638
I would not be here now.

510
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:02,309
(Bulgudaecheonjisu: One's sworn enemy)

511
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:05,480
In your eyes, I must look like a disgusting man...

512
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:08,219
who had a secret affair with the Queen Dowager,

513
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:10,949
but I am a father too.

514
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,559
No father wishes his child ill,

515
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:19,760
no matter how incompetent or horrible he is.

516
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:28,869
Please take good care of Myung Yoon.

517
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:12,949
That is strange.

518
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,479
What now?

519
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,889
Well, I am talking about Choi Sang Rok.

520
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,989
They say people change drastically right before they die.

521
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,590
I wonder if he has made up his mind to take his own life.

522
00:40:24,789 --> 00:40:25,929
Otherwise, why would he...

523
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,960
No.

524
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,300
We should be grateful if that scoundrel took his own life.

525
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,030
Stop talking nonsense.

526
00:40:32,369 --> 00:40:34,239
What about the thing I asked you to take care of?

527
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:35,570
Pardon me?

528
00:40:35,969 --> 00:40:39,380
Oh, that. I told Sun Ok to take care of the preparation,

529
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,239
so you can get going now.

530
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,280
Let us go, then.

531
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,670
Well, Oh Wol is with the Prince.

532
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,780
Why is His Highness keeping Oh Wol?

533
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,739
Ask him directly.

534
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:18,480
Please come with me.

535
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,630
Where is Oh Wol?

536
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,469
What are you doing?

537
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:45,369
Open the door, Your Highness.

538
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:50,550
Open the door, Your Highness.

539
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:52,079
Your Highness!

540
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:22,139
I was harsh on you on purpose.

541
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:24,980
I thought...

542
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,050
that was the best thing I could do for Your Highness.

543
00:42:34,389 --> 00:42:36,260
It was not because I disliked you.

544
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:38,960
At first,

545
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:41,599
I was engaged.

546
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:43,969
Then...

547
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:50,309
I fell for the Crown Prince,

548
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:54,110
so I could not reciprocate your feelings.

549
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:57,210
I have already made up my mind,

550
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:01,320
so do not think that you can persuade me.

551
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:03,190
I do not intend to.

552
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:07,690
I simply wish to tell you how I feel...

553
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,129
so that you can see the truth.

554
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,190
It is all pointless.

555
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,800
No matter what you say,

556
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,829
I will leave...

557
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:20,939
the Capital with you tomorrow.

558
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,510
Do you think you can make me yours against my will?

559
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:24,739
It is fine...

560
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:27,610
even if...

561
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,980
you will never be mine.

562
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,050
I am okay with that,

563
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,590
so I will do anything to save you.

564
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:54,400
Your Highness.

565
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,409
Would you choose...

566
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:00,980
to be miserable for the rest of your life...

567
00:44:01,309 --> 00:44:04,849
until the day you die just to survive?

568
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,289
I do not want that.

569
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:14,519
If I had to live like that,

570
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:16,929
I would rather...

571
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,860
take my own life,

572
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:24,230
praying that...

573
00:44:25,469 --> 00:44:29,269
I could be happy even for a fleeting moment in my next life.

574
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:33,380
I will gladly choose that path.

575
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:47,090
I trust that you are no different from me.

576
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,030
You will probably deny it,

577
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:54,099
but I know that you will choose the same path.

578
00:44:58,530 --> 00:44:59,599
I do not wish to see you...

579
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:03,739
become miserable too because of me.

580
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,480
I hope you can stop being obsessed with me...

581
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:13,480
and choose a path that can lead you to happiness.

582
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:17,219
I mean it.

583
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:16,909
My lady.

584
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:45,469
How could you tell me to stop doing something I simply cannot quit?

585
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,210
However,

586
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,510
I will stop if that is what you want.

587
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:57,050
So...

588
00:46:58,690 --> 00:46:59,690
I will stop here.

589
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:03,059
Please be safe and take good care of yourself.

590
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:10,530
Hey.

591
00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:13,000
You did not find her?

592
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:17,138
I checked every place where she could be, but...

593
00:47:17,139 --> 00:47:18,170
My goodness.

594
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:24,849
- My gosh. - Lady Myung Yoon.

595
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,590
What happened? You kept us waiting for a while.

596
00:47:32,889 --> 00:47:35,659
I had to take care of something urgent.

597
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:37,260
What is the matter?

598
00:47:37,261 --> 00:47:38,360
His Royal Highness is asking for you.

599
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,630
- Please come with me. - Where are you taking her?

600
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,868
Oh, we will need you too. Come with us.

601
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:45,729
- What about me? - We must return...

602
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,500
- before Lord Choi is back. - Goodness.

603
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:50,309
Of course, His Royal Highness will take care of it.

604
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,809
He is waiting for you. We should hurry.

605
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:05,349
- Come and get yours! - Help yourself.

606
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,988
- Oh, my. - One moment, please.

607
00:48:07,989 --> 00:48:09,218
Thank you so much for doing this.

608
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,429
- My goodness. - Please give me a moment.

609
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,158
- Please wait in line. - Gosh, all right.

610
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:14,230
My gosh.

611
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:16,698
Gosh, I'm so full.

612
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:19,570
- How nice. - Oh, my.

613
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:21,969
- Thank you for your hard work. - My pleasure.

614
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:24,239
What is all this?

615
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:26,479
We are giving out food and medicinal herbs...

616
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,239
to the people in this poor village.

617
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,179
Please help us.

618
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,409
Okay, sure.

619
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:33,849
- Welcome. - All right, come on.

620
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:35,980
Come on, quick. I have a job for you.

621
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:38,219
All right.

622
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,619
- Come on. - My gosh. Thank you.

623
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:43,360
You must still have a pile of things to take care of.

624
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:45,690
When did you come up with this idea?

625
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,360
It was nothing hard.

626
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,400
I should award you for your contribution.

627
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,300
I wondered what would make you happiest...

628
00:48:54,869 --> 00:48:56,039
and thought of this right away.

629
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,469
Thank you.

630
00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:00,079
If you are truly grateful,

631
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:03,349
please call me "husband" just once.

632
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,030
Husband.

633
00:49:31,539 --> 00:49:32,639
Husband.

634
00:49:35,409 --> 00:49:36,510
Husband.

635
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,320
What did she say to you?

636
00:49:45,519 --> 00:49:46,519
Your Royal Highness?

637
00:49:47,789 --> 00:49:48,889
Your Royal Highness.

638
00:49:55,099 --> 00:49:57,469
So, can we just stand back and watch?

639
00:49:58,429 --> 00:49:59,469
Of course not.

640
00:49:59,969 --> 00:50:01,039
We should do some physical work...

641
00:50:02,039 --> 00:50:03,670
for a change.

642
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,909
Thank you.

643
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,880
How generous of you.

644
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,190
Thank you.

645
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:20,018
- Eat up. - Eat as much as you like.

646
00:50:20,019 --> 00:50:21,019
Thank you.

647
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,559
Oh, my. Thank you so much.

648
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:27,698
- Gosh, how much does this cost? - How kind of you.

649
00:50:27,699 --> 00:50:30,069
- My gosh. This is a lot of food. - Take more.

650
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:31,198
I should give you some more.

651
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:32,499
- Oh, my. Thank you. - Thank you so much.

652
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,638
- Thank you. - Thank you very much.

653
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:35,768
- Give me a lot of it. - Can I get some more?

654
00:50:35,769 --> 00:50:37,669
- That looks so good. - My gosh. Thank you.

655
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:39,070
- How long has it been? - Thank you.

656
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:42,639
- Hey, stop. - Goodness.

657
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,250
Oh, boy.

658
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:46,550
Hey, go.

659
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,019
- Where... - This way, please.

660
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:58,289
- You can put it over here. - Here?

661
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:02,659
- What was that? - Okay. No problem.

662
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:08,670
Hey, that...

663
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:11,139
All right.

664
00:51:14,579 --> 00:51:15,639
What are you doing?

665
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:18,510
What?

666
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:24,820
I was not doing anything.

667
00:51:24,949 --> 00:51:27,190
Right. Why are you standing there doing nothing?

668
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:30,289
Push.

669
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,070
Where did His Royal Highness go?

670
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:39,329
How come he is nowhere to be seen?

671
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:41,900
Oh, gosh.

672
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:45,239
Here we go!

673
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:48,210
There.

674
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,380
My gosh.

675
00:52:00,889 --> 00:52:01,889
All right.

676
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:06,129
The elderly lady who lives here suffers from leg pain,

677
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:07,130
so she could not leave the house.

678
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:10,199
How do you know about her leg pain?

679
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,869
I did my research in advance.

680
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,940
You said I had a knack for surprising others.

681
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:17,809
But you beat me.

682
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:26,179
Let us go inside.

683
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:41,300
You are handsome...

684
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:43,599
and kind.

685
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,739
Young Master, I wish you many blessings.

686
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:48,269
Thank you.

687
00:52:48,769 --> 00:52:49,800
- Ma'am. - Yes.

688
00:52:50,469 --> 00:52:52,210
Let me have a look at your leg. It has been a while.

689
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,909
- All right. - Be careful.

690
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:00,579
It is...

691
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:04,190
gone.

692
00:53:05,789 --> 00:53:07,920
It has vanished.

693
00:53:09,789 --> 00:53:12,929
The darned fate of a widow.

694
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,230
It has vanished without a trace.

695
00:53:21,639 --> 00:53:22,940
Do you give face readings?

696
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:26,739
She is famous for it in this village.

697
00:53:27,409 --> 00:53:28,440
I see.

698
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,179
Then may I get a reading too?

699
00:53:31,349 --> 00:53:32,849
You do not need it.

700
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,019
You were born with a destiny others dream of.

701
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:39,119
Is that so?

702
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:45,030
All your bad luck is gone,

703
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,800
and I see that you now have a lover.

704
00:53:49,829 --> 00:53:53,440
You managed to ward off your bad luck,

705
00:53:54,369 --> 00:53:56,269
so only great things await you.

706
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:02,940
Ma'am.

707
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:06,010
- My fate is... - She said it had changed.

708
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:10,420
She would not lie to you.

709
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,760
Right.

710
00:54:15,389 --> 00:54:17,789
Just hearing that lifts my spirits.

711
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:19,630
Thank you, ma'am.

712
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,030
Yes.

713
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:36,440
I left the sack.

714
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:38,309
Just a moment.

715
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,260
My lady.

716
00:54:50,659 --> 00:54:52,329
I looked everywhere for you.

717
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:54,960
Where is His Royal Highness?

718
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,630
This is ginseng.

719
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:03,039
Make tea with it and drink it. It will boost your energy.

720
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:06,440
My goodness. You kindly filled up my rice jar.

721
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:09,880
You do not have to give me such rare ginseng.

722
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:13,579
I am sorry for making you give a fake reading.

723
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:18,949
It was not fake.

724
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,889
- Pardon me? - You practically begged me,

725
00:55:22,889 --> 00:55:27,630
so I was just going to do it even though I was not up for it.

726
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,400
But when I saw her face,

727
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:33,269
I realized...

728
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:36,539
that her fate had actually changed.

729
00:55:37,409 --> 00:55:39,809
I have never experienced something like this before.

730
00:55:43,449 --> 00:55:45,579
Please take care and stay healthy, ma'am.

731
00:55:53,489 --> 00:55:54,489
You are here.

732
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,389
Ma'am.

733
00:55:57,389 --> 00:55:58,530
I would like a reading too.

734
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:05,599
You are lucky that you will marry a nice man.

735
00:56:06,099 --> 00:56:08,070
Your future husband is very strong.

736
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:14,179
He is someone around you, so do not go and bark up the wrong tree.

737
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:19,579
You will have five sons and live a happy life.

738
00:56:20,179 --> 00:56:23,320
Just make sure you do not let him go.

739
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,219
Do not let him go.

740
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:37,929
I will not let you go...

741
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,300
What is it? Do you have to poop?

742
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:45,769
Gosh.

743
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:51,480
Ma'am.

744
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,010
What about me?

745
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:54,449
Where is my better half?

746
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:58,590
Pardon me?

747
00:57:02,889 --> 00:57:03,889
Where?

748
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,099
What are you thinking about?

749
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:13,969
I feel like I received a reward I do not deserve.

750
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,309
I was just wondering how I could repay you for your kindness.

751
00:57:17,539 --> 00:57:18,769
You need not wonder.

752
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:23,510
All you have to do is call me "husband" once more.

753
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:38,289
I have a foul mouth.

754
00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:39,889
Do you want to hear it?

755
00:57:46,530 --> 00:57:50,099
I have never seen you smile so many times in a day.

756
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,809
For me, this is enough.

757
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:32,449
You should hurry up and get ready too.

758
00:58:33,110 --> 00:58:36,519
Leave with Inspector General Choi. I will follow you.

759
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,260
Do you think I will let you deceive me again?

760
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:46,030
If you do not come with me, I will not go anywhere.

761
00:58:47,659 --> 00:58:48,699
Your Majesty.

762
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:52,599
Come with me.

763
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:55,369
I cannot do anything without you.

764
00:58:56,539 --> 00:58:57,769
I am much obliged.

765
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:01,139
Hurry up and get ready. Sang Rok must be waiting.

766
00:59:17,329 --> 00:59:18,360
Sang Rok.

767
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:22,960
This path...

768
00:59:24,099 --> 00:59:25,869
might lead us all to death.

769
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:28,900
Are you okay with that?

770
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:36,409
I am grateful that I can serve you both.

771
00:59:38,949 --> 00:59:40,079
Then let us leave it to our fate...

772
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:43,019
- and get going. - Okay.

773
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:46,250
This way.

774
00:59:53,429 --> 00:59:56,159
I apologize for putting you in danger too.

775
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:59,369
No, you have done so much for me.

776
00:59:59,969 --> 01:00:01,070
Do not worry.

777
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:02,969
Hurry up and get going.

778
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:06,210
Come on.

779
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:41,110
- Get on my back. - No.

780
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:42,840
I can keep going.

781
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,780
You are slowing us down.

782
01:00:45,409 --> 01:00:46,449
Hurry up and get on my back.

783
01:01:07,099 --> 01:01:08,239
Hang in there.

784
01:01:09,469 --> 01:01:10,469
We are almost there.

785
01:01:10,909 --> 01:01:11,940
Okay.

786
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,800
Do you think we can pass through the fortress gates?

787
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:40,900
I already made the necessary arrangements, so do not worry.

788
01:01:44,309 --> 01:01:45,710
Do you feel queasy?

789
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,880
She hardly ate anything.

790
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:51,250
Let me check your pulse first.

791
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:52,980
I will go and get some water for her.

792
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:07,659
What is it?

793
01:02:08,929 --> 01:02:10,630
Is it something serious?

794
01:02:12,329 --> 01:02:13,429
No, it is not that.

795
01:02:16,369 --> 01:02:17,440
Hold on.

796
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:46,969
Do not tell me...

797
01:02:59,949 --> 01:03:00,980
That is it.

798
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:03,679
You are pregnant.

799
01:03:45,159 --> 01:03:46,928
(Missing Crown Prince)

800
01:03:46,929 --> 01:03:49,729
We do not know what they would do if we gave them more time,

801
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:50,929
so please hurry.

802
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:53,400
His pulse is so unstable that I can barely feel it.

803
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:55,368
A coup is the only way...

804
01:03:55,369 --> 01:03:57,340
you ministers and I can survive.

805
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:59,940
This may be our last chance to uproot the problem,

806
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:02,280
so we must not make a single mistake.

807
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:06,679
The Crown Prince, Gun, is qualified to ascend the throne,

808
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:09,320
so I officially announce his accession to the throne.

809
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:12,750
- Allow us to greet Your Majesty. - Allow us to greet Your Majesty.
