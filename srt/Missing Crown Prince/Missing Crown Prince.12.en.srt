(in this drama are historically irrelevant and fictitious.)

(Production guidelines were strictly followed...)

11
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:48,890
(when filming with children and animals.)

12
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:52,689
(Episode 12)

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,269
Why... How is it that...

14
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,909
Why are you here alone?

15
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:12,979
Where is the Queen Dowager?

16
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,250
I just escorted her...

17
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,608
to the Queen Dowager's quarters.

18
00:01:16,609 --> 00:01:17,980
The Queen Dowager's quarters?

19
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,189
I told you...

20
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:22,750
to escort her away even if I did not make it.

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,459
She was adamant...

22
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:26,760
about not leaving without you.

23
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:14,909
Such insolence!

24
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,110
I am still the Queen Dowager of this country.

25
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:21,680
Show your respect.

26
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,960
You should have left with the Queen Dowager.

27
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,159
Myung Yoon...

28
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,259
I could not find her.

29
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,770
But she was not in any imminent danger.

30
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:44,439
I was still at the palace, so you should have trusted me...

31
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,169
and left with the Queen Dowager.

32
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,909
I apologize.

33
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,780
I understand how you could not leave your daughter behind,

34
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,318
but to think that Her Majesty...

35
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,020
walked back into a deadly situation...

36
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:08,830
I am sorry.

37
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:14,699
Her Majesty...

38
00:03:16,669 --> 00:03:20,199
wishes to at least spend one night with you tonight.

39
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,340
Let us head to her quarters.

40
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,680
Not right now.

41
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,750
I have someplace to be.

42
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,180
Are you saying there is another way?

43
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:36,089
Up until a while ago, I did not expect...

44
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,389
that I would be willing to go this far.

45
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,389
But if my plan works,

46
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,060
Soo Ryeon will keep her life.

47
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:50,939
So please ask her to take care of Myung Yoon.

48
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,009
What do you mean she is not here?

49
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,180
While I was off at the lavatory,

50
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,819
she left.

51
00:04:12,889 --> 00:04:16,029
Could your master have sneaked her out of here?

52
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,258
That may be it.

53
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,828
Such insolence. You are to speak the truth.

54
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:24,639
That seems like the case.

55
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:27,740
If you allow my daughter...

56
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:30,909
to safely make it out of the palace...

57
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,980
In exchange,

58
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,449
will you give me the antidote?

59
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,818
Once Myung Yoon is safely on the other side of these walls,

60
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:41,220
then yes. I will hand it over.

61
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,670
The situation at the palace is unstable.

62
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:02,610
You will stay hidden until the matter is resolved.

63
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,110
- Your Royal Highness... - Right now,

64
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,579
my head is about to explode from everything I must consider.

65
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:12,680
I ask that you at least ease my mind.

66
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:15,649
Your Royal Highness.

67
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:17,490
Enter.

68
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,069
Change into this first.

69
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:49,889
What is going through your head?

70
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,688
She is the daughter of Choi Sang Rok.

71
00:05:52,689 --> 00:05:53,689
For now,

72
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:56,029
I will keep her hidden.

73
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:59,759
Tomorrow, I will find a way to let her escape the palace.

74
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:05,100
Tell Sang Soo to prepare a set of bedding.

75
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,709
Of course.

76
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,689
Their fates have gone awry.

77
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:34,869
If the Crown Prince lives, your daughter will die.

78
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,740
And if your daughter lives, the Crown Prince will die.

79
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,899
Inspector General Choi, what brings you by?

80
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,709
Let us leave.

81
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:19,379
We will talk outside.

82
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:37,759
Killing me...

83
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,229
will not bury your transgressions.

84
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,430
I do not care.

85
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,370
The crimes will all fall on me.

86
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,740
I will not ask for forgiveness.

87
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,879
Father.

88
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,089
Lady Choi.

89
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,149
Cut me instead.

90
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,319
Father,

91
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,360
kill me instead.

92
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,430
Lady Choi.

93
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,539
- Step aside. - Move aside.

94
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,839
Kill me first.

95
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,610
Until you kill me,

96
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:29,149
you will not be able to harm His Royal Highness.

97
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,389
Killing me will not change anything.

98
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:44,200
Even if I die,

99
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,029
Dosung will never forgive you people.

100
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,429
With you gone,

101
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,840
Prince Dosung will be King whether he likes it or not.

102
00:08:53,169 --> 00:08:54,370
That means...

103
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:56,970
Myung Yoon will be safe.

104
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:05,080
Your Royal Highness, it is Gap Seok.

105
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,360
Your Royal Highness.

106
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,309
Your Royal Highness?

107
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,870
You may enter.

108
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:08,110
If you have nothing more to say, dismiss yourself.

109
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:33,970
What happened?

110
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:36,240
It was nothing.

111
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,610
Did you request for an extra set of bedding?

112
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,110
Yes.

113
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:43,779
I told Sang Soo, so he will soon bring it.

114
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,590
Wait...

115
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,220
a few moments.

116
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,860
Killing me will not bury your transgressions.

117
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:35,570
With you gone,

118
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,970
Prince Dosung will be King whether he likes it or not.

119
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,669
That means...

120
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,370
Myung Yoon will be safe.

121
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:08,669
His Royal Highness almost died...

122
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,470
while trying to save Lady Myung Yoon,

123
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,609
but he still stayed up all night nursing her back to health.

124
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,309
But back then, he thought you were my daughter.

125
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,409
Exactly. That had me puzzled as well.

126
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:26,049
Why would he care about what happens to a female servant?

127
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,789
Still, he always seemed to look out for her.

128
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,789
She was not his hostage.

129
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,659
He also harbours feelings for Myung Yoon.

130
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,159
So...

131
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:41,529
By the way, where is Lady Myung Yoon?

132
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:45,470
Tell Moo Baek that I urgently need to see him.

133
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,779
Gosh.

134
00:12:56,179 --> 00:12:57,210
Moo Baek.

135
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:02,990
Lord Choi needs to see you urgently.

136
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:07,190
The palace is so spacious...

137
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:11,100
that I had a rough time locating you.

138
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,169
Are you not worried about Lady Myung Yoon?

139
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:17,570
Her whereabouts are unknown.

140
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,139
What?

141
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,669
I heard she was at the Crown Prince's Palace.

142
00:13:27,409 --> 00:13:28,509
The Crown Prince's Palace?

143
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,149
Please let me return to Yanghwadang.

144
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:35,418
If I am the reason you are attacked again...

145
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:36,590
Your father...

146
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:39,320
did not know you were here,

147
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,258
so what happened earlier...

148
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:43,389
had nothing to do with you being here.

149
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:45,100
It is not just my father.

150
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:48,500
No one should know I am here.

151
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,470
That is why you are keeping me hidden.

152
00:13:55,409 --> 00:13:57,309
I am the daughter of a traitor.

153
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,950
I am not worth you risking your own life to save,

154
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,908
so please let me leave.

155
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:06,019
I meant what I said...

156
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:09,350
when I wished you to be unscathed.

157
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,690
If making me waver and suffer is not your intention,

158
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,830
you will put this to rest.

159
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,500
How could I dare to... Gosh, no.

160
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,398
I am worried that I will do you even more harm,

161
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,700
which is why I request this out of fear,

162
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,669
so please consider my request.

163
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:30,740
The worst...

164
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,808
happening to you outside these walls...

165
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:35,379
is something I cannot handle.

166
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:42,019
That is why I ask for your understanding.

167
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,500
Clear your mind tonight and get some rest.

168
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,539
Gun, it is I.

169
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:08,779
Your Royal Highness. Please keep it from Prince Dosung.

170
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,149
Brother, it is Dosung.

171
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:24,529
Come in.

172
00:15:32,039 --> 00:15:33,299
I hope you did not forget.

173
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:37,539
It has been so long since we enjoyed drinks together.

174
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:39,809
Right.

175
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,309
Our time at the kisaeng house was our last.

176
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,779
Yes, and that was ages ago.

177
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:50,190
I have informed the Royal Kitchen, so they will soon bring our drinks.

178
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,230
People will constantly knock on these doors,

179
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:57,029
so let us drink in your room.

180
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,700
Sure, let us do that.

181
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,360
This is the royal taster sent by Master Moonhyung.

182
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:29,389
Due to her origin,

183
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,429
she has vast knowledge regarding poison.

184
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,870
I, Court Lady Oh,

185
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,268
will answer to Master Moonhyung's order...

186
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:40,740
We hear you, so taste the food already.

187
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:38,299
What is that?

188
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,000
It is a seosaengwon.

189
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,099
- As in a rat? - Yes.

190
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,410
Get that away from me!

191
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,319
There is no need to be alarmed. You may raise your head.

192
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:02,519
While playing around as children,

193
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,959
a rat went into his pants.

194
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,359
That is why he fears them.

195
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:09,390
I blame you for that.

196
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,259
Are you feeding food to the rat...

197
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,329
to detect toxins that can build up in the body?

198
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,269
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

199
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,700
Because of how small it is,

200
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,108
toxins will be detected...

201
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:23,710
even with the smallest amount of food.

202
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,480
I get it, so hurry along.

203
00:18:26,779 --> 00:18:29,910
At this rate, it will be daybreak before we get to smell the alcohol.

204
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:33,519
My brother must long to drink, so hurry things along.

205
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,829
- She must die. - Father!

206
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:44,029
For you and Prince Dosung to live,

207
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,230
the royal taster must die.

208
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:48,399
If she talks,

209
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,369
both you and Prince Dosung will die.

210
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,539
No one will be able to protect you.

211
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,279
His Royal Highness will.

212
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,709
I trust him.

213
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,980
Not a chance.

214
00:19:02,609 --> 00:19:05,279
How can the Crown Prince protect you...

215
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:07,990
when Jang Hyun Mok is among the officials?

216
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:11,049
I am well aware of Master Moonhyung's character.

217
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:12,920
He...

218
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,789
will remain impartial and uncover the truth.

219
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,099
You are too naive.

220
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,299
Jang Hyun Mok and I are not so different.

221
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:26,269
Just like I will do everything for my blood that is Prince Dosung,

222
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,268
Jang Hyun Mok will consider his grandson's best interest...

223
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,710
and eliminate Prince Dosung...

224
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,710
for the Crown Prince's sake.

225
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,480
Despite what you say,

226
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,990
I do not have any power to keep the royal taster from talking.

227
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,059
The Commander of the Royal Guards may disregard the request of others,

228
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,390
but he will answer to you.

229
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,960
So persuade the commander...

230
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:56,029
and clear a path to the prison cell.

231
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,039
How can you ask your own child to help you kill someone?

232
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:02,210
- I cannot do it. - Clear a path for me,

233
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,808
and I will take care of the rest.

234
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:07,309
That is enough. I do not wish to hear more of this.

235
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,509
Your Highness,

236
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:14,220
do you truly wish to lose Prince Dosung?

237
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:16,589
I am saying that I trust the Crown Prince.

238
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,119
- Your Highness! - It is late into the night.

239
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:20,559
Please dismiss yourself.

240
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:41,349
You heard everything, yes?

241
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,549
Follow me.

242
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,559
You know better than anyone else...

243
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,200
that the Crown Prince...

244
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:05,239
may fortunately be able to protect...

245
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,440
the Queen and Prince Dosung...

246
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:10,470
while he cannot protect you.

247
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,740
I...

248
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,049
simply followed your order.

249
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,809
You fool.

250
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,819
Do you truly not know you will be...

251
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:23,250
the scapegoat of this matter the moment...

252
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,490
you forget to watch your mouth?

253
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:28,859
For the Crown Prince to keep the Queen...

254
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,190
or Prince Dosung alive,

255
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:34,599
he will certainly need a scapegoat to die in their stead.

256
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,240
You are the best scapegoat he can use.

257
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,269
In short,

258
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,569
you will die in the end...

259
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,508
no matter what you say.

260
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:48,549
What?

261
00:21:55,819 --> 00:21:56,890
My lord.

262
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,459
What are you doing,

263
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,929
still in the palace at this late hour?

264
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:04,490
How can I leave the palace with the current situation?

265
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:06,129
Everyone, including Master Moonhyung,

266
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:08,269
is too distressed and about to stay up all night.

267
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:12,069
How did the talk with the Queen go?

268
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:14,969
If the day passes as is,

269
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,740
everything will end. You know that, do you not?

270
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,339
Wait.

271
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:25,849
I have played the final hand.

272
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,349
Here.

273
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:39,230
Are you that happy?

274
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,099
Of course.

275
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:43,430
I thought you got caught.

276
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:47,240
But the moment you came into the main hall,

277
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,269
it felt like a dream of some sort.

278
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,568
Had it not been for me,

279
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:52,109
you would have become the Crown Prince.

280
00:22:52,309 --> 00:22:53,609
Did it not upset you?

281
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,150
No way.

282
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:58,348
I feel very relieved as if all my stress has washed away.

283
00:22:58,349 --> 00:23:00,779
That cannot be true.

284
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,920
Do you have any idea what I did so as not to become...

285
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:06,618
the Crown Prince?

286
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:07,619
Well.

287
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,190
You even did the sword dance, right?

288
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,460
You cannot even dance with your shoulders.

289
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,869
Seeing you dance up and down must have been great entertainment.

290
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:19,700
It is such a bummer I could not see that rare sight.

291
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
Right now...

292
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,979
Shall I dance it for you?

293
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,079
Will you really do it?

294
00:23:27,509 --> 00:23:29,250
- Go ahead. - All right.

295
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,480
Watch carefully.

296
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,319
You are about to watch Joseon's best sword dance.

297
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:43,930
Here it comes.

298
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,028
Here it comes.

299
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:49,130
It is almost here.

300
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:51,769
Here it comes.

301
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,298
Forget it.

302
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,608
It is making the drinks go bad.

303
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:58,240
No, watch me a little longer.

304
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:01,980
Relax your wrists more.

305
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:04,180
My wrists? Right.

306
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,150
Like this.

307
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,890
Your wrists are too stiff.

308
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,859
If the royal taster speaks,

309
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,529
Prince Dosung will not be safe, either.

310
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,798
For Prince Dosung's sake,

311
00:24:23,799 --> 00:24:26,598
we must stop Court Lady Yoon from speaking, Your Highness.

312
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,710
Father left after mentioning the same thing for an hour.

313
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,339
Leave.

314
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:32,539
Your Highness.

315
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:35,980
Why was Prince Gwangchang shot to death?

316
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,180
I heard the King back then was against it until the very end.

317
00:24:41,019 --> 00:24:42,890
However, Prince Gwangchang died coughing up blood...

318
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:44,890
at that young age.

319
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,359
Your Highness. You must recall that Prince Gwangchang...

320
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:52,430
was innocent just like Prince Dosung.

321
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,798
Similar to how those wanting to drive out the Queen Dowager...

322
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,068
killed Prince Gwangchang,

323
00:24:56,069 --> 00:24:57,899
- Prince Dosung will also... - Enough!

324
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,640
Your Highness. If the royal taster speaks,

325
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:03,039
Prince Dosung will surely die.

326
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:05,210
Only when Prince Dosung dies...

327
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,338
will the deposed Crown Prince be reinstated...

328
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:09,279
and succeed to the throne.

329
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:11,819
Do you truly wish to die?

330
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:14,049
I told you I have had enough!

331
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,819
If I can protect Your Highness and Prince Dosung,

332
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:23,359
I do not mind dying over and over again.

333
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,799
Please consider it.

334
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:32,170
Leave. I beg you.

335
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,950
Can we really do this?

336
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:43,750
Of course not.

337
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,480
But what can we do?

338
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:55,059
Those brothers have the closest relationship in Joseon.

339
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:58,329
Oh, it is about Lady Myung Yoon.

340
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:00,960
Her father must have sneaked her away already.

341
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,430
Right. Is that so?

342
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,000
Yes.

343
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:08,410
So there is no need to worry about her.

344
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,309
He successfully took her away from that forbidding Yanghwadang.

345
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,950
She will somehow sneak out of the palace.

346
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:20,549
- What a relief. - Yes.

347
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,789
Your Royal Highness. Please keep it from Prince Dosung.

348
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,930
Pour me another glass.

349
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,940
Oh, right. Sure.

350
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:50,109
You can hold your drinks now.

351
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,019
That is for me to say.

352
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,389
Were you drinking all day and night somewhere?

353
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,890
I always had a strong head.

354
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,788
- I simply did not drink. - You could not drink.

355
00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:03,130
- No, I did not drink. - Right, you did not.

356
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:07,230
I shall not beat you in anything you say tonight.

357
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,700
You shall not beat me?

358
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:10,099
Good.

359
00:27:10,329 --> 00:27:12,900
Then I shall beat you.

360
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,140
With that skill of yours?

361
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:18,170
Give it a shot.

362
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,750
You little...

363
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,710
Here I go.

364
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:29,150
You really...

365
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:31,618
- Barley. - "Barley?"

366
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:33,759
Barley. Rice.

367
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,689
Barley. Rice.

368
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:37,259
I caught it. I caught your hand!

369
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:39,460
It is my turn now.

370
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,259
- Come here. - Wait.

371
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,440
- Here I go. - Calm down.

372
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,768
Calm what down?

373
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:50,170
Give me your hands.

374
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,910
I seem drunk.

375
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,710
I cannot hold my liquor.

376
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,380
Barley is best when you are drunk, Brother.

377
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,420
Here is my barley.

378
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,720
No.

379
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:04,549
Barley.

380
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,759
Rice.

381
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,930
Excuse me for a minute.

382
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:30,079
We will set up the bedding if you step outside for a while.

383
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:58,339
How can you not hide your displeasure before her?

384
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,240
Just do your work.

385
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,150
Make sure not a soul comes in here.

386
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,579
Especially,

387
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,849
Choi Sang Rok's household members.

388
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,190
The guard-like man and the female servant...

389
00:29:12,259 --> 00:29:13,390
Darn it.

390
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,829
How dare a slave act like a lady?

391
00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:18,660
And to treat me lower than herself?

392
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,799
Really.

393
00:29:23,069 --> 00:29:24,599
Wait until I catch a glimpse of her.

394
00:29:25,670 --> 00:29:27,799
I will kill her at that young age.

395
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,710
Lower your voice. She might hear you.

396
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,440
What? I did not say anything inappropriate.

397
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:38,680
Either way, His Royal Highness will be given a hard time...

398
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,990
the day she is found hiding in here.

399
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:44,490
Make sure everyone stays away from the Crown Prince's Palace.

400
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:47,190
- Understood? - Yes.

401
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,730
All sins...

402
00:29:57,569 --> 00:29:59,700
are my responsibility to take.

403
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,640
So as for Her Majesty the Queen Dowager...

404
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,559
Once it is confirmed that the Queen Dowager is safe,

405
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:25,299
the antidote will be delivered to Your Royal Highness.

406
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:43,450
- It is I, Moo Baek. - You may enter.

407
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:11,670
Deliver this to the Crown Prince as soon as the sun comes up.

408
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:17,910
Then leave the palace with Oh Wol right away.

409
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:19,220
Pardon me?

410
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,950
- What about Lady Myung Yoon? - Wait outside the palace.

411
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,889
As soon as Myung Yoon gets out of the palace safely,

412
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,319
leave far away with her.

413
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,430
Once you find a place where you two can settle down,

414
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,000
you can use this to start something.

415
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:41,569
You will be able to afford it even after getting a house.

416
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,970
But what if Lady Myung Yoon cannot sneak out? Then what do I do?

417
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,409
She cannot sneak out of the palace on her own.

418
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,849
- I must... - Just deliver the letter.

419
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,440
I failed to protect you until the end.

420
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,579
Please forgive me.

421
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,650
No.

422
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,519
Without your help,

423
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,089
Soo Ryeon and I...

424
00:33:03,549 --> 00:33:05,420
would not have been able to come this far.

425
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,660
Thank you.

426
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I...

427
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,170
will be sure to return the favour...

428
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,799
in my next life.

429
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,640
It was an honour...

430
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:28,140
to have been able to serve you,

431
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:32,920
Young Master.

432
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:49,159
I wish...

433
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:55,530
to spend at least one night with you as your wife before I die.

434
00:34:57,969 --> 00:34:59,539
Please let me, Sang Rok.

435
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:36,809
Soo Ryeon.

436
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,079
Please...

437
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,380
call me your wife, just once.

438
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,389
My dear wife.

439
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:50,789
Yes.

440
00:35:51,949 --> 00:35:52,960
My dear husband.

441
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:00,730
Now, I can die without regrets.

442
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,500
In our next lifetime,

443
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,839
let us born as commoners...

444
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,009
(Pilbupilbu: An ordinary man and woman)

445
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,440
and live happily ever after.

446
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:14,079
Yes,

447
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
my dear husband.

448
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:25,518
I remember the day...

449
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:29,530
when I met you again ten years after becoming a royal physician.

450
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,099
Just like today, it was the saddest...

451
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,030
and happiest day of my life.

452
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,400
That day,

453
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,699
we lost Prince Gwangchang.

454
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:00,559
Soo Ryeon!

455
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:05,360
No! You cannot do this.

456
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,860
Soo Ryeon!

457
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,630
Court Lady Kim!

458
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,300
Court Lady Kim!

459
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,880
Please stay alive.

460
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:31,989
I will never...

461
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,789
I will never let you go again.

462
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,360
I promise.

463
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,860
No matter what happens,

464
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,769
I will be sure to leave the palace with you one day...

465
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,500
and spend the rest of my life with you,

466
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,039
so please...

467
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:51,369
just stay alive...

468
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:53,909
until then,

469
00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:56,210
Soo Ryeon.

470
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,550
And to keep my promise,

471
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,949
I put up with everything and held out for 20 years.

472
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:08,460
Had I known we would end up like this,

473
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,860
I would have run away with you long ago.

474
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:15,969
You did not want to endanger me.

475
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,239
I know that you did what you did for my sake.

476
00:38:19,739 --> 00:38:20,768
Soo Ryeon.

477
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:22,710
You need not say more.

478
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:25,469
I...

479
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:30,349
have been holding out, thinking of this moment...

480
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,619
when I could finally become your wife.

481
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:36,920
The moment we have been desperately waiting for...

482
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,460
Our first night together...

483
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:44,630
will now be our last night together.

484
00:38:47,329 --> 00:38:48,329
I am sorry.

485
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:51,199
It does not matter.

486
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,809
One night is enough.

487
00:38:58,769 --> 00:38:59,940
I mean it.

488
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:45,780
Your Highness.

489
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,150
If the royal taster speaks,

490
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:50,449
Prince Dosung will surely die.

491
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,590
Prince!

492
00:40:51,591 --> 00:40:53,488
- Mother! - Gwangchang!

493
00:40:53,489 --> 00:40:55,059
No, my prince!

494
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,388
No!

495
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:59,159
No, Gwangchang...

496
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:01,699
Why was Prince Gwangchang shot to death?

497
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:04,669
Prince Gwangchang died coughing up blood at that young age.

498
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,799
Do you truly wish to lose Prince Dosung?

499
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,139
No...

500
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,109
If she talks...

501
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,468
If the royal taster starts talking...

502
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,609
Both you and Prince Dosung will die.

503
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,279
Prince Dosung will surely die.

504
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,980
Do you truly wish to lose Prince Dosung?

505
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:33,500
Your Highness.

506
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,989
- Choi Sang Rok? - Yes, Your Royal Highness.

507
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,249
He started using it...

508
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,960
when His Majesty was in critical condition.

509
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,488
That was when His Majesty's condition began to improve,

510
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:03,960
so we could not remove it.

511
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,659
I also know that it was my father...

512
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,869
who caused it.

513
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:14,300
I meant what I said when I wished you...

514
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,539
to be unscathed.

515
00:42:26,219 --> 00:42:28,920
Killing me will not change anything.

516
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:30,320
With you gone,

517
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,989
Prince Dosung will be King whether he likes it or not.

518
00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:35,590
That means...

519
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,190
Myung Yoon will be safe.

520
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:36,690
Your Highness.

521
00:43:37,389 --> 00:43:38,650
Where are you going at this late hour?

522
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,019
I cannot fall asleep.

523
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:43,929
I wish to go and see my father.

524
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:45,590
Yes, I will escort Your Highness.

525
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:47,800
No.

526
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:51,030
I will go to the Main Palace.

527
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,769
You go to the prison and make sure there are no problems.

528
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:56,710
Yes, Your Highness.

529
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,880
If you turn a blind eye to it, no one will ever know.

530
00:44:04,409 --> 00:44:06,920
I will make sure it will not affect you negatively.

531
00:44:07,949 --> 00:44:10,119
She tried to poison His Majesty.

532
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:13,260
What will she say during the investigation to slander my prince?

533
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:15,860
I am so anxious that I cannot sleep.

534
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:34,079
The Queen kindly brought it for you out of pity.

535
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,429
Try anything funny, and you will be beheaded at once.

536
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:11,550
I will wait by the entrance.

537
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:13,519
Please let me know if you need me.

538
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,519
Thank you.

539
00:45:25,929 --> 00:45:27,429
Please save me, Your Highness.

540
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,429
I will do anything you say.

541
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,400
Please just spare me, Your Highness.

542
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,039
Please...

543
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,119
Please spare me, Your Highness!

544
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:51,650
You will die anyway.

545
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:54,558
How could you expect to be spared...

546
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,889
after attempting to poison His Majesty?

547
00:45:56,489 --> 00:45:58,429
Rather than dying painfully after being tortured,

548
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:01,929
would it not be better to take your own life?

549
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:04,230
Why should I die?

550
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:09,199
All I did was obey the orders from the Queen Dowager's Palace.

551
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,340
This is unfair!

552
00:46:11,409 --> 00:46:12,469
Shut your mouth!

553
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,039
How dare you say it is unfair?

554
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,780
When I think of what you did,

555
00:46:18,179 --> 00:46:20,650
I cannot appease my anger even if I rip you to shreds right here.

556
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:23,948
If you wish to die in one piece,

557
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:25,250
you must take this dagger now.

558
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:28,159
No, I do not want to.

559
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,690
If I...

560
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:32,789
will die anyway,

561
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:36,369
I wish to at least speak out and fight before I die.

562
00:46:37,969 --> 00:46:39,030
What did you say?

563
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,570
Your Highness, you are afraid I would speak the truth.

564
00:46:42,869 --> 00:46:44,840
That is why you are ordering me to take my own life.

565
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,340
Your Highness, if you fail to save me,

566
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,510
I will tell them that the orders all came from you.

567
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,789
Who would believe you?

568
00:46:59,659 --> 00:47:00,960
Suit yourself.

569
00:47:06,429 --> 00:47:07,429
Then...

570
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,869
instead of you,

571
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,599
I will tell them that Prince Dosung was behind it all.

572
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,639
What do you think will happen, then?

573
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:20,639
Those who support the Crown Prince will come after him.

574
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,510
Then Prince Dosung will not be safe either.

575
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:28,219
No...

576
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,989
If you wish to save Prince Dosung,

577
00:47:33,889 --> 00:47:35,489
you must save me now.

578
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:37,460
Tell the Commander of the Royal Guards...

579
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:40,130
to release me right away.

580
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,400
- No! - Shut your mouth.

581
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:44,469
If Prince Dosung dies,

582
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:47,199
it is all on you.

583
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,340
You are getting him killed.

584
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,139
Do you wish to be a mother who gets her own son killed?

585
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,079
I told you to shut your mouth!

586
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:11,159
Please spare me, Your Highness.

587
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,059
I thought Gun was a lightweight compared to me,

588
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,869
but I learned today that he can easily drink me under the table.

589
00:48:52,599 --> 00:48:53,599
All right.

590
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,639
Your hands are clean now.

591
00:49:09,849 --> 00:49:12,219
My feet look just like this, and so do Gun's.

592
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,420
Like father, like sons.

593
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:18,829
We certainly take after you.

594
00:49:28,769 --> 00:49:30,269
How come your feet are so cold?

595
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:35,210
It is I, Joong Young.

596
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:37,210
You may enter.

597
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:50,590
You need...

598
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,460
to come with me for a moment.

599
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:10,250
Who did this?

600
00:50:51,949 --> 00:50:54,119
I kept it from you for I thought telling you...

601
00:50:54,989 --> 00:50:57,289
would change nothing and only disturb you.

602
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,829
But now that the royal taster ended up like this,

603
00:51:00,659 --> 00:51:02,760
I believe you should know too.

604
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:06,300
You must know that Master Moonhyung and his supporters...

605
00:51:06,969 --> 00:51:09,440
met earlier today to discuss what to do going forward.

606
00:51:10,809 --> 00:51:11,840
Yes.

607
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:13,809
What about it?

608
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,980
Surely, the Left State Councillor should be ousted too.

609
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,579
He dared to slander His Royal Highness.

610
00:51:20,349 --> 00:51:22,079
The problem is the Queen.

611
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,619
It will certainly stir up a debate.

612
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:26,920
Everyone...

613
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,519
is equal before the law.

614
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:32,229
It does not matter if she is the Queen or something else.

615
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:34,400
All those convicted of a wrongdoing or crime deserve punishment.

616
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:37,170
I am sorry to say this,

617
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,599
but even if I keep my lips sealed about it,

618
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:42,969
the fact that the Queen visited the prison is bound to come out.

619
00:51:43,909 --> 00:51:46,780
Then things will get out of control,

620
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:49,579
so you should be prepared for what is coming.

621
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,380
Your Royal Highness.

622
00:51:58,090 --> 00:51:59,150
We have a problem.

623
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:03,429
Lower your voice.

624
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,659
The royal taster...

625
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:10,230
was found murdered.

626
00:52:14,469 --> 00:52:15,599
What should we do?

627
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:18,469
It is not like we can bring her back to life.

628
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:22,210
What should we do now?

629
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:25,409
Bring me my official robe.

630
00:53:27,139 --> 00:53:28,179
Your Highness!

631
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:33,579
Who is it?

632
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:36,219
Who is pushing my mother to the edge?

633
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:38,789
Is it you?

634
00:53:39,619 --> 00:53:40,760
Or is it my grandfather?

635
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:45,789
Right, it must be both of you.

636
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,400
If you do anything that may disturb my mother again,

637
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:54,599
I will kill you with my own hands.

638
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:57,239
Do you understand?

639
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:19,630
Dosung.

640
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,230
I killed her.

641
00:54:30,269 --> 00:54:31,269
Wait outside.

642
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:31,329
You promised me.

643
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:34,000
In our next lifetime,

644
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,639
we will be born as commoners...

645
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,780
and live happily ever after as a couple.

646
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:42,610
Yes.

647
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:45,449
We will do that.

648
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:37,530
Your Majesty!

649
00:56:42,269 --> 00:56:43,269
Your Majesty.

650
00:56:43,769 --> 00:56:45,739
Your Majesty!

651
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:47,880
No, Your Majesty!

652
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,480
Your Majesty, please open your eyes.

653
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:52,079
Your Majesty!

654
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,599
I said I killed the royal taster.

655
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:09,860
Why will you not ask me anything?

656
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,469
Sit down.

657
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:20,340
Because of me, you can no longer clear your name.

658
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:22,879
Now, you can no longer save Father...

659
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,949
or take down the traitors.

660
00:57:25,949 --> 00:57:26,949
So, why...

661
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,380
Why are you not saying anything?

662
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:31,789
Ask me why I did such a thing.

663
00:57:31,989 --> 00:57:34,059
Yell at me and call me insane!

664
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,030
Your selfish brother dragged you into this mess for his own sake.

665
00:57:39,659 --> 00:57:40,659
So, why...

666
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:43,969
Why...

667
00:57:44,329 --> 00:57:46,940
Why are you not saying anything?

668
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,099
Let go.

669
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:53,940
I said, let go.

670
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:56,339
Let go.

671
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,809
Let go of me! Let go...

672
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:01,250
It is okay.

673
00:58:03,219 --> 00:58:04,219
Dosung.

674
00:58:05,889 --> 00:58:06,889
It is all right.

675
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:14,800
It is all right.

676
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:32,809
Gun.

677
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:36,920
Please forgive me, Gun.

678
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,860
Gun...

679
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:00,110
Please forgive me, Gun.

680
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:01,579
That is enough.

681
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:04,609
Forgive me, Gun...

682
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:05,610
Stop.

683
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,550
That is enough.

684
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:19,989
Master Moonhyung is here.

685
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,440
He may enter.

686
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:40,750
Prince Dosung, you are here too.

687
00:59:44,719 --> 00:59:45,949
Go to your chambers.

688
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:48,960
No.

689
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:52,460
Prince Dosung should hear this too.

690
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,030
- The royal taster is... - About the royal taster.

691
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,170
I killed her.

692
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,158
(Missing Crown Prince)

693
01:00:55,159 --> 01:00:57,159
How will you carry the burden of your sins?

694
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,559
I wish you were Baek Gu.

695
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:01,860
Tell the Crown Prince to hand over Myung Yoon.

696
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:03,529
I will take her there.

697
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:05,598
After all, we nearly got married.

698
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:07,400
Lee Gun has been cleared of all charges...

699
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:09,698
and is bestowed with the title of Prince Susung.

700
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:12,710
The trap was set up to get Prince Susung.

701
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:17,409
Prince Susung can no longer tell anyone about us.

702
01:01:17,550 --> 01:01:19,480
Do you plan to spare Prince Susung?

703
01:01:19,610 --> 01:01:21,119
Of course, we must kill him.
