(in this drama are historically irrelevant and fictitious.)

(Production guidelines were strictly followed...)

00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:48,950
(when filming with children and animals.)

00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:54,530
(Episode 9)

13
00:00:57,829 --> 00:00:58,899
Grandfather.

14
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,570
Your Royal Highness.

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,170
"Royal Highness?"

16
00:01:04,299 --> 00:01:05,599
Your Royal Highness the Crown Prince.

17
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:08,739
Grandfather.

18
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:13,109
You have been through so much.

19
00:01:13,849 --> 00:01:15,909
I am glad that you are here.

20
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:17,620
I am glad to see you.

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,219
Please allow me to properly greet you.

22
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:34,370
Please, there is no need.

23
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,409
This is Gap Seok, my bodyguard.

24
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:46,209
Hello.

25
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,510
I am Lee Gap Seok.

26
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:58,890
She is a physician. She accompanied me here because of my wound.

27
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,530
You are hurt?

28
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,629
Thanks to her, it has almost healed up,

29
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:05,530
so you need not be concerned.

30
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:07,769
I am truly relieved.

31
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,240
Thank you for treating him.

32
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:15,469
It is cold. Let us go outside.

33
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,210
Take her to the annex.

34
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,119
And let my son know right away that His Royal Highness is here.

35
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,319
Yes, my lord.

36
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:26,819
Let us go inside.

37
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:05,259
Are you actually that clueless?

38
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:08,029
The moment he lives and speaks of the truth,

39
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,559
your chances of becoming the Crown Princess and...

40
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,830
I will not participate in the bridal selection order.

41
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,039
- You must see a physician at once. - No.

42
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,310
I cannot do that.

43
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:24,310
He does not even know that you were the one who kidnapped him,

44
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,009
so why are you doing this?

45
00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:29,908
Why must you have him killed?

46
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,479
I do not understand.

47
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,580
I never asked...

48
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,590
for your understanding.

49
00:03:34,591 --> 00:03:35,750
The lady you serve is...

50
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,389
So, are you...

51
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,430
Royal Physician Choi's servant?

52
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,629
Answer my question.

53
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,129
Do you work for Royal Physician Choi's family?

54
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,639
I see. That was what happened.

55
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,979
I thought something must have happened.

56
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:07,689
Those traitors set you up, Your Royal Highness.

57
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,989
I put you...

58
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:12,559
and Uncle in jeopardy. For that, I apologize.

59
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,729
Why would you say that?

60
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,800
Please do not say that again.

61
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,000
He is right, Your Royal Highness.

62
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,769
No matter what happens,

63
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,600
Father and I will keep you safe.

64
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,740
No, that is okay.

65
00:04:26,769 --> 00:04:28,910
Grandfather, I do need your help,

66
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,910
but I do not plan to stay here for a long time.

67
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:35,480
The messengers must have arrived in Mungyeong by now.

68
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,050
The moment they find out that I am here,

69
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,589
they will come here at once to arrest me.

70
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,050
About you staying in Mungyeong, do not worry.

71
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,290
I will take care of it.

72
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,329
Traitor Lee Gun, come out at once. You are to be tied up!

73
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,670
We know that Lee Gun, the traitor, is hiding somewhere in this house.

74
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,269
Hand him over now,

75
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,870
or the whole family will be punished for treason.

76
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:04,910
Why must we wait?

77
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,350
Let us barge in at once.

78
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,110
Why cause bloodshed?

79
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,079
He is completely surrounded, so he will show himself.

80
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,089
Let us wait a little while. If he does not come out,

81
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:17,620
then we will barge in like you said.

82
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,268
Lee Gun is guilty of high treason. Tie him up!

83
00:05:29,269 --> 00:05:30,769
Watch your mouth!

84
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:32,899
How dare you accuse him of high treason?

85
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,410
My lord.

86
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,110
It is an edict from Her Majesty the Queen Dowager.

87
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:42,209
You need not read it.

88
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,980
Please hand it over.

89
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,018
What are you doing?

90
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:53,729
How dare you toss a royal edict...

91
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,889
This edict...

92
00:05:56,129 --> 00:05:57,230
is fake.

93
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,000
- Gap Seok. - Yes, Your Royal Highness.

94
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,879
Do you know what this is?

95
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,220
His Majesty ordered me to hold on to this,

96
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,819
the royal seal.

97
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,189
His Majesty's seal is here.

98
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,229
Who dared to forge a royal order?

99
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,099
Those traitors had the audacity to force the royal seal...

100
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,139
to issue a fake edict.

101
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,600
Arrest them at once.

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,069
Yes, my lord.

103
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,339
Arrest the traitors at once!

104
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,509
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

105
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,560
Mother sent these.

106
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:06,730
She said you would find some jewelry pieces and clothes in it.

107
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:26,350
Your Royal Highness, you should see this.

108
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,509
It is the royal seal, is it not?

109
00:07:51,579 --> 00:07:52,610
All I do...

110
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,250
is cause her concern.

111
00:07:58,319 --> 00:07:59,620
I am a terrible son.

112
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,420
Because of the royal seal,

113
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,189
Mother would get in trouble.

114
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,589
How could I...

115
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,329
repay her for this?

116
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:21,540
His Majesty must have known...

117
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,439
that this would happen.

118
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:25,180
Yes.

119
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:29,410
He predicted that I would end up in a situation like this...

120
00:08:30,149 --> 00:08:31,750
and prepared a way for me to get out of this predicament.

121
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,519
I am deeply grateful for Father's...

122
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,690
boundless benevolence.

123
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:44,500
Even if we lock up the commander of the Palace Guards and his men,

124
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,870
those at the palace must be waiting to hear from them,

125
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:51,700
so we should come up with a solution as soon as possible.

126
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,240
I have a plan.

127
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,539
Ask the village head to arrange a messenger to be sent to the palace.

128
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:08,889
People will wonder if you are a spy or something.

129
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,289
Please do not get the wrong idea.

130
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:13,159
Follow me.

131
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,070
You are a servant, but you do work for Royal Physician Choi's family.

132
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:28,639
Do not do anything that could lead to a misunderstanding.

133
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,610
I will ask for you if we need you.

134
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:33,879
Do not visit the men's quarters without permission again.

135
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Well understood.

136
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,350
By the way,

137
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,720
why was His Royal Highness deposed?

138
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,219
Does it have something to do...

139
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,359
with how he was taken to the Department of Justice?

140
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,559
You are a mere maid. Why do you have so many questions?

141
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,929
If you are that curious,

142
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,700
ask your lady when you see her later.

143
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:54,999
She does not know anything about it either.

144
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,340
Then ask your master.

145
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,139
They are asking for you in the men's quarters.

146
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,518
It is seolyamyeok.

147
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,388
It is not a snowy night,

148
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:18,788
but I prepared this dish for I heard it was one of your favorites.

149
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:20,929
How did you find out that I liked seolyamyeok?

150
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:24,759
Ever since I moved back to my hometown,

151
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,600
His Majesty has been writing me letters every year.

152
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:28,928
Except for the parts where he asked me how I was doing,

153
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:31,600
they were mostly about you.

154
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,898
It was thanks to His Majesty's letters...

155
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,809
that I found out seolyamyeok was one of your favorite dishes.

156
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,340
Father.

157
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,750
All right.

158
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,059
All right, please eat.

159
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:57,759
For you,

160
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:01,029
I prepared beef from cows that were fed medicinal stone powder.

161
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,500
Pardon me? You fed stones to cows?

162
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:09,710
Have you ever heard of geojongseok?

163
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,179
No, I have never heard of it.

164
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:14,450
Have you heard of it?

165
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,679
Yes. It is a stone that has health-promoting energies...

166
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,418
and detoxifying properties.

167
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:22,490
That is why it is called a medicinal stone.

168
00:11:22,789 --> 00:11:23,990
That is correct.

169
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:27,960
However, we humans cannot eat it for it is a stone after all.

170
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,199
Hence, it is fed to livestock such as cows and pigs first.

171
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,600
Then we eat the meat.

172
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,629
Medicinal stone-fed beef...

173
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,169
does not smell and tastes tender.

174
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,970
All right. Hurry up and try it.

175
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,799
It melts in my mouth.

176
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,329
Right, Your Royal Highness?

177
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,700
Yes, it is incredibly tender and tasty.

178
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,269
It does not smell at all.

179
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:15,509
You can only taste this in Mungyeong.

180
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,279
All right. Eat as much as you like.

181
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:21,409
Yes. You should have some too, Grandfather.

182
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,809
It is okay. I am good.

183
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:33,590
It truly melts in your mouth.

184
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,539
It is such a beautiful color.

185
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,610
Yes, indeed.

186
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:50,039
What is this? It has such a nice color.

187
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,139
It was made with omija marmalade.

188
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:54,210
"Omija?"

189
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,480
Do you know about omija too?

190
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,918
The skin and flesh taste sweet and sour,

191
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,549
while the seeds taste spicy and bitter.

192
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,319
Together, the berry tastes salty.

193
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Hence the name omija, "five-flavor berries."

194
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:08,960
Do you know what it is good for?

195
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:11,700
According to "The Compendium of Materia Medica" and "Dongui Bogam,"

196
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,699
it helps boost men's libido.

197
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,870
"Men's libido?"

198
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,740
It has many other health benefits.

199
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,840
From what I know, it aids digestion as well.

200
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:27,580
She is more knowledgeable than most male physicians, Your Highness.

201
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:29,750
I am selective as to whom I choose to accompany me.

202
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:46,700
Oh Wol, are you inside?

203
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,639
Go inside, Your Royal Highness.

204
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:09,990
I brought you new bandages.

205
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,190
Change the bandages once you are done treating his wound.

206
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:15,830
Has his wound festered?

207
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,759
No, of course not.

208
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:20,429
Everyone thinks you are a physician.

209
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:22,070
If he is seen visiting you again...

210
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:24,440
right after seeing you when he is totally fine,

211
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,240
they will think something suspicious is going on.

212
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:43,690
You must have been very surprised.

213
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,190
Please forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

214
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,230
Forgive you? For what?

215
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:54,230
I dared to do things...

216
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,299
I should have never done to Your Royal Highness.

217
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,139
Right.

218
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,639
You threw the medicinal herbs at me...

219
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,980
and smeared soot on me.

220
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:09,909
You were quite rude and disrespectful to me, Baek Gu.

221
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:13,179
However, you treated me like that because you did not know who I was.

222
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,549
I was the one who concealed my identity, so I should apologize.

223
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:18,090
No, Your Royal Highness.

224
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,190
Please forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

225
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,559
It does not matter whether I am the Crown Prince or a mere scholar.

226
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,240
You are my savior who saved my life...

227
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,870
several times.

228
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:37,070
It is all thanks to you that I was able to come here safe and sound.

229
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,879
That is a fact.

230
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,480
Hence, you must stop apologizing.

231
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,460
Your Royal Highness.

232
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,529
What is the matter?

233
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:03,330
Are you worried about what is to come now that you know who I am?

234
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:11,740
Since you are a bright girl, you must be anxious about...

235
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:14,350
what would happen to your master who tried to kill the Crown Prince.

236
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:17,309
You must be worried about your young lady as well.

237
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,620
That is correct.

238
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,720
I certainly do not plan to forgive your master.

239
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,329
No matter what happens, I will make sure...

240
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,860
your master pays for what he did.

241
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,330
And if that happens,

242
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,629
your young lady will be affected too.

243
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:39,799
However,

244
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,139
I will keep you safe.

245
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,840
I will protect you no matter what happens,

246
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,409
so please stay with me.

247
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:53,049
Your Royal Highness.

248
00:16:57,149 --> 00:16:58,159
I am...

249
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:01,019
I am not just saying it. I truly...

250
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,730
do not want you to get hurt.

251
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,500
Your Royal Highness.

252
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,740
The truth is,

253
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,440
I am...

254
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,779
Your Royal Highness, they are asking for you in the men's quarters.

255
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,349
I should go.

256
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,190
Let us talk again later.

257
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:45,170
Baek Gu, I did not know you were such a crybaby.

258
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:47,440
Do not cry.

259
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:49,309
I told you it was okay.

260
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,049
Your Royal Highness.

261
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,259
Stay with me, and nothing will happen to you.

262
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:12,529
Do not worry, and get some rest.

263
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,250
Do you not think Baek Gu is acting strange?

264
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,880
In what way?

265
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,220
Never mind.

266
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,720
Anyway, why is he asking for me?

267
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:36,619
They have sent the messenger to Hanyang.

268
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,629
(Deposed Crown Prince Lee Gun has been arrested...)

269
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:47,130
(and is being transported.)

270
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,609
- Giddyap! - Giddyap!

271
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,380
A messenger arrived from Mungyeong.

272
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,190
The deposed Crown Prince has been arrested.

273
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,999
Head Eunuch, what brings you by?

274
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,930
His Majesty is in critical condition.

275
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:31,979
What is going on?

276
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,609
Her Highness ordered us never to let the Inspector General enter.

277
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,220
Let her know that I am here.

278
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,490
Your Highness, Prince Dosung is here.

279
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,690
Your Highness.

280
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,619
Prince Dosung has not been installed as Crown Prince yet.

281
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,990
If His Majesty passes away now,

282
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,019
the Queen Dowager and Choi Sang Rok...

283
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:21,059
might get different ideas.

284
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,099
Oh, right. The other day,

285
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,099
the Queen called a physician to the palace. What did he say?

286
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:31,069
You spoke with him in private.

287
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,409
If you...

288
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,910
answer my question truthfully,

289
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:42,109
I will let you go.

290
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,250
Do you think...

291
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,990
there is a chance that His Majesty will recover?

292
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,259
Poison from the poison-feather bird?

293
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:57,129
It has not been used for a very long time.

294
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,400
It is passed down like folklore even among physicians.

295
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,670
It is poison that no one has actually seen.

296
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,670
Then...

297
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,409
how could he be so sure it was caused by that poison?

298
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,140
The symptoms are similar to those described by his teacher.

299
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,809
If it was any other poison,

300
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:18,049
the physicians at the Royal Infirmary would certainly know.

301
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,250
That means His Majesty...

302
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:24,220
It means that...

303
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:27,289
no one except Choi Sang Rok can treat him.

304
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,400
Why are you out here?

305
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,440
For some strange reason, my chest feels tight and heavy.

306
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,079
Do you have indigestion?

307
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:47,579
Would you like some omija tea?

308
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,910
Please spare me a moment.

309
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:26,579
I cannot step out at the moment. Could it wait?

310
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,289
I must speak with you now.

311
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,960
I will do anything you say.

312
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,660
I will become Crown Prince if you tell me to.

313
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,369
If you want me to marry your daughter, I will do it.

314
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,439
I will take care of my maternal grandfather too,

315
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,470
but you must...

316
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,539
treat my father...

317
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,338
and let my brother go.

318
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:54,009
That is too much to ask.

319
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:57,250
Releasing the deposed Crown Prince will backfire on us.

320
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,420
I will persuade him.

321
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:02,490
I will tell him to live in hiding in a place where no one knows him.

322
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,420
If that still makes you anxious,

323
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,519
I will make sure he leaves the country...

324
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:10,859
and never returns to the palace again.

325
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:14,730
You do that.

326
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:17,099
Your Majesty.

327
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,500
However,

328
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,880
never forget that you promised us to take care of everything...

329
00:23:26,039 --> 00:23:27,710
going forward.

330
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:30,710
Do you understand?

331
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

332
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,109
Open the door.

333
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,899
Take the Queen to her palace.

334
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,410
I refuse to leave.

335
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:31,269
Just go ahead and kill me instead.

336
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,180
Queen, you seem to be in utter shock.

337
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,579
Return to your palace...

338
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,548
- and take care of yourself. - I refuse.

339
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:44,619
What are you waiting for? Take her to the Queen's Palace at once.

340
00:24:52,829 --> 00:24:55,099
Let go. I told you to let go!

341
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,240
Prince Dosung, you ought to stop them.

342
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:01,299
You should not trust them!

343
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,740
Take her to her palace.

344
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:06,309
Let us go, Your Highness.

345
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,180
Do not do this, Prince Dosung.

346
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:10,670
What is that?

347
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:16,980
It is a device that helps remove the poison.

348
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:20,049
Soon, His Majesty's breathing will become stable,

349
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,119
and he will no longer vomit blood.

350
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:36,430
Do you still feel unwell?

351
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:40,039
No.

352
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,640
I am okay now, so do not worry.

353
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,130
Father's condition is improving.

354
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:10,670
Is that true?

355
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:12,869
Yes.

356
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,740
I must go to his bedchamber.

357
00:27:17,269 --> 00:27:18,309
I have...

358
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,240
something to tell you.

359
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:23,910
Please calm down...

360
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:26,279
and sit.

361
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,589
I have decided...

362
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:39,259
to obey their wishes and become Crown Prince.

363
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,058
- No, you cannot. - Mother.

364
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,868
You must not do that.

365
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,769
I am well aware that both you and Father...

366
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,640
want Gun to ascend the throne.

367
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:48,839
That is why...

368
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:54,039
you gave him the royal seal.

369
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:58,519
You knew about it?

370
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:01,119
I could guess that much.

371
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:02,619
Did it...

372
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,759
hurt your feelings?

373
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:11,289
Handing over the royal seal to Gun did not hurt my feelings at all.

374
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,200
But your decision to hide it...

375
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:19,700
even from me...

376
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,069
did hurt me.

377
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,920
Yes, Your Majesty. I am here.

378
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,450
The royal seal...

379
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,150
The royal seal...

380
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:43,359
Make sure you send it to the Crown Prince.

381
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:45,359
To the Crown Prince...

382
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,599
Make sure no one finds out.

383
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,509
Your Majesty!

384
00:28:58,809 --> 00:28:59,839
Your Majesty!

385
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,180
Your Majesty...

386
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,650
You need not feel bad about it.

387
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:09,789
It is my own fault for failing to earn your trust, Mother.

388
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,759
That is why you are against me becoming Crown Prince.

389
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,729
No, that is not why.

390
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,130
Then why are you against it?

391
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:25,339
Because I am not wise enough,

392
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,309
I cannot figure out what you are thinking, Mother.

393
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,890
There is no other way to save Father.

394
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:46,859
I must...

395
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:50,089
become the Crown Prince of this country.

396
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,390
Prince Dosung.

397
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:54,660
I will be off, then.

398
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,890
If I obey you and die,

399
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:21,059
Father will be your next target.

400
00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:23,890
Because as long as Father is alive,

401
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,859
Dosung cannot become King.

402
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,500
Your Highness.

403
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:35,410
I suggest you tell Prince Dosung the truth.

404
00:30:35,869 --> 00:30:36,970
The truth?

405
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,440
That my father...

406
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,579
will kill his father...

407
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:45,180
if he is installed as Crown Prince?

408
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,589
Is something the matter?

409
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,130
I told you...

410
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,700
to tame your fiery temper first.

411
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,269
You did.

412
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:07,039
- Pardon? - It is nothing.

413
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,920
I am...

414
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,259
Actually...

415
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,119
I am...

416
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:40,299
No.

417
00:31:41,569 --> 00:31:42,640
You cannot.

418
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,469
Do you know where I am heading?

419
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:46,710
You are going to Oh Wol again, are you not?

420
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:50,749
What if someone spots you going to the annex?

421
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:51,809
I am going to the restroom.

422
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,119
Go ahead.

423
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:03,630
Now tell me.

424
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,859
What were you going to say during the day?

425
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:12,000
It seemed you had something to tell me.

426
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,309
What is it that is so hard to talk about?

427
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,980
Nevermind. Let me hear it later when we have time.

428
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:31,720
No, Your Royal Highness.

429
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,430
I will tell you.

430
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:40,799
Your Royal Highness.

431
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:43,369
Yes?

432
00:32:45,069 --> 00:32:46,069
Actually...

433
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:47,539
"Actually?"

434
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,240
Actually...

435
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,079
I am not the servant Oh Wol.

436
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,950
What do you mean by that?

437
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,549
Are you not Oh Wol?

438
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:09,259
The Royal Physician Choi Sang Rok is my father.

439
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,900
What...

440
00:33:15,869 --> 00:33:17,700
- was that? - I am...

441
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,839
Myung Yoon, the daughter of Royal Physician Choi,

442
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,509
who was behind your kidnapping.

443
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,059
For deceiving Your Royal Highness...

444
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,789
Stop.

445
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:45,160
As you got kidnapped because of me...

446
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,430
As you were in danger of death and pursuit,

447
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:51,400
I wanted to help one way or another.

448
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:52,970
I wanted...

449
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:55,940
to protect you from my father.

450
00:33:57,509 --> 00:33:58,670
However, to do so,

451
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,480
I had to be the servant Oh Wol.

452
00:34:03,079 --> 00:34:06,579
As the Royal Physician's daughter, I could not protect you.

453
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,849
By becoming Oh Wol and Baek Gu,

454
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:11,219
I wanted to stay by your side.

455
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:16,289
And so, I fooled you.

456
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,599
There was a reason for you...

457
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,929
to disguise yourself as Oh Wol.

458
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:26,099
I can understand that.

459
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,539
I, too, had hidden my identity.

460
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,840
However...

461
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,610
I cannot say anything for now.

462
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,980
Nor do I want to hear anything.

463
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:45,019
That is because, of all people,

464
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,619
you are the Royal Physician's daughter.

465
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,460
Of course, I cannot accuse you of your father's crimes.

466
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:56,229
I also know it is not your fault to be born as his daughter.

467
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,300
However,

468
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,469
only my brain understands it.

469
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,900
My heart cannot.

470
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,808
What your father did...

471
00:35:03,809 --> 00:35:06,980
My father did not harm you with intention.

472
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,638
He had no choice but to kidnap you...

473
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:10,110
as I was to become a widow.

474
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,519
But you turned out to be the Crown Prince.

475
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,920
He was scared of the aftermath.

476
00:35:15,849 --> 00:35:17,888
Please take pity on my father for his clouded judgment...

477
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:19,989
- because of me... - I do not want to hear it!

478
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,559
"Take pity?"

479
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,030
Will you be able to say that even if your father had murdered someone?

480
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:42,510
Do not bring up...

481
00:35:44,349 --> 00:35:45,980
your father again in front of me.

482
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,659
I will take you to Hanyang.

483
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,219
Until then,

484
00:35:57,329 --> 00:35:58,389
do not tell a soul...

485
00:35:59,929 --> 00:36:03,429
that you are the Royal Physician's daughter.

486
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:06,469
Understood?

487
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:12,210
Yes.

488
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:15,139
Please forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

489
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,380
They accused me of delivering the poisoned dried yellow croaker...

490
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,750
you gave me...

491
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,619
to the Queen.

492
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,320
But it was not her. The Queen Dowager did it.

493
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,690
You have my word...

494
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:38,360
that I will keep His Majesty safe.

495
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,510
I...

496
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,440
I am...

497
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,820
Well...

498
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:48,690
I have something to say. Step outside for a moment.

499
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:16,320
Did you leave?

500
00:40:17,489 --> 00:40:20,820
I am leaving first as it will be an utter shame for me...

501
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:22,860
to keep you company until Hanyang.

502
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:26,059
Please forgive me for leaving...

503
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,300
without even saying goodbye.

504
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,840
My lady!

505
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:44,849
Were you still after me?

506
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,380
Are you all right?

507
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,449
Are you hurt or in pain anywhere?

508
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:51,849
- No. - Then,

509
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,659
let us take you home right away.

510
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:57,030
I have yet to finish his lord's order.

511
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,059
These men will take you.

512
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:01,800
You two. Take the lady to Hanyang.

513
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:03,099
Understood.

514
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,929
We need to talk in private.

515
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:11,239
Why do you look so shocked?

516
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,980
After all this time we have been together,

517
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,449
did you think I was still unaware that he was the Crown Prince?

518
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:19,920
Now, answer me.

519
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,079
Will you escort me home...

520
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:24,650
or continue to pursue the Crown Prince?

521
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,819
- My lady... - If you give up on the latter...

522
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,159
and escort me home,

523
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,159
I will come with you without causing trouble.

524
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,030
But if you go after him,

525
00:41:36,469 --> 00:41:38,829
I will subdue those men and run away.

526
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:44,710
Are you afraid to go against my father's order?

527
00:41:46,139 --> 00:41:50,578
I promise to talk to my father so that he does not blame you...

528
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:53,420
I do not care about what happens to me.

529
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:57,219
You are always my priority.

530
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,460
I will escort you home.

531
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:48,440
His condition has greatly stabilized.

532
00:42:49,539 --> 00:42:50,570
I am glad to hear that.

533
00:42:51,909 --> 00:42:52,909
However,

534
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:54,980
we may be able to trust Prince Dosung,

535
00:42:55,309 --> 00:42:57,179
but the same cannot be said about Left State Councilor Yoon.

536
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:00,780
What if he has other ideas?

537
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,320
I have come across a way to keep him leashed,

538
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:05,320
so please do not fret.

539
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:08,619
Recently,

540
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,059
a report came in from the Slave Administration Office.

541
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,230
A report came in from the Slave Administration Office.

542
00:43:18,969 --> 00:43:20,699
One of the officials is rumored...

543
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:22,738
to have a lowborn mother.

544
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:25,239
(Eolja: A son conceived between a nobleman and a lowborn woman)

545
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,538
The rumor should be investigated,

546
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:29,750
and the official should be impeached if the rumor is true.

547
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,380
The subject of the rumor...

548
00:43:34,449 --> 00:43:35,780
is Left State Councilor Yoon.

549
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:47,260
Left State Councilor Yoon's grandmother...

550
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:49,329
used to be lowborn?

551
00:43:49,530 --> 00:43:50,530
Yes.

552
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:52,900
She was the daughter of a slave,

553
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,198
but when the family they served...

554
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:55,239
perished during the Japanese Invasion,

555
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:57,869
she masked herself as the daughter of her master's wife...

556
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:01,880
and married Yoon Yi Kyum's grandfather.

557
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:05,549
That means Yoon Yi Kyum is also...

558
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,550
Yes.

559
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:08,579
Our status follows that of our mother...

560
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:11,590
which means all of her descendants...

561
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:13,519
are born lowly by default.

562
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,130
That makes Yoon Yi Kyum a slave as well.

563
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:20,760
One of the descendants of his grandmother's master...

564
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:24,130
must have had her slave document.

565
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:25,799
He has asked the Slave Administration Office...

566
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,739
to authenticate it.

567
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:30,710
Was it authenticated? Was his grandmother a slave?

568
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:34,709
Most of the slave documents stored by the office...

569
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,650
were burned during the Japanese Invasion,

570
00:44:36,909 --> 00:44:39,279
so the authentication process will take time.

571
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,349
However, once the document is proved to be real,

572
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,849
we will have our hands around Yoon's throat...

573
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,260
and will be able to remove him when necessary.

574
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:51,289
There is a chance of it not being authenticated.

575
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,300
Since that can happen, I have been asking those...

576
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,170
who know his family to serve as a potential witness.

577
00:44:59,369 --> 00:45:02,809
Could he be aware of his grandmother's social class?

578
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,409
What?

579
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:09,340
The Office of the Inspector General has been asking about my family?

580
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:10,750
Yes.

581
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:13,880
Apparently, they are looking into your grandmother.

582
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:18,119
What is it?

583
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,590
Do you know what this could be about?

584
00:45:22,659 --> 00:45:23,659
Of course not.

585
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:26,030
Anyway, I should head out.

586
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:31,329
You are to find out the information Choi Sang Rok has.

587
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:35,800
Wait.

588
00:45:35,801 --> 00:45:38,739
On top of that, get me leverage I can use against him.

589
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:40,679
As leverage?

590
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:44,109
Would there be a secret he is harboring...

591
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,880
that I would be able to find?

592
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:49,449
If you cannot find anything, make something up!

593
00:45:49,989 --> 00:45:53,219
Do not sit around until he bites down on our necks...

594
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,019
and find something we can use.

595
00:45:55,789 --> 00:45:56,929
Do you hear me?

596
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,130
Darn it.

597
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:13,939
I wonder if the ember I sent to the Slave Administration Office...

598
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,579
has caused a fire.

599
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,949
Please do not worry.

600
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:21,380
The bait will be too tempting for anyone to pass up.

601
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:24,190
I am sure a fire has already erupted.

602
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:26,219
I only hope you are right.

603
00:46:26,619 --> 00:46:29,159
They have never been able to trust one another.

604
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:33,159
The Queen Dowager will want leverage against Yoon Yi Kyum,

605
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,929
and Yoon Yi Kyum...

606
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:39,868
will go from being at the top of the food chain...

607
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:41,900
to joining those of lowborn status overnight.

608
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,340
This is a battle they will surely engage in.

609
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:48,840
How were you in possession of such a document?

610
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:52,809
In case Yoon Yi Kyum thought of hurting you...

611
00:46:53,619 --> 00:46:55,980
after you succeed to the throne,

612
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:59,119
I made such preparations in advance.

613
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,320
Grandfather...

614
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:06,860
I only did what I had to do.

615
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:15,739
Then,

616
00:47:16,139 --> 00:47:17,539
I will see you in Hanyang.

617
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:20,380
Please take care of yourself until then.

618
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:24,079
I humbly request that you take your own advice.

619
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:27,179
Uncle, stay strong.

620
00:47:27,619 --> 00:47:29,079
Take care of yourself, Your Royal Highness.

621
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:51,239
Have you sent out the letter?

622
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,110
I have sent people to Sosu Academy, Dosan Academy,

623
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,110
and Byeongsan Academy.

624
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,050
Good.

625
00:48:05,489 --> 00:48:07,058
Kings of the past.

626
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:08,518
(Yeolseongjo: Kings of the past)

627
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:10,429
Please protect His Royal Highness.

628
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:16,159
What could it be that you are holding dearly?

629
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:19,030
Something that is good for men.

630
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,369
Is it omija?

631
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,969
Sure. Enjoy all that you want.

632
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:28,980
Your uncle made sure we took some of it.

633
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:34,050
"Producing heirs is the duty of a prince."

634
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:38,419
I am full of vigor even without such a thing.

635
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:41,389
You must have thrown Oh Wol out with that extra energy you have.

636
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:45,030
I mean...

637
00:48:46,059 --> 00:48:47,929
Oh Wol left us out of the blue,

638
00:48:48,199 --> 00:48:50,670
but you have not said a word about it.

639
00:48:56,510 --> 00:48:59,340
Could something have happened?

640
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:01,780
Your Royal Highness.

641
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,079
How is Myung Yoon? Tell me she is all right.

642
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:10,849
She is. However,

643
00:49:12,289 --> 00:49:14,619
she was aware that the man we abducted...

644
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:17,590
was the deposed Crown Prince.

645
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,638
When you had found out he was the Crown Prince,

646
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:32,969
you should have immediately asked for his forgiveness.

647
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:36,239
Were you that desperate to make me Crown Princess?

648
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:40,019
Were you that desperate to be the king's father-in-law?

649
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:41,619
Yes.

650
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:45,119
I wanted you to be Crown Princess,

651
00:49:45,389 --> 00:49:47,558
and I wanted to be the king's father-in-law.

652
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:48,559
Was I wrong...

653
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,960
to dream of such things?

654
00:49:51,329 --> 00:49:53,500
Yes, you were wrong...

655
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:56,260
for I did not have the right to be Crown Princess.

656
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,369
There is no need to mention the abduction now.

657
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,340
The deposed Crown Prince has been arrested.

658
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:08,940
He will not make it out alive this time around,

659
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,280
so everything that happened including his abduction...

660
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:16,119
will be buried when he lays to rest.

661
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,419
If you understand my words,

662
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,559
you will make preparations to become Crown Princess.

663
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,690
How can I become Crown Princess...

664
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,429
when the Crown Prince no longer holds his title?

665
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,130
It was the deposed Crown Prince who was arrested,

666
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:32,929
not the actual Crown Prince.

667
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:36,638
I do not follow.

668
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:38,969
Prince Dosung will soon be installed as Crown Prince...

669
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,809
and will marry you.

670
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:41,980
That...

671
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:45,979
will make you Crown Princess. Is it now clear to you?

672
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,079
This is preposterous.

673
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,889
How can I marry the man...

674
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,090
after wronging his older brother?

675
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,320
Does it not occur to you that marrying Prince Dosung...

676
00:50:56,659 --> 00:50:58,288
might be the only way for our family to remain unscathed...

677
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:00,260
should our wrongdoing come to light?

678
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,099
The deposed Crown Prince...

679
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:10,440
is now an enemy of this family...

680
00:51:10,739 --> 00:51:14,439
which means that only Prince Dosung can protect you...

681
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,078
Do you think he will marry me...

682
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:18,579
after knowing all that we have done?

683
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,420
He will...

684
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:27,920
for his heart already beats for you.

685
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:35,329
Why did you...

686
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:40,269
have to be born as Royal Physician Choi's daughter?

687
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,250
My lady.

688
00:51:56,889 --> 00:51:58,550
Why the long face?

689
00:51:59,789 --> 00:52:01,820
Did Lord Choi give you an earful?

690
00:52:06,659 --> 00:52:08,400
Why do you seem heartbroken...

691
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:10,699
when you were caught after running away from home?

692
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:14,099
A commendation...

693
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:16,039
was never an option.

694
00:52:16,769 --> 00:52:17,769
Oh Wol,

695
00:52:18,409 --> 00:52:19,880
I should rest.

696
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:24,050
Right.

697
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,320
My lady,

698
00:52:28,179 --> 00:52:29,719
are you not feeling well?

699
00:52:29,949 --> 00:52:30,949
That is not it.

700
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:33,019
I am tired...

701
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:35,159
and would like to turn in early.

702
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:38,690
Sure.

703
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:56,380
Something was off about her,

704
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,349
but I cannot put my finger on it.

705
00:53:05,489 --> 00:53:07,719
He will not make it out alive this time around,

706
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:11,090
so everything that happened including his abduction...

707
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:14,860
will be buried when he lays to rest.

708
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,469
Prince Dosung will soon be installed as Crown Prince...

709
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:21,800
and will marry you.

710
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:23,739
That...

711
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,940
will make you Crown Princess.

712
00:53:43,329 --> 00:53:45,190
As you got kidnapped because of me...

713
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:48,559
As you were in danger of death and pursuit,

714
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,469
I wanted to help one way or another.

715
00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:53,099
I wanted...

716
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:56,070
to protect you from my father.

717
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:07,150
Nothing good will come from provoking them.

718
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,619
I advise that you stay away from the King's quarters for now...

719
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:11,349
I shall not do that.

720
00:54:12,289 --> 00:54:13,420
No matter what they do,

721
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,659
I will stay by His Majesty's side.

722
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,289
But you are aware of our current situation.

723
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,960
Choi Sang Rok is the only one...

724
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,429
who can help Father.

725
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,969
You of all people know that.

726
00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:29,539
Please put your faith in me...

727
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:31,840
and follow my lead.

728
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:38,179
Your Highness,

729
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:40,348
I also agree...

730
00:54:40,349 --> 00:54:41,948
that it will be in your best interest...

731
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:43,789
to protect you from my father.

732
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:50,059
Mother, please.

733
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,199
I hear you.

734
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:10,309
Is there trouble?

735
00:55:10,909 --> 00:55:14,480
Her Majesty has not been able to take a bite of anything.

736
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:19,389
She had to deal with a lot lately.

737
00:55:19,989 --> 00:55:22,059
Her heart seems to be in pain,

738
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,759
so maybe it would be nice...

739
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,300
for her to get some fresh air outside palace walls.

740
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:32,699
Court Lady Kim,

741
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,739
you have lived your whole life being concerned for her.

742
00:55:36,739 --> 00:55:40,179
What else could I possibly want in life?

743
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:43,039
All I want...

744
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:47,050
is for her to find ultimate peace.

745
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,619
How can you stand strong if you do not eat anything?

746
00:55:57,489 --> 00:55:59,559
I have only lost my appetite,

747
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:01,900
so do not worry too much.

748
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:04,170
What do you say...

749
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,840
to some fresh air at Botaam Hermitage?

750
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,539
But people will talk if I go on an outing...

751
00:56:14,309 --> 00:56:15,679
to offer Buddhist prayers.

752
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:17,650
Who would dare to object...

753
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,219
a suggestion made by the Queen Dowager?

754
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,780
Anyone who does are traitors...

755
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:27,359
who I will sentence to death.

756
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,289
(Mulgo: Terminating the lives of sinners and criminals)

757
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:33,860
Maybe I should trust your words.

758
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:35,530
Yes.

759
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,869
That you should.

760
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,400
I do not want it to be extravagant.

761
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,670
Please let me leave without it being a fuss.

762
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:45,570
Sure.

763
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:48,210
I will discuss the details with Left State Councilor Yoon,

764
00:56:48,579 --> 00:56:50,280
so try to eat something for the time being.

765
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:53,519
You will need your strength to be on the road.

766
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,949
Sure thing, Sang Rok.

767
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:09,829
The Office of the Inspector General has been asking about my family?

768
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:20,010
This is the new cheonbo rifle...

769
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:22,678
enhanced at the Office of Firearms.

770
00:57:22,679 --> 00:57:24,710
(Cheonbochong: A gun with a range of 1,000 paces or 1,800m)

771
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,750
I hear your daughter...

772
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:32,119
is at the risk of being sold to cover your debt.

773
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,730
You cannot let that happen to your daughter.

774
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:41,789
When will the temporary palace be completed?

775
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,460
I hear spring will have to pass.

776
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,400
I wish to be free of all this trouble...

777
00:58:47,699 --> 00:58:48,760
and leave the palace...

778
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:51,269
to be beside Prince Gwangchang.

779
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,199
Can they not speed up the process?

780
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:59,009
I will give notice to the Palace Supply Bureau.

781
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:00,940
(Naesusa: The Palace Supply Bureau)

782
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:06,010
Spring will soon reach us, so please hang in there...

783
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:08,750
a while longer.

784
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:39,050
Take cover!

785
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:00,769
- What on earth happened? - Take cover.

786
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,840
Protect Her Majesty.

787
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:09,139
Oh, no.

788
01:00:10,809 --> 01:00:12,150
Please come to.

789
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:13,819
Come on.

790
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,119
- Your Majesty. - Please!

791
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,250
You must take cover, Your Majesty.

792
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:22,159
Where is the physician?

793
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:23,960
Call a physician right away.

794
01:00:24,659 --> 01:00:25,760
Do not just stand there!

795
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,900
Escort Her Majesty to a safer place!

796
01:00:29,429 --> 01:00:30,469
Yoon Yi Kyum.

797
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,530
Yoon Yi Kyum, how dare you?

798
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:17,609
(Missing Crown Prince)

799
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:19,679
Have you found a way to clear your name?

800
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:21,920
I have an idea in mind.

801
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,820
Why is he not waking up?

802
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:26,948
Please tell me what I can do...

803
01:01:26,949 --> 01:01:28,558
to appease her anger even in the slightest.

804
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,888
The new Crown Prince gets installed tomorrow.

805
01:01:29,889 --> 01:01:31,059
What do we do?

806
01:01:31,489 --> 01:01:33,089
He will be installed as Crown Prince...

807
01:01:33,090 --> 01:01:34,559
and take his bride on the same day.

808
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:36,860
What am I supposed to do now?

809
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:39,670
I will become Crown Prince and protect those precious to me.

810
01:01:39,929 --> 01:01:43,469
Please do not forget the man whose heart beat for you.
