00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,239
(All characters, locations, organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,469
(in this drama are historically irrelevant and fictitious.)

3
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:03,709
(Production guidelines were strictly followed...)

4
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:04,809
(when filming with children and animals.)

5
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,369
That is an acupuncture needle canister...

6
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,000
carried around by physicians.

7
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:40,149
You do not seem familiar.

8
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:42,479
Have you traveled here to take the state exam?

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,890
That is correct.

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,920
No.

11
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:53,320
I wish you well on the exam.

12
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:04,269
Did you enjoy your refreshments?

13
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:05,799
I did.

14
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:18,879
Get ready.

15
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:49,609
Master Lee.

16
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:51,849
Hey!

17
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:55,150
Get over here, darn it.

18
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,090
Stop them.

19
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:00,629
Darn. Stop it.

20
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,890
Stop it already.

21
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,860
(Episode 2)

22
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:57,719
The item has been secured.

23
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,120
And the men?

24
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,020
I handled them.

25
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,930
Good work.

26
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,560
Get me Oh Wol.

27
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,199
My lady.

28
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:19,800
It is Moo Baek.

29
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:23,210
What does this concern?

30
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,610
Lord Choi has asked for Oh Wol.

31
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,310
Oh Wol?

32
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,830
Is Oh Wol not in the room?

33
00:03:43,229 --> 00:03:44,758
For what reason...

34
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,830
does my father want to see her at this late hour?

35
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:48,129
Where is Oh Wol?

36
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,698
She went to bed two hours ago.

37
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:52,568
(Sijin: 2 hours)

38
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:54,139
I am just coming from Oh Wol's room.

39
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:58,979
Lord Choi awaits her.

40
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,478
Oh Wol, if you are in there, come out this second.

41
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,979
Actually, I sent her to the clinic for medicine.

42
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,590
At this late hour?

43
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:11,319
You see, I seem to be struggling with indigestion.

44
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,889
Is it bad?

45
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:16,328
If that is the case, I will alert Lord Choi.

46
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,528
It is not that bad.

47
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,429
She will soon be back with the medicine,

48
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,699
and that will be enough.

49
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,300
Please send her to the men's quarters once she returns.

50
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,939
Can I still not persuade you to help me?

51
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,750
What Lord Choi does is solely for your sake.

52
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,350
Brother.

53
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:48,089
My lady, you cannot refer to me that way.

54
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:52,059
You have been forbidden to call me that.

55
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,499
That is not the issue at hand...

56
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,828
We must obey our class system.

57
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:56,199
If someone had heard you,

58
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:58,199
I would have had to pay with my life.

59
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:01,610
Do you wish to see me dead?

60
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,519
What is taking you so long?

61
00:05:15,819 --> 00:05:17,089
Hurry back, Oh Wol.

62
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,079
Moo Baek.

63
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,449
Lady Myung Yoon told me to turn in early,

64
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:51,490
but sleep would not find me.

65
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,589
- That is the truth. - Follow me.

66
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,230
Lord Choi has asked for you.

67
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:30,160
If you understand what I said, you will act promptly.

68
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,029
Yes, my lord.

69
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,139
Lady Myung Yoon's fate...

70
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:45,180
depends on the words you say.

71
00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:47,279
Do not forget that.

72
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,879
Follow me.

73
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,779
Where did this tonic suddenly come from?

74
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,290
Well...

75
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,889
You told Moo Baek you had indigestion.

76
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:38,000
Lord Choi said this would quickly put you at ease.

77
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,268
Moo Baek showed up out of the blue looking for you,

78
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:43,000
so that was the excuse I made...

79
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,110
Outside...

80
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:51,910
Moo Baek is outside.

81
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:55,350
All right, I hear you.

82
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:58,050
First, tell me how it went.

83
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,519
What did they say? Will they do as I wish?

84
00:08:05,589 --> 00:08:08,490
Please drink the tonic.

85
00:08:09,029 --> 00:08:10,129
Come on.

86
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:16,430
Look at you drink.

87
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:17,970
There you go.

88
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,069
My gosh!

89
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,208
Oh, no.

90
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:24,209
Why...

91
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,180
I cannot believe you drank it all.

92
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,050
Why not? You told me to drink it.

93
00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:32,580
But that is...

94
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,019
Oh, no.

95
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,919
I am now absolutely clueless.

96
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,320
What on earth...

97
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,460
How can you of all people be clueless right now?

98
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,429
Did they say they can prepare it?

99
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:52,539
You are killing me.

100
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:54,339
What is it? Did they refuse?

101
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,509
Can they not help me?

102
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,980
No, that is not it.

103
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:01,179
- You see... - What is it?

104
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,350
Did they ask for more money?

105
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:07,919
Was that their term?

106
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,889
Lady Myung Yoon's fate depends on the words you say.

107
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:15,159
Do not forget that.

108
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:22,029
Oh Wol.

109
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,538
What is it?

110
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:26,970
Did something happen?

111
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,340
My lady.

112
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,149
I committed a mortal sin. Please take my life.

113
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:36,409
No way.

114
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:39,120
Did they...

115
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,549
Did those thugs hurt you in any way?

116
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:44,460
Then I will...

117
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,620
What?

118
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,960
My lady!

119
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:51,159
My lady.

120
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,700
Do not worry.

121
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,769
I will...

122
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,139
I will teach them...

123
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,909
I will teach them...

124
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:07,850
My lady!

125
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,230
- Everything is set. - And the young man?

126
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:23,490
He was dealt with as per your instructions.

127
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,769
If he catches a glimpse of Myung Yoon's face,

128
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,200
this will all have been for nothing.

129
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:34,440
There can be no room for error.

130
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,309
Even if he manages to wake up,

131
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,210
he will not be able to see anything.

132
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:42,710
Keep a close eye on Myung Yoon as well.

133
00:10:43,549 --> 00:10:45,919
If she wakes up before the rooster crows,

134
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,620
the plan could be ruined.

135
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,319
Tell Oh Wol...

136
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,590
that she must stand guard outside her room.

137
00:10:53,289 --> 00:10:54,289
Yes, my lord.

138
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,889
Also, only you and Oh Wol...

139
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,360
can know about what transpired.

140
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:04,440
No one from the domestic staff is to approach her room.

141
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,269
Make sure to keep them away.

142
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,580
Stand guard.

143
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,980
If you hear an odd sound coming from the room,

144
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,750
you will alert me immediately.

145
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:21,990
Do you understand?

146
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,590
Sure.

147
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,699
The two will have to be dressed as groom and bride...

148
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,839
and remain in bed together...

149
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,279
until their souls and energy connect.

150
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,409
When the two are finally united,

151
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,309
Myung Yoon's curse will be lifted.

152
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,149
However, all will have been for nothing...

153
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,259
should the man see Myung Yoon's face.

154
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,620
You must...

155
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:04,629
keep that in mind.

Your Royal Highness...

163
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,700
Gosh, my head.

164
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,740
Your Royal Highness.

165
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,110
Your Royal Highness...

166
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:29,580
Oh, gosh.

167
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,750
Your Royal Highness?

168
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,230
Are you...

169
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,909
- Goodness. - My gosh.

170
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,250
It all happened so fast...

171
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:06,450
that I do not remember clearly.

172
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,090
They were men I had not seen before.

173
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,519
Please be alive and well, Your Royal Highness.

174
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,590
Please.

175
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:17,230
Please...

176
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:18,659
Your Royal Highness.

177
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:28,909
Your Royal Highness.

178
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:47,789
Darn it.

179
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,879
I heard the man I marry would meet an untimely death.

180
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,289
I have a way.

181
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,089
I will take care of everything,

182
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,120
so just do as I say and follow my lead.

183
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,779
My lady?

184
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,580
Oh Wol, is that you?

185
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,350
Yes, my lady.

186
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,620
My lady.

187
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:48,389
I have committed a mortal sin.

188
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,460
Lord Choi ordered it,

189
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,220
and I had no choice.

190
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:54,789
Save it.

191
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:57,490
As if you could have disobeyed my father.

192
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:01,000
It is all right, so please open this door.

193
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,699
May I leave it locked?

194
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,700
Why you...

195
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:06,970
I will knock it down.

196
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,409
Yes, I will open it.

197
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,019
How did it go with what I ordered?

198
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:25,590
I never got your answer.

199
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,360
Right.

200
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:29,289
They will already be waiting for you.

201
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:31,429
Let us hurry.

202
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:37,970
Wait. Do not do that, my lady.

203
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,869
You disobeyed my father's orders...

204
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,570
the second you opened that door.

205
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:46,139
What you do now will not change that,

206
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,950
- so help me with this. - That is not it.

207
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,878
Even if you were to help him,

208
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,450
he should not see your face.

209
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,720
And he should not know where he is.

210
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,128
Hurry up and strip down.

211
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:02,129
Pardon?

212
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:04,528
Do you want to change attires with me again?

213
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:07,599
I must take him to a place my father cannot find him,

214
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:10,598
but I cannot leave the house wearing this.

215
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,339
And not wearing clothes is not an option.

216
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:14,569
Maybe we can let this man leave by himself.

217
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,670
We only have to help him over the wall.

218
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:18,679
How can he jump over the wall...

219
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,909
when he is tied up like this?

220
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,209
Then just untie his hands.

221
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,950
What if he takes off his blindfold as soon as he is over the wall?

222
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,750
You said he should not know where he has been.

223
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,720
He could even remove his gag.

224
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:31,920
Then, he will be able to scream for help.

225
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:37,230
Allow me to take him away.

226
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,730
Can you ride a horse?

227
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:42,130
I will take off my clothes.

228
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,079
My lady,

229
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,680
can I at least take this off?

230
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:07,619
Your Royal Highness...

231
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,660
My lady.

232
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,160
No.

233
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:16,630
If my father decides to look in on us,

234
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:19,039
seeing you disguised as me will buy me some time.

235
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:24,740
Stop pouting and wake this man up.

236
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,210
Look here.

237
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:37,789
Look here. Wake up.

238
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,609
Move aside.

239
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,079
What will you do?

240
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,460
My lady?

241
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,630
My lady!

242
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:39,549
My gosh.

243
00:19:40,349 --> 00:19:41,420
Unbelievable.

244
00:19:50,259 --> 00:19:52,660
Lady Myung Yoon is sick and must rest.

245
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,568
Did you not hear...

246
00:19:54,569 --> 00:19:56,200
that no one is to step foot inside the women's quarters?

247
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,829
Well, you see...

248
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:01,509
Someone came by asking for Lord Choi,

249
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,910
but I did not know what to do.

250
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,338
Who did you say was here?

251
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:08,779
Guard of the Crown Prince's Palace.

252
00:20:09,349 --> 00:20:10,450
Guard of the Crown Prince's Palace?

253
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,318
Why is the Guard of the Crown Prince's Palace...

254
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:13,950
here to see me at this hour?

255
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:15,250
He is looking...

256
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,490
for the Crown Prince.

257
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,400
What is this nonsense?

258
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:29,230
What do you mean he went missing during his secret outing?

259
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:32,170
Forgive me, but it is like I just informed you.

260
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:37,140
He passed out while drinking at the tavern.

261
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,808
And right about that moment, I passed out...

262
00:20:40,809 --> 00:20:42,549
from a blow to the head.

263
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:44,250
When I came to,

264
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,349
His Royal Highness was gone.

265
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,119
The tavern?

266
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,289
Which one?

267
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:55,859
It is the tavern at the intersection in Jingok.

268
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:01,598
I searched around the tavern and the vicinity of it,

269
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,700
but I could not find a single trace of him.

270
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,440
This secret outing was not his first.

271
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,039
He is a smart man, so I am sure he is well.

272
00:21:10,609 --> 00:21:12,778
But why did you come to see me?

273
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:13,880
Is it not protocol...

274
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,750
to alert the palace in this situation?

275
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,349
I was making my way toward the palace with that in mind,

276
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,319
but I came here instead because I was reminded of you.

277
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:29,460
His Royal Highness went on this secret outing...

278
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,160
because he had urgent business to run by you.

279
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,170
- By me? - Yes.

280
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:39,670
So I thought he could have made it here.

281
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,939
I apologize for the inconvenience at this late hour.

282
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,940
It is all right.

283
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:48,149
I will think of a way,

284
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,609
so hurry back to the Palace.

285
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,789
I wish you safe travels.

286
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,500
Your Royal Highness...

287
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:26,149
Let me get this straight. I was abducted...

288
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,480
to wash off your bad luck.

289
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,889
And if I stay,

290
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,750
They might kill me to keep me silenced.

291
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,190
The young lady of this family wishes to let me go out of pity.

292
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,460
That is correct.

293
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,230
It is like putting out the fire you lit.

294
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:43,329
I hear you,

295
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,338
so please untie me.

296
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:46,799
Before I untie you,

297
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,170
you must keep something in mind.

298
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,410
The only people in this family who can help you...

299
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:56,109
are my lady and me. Do not forget that.

300
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,618
Also, I am nothing but a servant.

301
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:02,519
Do not try to use me as a hostage to get away.

302
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:05,720
Now then, I will untie you.

303
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:38,819
Was he kidnapped from the tavern at the intersection?

304
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,529
- Yes. - Is he truly the Crown Prince?

305
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,630
Is there a possibility it could be someone else?

306
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,859
They waited for him with drugged liquor.

307
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:50,269
But a servant appeared out of nowhere.

308
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,740
They knocked him down and brought him.

309
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,410
It must be the Crown Prince.

310
00:23:59,809 --> 00:24:01,180
How did this happen?

311
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,919
We kidnapped a man to stop the misfortune...

312
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,920
that he was destined to have.

313
00:24:06,349 --> 00:24:09,490
But what will happen if that very man is the Crown Prince himself?

314
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,430
What should we do?

315
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,000
How many hours are left...

316
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,200
before dawn?

317
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:48,119
Good grief.

318
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,710
Why you...

319
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:41,710
Shut your mouth...

320
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:43,379
before I snap your wrist.

321
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,750
It was not intentional.

322
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,279
It was a mistake.

323
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,589
I will snap your wrist if you make another mistake.

324
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:55,828
Then get this blindfold off of me.

325
00:25:55,829 --> 00:25:57,230
That will get you killed.

326
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:07,339
Let us go.

327
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:34,400
You must go over the wall.

328
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:39,900
This is the ladder.

329
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,710
Go up first. Hurry.

330
00:26:52,019 --> 00:26:53,980
- Hurry... - Hurry up, please.

331
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,059
Good grief.

332
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,289
Hurry up, will you?

333
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,930
- Oh, no. - Hold on.

334
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:31,220
Go.

335
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,700
Quiet down.

336
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,279
Who is it?

337
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,980
What?

338
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,650
Who on earth...

339
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:04,890
put this ladder right here?

340
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,720
Goodness.

341
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,670
- Should I go after them? - No need.

342
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:53,769
Either way, the rooster crowed at dawn.

343
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,569
We saved ourselves from disaster.

344
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:00,139
Even so, should we not check if the Crown Prince is all right?

345
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,049
Oh Wol will guide him to a safe place.

346
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,849
Myung Yoon must have told her well.

347
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,390
- Right. - But to be sure,

348
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,859
keep an eye on Myung Yoon.

349
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:13,460
Once Oh Wol returns,

350
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,960
ask her what happened to the Crown Prince.

351
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:17,759
Understood.

352
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,130
Be careful. It is a downhill.

353
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:26,569
There are stairs.

354
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:28,670
Goodness gracious.

355
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:30,640
My gosh.

356
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,410
I cannot go any further.

357
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:35,849
We must make haste.

358
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:40,279
Can you not see the state I am in?

359
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:44,390
You have sturdy wrists with overflowing energy.

360
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,788
Why not carry me on your back?

361
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:48,420
Stop with this trickery.

362
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:49,559
What?

363
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:51,629
What trickery?

364
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,499
I know you are hurt and tired.

365
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,859
But if you do not leave right now,

366
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,569
you will die.

367
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,599
Follow me quietly if you wish to live.

368
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,470
You do not have to threaten me every time.

369
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:05,539
Fine, I will go.

370
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,460
I am trying to save you.

371
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,130
We will arrive in a bit, so hang in there.

372
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,579
Leave her be until morning.

373
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,519
She should take a rest after all this ruckus.

374
00:30:56,259 --> 00:30:59,359
Which way is she coming from?

375
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:01,430
Gosh.

376
00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:07,400
Over here, missy! Over here!

377
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,980
Please wait here.

378
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,539
All right.

379
00:31:19,619 --> 00:31:20,650
Hey.

380
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,390
What in the world is going on?

381
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:27,220
Who is that man, and what is with your outfit?

382
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:39,369
Are you kidding me?

383
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:41,068
I gave you a handsome sum of money.

384
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:43,139
But to bring a donkey and not a horse?

385
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,769
It is stronger than it looks.

386
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:46,339
- I will take it back if you wish. - No.

387
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,180
Get lost after you give me the rein.

388
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,349
Let us get...

389
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:01,720
another drink later. Okay, missy?

390
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,930
I am leaving.

391
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,630
"Drink?"

392
00:32:13,069 --> 00:32:14,069
Come this way.

393
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,980
This is a horse. Get on.

394
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,489
Does that mean I can take the blindfold off?

395
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,549
You cannot.

396
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,160
Then who will lead the horse?

397
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,430
Are you saying you can ride a horse despite being a female servant?

398
00:32:42,069 --> 00:32:44,700
A female servant kidnapper trained to ride a horse?

399
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,839
You must be from one great family.

400
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:04,089
My lord. A message has come from the palace.

401
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:08,619
Are you going to the palace?

402
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,130
Yes. I got word to come at once.

403
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,130
Let me guard you.

404
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,069
No.

405
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,599
As soon as it is morning, bring over Master.

406
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,670
Tell him I have something to ask.

407
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,210
Yes, my lord.

408
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:35,450
(Injeongmun)

409
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,219
Your Highness. It is I, Court Lady Kim.

410
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,030
You may enter.

411
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,570
How did it go?

412
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:10,639
Did you find the Crown Prince?

413
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,210
It looks like the horse has no energy left.

414
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,309
Please get off...

415
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,289
Are you all right?

416
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,530
I want to say that I am all right,

417
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:06,199
but I am not.

418
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,900
Did you hurt your ankle?

419
00:37:22,309 --> 00:37:24,579
Did this happen when you fell down earlier?

420
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,980
Yes.

421
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,920
You should have told me.

422
00:37:35,059 --> 00:37:36,760
You said to stop with the trickery.

423
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,129
You have sturdy wrists with overflowing energy.

424
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:41,058
Why not carry me on your back?

425
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:42,569
Stop with this trickery.

426
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:43,570
What?

427
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,570
What trickery?

428
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,510
I thought you were just faking it.

429
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:03,250
You can go ahead and take off the blindfold now.

430
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:03,079
Why do you look so surprised?

431
00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:04,349
What?

432
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,079
Surprised? No, I am not.

433
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:12,050
You kept threatening me, so I expected you to look like a goblin,

434
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,730
but you are actually quite beautiful.

435
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:19,699
I mean...

436
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:23,530
You are better-looking than I thought you would be.

437
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:29,139
I did not say anything.

438
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,079
If a mere servant looks this fine,

439
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:37,980
how beautiful is the young lady you serve?

440
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:42,150
Is she as beautiful as a fairy or something?

441
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:45,489
Stop talking nonsense.

442
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,659
Are you hurting anywhere else?

443
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,599
Here.

444
00:39:56,969 --> 00:39:57,969
My heart.

445
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,639
Goodness, seriously!

446
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:01,539
Stop joking around.

447
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:04,110
If you are hurting anywhere else, you need to tell me.

448
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,610
I was not joking.

449
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,210
Right here.

450
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,150
It hurts.

451
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,159
My lord!

452
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:34,138
He either has a broken rib...

453
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:35,300
or a hairline fracture.

454
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,809
It must have been extremely painful to ride a horse in this state.

455
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,210
How did he endure the pain?

456
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,360
I thought he was a scholar.

457
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:03,969
Is he a physician?

458
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,210
We do not know what kind of danger the Crown Prince is in now.

459
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:17,809
You still have not found a single trace?

460
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:25,250
What have the palace guards been doing?

461
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,460
What is the Police Bureau up to?

462
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,888
Mobilize the soldiers in training if need be.

463
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:33,129
(Dogamgun: Soldiers in training)

464
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,699
Find the Crown Prince at all costs!

465
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,929
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

466
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:49,709
He must be at the kisaeng house again, just like the last time.

467
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:52,110
I bet he has no idea that we are frantically trying to find him.

468
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,920
Do you not think we are overreacting?

469
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,119
Listen, Magistrate.

470
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:03,759
We are talking about the Crown Prince of this country.

471
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,789
Please...

472
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:06,829
be respectful.

473
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:11,400
All right.

474
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,400
Our priority is to find the Crown Prince.

475
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:16,369
We must hurry.

476
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:56,510
What are you doing?

477
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:00,619
You woke up.

478
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:04,250
I got some medicinal herbs for your wound.

479
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:14,800
By the way, are you a physician?

480
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:16,230
A physician?

481
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:19,369
This is yours, is it not?

482
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:30,650
It must be something important to you, sir.

483
00:43:32,679 --> 00:43:33,679
Yes.

484
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,539
From now on,

485
00:44:03,309 --> 00:44:04,949
do not call me "sir."

486
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,650
Instead, call me "husband."

487
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,518
- Pardon me? - Whether I was kidnapped or not,

488
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:14,420
it is true that your young lady and I spent the night together,

489
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,429
so I am her husband now.

490
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:18,389
Am I wrong?

491
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:20,960
Have you lost your mind?

492
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,530
Such insolence.

493
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,829
Just do it.

494
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:26,769
Say, "husband."

495
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:30,969
Do it, or...

496
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:34,510
I refuse to let you treat me.

497
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:38,480
Fine, well understood.

498
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,849
Sir.

499
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:46,190
- Goodness. - Why you...

500
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:52,659
My gosh.

501
00:44:53,929 --> 00:44:55,058
Depose the Crown Prince?

502
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,868
What do you mean, Grandfather?

503
00:44:56,869 --> 00:44:59,199
Why are you all so surprised?

504
00:45:00,969 --> 00:45:02,768
Many people do not approve of him...

505
00:45:02,769 --> 00:45:04,909
because his late mother came from a family in the Namin Faction.

506
00:45:05,309 --> 00:45:07,538
It has only been a few days since that incident took place,

507
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:08,979
and now this.

508
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,348
So it is only natural that we consider this option, is it not?

509
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:12,849
Even so,

510
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,979
you are out of line, Father.

511
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,690
My goodness. You two are too soft.

512
00:45:18,889 --> 00:45:21,760
Listen carefully, you two.

513
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,559
When he comes into power,

514
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:27,328
you will not be spared for you are second in line to the throne.

515
00:45:27,329 --> 00:45:29,529
Gun will never do such a thing.

516
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:31,570
Never say never.

517
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,339
Take Prince Gwangchang for example. The Queen Dowager's son.

518
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,639
Why did he die?

519
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:40,179
The deposed king was against it at first too.

520
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,480
However, the Namin Faction accused him of treason...

521
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,550
and killed him.

522
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:50,119
Would that have happened if they were real brothers?

523
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:53,019
Just like the deposed king and Prince Gwangchang,

524
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:56,059
you and the Crown Prince...

525
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:00,059
are not real brothers.

526
00:46:01,530 --> 00:46:02,999
I have never once...

527
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,799
treated the two princes any differently.

528
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,440
I know. I am well aware of it.

529
00:46:09,969 --> 00:46:12,980
That is why they get along so well.

530
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:16,349
But even so,

531
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,980
you cannot change the fact that blood is thicker than water.

532
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:25,250
If the Crown Prince ends up ascending the throne,

533
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,519
his maternal family and the Namin Faction will come into power.

534
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,329
And if that were to happen,

535
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:36,129
would they want to spare Prince Dosung?

536
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:37,429
Please, that is enough!

537
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,500
I will pretend I never heard what you said today.

538
00:46:43,909 --> 00:46:45,210
Where are you going?

539
00:46:45,909 --> 00:46:47,840
I must find Gun.

540
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,650
Please excuse me.

541
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:05,289
He is too affectionate for his own good.

542
00:47:06,829 --> 00:47:09,428
Father, do you not think you are overly worried?

543
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:11,099
Perhaps, you are right.

544
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:13,440
However,

545
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:17,409
the family's future depends on this.

546
00:47:17,769 --> 00:47:19,210
Look at the Queen Dowager,

547
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:22,179
who was trapped in the secret garden for over a decade.

548
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:23,780
Who...

549
00:47:24,349 --> 00:47:27,320
can guarantee that the same thing...

550
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,719
will not happen to you down the road?

551
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,529
- Hurry! - This way!

552
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:43,630
Come this way!

553
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,650
Are you sure it was here?

554
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:04,349
Yes.

555
00:48:04,519 --> 00:48:06,619
The bar lady could not see anything for she was tied up,

556
00:48:07,190 --> 00:48:09,219
and you saw nothing because you fainted?

557
00:48:10,489 --> 00:48:12,260
How bizarre.

558
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,768
Search the area again!

559
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:18,800
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

560
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:39,889
Where to now?

561
00:48:40,119 --> 00:48:41,719
- We have arrived. - Pardon me?

562
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,489
Gosh.

563
00:48:52,869 --> 00:48:55,369
Thanks to you, I arrived safe and sound. Thank you.

564
00:48:56,139 --> 00:48:58,610
But this is a dead end.

565
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:01,639
Do not tell me...

566
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:06,349
you will enter the palace.

567
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:08,920
Yes, correct.

568
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:11,948
So you are not just a physician? You work at the Royal Infirmary?

569
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,590
(Naeuiwon: The Royal Infirmary and the physicians who work there)

570
00:49:15,159 --> 00:49:16,659
No, you cannot go.

571
00:49:16,989 --> 00:49:18,030
Why not?

572
00:49:19,929 --> 00:49:23,269
Father will find out right away if he works at the Royal Infirmary.

573
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,539
You are in no state to enter the palace right now.

574
00:49:29,099 --> 00:49:31,940
As a physician, you must know that you have lost quite a bit of blood.

575
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,209
The jagged end of the broken rib could punch a hole in your organs.

576
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:35,679
If that happens, it will be dangerous.

577
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:38,308
You should go home and get some rest to recuperate.

578
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:39,309
(Jeongyang: To relax and rest physically and mentally)

579
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:41,618
I can receive treatment at the Royal Infirmary, so do not worry.

580
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:44,349
I am saying this because you must not go to the Royal Infirmary.

581
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:48,360
What do you mean I must not go to the Royal Infirmary?

582
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:52,530
In any case, bad things could happen if you entered the palace now.

583
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:54,658
I suggest you just go home.

584
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,130
I will take you home.

585
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,030
I appreciate your concern,

586
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:01,069
but there is something I must do in the palace.

587
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:03,868
It is not like you must do it today.

588
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:05,739
Get your wound treated first and...

589
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:08,340
You really are acting strange.

590
00:50:10,650 --> 00:50:13,650
Are you hiding something from me?

591
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:21,289
Fine. Whatever it is, I suppose you cannot tell me.

592
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,760
Anyway, I shall go inside now.

593
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:26,289
You should leave.

594
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,429
- Sir. - Again!

595
00:50:29,829 --> 00:50:30,900
"Husband."

596
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:38,340
If...

597
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,280
something happens, come back here.

598
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,349
I will be waiting.

599
00:50:43,579 --> 00:50:44,610
What could happen?

600
00:50:46,849 --> 00:50:48,780
What do you mean?

601
00:50:49,019 --> 00:50:52,090
I am telling you this just in case, so do not forget what I said.

602
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,730
Stop... Your Royal Highness.

603
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,530
I see you are working hard.

604
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:07,799
I am sorry to bother you, but I am not feeling too well.

605
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,968
Could you help me?

606
00:51:08,969 --> 00:51:10,070
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

607
00:51:10,909 --> 00:51:13,739
Go and tell everyone that His Royal Highness is back.

608
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:15,280
Yes, sir.

609
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:27,559
The Crown Prince...

610
00:51:28,489 --> 00:51:30,289
I was told to...

611
00:51:38,369 --> 00:51:40,940
Your Highness. It is I, Court Lady Kim.

612
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:48,679
What is the matter?

613
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,849
The Crown Prince has returned.

614
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:52,980
Your Highness.

615
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,449
If His Majesty finds out,

616
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,650
there really is no way going back.

617
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:03,789
Your Highness!

618
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:13,840
Let us go to the Main Hall.

619
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:23,110
Why are you suddenly telling me to give up on the Crown Prince?

620
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,510
What do you mean?

621
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,750
He is a criminal who saw something he should not have seen...

622
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:30,789
and found out something he should have never known.

623
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,559
Ask no more.

624
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,920
Just do as I say.

625
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:40,329
I am the King of this country.

626
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:43,969
I know you are the Queen Dowager, but you are out of line.

627
00:52:44,429 --> 00:52:45,469
Your Majesty.

628
00:52:45,869 --> 00:52:48,300
I was the one who put you on the throne,

629
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,610
so I can also drag you down.

630
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:53,380
Never forget that.

631
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,550
I am indebted to you, so I will pretend I never heard any of this.

632
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,280
Now, leave.

633
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:10,288
Head Eunuch, are you there?

634
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:12,820
(Sangseon: Head Eunuch)

635
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:16,659
Is there anyone outside?

636
00:54:30,739 --> 00:54:31,809
The deposed king.

637
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,710
Do you know what I did during the ten years...

638
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,710
when I was locked up in the garden...

639
00:54:39,349 --> 00:54:41,219
because of that despicable scoundrel?

640
00:54:43,219 --> 00:54:44,650
I won every single person in the palace...

641
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:46,789
over to my side.

642
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:49,888
When I came across anyone who did not support me,

643
00:54:49,889 --> 00:54:52,260
I listed whatever excuses I could come up with...

644
00:54:52,829 --> 00:54:54,730
and replaced them with those who supported me,

645
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:59,500
focusing single-mindedly on my plan to get back at the deposed king.

646
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,110
Do you know what I did after that?

647
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:07,779
I had the Royal Chef...

648
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,440
(Daeryeongsuksu: Royal Chef)

649
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:10,849
feed opium...

650
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,150
to the deposed king, little by little.

651
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:18,550
Gradually, it worsened his madness.

652
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,519
Initially, I considered...

653
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,159
using poison if opium did not work,

654
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:26,699
but it was not necessary.

655
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,769
I cannot believe this.

656
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,869
Head Eunuch, are you there?

657
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,099
Yes, Your Highness.

658
00:55:45,110 --> 00:55:46,650
Head Court Lady, are you outside?

659
00:55:47,050 --> 00:55:48,619
Yes, Your Highness.

660
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,320
Royal Chef and Royal Taster, are you there too?

661
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,630
- Yes, Your Highness. - Yes, Your Highness.

662
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:10,969
As of now, you are to keep an eye on everything the King does...

663
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:13,139
and report to me.

664
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,710
- Yes, Your Highness. - Yes, Your Highness.

665
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,719
You are all dismissed.

666
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:26,590
- Yes, Your Highness. - Yes, Your Highness.

667
00:56:36,329 --> 00:56:38,099
Now, you believe me, right?

668
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:55,320
You must choose.

669
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:58,489
Is it the Crown Prince...

670
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:01,159
or the throne?

671
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:04,659
Must you do this?

672
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:07,059
All you have to do is give up on the Crown Prince.

673
00:57:08,699 --> 00:57:11,170
After all, he is not your only son.

674
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,300
You have another son.

675
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,769
Let me ask you one last time.

676
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,039
Is it the throne...

677
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:23,139
or the Crown Prince?

678
00:57:32,349 --> 00:57:33,789
Give me some time to think.

679
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:37,860
Sure. However,

680
00:57:38,929 --> 00:57:40,500
I cannot wait too long.

681
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:08,689
Are you not ashamed?

682
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:10,018
Watch what you say.

683
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:11,429
Do you believe that killing me...

684
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:14,928
will keep your dirty hidden affair from surfacing?

685
00:58:14,929 --> 00:58:16,559
If that is not enough,

686
00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:19,400
I will kill anyone and everyone who knows...

687
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:21,469
about the secret.

688
00:58:23,539 --> 00:58:24,610
What?

689
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:26,980
Do you not think I can do it?

690
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,340
The deposed king only kept disloyal vassals by his side,

691
00:58:30,179 --> 00:58:32,050
so I thought he was a bad judge of character.

692
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:35,320
But I suppose he was right about you, after all.

693
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,988
The truth is, Prince Gwangchang...

694
00:58:37,989 --> 00:58:40,118
had the filthy blood of your secret lover...

695
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:41,320
Shut your mouth.

696
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:45,429
It looks like you truly wish to get killed.

697
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,829
You are going to kill me anyway. Am I wrong?

698
00:58:49,929 --> 00:58:52,130
I warned you several times to watch your mouth.

699
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,639
Do not forget.

700
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,369
The lives of the King, the Queen,

701
00:58:58,909 --> 00:59:01,409
and Prince Dosung depend on what comes out of your mouth.

702
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:29,800
What a devious, despicable monster.

703
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,980
What are you planning to do?

704
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:51,730
First,

705
00:59:52,429 --> 00:59:53,829
before the Queen Dowager finds out,

706
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:58,030
we should find the owner of the acupuncture needle canister.

707
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:04,039
The man she had an affair with must be her weakness,

708
01:00:05,239 --> 01:00:08,409
seeing how she is desperately trying to conceal it.

709
01:00:10,179 --> 01:00:12,409
However, I cannot trust anyone in the palace.

710
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:14,780
Who knows what she would do if we made a reckless move,

711
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,820
and if she found out about it?

712
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,590
What about Royal Physician Choi?

713
01:00:23,659 --> 01:00:24,789
I am not sure.

714
01:00:25,929 --> 01:00:28,300
I can trust his character and capabilities,

715
01:00:29,030 --> 01:00:31,369
but I am not certain if he will be on my side.

716
01:00:32,699 --> 01:00:35,070
Promise him that his daughter can marry me,

717
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:38,239
and he will side with us.

718
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:41,309
The Queen Dowager could ruin that plan.

719
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,380
But to find the owner of the acupuncture needle canister,

720
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:48,150
we really need his help,

721
01:00:50,449 --> 01:00:52,389
so I will try to find out what he is thinking.

722
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:53,519
Be careful.

723
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:58,159
You must be very careful.

724
01:00:58,329 --> 01:01:00,190
I will summon him, using my treatment as an excuse,

725
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:03,530
so the Queen Dowager will not suspect us.

726
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,380
I am relieved you did not suffer a serious injury, Your Highness.

727
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:17,849
I am sorry. I should have been careful.

728
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,989
I am sure there was an understandable reason.

729
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:28,760
Are you already taking my side for I will be your son-in-law?

730
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:32,130
No, it is not that.

731
01:01:33,659 --> 01:01:35,199
Your daughter is keeping well, right?

732
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:39,099
Yes.

733
01:01:39,269 --> 01:01:42,800
The person I trust and respect the most in this palace...

734
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,670
will become my father-in-law.

735
01:01:45,469 --> 01:01:46,869
It truly delights me.

736
01:01:47,039 --> 01:01:50,579
Thank you for your kind words. I am much obliged,

737
01:01:50,849 --> 01:01:51,909
Your Royal Highness.

738
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,050
That said...

739
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:02,889
Do you happen to know anything about this acupuncture needle canister?

740
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:08,030
I gave this out to the physicians at the Royal Infirmary.

741
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:09,960
Where did you get it?

742
01:02:10,469 --> 01:02:12,099
I came into possession of it by chance.

743
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,170
Anyway,

744
01:02:15,369 --> 01:02:17,269
I wish to find the owner of this canister.

745
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:21,409
Would you be able to help me?

746
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,710
I gave the same canister to many physicians.

747
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:28,650
First, I will go to the Royal Infirmary...

748
01:02:29,019 --> 01:02:31,989
and find out if anyone there had misplaced it.

749
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:33,960
I will tell you the reason later.

750
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:35,920
Please look into it discreetly.

751
01:02:36,289 --> 01:02:39,460
Yes, I will.

752
01:02:54,510 --> 01:02:57,179
Are you not feeling well?

753
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:03,079
I am fine. If there is anything even slightly wrong with His Highness,

754
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:06,518
send a messenger to the Royal Infirmary at once, okay?

755
01:03:06,519 --> 01:03:08,260
Yes, please put your worries to rest.

756
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:28,110
What will the King decide to do?

757
01:03:31,949 --> 01:03:35,179
He will choose to give up on the Crown Prince.

758
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,289
If he chooses to protect the Crown Prince,

759
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:42,659
he will lose too many things.

760
01:03:56,539 --> 01:03:59,340
Your Royal Highness, are you asleep?

761
01:04:03,179 --> 01:04:04,250
Who is it?

762
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:06,050
It is I, Head Eunuch.

763
01:04:06,579 --> 01:04:07,679
What is the matter?

764
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,119
His Majesty is asking for Your Royal Highness.

765
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,219
At this late hour?

766
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:17,929
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

767
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:22,699
I will get dressed. Give me a moment.

768
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:36,679
I told you to wait.

769
01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:41,820
I will give you a hand.

770
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:02,539
Did my father order you...

771
01:05:04,539 --> 01:05:05,809
to kill me?

772
01:05:28,429 --> 01:05:30,159
Your Royal Highness.

773
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:32,599
Your Royal Highness.

774
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,500
Your Royal Highness.

775
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,159
What is this place?

776
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:06,500
Come inside, Your Royal Highness. You must hide at once.

777
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,409
Please forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

778
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,460
(Missing Crown Prince)

779
01:08:17,029 --> 01:08:19,229
I must leave the palace.

780
01:08:19,569 --> 01:08:21,300
I cannot trust anyone.

781
01:08:21,539 --> 01:08:23,898
Find the Crown Prince before the King does.

782
01:08:23,899 --> 01:08:26,470
Move ahead with it, at once.

783
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:28,408
I will find you, no matter what.

784
01:08:28,409 --> 01:08:30,179
Hand over the Crown Prince.

785
01:08:30,180 --> 01:08:31,709
Is the Crown Prince alive?

786
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:33,978
You know it all depends on how you behave yourself.

787
01:08:33,979 --> 01:08:35,219
Give up on the Crown Prince,

788
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:37,278
and everything will go back to how it was.

789
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,819
Are they trying to take this...

790
01:08:38,949 --> 01:08:41,358
as an opportunity to oust the Crown Prince?

791
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:42,818
He lost too much blood.

792
01:08:42,819 --> 01:08:45,029
If we stall here, he certainly will not make it.
