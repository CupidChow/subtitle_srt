Father.

13
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,630
Gun.

14
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:05,799
Gun.

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,239
It is I,

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,109
Gun.

17
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,469
You have been through so much.

18
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:39,969
No.

19
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,709
Your Majesty.

20
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,510
There may be some eyes watching,

21
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:47,280
so please go inside.

22
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,250
Let us go inside.

23
00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:08,870
Commander.

24
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:12,000
Is it okay for His Majesty to step out of the palace like this?

25
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:15,239
If they find out...

26
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,979
I already took care of them, so you need not be concerned.

27
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,180
(Episode 17)

28
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:46,599
How...

29
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,810
are you feeling?

30
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:53,280
I have regained consciousness, thanks to you. So do not worry.

31
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:58,349
Lady Myung Yoon who is outside is the one who treated you, not I.

32
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,550
The truth is,

33
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,489
her father is...

34
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,689
I am aware that she is Choi Sang Rok's daughter.

35
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,530
Even though I could not move my body,

36
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,229
I could still hear.

37
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,699
But I...

38
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,069
There is nothing more I can do.

39
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:25,909
Please help me.

40
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,080
Father, please wake up.

41
00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:34,050
Open your eyes, Father!

42
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:38,659
It is almost over.

43
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,629
Please...

44
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,129
hang in there just a little longer, Father.

45
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,300
Did you also hear me and Dosung fight?

46
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,530
All of it?

47
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,610
Why will you not answer me?

48
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,509
Do you not consider me as family?

49
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,610
You disregarded me...

50
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,810
as your family first.

51
00:03:59,939 --> 00:04:01,180
Do not be unreasonable.

52
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,619
I have never thought that way.

53
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,879
Then how could you...

54
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,250
have taken a liking to the woman your brother almost married?

55
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,660
- I am sorry. - Do not be sorry.

56
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,459
I know how much you have struggled.

57
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,100
The Head Eunuch and the Royal Guard Commander told me everything.

58
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,370
I am much obliged.

59
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:28,040
I am sorry to ask you this,

60
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,139
but I...

61
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,540
have a favor to ask of you.

62
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,579
- Lady Myung Yoon... - Do not worry.

63
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:43,149
I also know that she saved me,

64
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,589
so she will not be punished.

65
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,759
Thank you for your boundless generosity.

66
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,930
We should let Dosung...

67
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,930
and Mother know that you have fully recovered.

68
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,240
No, we should not.

69
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,639
As you know, they are surrounded by our enemy at the moment.

70
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,810
- However... - Have you forgotten already?

71
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,610
How did the Chief Royal Secretary die?

72
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,819
To deceive your enemy, you must deceive your allies first.

73
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,089
This time, you must not make a single mistake. Do you understand?

74
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,319
Yes, Father.

75
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,959
I heard you had been meeting with those in the Namin Faction.

76
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:25,660
They are enraged by what happened to my maternal grandfather.

77
00:05:26,129 --> 00:05:27,829
So I have persuaded them to prepare a petition...

78
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,699
to impeach Yoon Yi Kyum and Choi Sang Rok.

79
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,869
I must meet them.

80
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:34,809
(Maninso: A petition signed by 10,000 people)

81
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,839
Are you planning...

82
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:39,338
to hand over the reins to them?

83
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,448
(Hwanguk: To change the dominant faction in court)

84
00:05:43,449 --> 00:05:45,180
I must replace the Seoin Faction in the royal court...

85
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,720
with the Namin Faction.

86
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:51,689
However, some members of the Namin Faction...

87
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,128
might still be loyal to the deposed King.

88
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:57,230
I am willing to take such a risk...

89
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:01,269
to oust the Queen Dowager and the Left State Councilor.

90
00:06:16,149 --> 00:06:17,779
Are you concerned because of Prince Susung?

91
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:22,250
We really are almost there.

92
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,388
Once Prince Dosung becomes Crown Prince,

93
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:25,720
he should ascend the throne right away.

94
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,659
Then we shall leave to the temporary palace in Anju.

95
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,028
(Yangwi: To hand over the throne)

96
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:30,089
As for Myung Yoon,

97
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:34,970
can we trust that Prince Dosung will keep her safe?

98
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,870
We have no choice but to trust that he will do so.

99
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,870
What about the Queen Dowager?

100
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,040
What do you plan to do with her?

101
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:47,779
We have come too far for her to be forgiven.

102
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,779
Tonight...

103
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,318
Father.

104
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,060
I am fine. Do not worry.

105
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,689
But...

106
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,389
Tonight,

107
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,730
I need you to come with me.

108
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,199
I plan to call the Tiger Hunters to the palace...

109
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,739
to take them down.

110
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,338
(Tiger Hunters: A special army unit whose main task is to catch tigers)

111
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:15,509
The Tiger Hunters...

112
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,708
must be in Paju now.

113
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:18,709
Correct.

114
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:21,079
They are there to guard the military horse farm in Paju.

115
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:22,879
We will go there and meet them.

116
00:07:23,079 --> 00:07:24,120
No, you should not go there.

117
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,920
If you write them a letter, I will go there and deliver it to them.

118
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,620
The Tiger Hunters must think that I am still bedridden.

119
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,459
They will not believe that the letter is from me.

120
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,259
I should meet them in person. Only then will they believe me.

121
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,529
However,

122
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,470
I am concerned that the long journey would take a toll on your health.

123
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,980
How is he?

124
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,220
His pulse is a little unstable, but it is not worrisome.

125
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,759
Are we good now?

126
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,959
However, Your Majesty,

127
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,529
you have not fully recovered yet,

128
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,000
so I suggest you be very careful for the time being.

129
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:19,300
Please trust me and let me take care of it.

130
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:22,970
I would be too concerned if you were to go there yourself.

131
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,379
If you are that concerned,

132
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,180
this young lady here...

133
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,279
can accompany us.

134
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,720
Would you...

135
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,389
come with us?

136
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,399
Yes, Your Majesty.

137
00:08:46,129 --> 00:08:47,399
See? Did you hear that?

138
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:50,369
We have this physician who knows my condition very well,

139
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,570
so what are you worried about?

140
00:08:53,539 --> 00:08:54,970
Hurry up and get ready to leave.

141
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,668
Your Majesty.

142
00:09:21,669 --> 00:09:22,799
Father.

143
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,750
His Majesty is not doing well.

144
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:39,220
Then what should we do?

145
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,220
Would acupuncture help?

146
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,549
At the moment, no.

147
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,690
His Majesty needs absolute rest now.

148
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:48,529
No.

149
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:51,629
The Tiger Hunters will soon leave Paju.

150
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,970
- We must meet them before that. - However...

151
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,870
If I give up now,

152
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,570
I will have to return to my bedchamber...

153
00:10:02,309 --> 00:10:04,080
and continue to live as if I am dead.

154
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:06,740
Even though I could hear everything...

155
00:10:07,549 --> 00:10:09,580
and knew everything that was going on,

156
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,750
I could not even move a finger.

157
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,019
If I must return to living in such misery,

158
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,019
I would rather...

159
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:22,690
choose to die.

160
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:27,769
I am an unfilial son...

161
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,639
for I failed to protect you, Father.

162
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:34,539
Please forgive me, Father.

163
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,309
I heard you sent a letter to the Tiger Hunters.

164
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:43,580
Once Prince Dosung is officially installed as Crown Prince,

165
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,080
the Left State Councilor will try to get rid of us,

166
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:49,419
so we need a weapon to fight against him.

167
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,459
But will the Tiger Hunters obey us without resisting?

168
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,460
The Commander of the Tiger Hunters has no interest in politics.

169
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,289
He is a typical military official.

170
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:59,399
If he sees that the letter is stamped with the royal seal,

171
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,500
he will obey us without questioning.

172
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,440
I wrote this for we could not afford to waste a single moment,

173
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:11,610
but the King's secret letter devoid of the royal seal?

174
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:22,049
You should...

175
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,220
take this.

176
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:33,029
I will do my very best,

177
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,470
so please trust me and wait.

178
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,169
Gun.

179
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,009
You must be very careful, at all times.

180
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,279
I will, Father.

181
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,970
Go and help His Royal Highness.

182
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,840
My lady, I am...

183
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,110
As you are aware,

184
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:22,149
the Royal Guard Commander is here.

185
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:27,220
Please do it for me.

186
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,419
Go with His Royal Highness and help him.

187
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,980
I would like to speak with you about something.

188
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,419
Come up here.

189
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:04,789
Yes, Your Majesty.

190
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,389
The universe is cruel.

191
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,200
Why is it that someone like you...

192
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,370
had to be born as Choi Sang Rok's daughter?

193
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,600
It must be over there.

194
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,740
Stop!

195
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,580
I see some guards.

196
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,580
- Are you the Tiger Hunters? - Yes, we are.

197
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:37,980
- Identify yourselves! - He is Prince Susung.

198
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,720
Be respectful!

199
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:49,830
I was told that His Majesty was still critically ill.

200
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:52,200
He is hiding it because of the traitors,

201
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:53,899
but he has recovered.

202
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:05,210
It is my father's topknot crown.

203
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:07,209
(Sangtugwan: A topknot crown used by men)

204
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,449
Do you believe me now?

205
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,418
(Sangtugwan: A topknot crown used by men)

206
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:14,250
This is not a matter I can decide on my own, so just one moment.

207
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,220
Please give me a moment.

208
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:25,600
If His Majesty has truly recovered,

209
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:28,600
he would issue a royal order instead of sending a letter in secret.

210
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:32,600
You must think very carefully about this.

211
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,969
If things go wrong because we trusted Prince Susung...

212
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,539
and made a move without the mobilization tag,

213
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:39,239
we may all be accused of treason and die, like Master Moonhyung.

214
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,350
(Balbyeongbu: An army mobilization tag)

215
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,519
Your Royal Highness.

216
00:15:47,549 --> 00:15:49,320
Something must be up. Do you not think so?

217
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,620
I feel like they are hiding something...

218
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,690
You must not kill anyone.

219
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,369
What are you waiting for?

220
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:12,139
Get into Hopojin!

221
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,140
(Hopojin: A formation used to besiege a tiger)

222
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:19,980
(Hopojin: A formation used to besiege a tiger)

223
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,420
Such insolence.

224
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:27,920
This is Prince Susung. Step back at once!

225
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,589
If His Majesty finds out about this,

226
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:33,259
you will all be punished for high treason.

227
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,799
We are simply following the Queen Dowager's order!

228
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,329
Do not be afraid!

229
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,630
Did the Queen Dowager...

230
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,839
order you to do this?

231
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:47,339
Yes.

232
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:49,269
We received a letter from the Queen Dowager.

233
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,240
However, I must proceed with caution to issue a military command,

234
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,209
so I will not believe anyone's letter...

235
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,079
and will not budge without the official mobilization tag.

236
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,849
Cast the net and capture them!

237
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:04,859
Stop!

238
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:29,579
Please accept my greetings, Your Majesty!

239
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:39,660
Listen, Tiger Hunters.

240
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:41,730
- Yes, Your Majesty! - Yes, Your Majesty!

241
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,559
The palace is ruled by traitors,

242
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:47,130
who are leading this nation to chaos.

243
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:51,369
Will you help me take down the traitors...

244
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:54,569
to ensure the safety and security of our country?

245
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:56,269
- Yes, Your Majesty! - Yes, Your Majesty!

246
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:57,880
All rise.

247
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,250
From now on,

248
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,349
I shall call you my Loyal Army.

249
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:12,889
Long live the King!

250
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:14,930
- Long live the King! - Long live the King!

251
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:16,758
- Long live the King! - Long live the King!

252
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:18,528
Long live the King!

253
00:19:18,529 --> 00:19:20,660
- Long live the King! - Long live the King!

254
00:19:20,829 --> 00:19:22,400
- Long live the King! - Long live the King!

255
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:24,569
Long live the King!

256
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,640
- Long live the King! - Long live the King!

257
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,509
- Long live the King! - Long live the King!

258
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,609
Long live the King!

259
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,579
- Long live the King! - Long live the King!

260
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:33,980
- Long live the King! - Long live the King!

261
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,049
Your Majesty.

262
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,289
I can tolerate this, so do not be concerned.

263
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,690
Your Majesty.

264
00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:50,460
I will be right by Your Majesty's side at all times,

265
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,900
so please call me whenever you need me.

266
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:54,259
I will.

267
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,539
Royal Guard Commander.

268
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,910
Watch out for military officials who try to enter the main palace.

269
00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:03,809
Yes, Your Majesty.

270
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,930
Before they make a move,

271
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:29,430
I need you...

272
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,500
to kill the King.

273
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,410
The King must die...

274
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,740
for Prince Dosung to ascend the throne.

275
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,049
If you...

276
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,589
take good care of this,

277
00:20:48,849 --> 00:20:50,519
you will be the next in line...

278
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:52,289
to be the head court lady.

279
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:56,660
Thank you for the offer,

280
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,858
but how could I enter His Majesty's palace and...

281
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:00,930
Goodness.

282
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:05,839
You serve the Queen,

283
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,410
who can enter the King's palace anytime.

284
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,880
We will figure out a way.

285
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,579
Just do as you are told.

286
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:37,069
She may not be clever,

287
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:39,200
but that witch is surely shrewd.

288
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,539
She may cause trouble for us down the road,

289
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:45,440
so once she finishes the job and becomes useless,

290
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,609
we will get rid of her.

291
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:58,119
Leave, all of you.

292
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,589
Have you lost your mind?

293
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,159
Do you wish to tell everyone in the palace...

294
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,269
that you are in league with the Queen Dowager and her supporters?

295
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,500
Oh, right.

296
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:15,769
I forgot for a moment that you bit your own master like a crazy dog.

297
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,539
How dare you glare at me like that?

298
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,109
Shall I gouge out your eyeballs?

299
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,979
I am here to speak with the Queen Dowager about an urgent matter.

300
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,289
You cannot speak with her now.

301
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,890
You are to tell me what it is about and leave at once.

302
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,359
I must tell her myself.

303
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,430
We kindly accepted you back because you begged us to spare you.

304
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,660
And now, you want to sit on my head.

305
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:44,940
Do not be delusional.

306
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,769
You are nothing but a spy rat.

307
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:50,440
Whether I am a rat or whatever else,

308
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,750
I am certain they accepted me back for they still needed me.

309
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:07,160
Please spare me.

310
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,529
Ever since the incident with the royal taster broke out,

311
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,900
I have had to fear for my life every single moment.

312
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:14,769
What are you talking about, all of a sudden?

313
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,970
The Left State Councilor never spares those...

314
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:24,509
who are done being useful or who know too much, like me.

315
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,450
And what is the reason you think I would be different?

316
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,349
I would never run my mouth...

317
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,289
for I do not know that much,

318
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:40,319
but I am certain that you will find me useful.

319
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:45,960
I will be in touch soon.

320
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,269
Leave now.

321
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,730
Yes, my lord.

322
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,240
Your Majesty.

323
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,680
Court Lady Cho is here.

324
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,910
What brings you here?

325
00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:09,289
The Left State Councilor is planning to assassinate His Majesty.

326
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,089
He gave me this and ordered me to feed it to His Majesty.

327
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,740
What is Court Lady Cho doing here?

328
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:03,910
Your Highness!

329
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,078
- What is the fuss about? - I swear, she visited...

330
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,410
the Queen Dowager's Palace.

331
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,519
I saw her coming out...

332
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:14,720
of the Queen Dowager's Palace with my own two eyes.

333
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:15,920
The Queen Dowager's Palace?

334
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,588
What are you talking about, all of a sudden?

335
00:25:18,589 --> 00:25:19,720
That sly witch,

336
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:21,759
Court Lady Cho.

337
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:24,900
I saw her leaving the Queen Dowager's Palace.

338
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,630
Are you saying Cheol Du is working for Choi Sang Rok?

339
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,970
It is possible that it is not Cheol Du.

340
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:33,069
However, if what Lady Myung Yoon read is true,

341
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:35,969
and if the spy is one of your closest aides...

342
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,538
In other words, the traitor was not me.

343
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:40,339
- Court Lady Cho, that little... - Be quiet!

344
00:25:42,349 --> 00:25:43,980
Bring Court Lady Cho to me now.

345
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:45,619
Yes, Your Highness.

346
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:50,950
Sit down.

347
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,539
I told you I would kill you with my own hands...

348
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,910
if you misbehaved one more time. Do you remember?

349
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:14,380
- Yes, Your Highness. - Then let me ask you this.

350
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,549
Why did you visit the Queen Dowager's Palace?

351
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:19,979
- Pardon me? - Did you go there...

352
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,279
to deliver someone's letter in secret?

353
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:23,650
Or did you go there to pick up a letter?

354
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:26,220
No, neither is true.

355
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:27,289
Is that so?

356
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:30,430
Go ahead and search her.

357
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,589
Yes, Your Highness.

358
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,599
I suggest you stay still for your own sake.

359
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,400
- Okay? - My gosh!

360
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,200
What are you doing? Get your hand off of me!

361
00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:45,109
I knew it.

362
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:46,839
Your Highness.

363
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:52,049
What is this for?

364
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:54,779
Tell me the truth at once!

365
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,619
Fine. I shall make you take this and find out.

366
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,829
- Hold her! - Yes, Your Highness!

367
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,630
Come here.

368
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,500
It is poison!

369
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,369
It is poison.

370
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,640
Where did you get this?

371
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:20,980
Did Inspector General Choi give you this?

372
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:24,549
Right, you will say you do not know.

373
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,279
Yes!

374
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,619
Inspector General Choi gave it to me.

375
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,089
To kill whom?

376
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:38,500
My brother?

377
00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:41,200
Did he order you to kill my brother?

378
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,210
Stay still!

379
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,869
I will ask you for one last time.

380
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,710
Did he order you to kill my brother with this poison?

381
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,180
Yes, he did.

382
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:01,650
He ordered me to kill Prince Susung.

383
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:09,230
I did not know Yoon Yi Kyum would make a move so quickly.

384
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,259
- What should we do now? - We must stop him.

385
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,259
What if we fail?

386
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,200
If the King dies,

387
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:18,329
we will be his next target.

388
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,369
Are you afraid of death?

389
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,339
- Sang Rok. - Do not be afraid.

390
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,750
I told you I would never let you die...

391
00:28:30,349 --> 00:28:32,680
even if they were to hang my head above the main street.

392
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:36,690
It has been a long time since I stopped fearing death.

393
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:40,259
What I fear the most...

394
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,829
is losing you.

395
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:45,460
Nothing else.

396
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:51,298
If we fail to stop his plan to kill the King...

397
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:52,599
I will stop him.

398
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,000
If I were in the dark, it would be different.

399
00:28:55,509 --> 00:28:57,470
But now that I know about his plan, I can surely stop him.

400
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:59,740
I assure you that I can stop him,

401
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:02,509
so just trust me.

402
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,559
Have the Tiger Hunters arrived?

403
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:19,059
Yes.

404
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,868
They must have begun the operation by now.

405
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:22,970
(Chakhogapsa: Soldiers who catch tigers)

406
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:44,549
The Tiger Hunters must be here.

407
00:29:44,589 --> 00:29:46,089
Go outside and check.

408
00:29:46,289 --> 00:29:47,359
Yes, Your Majesty.

409
00:29:55,869 --> 00:29:57,529
If the tiger is released in the garden,

410
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,440
someone could get hurt.

411
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,170
Do not worry, Your Royal Highness.

412
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:04,539
We fed it well and pulled out its teeth and claws,

413
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,880
so no one will get hurt.

414
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:11,109
Can you find the scoundrels who killed Master Moonhyung...

415
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,079
before our D-Day?

416
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,450
Do not worry.

417
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:18,789
One of Lady Myung Yoon's acquaintances is well-connected.

418
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:21,160
We will find them very soon.

419
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,690
Magistrate Yoon acts...

420
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,630
as eyes and ears for Choi Sang Rok and the Left State Councilor.

421
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:30,400
We must get him for our plan to succeed.

422
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,170
Yes, I will remember that.

423
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:36,039
Your Royal Highness. It is I, Sun Ok.

424
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:45,349
What is it?

425
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,589
Are you refusing to let me in the house now?

426
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,430
I do not know why you are here...

427
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,029
Allow me to go inside. Let us talk in private.

428
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:07,339
I have nothing more to say to you.

429
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:09,170
Go back.

430
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:13,339
Never had I imagined you would drive me out even before the door.

431
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,509
They say you must deceive your allies before deceiving your enemy.

432
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,019
There must be no mistakes this time. Understood?

433
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,259
Take care on your way back.

434
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,630
Leave tomorrow and go far away.

435
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,500
If you stay here, you will die.

436
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,630
The Inspector General and Court Lady Cho...

437
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,420
What happened?

438
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,029
I will call once it is time.

439
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,900
Until then, stay well.

440
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,640
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

441
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
Your Majesty!

442
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,019
I am all right.

443
00:33:00,549 --> 00:33:02,119
I have simply used too much energy.

444
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,789
It made me dizzy.

445
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,859
I will ask Choi Sang Rok's daughter to come.

446
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,109
Your Majesty. By any chance, did...

447
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,690
Your Majesty?

448
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:41,559
If I do not go,

449
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,589
the Crown Prince might fall into danger.

450
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,869
Is there no solution?

451
00:33:52,269 --> 00:33:53,339
There...

452
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,170
is one.

453
00:33:57,309 --> 00:33:58,609
And what is that?

454
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,489
I heard a tiger had appeared in the garden.

455
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,198
To stop the tiger from causing harm, I plan to call over Tiger Hunters.

456
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,299
(Hohwan: Catastrophes caused by a tiger)

457
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,400
What do you all think?

458
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,768
Tiger Hunters have left to catch the tiger...

459
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:33,309
that attacked Majang in Paju.

460
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:38,780
The palace soldiers are more than enough to guard the palace.

461
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,989
I think it is only right to let the palace soldiers handle it.

462
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,019
The palace soldiers have never dealt with a tiger, have they?

463
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:49,460
And the tiger that attacked Majang has already been caught.

464
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:51,960
Calling the Tiger Hunters at once...

465
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,030
and preventing any damage is better, no?

466
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:57,000
Your Majesty is right.

467
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,869
If the tiger jumps over the gates and attacks the private houses,

468
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,309
the people will suffer great damage.

469
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,239
I agree with the Deputy Education Director.

470
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,979
Tiger Hunters should be ordered to come at once...

471
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,809
to prevent disasters caused by the tiger.

472
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:16,219
Inspector General. Send a messenger to Paju this instant...

473
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,619
to bring the Tiger Hunters over to prevent any catastrophe.

474
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:22,590
Yes, Your Majesty.

475
00:35:41,179 --> 00:35:42,179
Your Majesty.

476
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:45,579
The Queen Dowager ordered the Tiger Hunters to come to the palace.

477
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,750
Inform the leader of the Tiger Hunters...

478
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:51,989
to be extra careful.

479
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

480
00:35:58,059 --> 00:35:59,099
Missy.

481
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:02,969
This man here saw those guys at the Police Bureau jail.

482
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,500
Tell her.

483
00:36:04,501 --> 00:36:07,940
Yes. I was imprisoned with them at the Police Bureau prison.

484
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:11,339
They boasted on and on about the powerful people behind them.

485
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,739
I was dying to beat them up but held back, which was...

486
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:16,849
Enough.

487
00:36:17,949 --> 00:36:19,250
Do you know where they are right now?

488
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,119
Come over here.

489
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:27,789
Good grief.

490
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,360
Really.

491
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,960
This is what you need, right?

492
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,059
- My gosh. - Let us enjoy ourselves today!

493
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:38,469
- What? - What?

494
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,400
Who are you?

495
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,409
How did you know I was here?

496
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,179
And who is that guy over there?

497
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:50,679
He is the big brother I had mentioned before.

498
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:52,109
I see.

499
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,880
Hey. Forget it.

500
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,090
I cannot believe these men are all over these uglies.

501
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:00,618
They are too unclassy for me to hang out with. Let us go.

502
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:02,058
- Hurry. - Come now.

503
00:37:02,059 --> 00:37:03,388
- Let us go. - Listen.

504
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:06,630
It is simply because they do not know any better.

505
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,829
The most beautiful girl in Hanyang is in this very kisaeng house.

506
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,900
- Did you not know? - What?

507
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,829
I have had enough.

508
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,158
Take that cotton mask off.

509
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,469
I want to see your face.

510
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,969
Is 100 nyang enough?

511
00:37:49,269 --> 00:37:50,539
Goodness gracious.

512
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:53,780
She does not show her face to just anyone.

513
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,979
Then how much should I pay?

514
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,249
I told you, did I not? It is not money.

515
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:01,480
She will only show her face to the man who pleases her heart.

516
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:05,489
Someone like the head of a bandit killing people of high status.

517
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,159
"A bandit killing people of high status?"

518
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,289
Her parents were killed by noblemen when she was little.

519
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,329
Noblemen fill her with rage.

520
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,630
Bring her the head of a high-status nobleman,

521
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,969
and she might even spend the night with you.

522
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,239
Should I bring her one head? Then I could...

523
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:23,639
"Spend the night?"

524
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:28,110
But a mere attendant like you can only dream of it.

525
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,980
Who are you saying is a mere attendant? I am nothing like that.

526
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,550
Listen carefully.

527
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:36,119
I have killed a nobleman, all right?

528
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:42,119
The bandit killing people of high status is all talk.

529
00:38:42,489 --> 00:38:44,759
I doubt they have killed the master of a noble family like I have!

530
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,760
Shut your mouth!

531
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,460
If that is true,

532
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:51,829
I will spend the night with you, my lord.

533
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,670
Have you heard of Master Moonhyung?

534
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,980
It is the old man who died on his way back home.

535
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:03,349
That was my doing along with him.

536
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:07,849
Come here! Come to me!

537
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,670
Did you get a message from His Royal Highness?

538
00:39:23,969 --> 00:39:25,030
Yes, sir.

539
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,698
His Royal Highness has found the criminal...

540
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,440
who murdered Master Moonhyung.

541
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:49,590
Why did you want to see me, Prince Susung?

542
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,260
Everything was...

543
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,789
the Left State Councilor's doing.

544
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,360
Please spare my life, Your Royal Highness.

545
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:29,030
Why must I do that?

546
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,369
Spare my life,

547
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:34,139
and I will forever be...

548
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,670
at your beck and call.

549
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:38,670
Oh, yes!

550
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:41,139
The Queen Dowager and the Inspector General...

551
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,980
Once Prince Dosung becomes the Crown Prince,

552
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:47,348
they plan to abdicate from the throne...

553
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:50,449
and immediately make a run to the palace in Anju.

554
00:41:04,469 --> 00:41:05,969
Left State Councilor Yoon...

555
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,539
ordered Court Lady Cho...

556
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:13,139
to murder...

557
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,150
His Majesty.

558
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,659
Should I tell him I was caught by Prince Susung?

559
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:31,829
I cannot.

560
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:34,099
He would never let me keep my life.

561
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,030
What do I do about this?

562
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:40,500
A penny for your thoughts?

563
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,210
It is about His Majesty.

564
00:41:45,739 --> 00:41:47,480
How about we do the deed tonight?

565
00:41:51,309 --> 00:41:52,519
Tonight?

566
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:53,849
Yes.

567
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:56,789
Other variables could surface.

568
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,920
Before Court Lady Cho changes her mind,

569
00:41:59,559 --> 00:42:01,320
it is best to get it over with.

570
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,570
All right.

571
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,599
Go back to the Queen's Palace and wait.

572
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,800
Of course.

573
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,719
Since the matter is urgent, I will be direct.

574
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,329
Your father, Left State Councilor Yoon,

575
00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:41,559
will attempt to murder His Majesty.

576
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,629
Your Majesty, what on earth...

577
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,800
You have always known that this would happen.

578
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,769
That will never happen.

579
00:42:51,409 --> 00:42:53,309
I will stop it in any way I can.

580
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:56,980
Court Lady Cho was ordered to kill him tonight.

581
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:03,519
What? Tonight?

582
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:05,750
I see you were clueless.

583
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:07,518
How can you guarantee his safety...

584
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:10,260
when you have no idea what orders are being made?

585
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,929
It cannot be true.

586
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,960
You must be wrong.

587
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,630
Show her the poison Left State Councilor Yoon gave you.

588
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:31,079
Is she telling the truth?

589
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,320
Yes, it is true.

590
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:40,059
That cannot be.

591
00:43:41,659 --> 00:43:44,590
No, this is wrong.

592
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:47,159
Stay alert, Your Highness.

593
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:49,429
This is not the time to be shocked.

594
00:43:49,929 --> 00:43:53,199
If you wish to save his life, pull yourself together...

595
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,400
and listen to me.

596
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,210
Clean His Majesty's face.

597
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:36,610
Of course.

598
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,340
Darn it!

599
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,190
Darn!

600
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:30,730
How dare you?

601
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:34,260
You...

602
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:36,829
Did you spill your guts?

603
00:46:40,539 --> 00:46:44,070
Where did you hide His Majesty?

604
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,050
Where...

605
00:46:56,849 --> 00:46:59,050
did you hide His Majesty?

606
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:01,419
Tell me this instant!

607
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,519
Do you think...

608
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,989
I would actually tell you?

609
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:07,460
What?

610
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:10,969
Your Highness!

611
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,480
Your Highness...

612
00:47:22,639 --> 00:47:23,650
Your Highness.

613
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:25,809
Your Highness...

614
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:36,829
How dare you barge in here?

615
00:47:37,389 --> 00:47:40,059
Where did you hide His Majesty?

616
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:41,929
Why would you ask me that?

617
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,899
Hand him over this second!

618
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,999
Such insolence.

619
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,269
How dare you show disrespect?

620
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:52,509
If I find His Majesty first,

621
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:55,079
you will not live to tell the tale.

622
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,449
Give him to me this instant!

623
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:16,269
You are the one who first broke his word.

624
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:20,340
It is not I but you who caused this debacle.

625
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:22,739
What is it?

626
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,109
After murdering His Majesty,

627
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,539
you would have killed me and Inspector General Choi.

628
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:28,280
Did you think I would do nothing...

629
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:31,210
when knowing what you had in mind?

630
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,388
You are dismissed.

631
00:48:37,389 --> 00:48:39,519
I will not leave.

632
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:41,658
Not until you give me His Majesty!

633
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:43,889
Should I cancel the Crown Prince's coronation?

634
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:48,159
If you do not mind that, keep pushing your luck.

635
00:48:50,269 --> 00:48:52,230
You will regret this.

636
00:48:56,239 --> 00:48:58,210
We will wait and see...

637
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,909
who regrets it in the end.

638
00:49:21,429 --> 00:49:22,659
Do not ever...

639
00:49:23,829 --> 00:49:25,730
raise your voice...

640
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:30,039
in the Queen Dowager's chambers again.

641
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:46,489
Are you going to sit around and do nothing?

642
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:50,559
We need to make some kind of move.

643
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:58,369
I heard you summoned me.

644
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,670
The deed must be expedited.

645
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,309
Tomorrow's morning assembly will be your window.

646
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,579
Can it be done?

647
00:50:12,110 --> 00:50:14,980
Yes, I will be prepared for it.

648
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:17,389
If this succeeds,

649
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:20,760
I will make sure you are compensated...

650
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,989
for what you suffered in Mungyeong.

651
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:26,158
I am much obliged.

652
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:28,059
There should be no room for error.

653
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,800
Of course.

654
00:50:34,869 --> 00:50:38,409
By the way, how will you deal with Choi Sang Rok's daughter?

655
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:41,110
She should be killed...

656
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,250
alongside her father.

657
00:50:49,050 --> 00:50:50,920
There was an unfortunate incident last night.

658
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,489
One with rebellious motives...

659
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:56,789
attempted to take the life of His Majesty at the King's Palace.

660
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:15,239
Left State Councilor Yoon, step forward.

661
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:35,230
I, Left State Councilor Yoon Yi Kyum,

662
00:51:35,929 --> 00:51:37,599
appear before you.

663
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:39,730
Left State Councilor Yoon Yi Kyum...

664
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:42,400
ordered Court Lady Cho of the Queen's Palace...

665
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,039
to take the life of His Majesty.

666
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:46,510
Do you admit to that?

667
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:52,380
As the King's father-in-law,

668
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:54,979
you were granted many blessings from the royal family.

669
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:57,650
But you dared to repay us by trying to murder His Majesty?

670
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:01,420
I am innocent.

671
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,829
Not even for a second...

672
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:07,929
have I harbored rebellious motives.

673
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:11,670
Inspector General Choi,

674
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,840
bring Court Lady Cho of the Queen's Palace.

675
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:18,110
Absolutely, Your Majesty.

676
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:23,010
It is a rebellion.

677
00:52:23,179 --> 00:52:25,110
Please hurry to safety.

678
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:29,579
- What is happening? - What am I hearing?

679
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:31,650
- My goodness. - Goodness.

680
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,690
Traitor Choi Sang Rok,

681
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:13,059
surrender yourself and be arrested!

682
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:20,369
Let us head out there...

683
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,070
and see what is happening.

684
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:26,110
Do not just stand here.

685
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:27,739
Let us head outside.

686
00:53:28,110 --> 00:53:29,949
Let us see what is going on.

687
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:32,150
What on earth?

688
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:42,889
Are you not heading out there?

689
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:47,300
Of course.

690
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,800
This will be your last moment together,

691
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,969
so share a few words...

692
00:53:53,769 --> 00:53:55,840
and take your time.

693
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,239
Grandfather.

694
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,109
Did you really...

695
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:03,480
I will gradually inform you...

696
00:54:04,349 --> 00:54:06,179
of the details.

697
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,550
For now, let us head outside.

698
00:54:42,719 --> 00:54:46,150
See? What did I tell you?

699
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:49,960
I said you would regret it.

700
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:52,789
We will wait and see...

701
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:55,059
who regrets it in the end.

702
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:03,769
Tiger Hunters,

703
00:55:04,539 --> 00:55:06,010
reveal yourselves!

704
00:55:07,579 --> 00:55:09,880
- What... - The Tiger Hunters?

705
00:55:19,219 --> 00:55:21,889
Tiger Hunters, reveal yourselves...

706
00:55:22,190 --> 00:55:25,730
and answer to the Queen Dowager!

707
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:48,980
Make way for His Majesty!

708
00:56:03,329 --> 00:56:04,400
Goodness!

709
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:19,579
Father.

710
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:53,210
What should we do?

711
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:55,679
Darn.

712
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:00,960
Those who I have thoroughly missed...

713
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:03,559
are all here in one place.

714
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:08,699
You are in the presence of His Majesty.

715
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,030
Drop to your knees this instant!

716
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:18,539
Tiger Hunters,

717
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:21,480
reveal yourselves!

718
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:28,920
Immediately take action!

719
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,090
Loyal Army.

720
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,690
Are you present?

721
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,059
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

722
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,630
Royal and Righteous Squad, reveal yourselves...

723
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,730
and receive my order!

724
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,400
What...

725
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:34,179
Shoot.

726
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:38,539
(Missing Crown Prince)

727
01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:40,379
Now that Father has recovered,

728
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,939
everything has changed.

729
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,479
Nothing has changed.

730
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:44,949
It has returned to its original place.

731
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:47,178
I will not cut ties with Inspector General Choi.

732
01:00:47,179 --> 01:00:49,980
I could very well easily order his death today.

733
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:53,218
I will take Lady Myung Yoon and leave the capital tomorrow.

734
01:00:53,219 --> 01:00:55,320
You truly are pregnant.

735
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,820
Where is Choi Sang Rok?

736
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,158
We will let the sky determine our future.

737
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:00,829
I will kill everyone if I must...

738
01:01:00,929 --> 01:01:03,730
to save our child.
