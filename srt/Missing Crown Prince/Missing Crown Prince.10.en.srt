(when filming with children and animals.)

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,560
Protect Her Majesty.

13
00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:55,659
Please come to.

14
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:57,199
Come on.

15
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,630
- Your Majesty. - Please.

16
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,729
You must take cover, Your Majesty.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,640
Where is the physician?

18
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:07,510
Call a physician right away.

19
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,239
Do not just stand there.

20
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,379
Escort Her Majesty to a safer place!

21
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:13,950
Yoon Yi Kyum.

22
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:16,079
Yoon Yi Kyum, how dare you?

23
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,120
Your Majesty,

24
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,760
I am to blame for not fortifying the location properly.

25
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,560
Command my punishment.

26
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:36,200
Arrest him...

27
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:39,170
Arrest him this instant...

28
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,079
Have you come to?

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,180
Where is the physician?

30
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:52,879
Check his wound first. Now!

31
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,599
(Episode 10)

32
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:23,009
Your Majesty!

33
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:33,389
Do not mind me and continue treating him.

34
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,158
Your Majesty, you cannot be here.

35
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,330
You should head to your quarters.

36
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,799
What is the meaning of this?

37
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,429
I told you to keep treating him.

38
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:41,430
Your Majesty, please.

39
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:44,139
Your Majesty,

40
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:45,839
let us head to your quarters.

41
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,908
You are getting in their way by being here.

42
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:50,039
Why is he not waking up?

43
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,180
He lost consciousness due to excessive blood loss.

44
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:55,680
But the wound is not too deep, so please do not worry.

45
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,669
Your Majesty, your shoes.

46
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:18,740
Yoon Yi Kyum.

47
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:23,169
Even ripping him into pieces would not be enough.

48
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:24,509
Your Majesty.

49
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,979
He will pay for what he did.

50
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,710
I will make sure of it.

51
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:37,460
I have never seen the Queen Dowager explode with so much rage before.

52
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:41,229
The look in her eyes was absolutely terrifying.

53
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:43,999
It scared the life out of me...

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,960
That is why this is outrageous.

55
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,669
She should want the shooter to be caught...

56
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:50,639
but she took it out on me who did nothing wrong.

57
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,699
Well...

58
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:56,409
Clearly, you are the only person here...

59
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,378
who wants her dead.

60
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,580
My goodness! How dare you speak such words?

61
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,818
I already told you I had nothing to do with this.

62
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:06,280
I was only speculating...

63
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,990
as to what she might think.

64
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,520
Anyway, judging by the fury she displayed,

65
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:16,660
we might see blood...

66
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,959
before the installation of the new Crown Prince.

67
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,410
Are you sure...

68
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:33,610
you had nothing to do with it?

69
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,980
Why you...

70
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,549
Then I will comfortably order...

71
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,250
the Police Bureau to quickly find the shooter.

72
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,720
Why that...

73
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,459
He put the plan in motion,

74
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,199
and now he is scared of the repercussions.

75
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,170
Why not do a better job?

76
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,439
- My lord. - Yes?

77
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,910
Prince Dosung summoned you.

78
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:15,189
Who did this?

79
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,119
My guess is that traitors hired a goon to...

80
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,319
Was it my grandfather?

81
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,660
I asked you a question!

82
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,230
Was it my grandfather?

83
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,149
Is there still no word from the Royal Infirmary?

84
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,220
I am afraid not.

85
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,050
- I must go there myself. - Your Majesty.

86
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:48,620
Rumors are already spreading.

87
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,420
I advise that you stay here and wait a bit more.

88
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,060
Your Majesty,

89
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,628
Prince Dosung is here to see you.

90
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:56,790
Dismiss him.

91
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:05,970
I said you were dismissed.

92
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,610
It was all my fault.

93
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,709
Please forgive him.

94
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,949
Do you honestly think...

95
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,949
that asking for forgiveness could get my fury to subside?

96
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:21,948
Please leave.

97
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,889
I will make sure nothing like this happens again.

98
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,389
It is too late.

99
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:28,389
The promise you made...

100
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,529
has already been broken.

101
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,930
And whatever is broken...

102
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,800
will never be whole again even after gluing it back together.

103
00:06:37,769 --> 00:06:38,769
I...

104
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,769
For him...

105
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,469
You know what lengths I went through in order to keep him by my side...

106
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,838
better than anyone.

107
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,839
However,

108
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,480
I almost lost that man right in front of my eyes.

109
00:06:49,779 --> 00:06:51,850
So how do you think I am feeling at the moment?

110
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:55,550
I would love nothing more than to beat Yoon Yi Kyum to death,

111
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:59,689
and it is taking every fiber of my being to hold back.

112
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,959
If you hear me, you will dismiss yourself.

113
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:07,730
What can I do?

114
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,839
Pray that the Inspector General keeps his life.

115
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:17,610
If anything happens to him,

116
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,680
there is no way of knowing what I will do.

117
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,209
I need your help.

118
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,449
The Queen Dowager's wrath has reached the sky.

119
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,979
There is nothing you say that will appease her...

120
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:01,389
The last thing she will want is a catastrophe.

121
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,689
Please help me.

122
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,980
There is no one who knows her better than you do.

123
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,980
Please tell me what I can do...

124
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,279
to appease her anger even in the slightest.

125
00:08:30,379 --> 00:08:31,420
Then...

126
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,820
Maybe you can find...

127
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,690
the royal seal that the Queen hid.

128
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,529
Only an offering of that magnitude...

129
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,759
will allow me to even suggest that she gives you another chance.

130
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,139
Curfew has begun.

131
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:03,210
Curfew has begun.

132
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,480
Curfew has begun.

133
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,450
Curfew has begun.

134
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,190
Curfew has begun.

135
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,730
Curfew has begun.

136
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,629
Curfew has begun.

137
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,940
Curfew has begun.

138
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,639
Shall we?

139
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,759
Your Royal Highness.

140
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,529
This way, please.

141
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:11,179
I heard that you studied under my grandfather.

142
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:13,678
How were you able to study under him...

143
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,090
when you belong to different factions?

144
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,059
I was able to learn from him during my days in Sungkyunkwan.

145
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,490
We may belong to different factions,

146
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,589
but I was mesmerized by his noble character and learning...

147
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,960
that I looked up to him as my teacher.

148
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,429
They may not be open about it,

149
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,029
but many others apart from us think of him as their mentor.

150
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,870
He is called Master Moonhyung for a reason.

151
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,340
Excuse me,

152
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:37,070
but what does Moonhyung mean?

153
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,980
It refers to a scale...

154
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:42,350
that unbiasedly assesses all academic discipline.

155
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,079
It is a nickname given out of respect...

156
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,778
for someone who was in the highest position...

157
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,019
at the offices and institute in charge of studies...

158
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,620
which are the Office of Special Advisors,

159
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,419
the Office of Royal Decrees, and Sungkyunkwan.

160
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:54,190
In other words, he is this.

161
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:58,629
Your Royal Highness.

162
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:00,329
Are you aware...

163
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,330
that they set a date for the Crown Prince's investiture?

164
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,370
The royal seal may be in your possession,

165
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,509
but you will not be able to stop them...

166
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,610
unless you clear your name.

167
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:12,809
Have you found a way to clear your name?

168
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,679
I have an idea in mind.

169
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,090
I apologize for having you stay in this shabby room.

170
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:30,529
Do not apologize.

171
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:32,960
I could not ask for more since we had to move discreetly.

172
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,799
It is the best place to stay hidden.

173
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:36,700
But more importantly,

174
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:38,600
how are you feeling?

175
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,669
I have gotten better thanks to your concern.

176
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:43,370
All right.

177
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,980
- Let us drink. - This is omija tea,

178
00:11:51,549 --> 00:11:53,149
a precious drink from Mungyeong.

179
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:57,220
I poured in a generous amount of syrup just for you,

180
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
so drink...

181
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,360
every drop of it.

182
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,730
Goodness.

183
00:12:03,929 --> 00:12:05,829
Although, it could be useless to you.

184
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:06,960
You are being cheeky again.

185
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,399
The tea is good for you, so drink up.

186
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,899
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

187
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,779
Have you been hearing about what goes on in the Palace?

188
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:23,850
I have been looking into the royal taster,

189
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,580
but I did not find anything out of the ordinary.

190
00:12:27,149 --> 00:12:28,149
I apologize.

191
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,860
That is all right. I appreciate the hard work.

192
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:32,360
We believed you would have news for us.

193
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,459
So what now?

194
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,059
What else? We will have to find another way.

195
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,659
Actually,

196
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,370
the physician who treated me...

197
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:43,428
also treated His Majesty.

198
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,099
Maybe you can meet with him...

199
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,539
and ask about His Majesty's condition?

200
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:54,909
It seems as though you are leaving the capital.

201
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,990
He found out what should be a secret,

202
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:04,159
so running away is how he prolongs his life.

203
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,059
You are smarter than I thought.

204
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:13,129
Do not be too afraid of us.

205
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:17,740
Once you answer a few questions, you will be sent on your way.

206
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,049
Are you feeling a lot of discomfort?

207
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,980
The Queen Dowager must have been shocked.

208
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,580
Did you tell her...

209
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:35,490
that I am doing better?

210
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:36,690
Yes.

211
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,658
You are dismissed.

212
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:44,659
Of course.

213
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,669
Are you here to check if I was alive or not?

214
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,309
I came to see you because it seems like...

215
00:13:57,009 --> 00:13:59,179
you are the only one who can stop the Queen Dowager.

216
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:02,080
And why should I stop her?

217
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:06,750
You almost lost your life,

218
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,190
so I understand your anger.

219
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,460
- However... - That is not the case.

220
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:15,830
Scars and wounds on the body will eventually heal.

221
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:17,259
Since I am alive,

222
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:20,199
I may be able to forgive him.

223
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,200
However...

224
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,269
I will never forgive him...

225
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,539
for targeting the Queen Dowager.

226
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,649
If you wish to save your grandfather's life,

227
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:38,279
have him step down from his position...

228
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,179
and retire to the countryside tomorrow if possible.

229
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:44,919
How could I possibly get my grandfather to retire?

230
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,158
He is not one to do as I say without putting up a fight.

231
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,029
Relay what I am about to tell you,

232
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:55,970
and he will comply with your request.

233
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:01,070
Tell him...

234
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,740
that I found the slave document...

235
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,879
that states his grandmother...

236
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:09,879
as a slave.

237
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,919
Her slave document?

238
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,990
What are you talking about?

239
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Brother,

240
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,639
what would you do if you were in my place?

241
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,490
No physician administers poison without having an antidote.

242
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:29,190
If he was poisoned by a physician, that physician will have one.

243
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,099
As per the Queen Dowager's adamant orders,

244
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,000
Choi Sang Rok is still at the Palace...

245
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,500
being treated at the Royal Infirmary.

246
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,190
Your Royal Highness.

247
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,630
Actually...

248
00:18:45,529 --> 00:18:46,529
I am...

249
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:50,569
Myung Yoon, the daughter of Royal Physician Choi,

250
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,299
who was behind your kidnapping.

251
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,630
Sang Rok.

252
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,200
Why are you here? I told you not to come.

253
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,559
This must have been quite a scare.

254
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,799
I thought I was going to lose you.

255
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,440
I was terrified.

256
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,640
Think of it as a nightmare.

257
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,579
Where could I possibly go without you?

258
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,779
Are you in great pain?

259
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:47,650
I simply acted like a crybaby.

260
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:50,819
I will...

261
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,490
make sure...

262
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:57,130
no one hurts you ever again.

263
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,700
You have protected me until now.

264
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:04,569
But from now on,

265
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,839
I will protect you.

266
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:30,630
As the Inspector General got hurt,

267
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:36,529
I will chair the meeting myself today.

268
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,410
Firstly,

269
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:44,169
a cabinet will be formed.

270
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,239
(Jogak: Organizing a cabinet)

271
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,008
As the Right State Councilor has resigned due to old age,

272
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:49,880
Minister of War Lee Seung Jo is promoted to his place.

273
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,449
And the Minister of Punishments...

274
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:53,180
is to take Minister Lee's place.

275
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:55,089
Your Majesty?

276
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,289
I am not done talking yet.

277
00:21:58,619 --> 00:22:00,118
Training General Cho Chang Eui is now...

278
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:01,829
the Governor of Hamgyong Province.

279
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,058
Head of the Guards Park Han Yong is now...

280
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:05,599
the Governor of Jeolla Province.

281
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,558
Head of Defense Kim Seok Chul is now...

282
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,670
the Governor of Gyeongsang Province.

283
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,039
You are to discuss and find the suitable successors...

284
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:17,269
of these men as soon as possible. Understood?

285
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,980
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

286
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:21,950
Your Majesty.

287
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:23,880
Go ahead.

288
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,278
The positions mentioned today...

289
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,619
are all important ones related to this country's military defense.

290
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,960
I think it is best to decide with time...

291
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:37,289
after appointing the successors.

292
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,730
Keep going.

293
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:42,500
If there is any upheaval in the country...

294
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,699
and their positions are vacant,

295
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,769
it will be hard to defend it.

296
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:49,308
Please take it into consideration.

297
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:51,509
- Please take it into consideration. - Please take it into consideration.

298
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,509
But there has already been an upheaval, no?

299
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,479
I was attacked out of nowhere due to their incompetence.

300
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,379
And the Inspector General was shot by a gun.

301
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,880
Did you already forget that?

302
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:06,058
You are to thoroughly investigate whether they were secretly...

303
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:07,960
in contact with traitors.

304
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:11,599
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

305
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:15,869
If there are any personal relationships...

306
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,699
or party interests played...

307
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,038
while selecting the successors,

308
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:23,309
it will not be overlooked. Am I clear?

309
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,309
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

310
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,220
After going through the recent incident,

311
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,349
the royal family's future has become a concern.

312
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,960
I have lost sleep over it.

313
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,559
Thus,

314
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,089
on the day of Prince Dosung's Crown Prince proclamation ceremony,

315
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,960
the Inspector General's daughter...

316
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,869
will be welcomed as the Crown Princess.

317
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,140
With that in mind, make the preparation.

318
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:54,869
Your Majesty.

319
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,108
Never in history have we proclaimed the Crown Prince...

320
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:00,839
and welcomed the Crown Princess at the same time.

321
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:02,480
Though it may not be in history,

322
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,879
it is still something we can carry out. No?

323
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,490
Welcoming the future queen of this country...

324
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,690
should be approached with great caution.

325
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:15,690
I, too, have the same opinion as Censor Kim Dae Seung.

326
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,829
We have yet to get the list of Crown Princess candidates.

327
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,970
The royal marriage should be postponed.

328
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:24,069
Please take it into consideration.

329
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,970
- Please take it into consideration. - Please take it into consideration.

330
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,769
She is the daughter of Inspector General,

331
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:33,039
the one who saved His Majesty as well as me.

332
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,210
Nobody can be a better Crown Princess candidate than her.

333
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:40,220
This is the royal family's marriage.

334
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,089
It will be done as I see fit.

335
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,950
- Your Majesty... - Enough.

336
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,529
I will...

337
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,759
not take any objections.

338
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,069
Are you not able to speak?

339
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,069
I asked why you did not take my side!

340
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:04,980
I told him to do so!

341
00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:08,509
Prince Dosung?

342
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,410
I must talk to the Left State Councilor.

343
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:25,229
Why did you tell him to do that?

344
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,329
Should we not save one more person, at the least?

345
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,969
Take your side,

346
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,200
and he would have been demoted to a trivial post.

347
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:36,869
I am afraid...

348
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,049
you should retire to the countryside.

349
00:25:44,009 --> 00:25:45,220
What do you mean by that?

350
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,220
Is Choi Sang Rok behind this?

351
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,419
So why did you have to do that?

352
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,789
Come to your senses.

353
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,690
Once you kick me out,

354
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,059
you will be alone.

355
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,160
Do you think...

356
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,799
there will still be people protecting you after I leave?

357
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,670
No.

358
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:09,139
No one will be on your side.

359
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,809
Are you on my side, Grandfather?

360
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:14,480
Do not ask such absurdity!

361
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:16,379
If I am not on your side,

362
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,318
am I on the Queen Dowager's or the Inspector General's side?

363
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,319
If so,

364
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,289
resign for my sake.

365
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:26,920
Did they...

366
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:30,359
threaten you?

367
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:32,599
Yes.

368
00:26:37,769 --> 00:26:38,769
Then...

369
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,269
I will take it that you will do it.

370
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:48,279
What do you think you can do alone?

371
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,380
When His Majesty lost consciousness,

372
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,818
I stopped the Queen's dethronement...

373
00:26:53,819 --> 00:26:56,289
and helped you become the Crown Prince.

374
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:59,189
How can you not realize you are nothing...

375
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,619
without me?

376
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,259
Yes.

377
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,229
All your words may be right.

378
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,259
However...

379
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:09,869
Even so...

380
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,739
It is better to keep our family history...

381
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,209
of a son born from a nobleman and a servant a secret, no?

382
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,509
(Eolja: A son conceived between a nobleman and a lowborn woman)

383
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,349
When I am crowned the King,

384
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,250
I will reassign you.

385
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,960
Wait until then.

386
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:36,029
The proof of our family history.

387
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,758
We can simply find and destroy that proof.

388
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,099
After all we have been through,

389
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,440
are you still looking down on Choi Sang Rok?

390
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:14,829
Your Highness.

391
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:16,970
You must know that once I resign,

392
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:19,440
Prince Dosung's...

393
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:21,869
Crown Prince proclamation ceremony can be canceled.

394
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:24,240
Keep in mind that I, your father,

395
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:26,710
am the only one who can help your son...

396
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,779
become the Crown Prince, besides the King.

397
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,450
I have...

398
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:34,980
never wished Prince Dosung to become...

399
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,889
the Crown Prince or the King.

400
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:38,890
Your Highness!

401
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:42,859
Only when he becomes the Crown Prince and the King...

402
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:45,758
can you avoid death.

403
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:47,460
I know what you mean.

404
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,500
However, what must I do...

405
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:52,769
when I have no power to convince Prince Dosung?

406
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:57,009
Please do as Prince Dosung wishes.

407
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:04,649
Then just until the Crown Prince proclamation ceremony...

408
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,980
That, too, is not something I can decide.

409
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,019
Please leave now.

410
00:30:03,069 --> 00:30:05,439
Yoon Yi Kyum turned in his letter of resignation...

411
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,779
and left the palace.

412
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,980
Prince Dosung was able to convince him.

413
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,789
Did you send word to Myung Yoon?

414
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:20,119
Yes.

415
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,789
She will have entered the palace by now.

416
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:52,720
Mother, it is time you took shelter from this rain.

417
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,819
Once the rain stops,

418
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,990
I will...

419
00:30:57,829 --> 00:30:59,460
make sure Grandfather can return,

420
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,900
so do not worry.

421
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,670
Do not worry about me, Prince Dosung.

422
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,339
I am actually relieved.

423
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,710
As his child, I do feel bad.

424
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,240
But once my father moves back to his hometown,

425
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,179
I would no longer need to worry about His Majesty...

426
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,508
even if you were to become Crown Prince.

427
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,980
I am truly relieved.

428
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,619
What do you mean by that?

429
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,089
It is nothing.

430
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:30,630
My father decided to join hands with them...

431
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,029
and has been making our lives difficult,

432
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,269
so I simply thought...

433
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,700
things would be easier for us with him gone.

434
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,440
That is why I said it.

435
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,980
Your Highness. It is I, Court Lady Cho.

436
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:47,380
You may enter.

437
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:55,490
The Inspector General's daughter has arrived.

438
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:58,789
- You mean, Lady Myung Yoon? - Yes, Your Highness.

439
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:02,460
I saw her at the Royal Infirmary.

440
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:07,900
I wonder if she knows everything.

441
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,029
That the wedding has been expedited.

442
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:12,700
It will now take place on the same day as the investiture ceremony.

443
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,380
Is Oh Wol here too?

444
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,890
Yes, she is waiting outside.

445
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:36,289
But why did you call Oh Wol here too?

446
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:38,660
I figured having Oh Wol by your side...

447
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,960
would comfort you.

448
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:46,700
On the day of the investiture ceremony,

449
00:32:47,869 --> 00:32:51,210
you and the Crown Prince will get married.

450
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:56,449
Just know that. Starting today,

451
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:59,250
you are to stay in the Royal Infirmary to get ready.

452
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,319
Father.

453
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,220
The order came from the Queen Dowager.

454
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,599
It must be this room here.

455
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:20,299
Then please excuse me.

456
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,089
My goodness. I wonder who used this room before.

457
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:44,960
The room smells musty.

458
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,660
Oh, dear.

459
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:49,799
Let me see.

460
00:33:58,509 --> 00:33:59,739
I understand it will be tiring,

461
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,039
but you should have said you would commute from home.

462
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,449
This room is a little too...

463
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,760
It is better than a prison cell.

464
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:17,260
Pardon me? A prison cell?

465
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,099
So, you are not here as a caregiver?

466
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,900
Did Lord Choi call you here to confine you?

467
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,900
Why?

468
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,599
So I will not run away.

469
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:31,409
My lady.

470
00:34:33,309 --> 00:34:35,340
What did you do wrong this time?

471
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:47,219
The Left State Councilor has resigned?

472
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:48,760
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

473
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,130
Rumor has it that he will move back to his hometown soon.

474
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,059
On top of that,

475
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,329
his key aides in important military positions...

476
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,599
have all been dismissed.

477
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,968
They have either been demoted to trivial posts...

478
00:34:58,969 --> 00:35:00,469
or been kicked out to the countryside.

479
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:02,138
And now,

480
00:35:02,139 --> 00:35:03,909
Prince Dosung's investiture ceremony and wedding...

481
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,539
will take place on the same day.

482
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:08,139
My goodness. What is the rush?

483
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,050
Who is the bride?

484
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:12,820
Inspector General Choi Sang Rok's daughter.

485
00:35:21,489 --> 00:35:23,130
After what he did,

486
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,559
he is trying to entrap Prince Dosung through marriage?

487
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,969
Darn it! Those scoundrels.

488
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,909
I wonder why Prince Dosung decided to proceed with the wedding.

489
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:39,840
I am certain Dosung does not want to do it.

490
00:35:39,909 --> 00:35:40,940
Oh, boy.

491
00:35:42,039 --> 00:35:43,079
Gosh.

492
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,550
At this rate, we might even see Baek Gu in the palace later on.

493
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:50,719
It must be stopped at all costs.

494
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:54,018
What is Sang Soo up to?

495
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:55,828
Your Royal Highness. It is I, Sang Soo.

496
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:58,059
- Hey, you scared me! - You may enter.

497
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:08,369
You should properly greet His Royal Highness first.

498
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,190
You may sit down.

499
00:36:26,989 --> 00:36:29,559
Your Royal Highness, this is...

500
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,659
Sun Ok, the court maid from the Queen Dowager's quarters.

501
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,360
You were the one who told me about Buyong Pavilion.

502
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:37,170
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

503
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,409
Buyong Pavilion, second watch of the night.

504
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,650
That was very brave of you.

505
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,579
I did it...

506
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,280
because I was saddened by Jong Geum's death.

507
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:00,920
Anyway, what brings you here?

508
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,530
While eavesdropping on the Queen Dowager's conversations,

509
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,230
I overheard...

510
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,500
that the royal taster was still alive.

511
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:10,929
Are you sure?

512
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,170
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

513
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:15,840
I do not know where she is now, but I am certain that she is alive.

514
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,079
- Let us go. - Go where?

515
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:24,949
I must meet the royal taster.

516
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,919
(Court Lady Yoon)

517
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,949
Start digging.

518
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,828
You want me to dig the frozen ground in the middle of the night?

519
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:38,460
Then would you rather dig up a grave in broad daylight?

520
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,630
Then what will you do?

521
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,500
I will hold this so you can see while digging.

522
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,739
Be the Crown Prince if you think it is unfair.

523
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:06,989
Dig deeper.

524
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:10,789
Goodness. We will soon see the sunrise here at this rate.

525
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,400
Shut your mouth. Be quiet.

526
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:15,099
My goodness.

527
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:36,550
Now, we know for certain that the royal taster is alive.

528
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:39,820
How did they pass through the palace gates with this empty coffin?

529
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,739
How much does a coffin like this cost?

530
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:01,880
Well, it depends on the type of coffin you want.

531
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,480
If you need to get one made...

532
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:05,210
For you, Officer...

533
00:39:08,349 --> 00:39:10,489
He is an assistant police chief.

534
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,059
Have you been working here for a long time?

535
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:18,159
Yes, I have worked in the Funeral Planning Office all my life.

536
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,230
Then you must know everything about coffins.

537
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:22,799
Yes. That is correct, but...

538
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,969
If you were told...

539
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,570
to sneak someone out of the palace,

540
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,110
pretending that they were dead,

541
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,570
what would you do?

542
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:35,780
Why are you asking me such a question all of a sudden?

543
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,050
Such insolence!

544
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,010
He is asking you the question for he needs your answer,

545
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:40,579
so go ahead and answer.

546
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,050
Yes, sir.

547
00:39:44,019 --> 00:39:46,789
It will not be that hard.

548
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,539
Your Majesty!

549
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,309
Is anyone outside?

550
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,309
Your Majesty!

551
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:12,980
My gosh.

552
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,150
Hurry.

553
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,750
- My lady! - My lady!

554
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:38,039
First, make it look like the person is dead and move the body.

555
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,739
Then,

556
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,679
make them lie down in an empty coffin.

557
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,820
After that, place a wooden panel above the person.

558
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:53,360
Then you can place a dead body on top.

559
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,010
Stop.

560
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,349
No one would care to check the coffin's size or weight,

561
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,849
so even if there are two bodies lying inside,

562
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:22,650
it will not get caught.

563
00:41:38,969 --> 00:41:42,070
(The royal taster's residence)

564
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,610
Father.

565
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,710
Please wake up.

566
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:32,960
We need you to regain consciousness to get everything sorted out.

567
00:42:33,489 --> 00:42:35,659
How could you still be lying here unconscious?

568
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,630
Father.

569
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,860
Are you listening?

570
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:46,800
Gun, whom you always dearly cherished, has been arrested again,

571
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,510
and I...

572
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:55,179
I must become Crown Prince in his place,

573
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,079
but I...

574
00:43:03,889 --> 00:43:06,690
There is nothing more I can do.

575
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:18,929
Please help me.

576
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,738
Father, please wake up.

577
00:43:26,739 --> 00:43:30,409
Open your eyes, Father!

578
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:37,050
Please...

579
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,420
Father.

580
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:42,960
Father, please...

581
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:47,230
Please open your eyes,

582
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:05,610
I need you to visit the Royal Infirmary.

583
00:44:06,349 --> 00:44:07,349
Yes, Your Highness.

584
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:08,920
If you see Choi Sang Rok's daughter,

585
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:10,949
discreetly relay my message to her.

586
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,289
I heard the royal taster was an orphan from Hanyang.

587
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:18,229
So, even if she has moved out of her house,

588
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,960
she must still be hiding somewhere in the capital.

589
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,829
Yes, I think so too.

590
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,530
But it is not like we can go around the village looking for her.

591
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:28,739
The investiture ceremony is tomorrow. What should we do?

592
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,109
The royal taster is clearly hiding,

593
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,679
so it will not be easy to find her even if we launch an open search.

594
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:38,279
If we keep it on the down low like this...

595
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,980
Forget tomorrow. We will not find her until next year.

596
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,420
We have no choice...

597
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:47,519
but to reach out to someone who can openly look for her.

598
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,230
"Someone who can openly look for her?"

599
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,030
Who might that be?

600
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:09,809
It was rude of me to ask you to meet with me at such a late hour.

601
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:11,750
Thank you for coming.

602
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:13,780
No problem.

603
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,590
I came here for I must tell you something as well.

604
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:18,789
Go ahead and tell me.

605
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:21,889
Your Highness.

606
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,190
I cannot marry you.

607
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:30,570
I assume you already know everything that happened between me...

608
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,730
and the Crown Prince after he was kidnapped.

609
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:35,239
Correct.

610
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,340
Then why did you agree to marry me?

611
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,340
Do you truly not know...

612
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,179
why I decided to accept this marriage?

613
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,449
I know.

614
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,119
However, I am a sinner.

615
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:52,090
I put His Royal Highness in such a predicament,

616
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:54,289
so how could I become Crown Princess?

617
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:59,500
Thankfully, she does not know about her father and the Queen Dowager.

618
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:01,629
It is shameless of me to ask you this,

619
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:03,900
but I have no choice. I ask you to please...

620
00:46:04,099 --> 00:46:05,530
understand my situation...

621
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:08,570
and call off the wedding.

622
00:46:10,039 --> 00:46:13,480
I, too, do not wish to marry you.

623
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,909
Of course, it is not because I dislike you.

624
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:22,219
I fell for you way before you were chosen...

625
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:24,590
as a Crown Princess candidate,

626
00:46:25,389 --> 00:46:28,820
and I still feel the same way about you.

627
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:34,960
However, I absolutely do not wish to force you...

628
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:36,630
to become mine.

629
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:40,769
If we do get married, it will only happen after I win your heart...

630
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:45,010
for I wish to feel confident when I walk down the aisle.

631
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:49,780
Then,

632
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:52,750
why did you want to see me?

633
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,750
I do not know when my father's condition could get worse,

634
00:46:56,349 --> 00:46:57,989
so I called you here to ask you for help.

635
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,460
Is His Majesty ill?

636
00:47:02,659 --> 00:47:03,659
You did not know?

637
00:47:04,429 --> 00:47:06,199
Did Royal Physician Choi not say anything about it?

638
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:08,029
At home,

639
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,369
he never speaks about what is going on at the palace.

640
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:13,940
Please tell me.

641
00:47:14,269 --> 00:47:17,110
If there is something I can do to help, I will do my best.

642
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:21,739
The truth is,

643
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,219
my father was poisoned,

644
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,380
and my brother was framed for it.

645
00:47:44,969 --> 00:47:45,969
Lady Myung Yoon.

646
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:50,009
- Yes. - I wish to find out...

647
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:51,968
what kind of poison was used on my father.

648
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:54,139
For that, you can consult the Royal Infirmary...

649
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:56,650
or reach out to my father. Why ask me?

650
00:47:57,679 --> 00:47:58,679
No one...

651
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,449
wants my father to regain his consciousness.

652
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:06,150
Your father too. Because of the incident involving my brother,

653
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,218
he wants me to become Crown Prince,

654
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:10,090
so he is not stepping in.

655
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,460
The other physicians are trying not to get involved...

656
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,460
because of what has been happening in the palace.

657
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:18,929
Lady Myung Yoon.

658
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,940
Please help me.

659
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:25,139
When I think of my father, I feel utterly anxious and helpless.

660
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:39,119
I am sorry, but I am not a physician.

661
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:41,690
I do not think I have the ability to help you.

662
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,289
My brother told me that you were more capable...

663
00:48:44,889 --> 00:48:46,029
than most physicians.

664
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:48,499
All I did was make sure his wound would not fester.

665
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,429
It was not a minor wound.

666
00:48:50,829 --> 00:48:53,570
He said he would have died without your help,

667
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:56,039
and I agree with him.

668
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:00,239
Thank you for thinking so highly of me,

669
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:01,939
but the only medical skills I know...

670
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,550
were the ones I learned on my own by observing my father.

671
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,750
Is there nothing you know about poisoning?

672
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:09,549
My father taught me...

673
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:11,590
some things about the few types of poison he handles.

674
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,289
It could be one of them.

675
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,530
- However... - Gun was arrested in Mungyeong.

676
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,230
He is being transported to Hanyang at the moment.

677
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:24,030
My father must regain his consciousness...

678
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:26,639
for Gun to be saved.

679
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,469
Once my father wakes up,

680
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:32,239
Gun can clear his name.

681
00:49:32,809 --> 00:49:35,340
Once he clears his name and is officially reinstated,

682
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:36,710
you...

683
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,619
will not have to marry me.

684
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,179
What... Who are you?

685
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:19,690
You are...

686
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:22,360
Long time no see, Lord Yoon.

687
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:24,130
Are you here...

688
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:27,099
to kill me?

689
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,699
I am here to ask a favor of you.

690
00:50:36,639 --> 00:50:38,269
(Slave Register)

691
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:50,650
(Slave Register)

692
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,659
It is a bribe.

693
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,590
I am pretty sure you will be satisfied.

694
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,130
Gun was arrested in Mungyeong.

695
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,869
He is being transported to Hanyang at the moment.

696
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:08,039
My father must regain his consciousness for Gun to be saved.

697
00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:29,090
Can we trust her?

698
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,730
Her father was the one who poisoned His Majesty.

699
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:35,260
It is suspicious that she willingly agreed to help you.

700
00:51:35,929 --> 00:51:38,400
She did not seem to know that it was her father's doing,

701
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:40,670
so I did not tell her.

702
00:51:40,769 --> 00:51:42,039
I am glad you did not tell her.

703
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,340
However, she is not a physician.

704
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,280
Will this be helpful?

705
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,809
If you get caught for this, you could get in trouble too.

706
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,780
She said she learned about poison from her father,

707
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:55,980
so she might recognize the type of poison her father used.

708
00:51:57,449 --> 00:52:00,719
If she finds out something, even the slightest clue,

709
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,559
it will be helpful.

710
00:52:03,929 --> 00:52:05,030
Well understood.

711
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:07,630
The thing is,

712
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:11,000
I can tell everyone to leave,

713
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,239
but not the Head Eunuch.

714
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:27,280
Head Eunuch, I have a favor to ask of you.

715
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:29,679
"A favor?" Please, Your Highness.

716
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,889
I await your orders.

717
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,329
Where are you going at this late hour?

718
00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:16,869
I should visit the main hall.

719
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:18,500
I am still recovering,

720
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,340
so I have not been able to visit His Majesty for the past few days.

721
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,340
I made sure to change the moxa on time,

722
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:28,139
so I suggest you take it easy and get some rest.

723
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,380
No.

724
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:32,610
I will be back shortly.

725
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:39,530
Your Majesty, the Inspector General is here.

726
00:58:24,539 --> 00:58:25,570
Do you think...

727
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,139
you can deceive me?

728
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:32,610
Open your eyes,

729
00:58:33,619 --> 00:58:34,650
Your Majesty.

730
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:06,980
You woke up too early.

731
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:43,250
Sleep some more,

732
00:59:44,119 --> 00:59:45,150
Your Majesty.

733
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:52,789
(Missing Crown Prince)

734
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:56,860
Was my father the person who poisoned His Majesty?

735
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,929
Knowing the prince's character,

736
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:01,460
this wedding must happen.

737
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:02,928
How come he is not here yet?

738
01:01:02,929 --> 01:01:04,369
He will come.

739
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:05,730
If the Crown Prince is gone,

740
01:01:05,969 --> 01:01:08,400
Prince Dosung will become King whether he likes it or not.

741
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,639
You are now officially invested as the Crown Princess.

742
01:01:11,909 --> 01:01:13,039
Stop!

743
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:15,179
Gun is back.

744
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,280
This is all fake!
