00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,339

(SUHO)

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,218
(All characters, locations, organizations, and incidents...)

9
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:46,478
(in this drama are historically irrelevant and fictitious.)

10
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,688
(Production guidelines were strictly followed...)

11
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:48,920
(when filming with children and animals.)

12
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:51,489
The Queen...

13
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,389
committed a mortal sin by killing the royal taster...

14
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,829
who attempted the murder of the former king.

15
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,929
As it is customary of the royal house,

16
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,429
Queen Yoon will be deposed...

17
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:03,500
and will be confined to her private residence.

18
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,869
Your Highness, it is times like this that you must stay strong...

19
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,040
I hear you, so dismiss yourself and prepare to leave the palace.

20
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,280
It is the Head Eunuch.

21
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:18,049
You may enter.

22
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,730
Drag her out of here.

23
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,229
- Of course. - Your Highness.

24
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,969
It is His Majesty's order.

25
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,969
She will serve you...

26
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,510
at your private residence.

27
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,040
I am Sun Ok, Your Highness.

28
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,540
- Do not just stand there. - Of course.

29
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,149
Your Highness, you must alert Prince Dosung.

30
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,219
Your Highness.

31
00:01:53,819 --> 00:01:56,049
Your Highness!

32
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,290
Your Highness!

33
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:02,229
- Your Highness. - What is with the fuss?

34
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,029
The palace sent someone,

35
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,260
and you...

36
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,069
The sa...

37
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,839
Saktal!

38
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,568
- Saktalgwanjak? - Yes, that.

39
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,038
And then, the mun...

40
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,138
(Saktalgwanjak: Stripping sinners of their titles and privileges)

41
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:19,209
The one where you are ordered to leave the capital.

42
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,249
As in munoechulsong?

43
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,008
Yes, that is the one!

44
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:23,408
(A punishment of stripping one's title forcing them out of Hanyang)

45
00:02:23,409 --> 00:02:24,449
Sneeze!

46
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,219
His Majesty gave the order.

47
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,930
Announce me.

48
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:36,930
We have strict orders...

49
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:39,530
not to let anyone in.

50
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,539
Such insolence.

51
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,810
How could you do this?

52
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,438
How could you depose Mother...

53
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:53,009
It was ordered after serious consideration.

54
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,879
Know that and dismiss yourself.

55
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,408
What kind of consideration...

56
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:58,379
could have led to this kind of decision?

57
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,750
Is this the reason you wanted to be King?

58
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,149
To remove both your mother and brother?

59
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,159
Quiet!

60
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,030
How dare you raise your voice at me?

61
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:09,960
Is it death you are seeking?

62
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,628
Even if it will lead to my death, I will speak my mind.

63
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:14,228
Do you still see me as a brother...

64
00:03:14,229 --> 00:03:16,469
who has time for your childish tantrums?

65
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,370
Childish tantrums, you say?

66
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:22,008
How can you say that...

67
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:23,370
after stabbing me in the back?

68
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:24,439
Are you...

69
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,210
not sorry for what you did?

70
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:31,250
I told you...

71
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:33,149
that the decision was not easy.

72
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,789
Are you saying I should be grateful, then?

73
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,259
Be grateful that I did not order you to take poison.

74
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,689
Order that instead.

75
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,199
Rather than seeing my mother deposed,

76
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,099
I would take the poison and die.

77
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,500
You dare to defy the King's order?

78
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:52,139
Leave the capital immediately and live your life quietly.

79
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,860
Your Majesty,

80
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,199
why did you do that?

81
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,500
You should have calmly explained the situation.

82
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,739
What if he acts out?

83
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,670
As if my placating him would get me anywhere.

84
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:45,420
Prince Dosung.

85
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,230
A fugitive dares to walk around the capital.

86
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:58,600
You must have a death wish.

87
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,709
I had to talk to you...

88
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,110
and am risking my life to do so.

89
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,149
Do not look at me like that.

90
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,550
What did I tell you?

91
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,750
I said as soon as the Crown Prince ascended the throne,

92
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:15,990
he would immediately...

93
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:20,220
remove you and the Queen.

94
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,629
Will you finally...

95
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:26,230
join me on my crusade?

96
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:28,730
What do you want from me?

97
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,180
Just do as ordered by your grandfather.

98
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:43,480
That is all I am asking.

99
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,720
Are you saying you trust me?

100
00:05:47,189 --> 00:05:49,019
You are my one and only grandson.

101
00:05:49,689 --> 00:05:51,459
If I do not trust you,

102
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,289
who can I trust?

103
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:56,060
Drop the sugar-coated nonsense...

104
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,559
and tell me why you really believe...

105
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,430
that I will do as you say.

106
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:09,209
Enter.

107
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:22,949
Are you all right?

108
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,859
What on earth have you done?

109
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,730
She kept fighting us, so we had no choice.

110
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,990
I will leave you two to talk.

111
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:10,670
Were you hurt?

112
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,439
Is it bad?

113
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
No.

114
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,769
While fighting off the men trying to capture me,

115
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,410
I hurt myself a little.

116
00:07:17,779 --> 00:07:19,240
But that is a lot of blood...

117
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:23,579
We must alert the Crown Prince immediately.

118
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,490
If they are holding me in captivity and forcing your hand...

119
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,160
It does not matter.

120
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:34,959
I...

121
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,889
will be King.

122
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,470
How could you even mention such a preposterous idea?

123
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:45,669
Are you suggesting a coup?

124
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,970
If I wish to be King,

125
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,910
I must lead a rebellion.

126
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,180
Do you expect me to believe that?

127
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:56,680
I would not.

128
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:59,878
The prince I know would not dethrone his father...

129
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,149
just to sit on the throne.

130
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,750
It will be my brother...

131
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,220
and not my father who I dethrone.

132
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,088
What do you mean...

133
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,899
My father abdicated the throne,

134
00:08:12,629 --> 00:08:14,269
and now my brother is King.

135
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:17,100
However,

136
00:08:17,569 --> 00:08:19,740
his reign will soon be over.

137
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,040
I will be King,

138
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:25,040
and you...

139
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,879
will be my queen.

140
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:41,389
This seems too easy to believe that he means it.

141
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,360
Whether he means it or not...

142
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,059
does not matter.

143
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:48,269
As long as we have the girl,

144
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,740
Prince Dosung will never betray us.

145
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,340
Just make sure they are watched at all times.

146
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:20,669
Do you still wish to have me?

147
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:22,200
His Royal Highness...

148
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,269
I mean, once you take the throne from His Majesty,

149
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:29,909
do you believe you can finally have me?

150
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,539
Your wound should be treated.

151
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:35,809
I will bring someone over, so wait here.

152
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,519
Do you know why...

153
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,189
His Majesty was adamantly against...

154
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,919
you being the Crown Prince?

155
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,559
Because once you were installed,

156
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,789
he knew that your grandfather...

157
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:52,860
would immediately take your father's life.

158
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:57,669
The Queen was also against it for the same reason.

159
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,840
No! You must not become one at any cost!

160
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:05,039
Mother. Why are you against it?

161
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,179
What is the reason I must not become the Crown Prince?

162
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:12,820
I hate the idea.

163
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,289
I do not want you to become the Crown Prince for my sake.

164
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:20,319
Nor do I want to see you brothers fight over the position.

165
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,459
I hate it all.

166
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,889
Admit that you wish to keep the Crown Prince title.

167
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,759
Just admit that you want her all to yourself...

168
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,969
even if she was mine!

169
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,169
Shut your mouth!

170
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:34,440
How dare you run your mouth like that when you know nothing?

171
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,409
What is it that I do not know?

172
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:41,080
If there is something I do not know, you can tell me now!

173
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:49,289
He did not want to hurt you...

174
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,319
by saying that your grandfather...

175
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,960
would kill your father to make you King.

176
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,460
I understood why he chose not to.

177
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:59,629
Rather than breaking your heart,

178
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:00,970
he would...

179
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,470
gladly be the brother you hate.

180
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,269
And he meant that.

181
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:10,639
Brother...

182
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:24,889
Gosh.

183
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:39,570
Where were you, my lord?

184
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:41,610
I looked for you everywhere.

185
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:43,309
Bring me the writing utensils.

186
00:11:43,809 --> 00:11:45,080
Pardon? Yes, of course.

187
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:52,720
(Goyukgye)

188
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:01,230
(Goyukgye: Harming oneself to earn the trust of enemies)

189
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,029
I told you...

190
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,500
that the decision was not easy.

191
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:13,539
Are you saying I should be grateful, then?

192
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:17,980
Be grateful that I did not order you to take poison.

193
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,450
Order that instead.

194
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,149
Rather than seeing my mother deposed,

195
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,950
I would take the poison and die.

196
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,049
You dare to defy the King's order?

197
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,919
Leave the capital immediately and live your life quietly.

198
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,669
Do not leave the capital and wait.

199
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,570
Only that way will Choi Sang Rok or your grandfather...

200
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,470
be able to find you.

201
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,379
Did he secretly become a seer?

202
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,250
He truly is impressive.

203
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,289
Pardon? What was that?

204
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,649
It was nothing.

205
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,320
I will write a letter...

206
00:13:06,659 --> 00:13:09,190
which you will discreetly deliver to my brother.

207
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:16,299
They are holding Lady Myung Yoon captive.

208
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,240
I met her at the hut which is their hideout,

209
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,309
but she would have been relocated after I left.

210
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:30,610
I wish to secretly talk to Chief Scholar and Chief Censor.

211
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,678
Deposed Queen Yoon...

212
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:34,820
colluded with her father to frame His Majesty.

213
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:36,619
And to cover up her involvement,

214
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,990
she committed a felony by killing the King's royal taster.

215
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,389
Thus, she should be ordered to take poison.

216
00:13:43,029 --> 00:13:45,000
Please consider my plea.

217
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:48,529
- Please consider our plea. - Please consider our plea.

218
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,769
Are there any other matters to discuss?

219
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,570
Your Majesty.

220
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:56,609
Yoon's son Lee Young...

221
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,678
defied the order to leave the capital...

222
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:00,580
and has been spotted on the streets.

223
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,409
He should also be ordered to take poison...

224
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,449
so that you can display your sovereignty.

225
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:08,049
Please consider my plea.

226
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,090
- Please consider our plea. - Please consider our plea.

227
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:17,730
I will consider the matter.

228
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,729
Your Majesty!

229
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,100
That will conclude today's cabinet meeting.

230
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,399
You are dismissed.

231
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,710
We should at least prevent their death by poison.

232
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:37,980
As if that is something we can achieve.

233
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,080
It will only get us on His Majesty's bad side.

234
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,860
Do you not realize that you are already on his bad side?

235
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:47,289
Magistrate Yoon?

236
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:48,960
How are you...

237
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,830
Did you invite him here?

238
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:57,529
Who invited me here is not the issue at hand.

239
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,500
Meanwhile, solving the pressing matter is.

240
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,370
I am leaving.

241
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,139
When His Majesty was the Crown Prince,

242
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:08,110
you all accused him as a traitor.

243
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,620
All scholars of the Seoin Faction...

244
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,649
have been stigmatized since then.

245
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:17,419
Also, his maternal grandfather who was Master Moonhyung...

246
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:19,490
tragically lost his life.

247
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:24,730
Do you truly not fathom His Majesty's intent?

248
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,429
He is going to join forces with the Namin Faction...

249
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,200
to purge all members of the Seoin Faction.

250
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,210
If you wish to live,

251
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:39,279
join me and Left State Councilor Yoon.

252
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,679
Once the Queen and Prince Dosung are ordered to consume poison,

253
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,980
no one can guarantee Lady Myung Yoon's safety.

254
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,249
Maybe it is time...

255
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,720
you brought her home from the palace.

256
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,489
She might get hurt on the big day,

257
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,788
or she could be held hostage...

258
00:15:53,789 --> 00:15:55,559
You still do not seem to know about His Majesty.

259
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,659
As long as he is at the palace too,

260
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:00,360
Myung Yoon will remain unharmed.

261
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:06,600
We will be able to see her again when the coup ends in a success.

262
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,769
But should things go awry,

263
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,840
she will have a better chance of living...

264
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:14,450
by putting more distance from me.

265
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,779
It is best to leave her be.

266
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:25,620
Also, should the rebellion...

267
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:29,259
not go as planned,

268
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,559
you...

269
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:35,730
will kill me.

270
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,970
What on earth are you saying?

271
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:44,110
She may think of me as her mortal enemy,

272
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,980
but I am still her father.

273
00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:50,110
She is not one to find happiness loving the man...

274
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,519
who took her father's life.

275
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,320
Just like I did,

276
00:16:57,789 --> 00:16:59,360
she will live...

277
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,730
in great torment.

278
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:06,630
All things considered, my dying at your hands...

279
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,299
is the way to bring her peace.

280
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,440
Are we set to leave?

281
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,150
Yes, my lord.

282
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,980
Let us go.

283
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:43,170
Let us overthrow the regime,

284
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,839
rid the palace of the atrocious King and Namin Faction,

285
00:17:47,369 --> 00:17:50,170
and rescue Queen Yoon who has been confined...

286
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,609
to her private residence.

287
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:56,980
Why do you seem worried?

288
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,519
We have already succeeded once.

289
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,190
We have the Grand Queen Dowager's secret blessing,

290
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,859
and the former king's son Prince Dosung...

291
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:06,559
is with us.

292
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:09,990
Put your faith in me and follow my lead.

293
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,359
You will be compensated.

294
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,369
Allow me to sign it first.

295
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,880
(Lee Young)

296
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,259
Everyone. As promised,

297
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,598
we will make sure to succeed.

298
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:47,599
Of course.

299
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,569
Let us go, then. Come on.

300
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,720
When...

301
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:10,420
should it be done?

302
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,319
Strike while the iron is hot.

303
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:16,690
The day the former king heads to Onyang Temporary Palace.

304
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,759
How about that night?

305
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,999
Half of the soldiers in the palace...

306
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,639
will escort the king to Onyang.

307
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,199
(Hojong: Escorting and guarding the king's palanquin)

308
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,599
The day sounds good to me.

309
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,539
What are your thoughts?

310
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:36,980
I will do as you order, Grandfather.

311
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,799
I desperately request...

312
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,099
that you forget the matters of the royal court...

313
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,400
and focus on your recovery.

314
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:05,539
I leave with ease...

315
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,450
knowing that you are here to replace me.

316
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:10,650
Of course.

317
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:13,779
I will wait patiently...

318
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:16,250
believing that you will return in good health.

319
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,200
Gun.

320
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:28,500
Yes, Father.

321
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,900
No matter what happens in the future,

322
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,609
can you promise me...

323
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,410
that you will protect your stepmother and brother...

324
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,880
without wavering to such forces?

325
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,079
Do not worry, Father.

326
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,950
Your son will protect my mother and little brother.

327
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,150
Place your trust in me.

328
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,619
Once the drum strikes to announce that it is 4am,

329
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,429
our people will open the gate.

330
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,828
(Ohgyeong: Between 3am and 5am)

331
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:34,499
The Royal Guards left with the former king,

332
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,200
but how are you planning to handle the Loyal Army?

333
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,500
I will poison...

334
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:42,839
their food.

335
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,619
Is that so? Goodness. Thank you.

336
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,259
Here you go. Go ahead.

337
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:00,959
Eat up.

338
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,630
- Do you want some too? - Let us eat.

339
00:22:03,089 --> 00:22:04,460
Gosh, thank you.

340
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,400
The poison is not life-threatening,

341
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,130
but vomiting and diarrhea...

342
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,869
will prevent them from performing their duties.

343
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,640
If we leave at 2am, we will arrive by 4am.

344
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:23,778
So before we leave for the attack, do another headcount of our men.

345
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:29,089
(Jeomgo: Doing a thorough headcount)

346
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:49,409
Where could you be going when you do not have...

347
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,569
soldiers of your own to count?

348
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,539
I need to relieve myself.

349
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,390
Let me come with you.

350
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,799
I suddenly had to relieve myself as well.

351
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,539
The Head of the Palace Guards is nowhere to be seen.

352
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,039
What do you mean he is nowhere to be seen?

353
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:28,809
It seems as though he left with his men.

354
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,549
Something does not seem right.

355
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:37,289
Bring me Magistrate Yoon.

356
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,759
Goodness.

357
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:44,190
- Cheol Du! - Yes, my lord.

358
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:46,899
Bring me more liquor.

359
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:47,960
Yes, my lord.

360
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:54,200
You have had enough to drink.

361
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:57,339
This is not a day for you to be drunk.

362
00:24:00,109 --> 00:24:02,109
This is exactly the day that I need to be drunk.

363
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,279
I may have chosen to be heartless,

364
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,490
but how can I kill my own brother while sober?

365
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,460
My lord,

366
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,730
Lord Choi would like a word.

367
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,730
With me?

368
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,480
It is chrysanthemum tea.

369
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:42,220
It helps relax and reduce anxiousness.

370
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:46,559
I prepared it thinking it would help on a day like this.

371
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,589
As you wanted to see me out of the blue,

372
00:24:50,829 --> 00:24:52,659
I thought you had something to say.

373
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,028
I was about to drink alone, then suddenly recalled you...

374
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:57,569
and had you come over.

375
00:24:57,869 --> 00:25:00,569
My apologies if I bothered you.

376
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:03,309
No, an apology is unnecessary.

377
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:06,680
Since you called for me for my sake, I will gratefully drink it.

378
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,230
This...

379
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,960
Does it truly help relax?

380
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,730
It tastes a bit funny.

381
00:25:47,019 --> 00:25:48,049
What did you put...

382
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,990
inside the tea?

383
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,890
Just a small amount of poison.

384
00:25:56,329 --> 00:25:57,460
This is the antidote.

385
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:02,500
Where did the Head of the Palace Guards take the soldiers?

386
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,170
There is not even one hour before we carry out the plan.

387
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,538
Tell me the whole truth about why they sneaked out...

388
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:09,269
of the mountains.

389
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,140
Do you have a death wish?

390
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,650
Well then, die.

391
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,279
They were sent...

392
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,420
to kill the Queen Dowager.

393
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:29,629
I'll tell you everything. Now, the antidote.

394
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,289
Did you send them to the Queen Dowager's Palace?

395
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,660
How many were sent?

396
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:38,739
Tell me at once if you want to live! Tell me!

397
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,039
The antidote...

398
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,359
Your Majesty. The King has left the capital.

399
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,829
Then we should get going too.

400
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,598
Have things been settled outside?

401
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:09,630
Yes, Your Majesty.

402
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:12,470
Steps have been taken so that until the shift changes,

403
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,039
we will not be kept under watch.

404
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,809
Everything will go according to plan.

405
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,380
Have faith in Inspector General Choi.

406
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,089
Now then, everyone. Raise your glass.

407
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:08,858
Dethroning his mother and killing his brother!

408
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:10,258
The morally depraved...

409
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:13,798
tyrant, Lee Gun. Let us drive him out!

410
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:16,569
- Let us drive him out! - Let us drive him out!

411
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,450
The traitors...

412
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,450
are to be arrested!

413
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:39,719
- How did they come in? - Who are they?

414
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,960
- What is going on? - What?

415
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,130
- What? - Wait.

416
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:53,900
How did this happen?

417
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,480
Stop them!

418
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,250
- Wait. - My stomach.

419
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:04,809
- It hurts. - My stomach hurts.

420
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,450
- My stomach! - It hurts.

421
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,069
My stomach hurts.

422
00:29:44,019 --> 00:29:45,559
Take this.

423
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,660
That is right.

424
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:54,700
The drinks have been poisoned.

425
00:30:02,869 --> 00:30:03,970
For you...

426
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,839
and our family's sake,

427
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:10,680
do you know how much effort I have put in?

428
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:14,849
Give me the antidote at once!

429
00:30:15,549 --> 00:30:16,890
If you do not,

430
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,960
I will kill Myung Yoon.

431
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:24,230
Here comes Lady Myung Yoon!

432
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:42,949
Did you think treason to satisfy your filthy greed...

433
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,509
for power would succeed?

434
00:30:45,549 --> 00:30:46,549
The fact that...

435
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:50,490
I am of your bloodline is embarrassing.

436
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:58,460
Everyone is to drop their weapons and surrender.

437
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:01,759
Those who surrender will be extenuated.

438
00:31:05,099 --> 00:31:06,700
Tie all of them up!

439
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,920
Your Majesty.

440
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,319
Choi Sang Rok is nowhere to be found.

441
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,759
I, too, will go with you.

442
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,230
If you come with me, what about this place?

443
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,170
The Commander is here, no?

444
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,069
Do you think the Commander can take my place?

445
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:43,970
The only one who can stand in for me...

446
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:46,640
is you.

447
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,779
All right.

448
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,119
Then I leave this place to you.

449
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:19,339
What are you waiting for? Protect Her Majesty!

450
00:32:28,819 --> 00:32:30,819
Your Majesty.

451
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:40,099
Court Lady Kim!

452
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,909
Sang Rok?

453
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,809
Take her away. Hurry!

454
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,849
Sang Rok!

455
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:47,160
- Sang Rok! - No, Your Majesty!

456
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,269
Sang Rok!

457
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:07,450
Sang Rok!

458
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,989
No, please. Sang Rok!

459
00:34:11,789 --> 00:34:12,889
Sang Rok!

460
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,260
No!

461
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,960
Please!

462
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:20,260
- His Majesty did? - Yes.

463
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,400
Let us withdraw.

464
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:34,880
Leave with Her Majesty.

465
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,010
No.

466
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,780
If I cannot go with you,

467
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,820
I will die with you right here.

468
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,489
I am done for.

469
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:44,820
Go.

470
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:46,590
I will not go alone.

471
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:48,559
I cannot do it.

472
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:51,260
To save you,

473
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:55,059
I devoted my whole life to you.

474
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,730
Do not let my death...

475
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:00,639
go in vain.

476
00:35:00,769 --> 00:35:02,309
Sang Rok...

477
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,909
Your Majesty.

478
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:06,840
Please think of the baby inside you.

479
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,409
Soo Ryeon.

480
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,550
We should save...

481
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,320
our baby.

482
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:31,400
Are you telling me to give birth to a fatherless baby?

483
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,769
Do not do this.

484
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:36,840
You know...

485
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,610
very well I cannot live without you.

486
00:35:40,909 --> 00:35:42,550
So why must you do this?

487
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,409
Please...

488
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,419
Please let us go together, Sang Rok.

489
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,689
No, Sang Rok. Come now.

490
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,320
- Sang Rok. Please. - Stop right there!

491
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,769
Moo Baek!

492
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:08,699
Your Majesty...

493
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,150
Go.

494
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,429
Sang Rok!

495
00:37:06,329 --> 00:37:07,360
- No... - Your Majesty.

496
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,949
I ask you to please...

497
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,150
spare the Queen Dowager.

498
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,449
Please spare the Queen Dowager.

499
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:34,789
Soo Ryeon...

500
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,159
did nothing wrong.

501
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,460
It was all me.

502
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,630
All she did...

503
00:37:43,699 --> 00:37:47,440
was let herself fall in love with a man.

504
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:51,039
Your Majesty!

505
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:53,380
Please...

506
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:55,239
have mercy on...

507
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,030
Sang Rok...

508
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,780
Listen, all of you!

509
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:40,480
- Yes, Your Majesty! - Yes, Your Majesty!

510
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,250
The Queen Dowager...

511
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,389
was assassinated...

512
00:39:51,659 --> 00:39:52,730
tonight...

513
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,000
by the rebels who raided the palace.

514
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,239
Do you all understand?

515
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:05,440
- Yes, Your Majesty! - Yes, Your Majesty!

516
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:32,670
My goodness.

517
00:40:33,969 --> 00:40:36,440
- Those traitors deserve this. - They should be stoned to death.

518
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:38,538
- Yes, absolutely. - What are you waiting for?

519
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:40,539
- Those scoundrels. - Hurry up and kill them.

520
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:43,849
- Those treacherous rats. - Kill them.

521
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,619
- Oh, boy. - Why wait?

522
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,949
- How dare they commit treason? - Exactly. How dare they?

523
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,420
Hurry up and behead them!

524
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,420
Show them no mercy!

525
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,260
My goodness.

526
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,428
Please order the execution...

527
00:41:32,429 --> 00:41:35,599
of Deposed Queen Yoon and her son, Lee Young, by poisoning.

528
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,129
- I do not want to hear it. - Your Majesty!

529
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,170
That is enough!

530
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,539
Bring me my buwol.

531
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:51,050
(Buwol: King's axe that symbolizes royal power)

532
00:42:11,969 --> 00:42:13,769
- What was that? - What is he doing?

533
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:23,849
Before you make a remark wishing harm on someone,

534
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:26,449
you must put your life on the line.

535
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:29,650
Your Majesty.

536
00:42:29,989 --> 00:42:32,590
Why are you trying to rule by fear?

537
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:35,289
Please be merciful and wise.

538
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:38,690
- Please be merciful and wise. - Please be merciful and wise.

539
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,429
Ministers.

540
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:44,369
How could you only expect mercy and wisdom from me?

541
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:47,039
Reflect on yourselves!

542
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,639
He is way out of line. Do you not think so?

543
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:56,309
How could he ask for his axe?

544
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:57,678
He basically told us...

545
00:42:57,679 --> 00:42:59,379
to shut our mouths and obey his orders!

546
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,550
He must have been very frustrated for him to do such a thing.

547
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,949
So please be careful, Inspector General.

548
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:05,518
Even so,

549
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:07,619
Choi Sang Rok's daughter must be executed. Do you not agree?

550
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:09,629
Her father committed a grave crime!

551
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:10,829
Have you lost your mind?

552
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:12,429
Do you not know...

553
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:15,799
that woman is His Majesty's greatest weakness?

554
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,069
(Yeokrin: King's weakness that could trigger his anger)

555
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,129
"Weakness?" What do you mean?

556
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,139
Oh, boy.

557
00:43:20,739 --> 00:43:22,538
You need to listen carefully if you are slow-witted.

558
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:25,010
I am afraid he will cause us trouble down the road.

559
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,340
Let us go.

560
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,989
My gosh.

561
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:38,719
- They will dry quickly here. - Yes.

562
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:42,159
Hello, there.

563
00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:47,059
- Me? - Goodness.

564
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:55,099
Come to my chamber tonight.

565
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:58,809
Why are you all quiet?

566
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:02,178
I am not a kisaeng. Please excuse me.

567
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:04,879
(Gwangi: A kisaeng who belongs to a government agency)

568
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,650
Look at you playing hard to get.

569
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:09,949
You really are pretty. Very pretty.

570
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:13,119
I am bleeding.

571
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,590
- You witch. Are you insane? - "Insane?"

572
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,500
You are insane.

573
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:24,030
Come with me, you lunatic. Gosh, you crazy fool.

574
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,969
Gosh.

575
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,039
Gosh.

576
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,238
My lady, are you all right?

577
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:33,809
I should be used to this by now. Let us go.

578
00:44:39,579 --> 00:44:41,449
The King is so cruel.

579
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:43,820
Has he forgotten all about Lady Myung Yoon?

580
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,429
It is a letter from the Queen Dowager.

581
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:58,829
Choi Sang Rok...

582
00:44:59,969 --> 00:45:01,899
left behind a remedy for Father.

583
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:02,909
Pardon me?

584
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:07,440
We should make the medicine and send it to Onyang right away.

585
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,530
Tell the King...

586
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,129
to issue the bridal selection order at once...

587
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,900
and select his queen,

588
00:45:33,139 --> 00:45:34,670
or I will not take the medicine.

589
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:37,269
Do you understand?

590
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,980
Yes, Your Majesty.

591
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,909
Your Majesty.

592
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:45,078
You must select your queen soon...

593
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:47,050
so that you can have an heir.

594
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:49,320
Please heed our advice.

595
00:45:49,989 --> 00:45:52,250
- Please heed our advice. - Please heed our advice.

596
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:54,989
Your Majesty.

597
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:58,190
If you wish to make a request, please let us know.

598
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:00,860
We are here to listen.

599
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,699
About the marriage ban.

600
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,799
Is it truly necessary to issue the ban...

601
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,710
along with the bridal selection order?

602
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:14,610
From what I understand, there are many negative effects.

603
00:46:15,079 --> 00:46:17,909
Then if we abolish the marriage ban,

604
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,550
would you go ahead and select your queen?

605
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:21,780
Well...

606
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:24,619
I do have to get married eventually.

607
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,320
You may leave.

608
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,789
As for the one on the left, I did not like how grumpy she looked.

609
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,030
She looked grumpy.

610
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:08,899
The one in the middle has a square face. I do not like that.

611
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,929
She has a square face.

612
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:14,570
The one on the right looked too naive and feeble.

613
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,239
Next.

614
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:25,809
You may leave.

615
00:47:33,389 --> 00:47:35,420
- Next. - You may leave.

616
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,260
Next!

617
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:42,059
Next!

618
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,539
You may leave.

619
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:54,480
- Next. - You may leave.

620
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,010
Next!

621
00:47:58,949 --> 00:48:01,219
That was the last group.

622
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,820
Already?

623
00:48:04,821 --> 00:48:06,489
Since we abolished the marriage ban,

624
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:11,159
the number of candidates decreased drastically.

625
00:48:13,159 --> 00:48:15,960
I cannot find a single woman I like in all of Joseon?

626
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:19,230
At the same time, I cannot marry just about anyone.

627
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:22,769
It is such a shame.

628
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:25,940
Head Eunuch. Tell the Chief Royal Secretary...

629
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:28,440
to shut down the Office of the Royal Wedding.

630
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:30,209
Yes, Your Majesty.

631
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:33,448
(Garyeodogam: The Temporary Office of the Royal Wedding)

632
00:48:33,449 --> 00:48:34,480
This is why...

633
00:48:35,179 --> 00:48:37,090
you ministers ought to identify such negative effects...

634
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:40,489
and work on improving the lives of the people as soon as possible.

635
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,759
- Thank you for your generosity, - Thank you for your generosity,

636
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,289
- Your Majesty. - Your Majesty.

637
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:49,159
Also, we will wish the former King a speedy recovery...

638
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:52,170
by reinstating the deposed Queen and making her Queen Dowager.

639
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,369
Prince Dosung will also be reinstated.

640
00:48:55,539 --> 00:48:56,909
Your Majesty, that cannot be done...

641
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,980
After long and careful consideration, I have arrived...

642
00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:11,920
at the conclusion that we should also eliminate guilt by association.

643
00:49:12,289 --> 00:49:13,718
If we leave it as is,

644
00:49:13,719 --> 00:49:14,959
(Yeonjwaje: Guilt by association)

645
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,889
Prince Dosung is a criminal for he is the grandson...

646
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,859
of Yoon Yi Kyum who committed high treason.

647
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:22,130
If Prince Dosung is a criminal, that makes me a criminal too.

648
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:24,730
That is utterly absurd.

649
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:26,230
A criminal?

650
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,868
How could you say such an absurd thing?

651
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:31,539
So, we should eliminate guilt by association.

652
00:49:33,579 --> 00:49:35,110
What do you ministers think?

653
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:38,980
- We shall eliminate it. - We shall eliminate it.

654
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:49,619
Congratulations.

655
00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:51,530
Congratulations.

656
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,159
Congratulations.

657
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:55,400
They have abolished guilt by association,

658
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,400
so you have been reinstated, Lady Myung Yoon.

659
00:49:59,699 --> 00:50:00,739
My lady.

660
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,469
Congratulations.

661
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:23,260
I shall give you the reward I had promised you.

662
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:28,059
Tell me what you want.

663
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:33,869
I wish to be able to treat the ill for the rest of my life.

664
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,150
(Baek Gu)

665
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,159
Gap Seok, are you outside?

666
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,599
Yes, Your Majesty.

667
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:16,849
Bring Dosung to me.

668
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:32,530
Your Majesty.

669
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,369
Your Majesty.

670
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,030
From now on,

671
00:52:10,699 --> 00:52:12,269
you are the King of Joseon.

672
00:52:12,869 --> 00:52:14,900
I have already informed the Chief Scholar and the Chief Censor.

673
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:17,039
They will take care of the formalities.

674
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,780
Oh, right.

675
00:52:22,909 --> 00:52:25,179
I will take a few royal inspector badges too. Keep that in mind.

676
00:52:26,949 --> 00:52:27,949
My dear brother.

677
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:32,820
I trust that you will...

678
00:52:33,619 --> 00:52:34,659
take good care...

679
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:36,530
of Joseon and the people.

680
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:38,130
Gun!

681
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:47,769
Here comes the secret royal inspector!

682
00:52:48,099 --> 00:52:50,969
- The secret royal inspector? - A royal inspector is here!

683
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:14,500
I have been told that there is a quack at this clinic...

684
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:17,099
who has been extorting money from people by deceiving them.

685
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:21,000
You must come forward to be tied up at once!

686
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,940
I do not know exactly what you heard,

687
00:53:25,239 --> 00:53:26,368
but I have never once deceived my patients...

688
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,809
or extorted money from anyone.

689
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:33,010
How dare you list excuses?

690
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:36,420
Come out and serve me at once unless you wish to die.

691
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:38,849
Pardon me?

692
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:41,489
I told you to serve me.

693
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,590
Serve me, and I will let you go punished.

694
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:46,090
What do you say?

695
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:50,829
I am a physician, not Chun Hyang.

696
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,300
Will you serve me,

697
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:55,570
Baek Gu?

698
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:07,219
Your Majesty...

699
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:10,190
My lord.

700
00:54:12,949 --> 00:54:13,960
"Husband."

701
00:54:54,829 --> 00:54:56,500
Gap Seok collected his corpse...

702
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,869
and buried him here.

703
00:55:05,809 --> 00:55:06,840
Say hello to him...

704
00:55:08,039 --> 00:55:09,179
and come down when you are done.

705
00:55:56,829 --> 00:55:57,860
Father...

706
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:18,380
Father...

707
00:56:42,070 --> 00:56:44,070
Have you been keeping well?

708
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:45,170
Yes.

709
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:48,280
Did you visit your father's grave?

710
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,110
Yes.

711
00:56:51,111 --> 00:56:54,349
There is someone who wants to see you. Would you like to meet her?

712
00:56:58,989 --> 00:57:00,119
Is she here?

713
00:57:15,369 --> 00:57:16,909
Are you in good health?

714
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,349
Yes, I am fine.

715
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:27,679
How...

716
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,219
have you been?

717
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,150
I have been well.

718
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,829
Good. That is the way it should be.

719
00:57:38,429 --> 00:57:39,530
So that your father...

720
00:57:43,869 --> 00:57:44,900
I am sorry.

721
00:57:47,739 --> 00:57:49,340
You look quite pale.

722
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,710
May I check your pulse?

723
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:11,289
Can you...

724
00:58:13,429 --> 00:58:15,530
forgive me?

725
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,840
I should not have said that.

726
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:29,809
Myung Yoon.

727
00:58:30,949 --> 00:58:33,050
- I... - In the past, I did not know.

728
00:58:36,619 --> 00:58:38,050
But looking back,

729
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:43,059
I realize...

730
00:58:44,929 --> 00:58:48,559
that the two of you were in the same situation as us.

731
00:58:54,469 --> 00:58:55,539
As for forgiving you...

732
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:01,309
I think...

733
00:59:04,949 --> 00:59:05,949
I may be able...

734
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,150
to forgive you sometime...

735
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:13,760
in the future.

736
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,059
I will do it.

737
00:59:53,230 --> 00:59:54,260
No.

738
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,929
I want to do this.

739
00:59:58,900 --> 00:59:59,929
Just let me.

740
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,269
Is the situation very bad?

741
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:25,329
She wishes to see you.

742
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:24,590
I am sorry.

743
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,789
I really wanted...

744
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:31,559
to say this to you.

745
01:01:46,409 --> 01:01:47,610
Do not worry about your child.

746
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:55,050
Rest in peace.

747

(Min Soo Ryeon)

748
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:35,719
I pray that the two of you...

749
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:38,050
will be born at a better time...

750
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:40,619
in your next life and live happily ever after.

751
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,469
Your Majesty, she has decided...

752
01:04:32,409 --> 01:04:34,738
to become a Buddhist nun.

753
01:04:34,739 --> 01:04:36,038
(Gujokgye: Buddhist ordination ceremony)

754
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:37,650
Please kindly allow me...

755
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,619
to serve the two of you here...

756
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:42,750
while repenting for my past sins.

757
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:44,920
You have my permission to do so.

758
01:04:46,519 --> 01:04:48,420
I am much obliged, Your Majesty.

759
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:01,269
Let us get going now.

760
01:05:20,219 --> 01:05:21,889
Is he coming with us too?

761
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:25,489
Of course, he must accompany Lady Myung Yoon.

762
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:27,960
I am surprised he has stayed away for this long.

763
01:05:29,329 --> 01:05:30,329
My lady!

764
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,400
Darn it.

765
01:05:34,401 --> 01:05:36,638
- Nice, hurrah - Nice, hurrah

766
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:38,839
- This is nice - This is nice

767
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:41,679
Nice, let us have some fun

768

Look at those crazy fools.

780
01:06:23,619 --> 01:06:26,750
Guards, drag them out at once!

781
01:06:27,019 --> 01:06:28,019
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

782
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,800
I am the secret royal inspector...

783
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:39,099
- Oh, no. - My goodness.

784
01:06:39,969 --> 01:06:41,039
What are you doing?

785
01:06:45,909 --> 01:06:46,909

My lord!

Oh, boy.

791
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:13,070
It has only been a little while since she gave birth.

792
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:15,199
Please take it easy!

793
01:07:19,510 --> 01:07:20,539
You little...

794
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:23,780
Hey, you!

795
01:07:32,619 --> 01:07:33,889
Did my brother...

796
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:36,888
beat up the village heads again?

797
01:07:36,889 --> 01:07:37,989
Yes, Your Majesty.

798
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,400
We keep getting urgent requests to send new village heads.

799
01:07:44,699 --> 01:07:46,730
Two villages in Jeolla Province alone.

800

Three villages in Gyeongsang Province.

801
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:50,868
As for Chungcheong Province, there are many...

802
01:07:50,869 --> 01:07:52,369
Stop. That is enough!

803
01:07:54,539 --> 01:07:56,280
I cannot take this anymore.

804
01:08:06,389 --> 01:08:07,389
They are dead meat now.

805
01:08:09,559 --> 01:08:10,789
Your Majesty.

807
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,310
All right.

808
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:37,920
What are you doing?

809
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:39,989
Come out and help us.

810
01:08:42,119 --> 01:08:43,760
Our child peed.

811
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,828
Change the diaper quickly and give us a hand here.

812
01:08:47,829 --> 01:08:48,859
All right.

813
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:58,069
Go back to sleep, okay?

814
01:09:04,109 --> 01:09:05,109
All right.

815
01:09:07,619 --> 01:09:08,619
Let me see.

816
01:09:24,829 --> 01:09:26,369
Where did Gap Seok and Moo Baek go?

817
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:27,840
They went to buy some medicinal herbs.

818
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:30,068
All right.

819
01:09:30,069 --> 01:09:31,369
What can I do to help?

820
01:09:31,869 --> 01:09:33,970
We are here.

821
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:42,979

There is no need for such formalities.

823

Your grandfather is here.

824
01:10:06,069 --> 01:10:07,810
- Have you been keeping well? - Yes.

825
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:10,880
Mother, Father. Have you been keeping well too?

826
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:14,210
Yes. I see that you have a lot on your plate.

827
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:17,890
Peekaboo.

828
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,060
Peekaboo.

829
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:25,090
Peekaboo.

830

Your Majesty.

831
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:32,229
- What is the matter? - The King is...

832
01:10:32,899 --> 01:10:33,899
Your Majesty.

833
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:36,239
Your Majesty.

834
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:41,409

835
01:10:42,579 --> 01:10:45,979
