That's not what I expected
when I bought that for ya.

15
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:23,249
It's so unpredictable.
Sort of like you, Yun-sang.

16
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,126
-Hmm?
-Grandma, come on!

17
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,296
Stupid clock. Keep this up,
and you're going in the trash.

18
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,632
Oh, don't get upset.

19
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:34,594
If you're going to keep this thing around,
the least you can do is be nice.

20
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,721
Really? 'Cause I think
I should just throw it out.

21
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,431
I don't mean the clock.

22
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,643
-This thing over here.
-Ah, Grandma!

23
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:44,896
Say "ah!"

24
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,231
There you go.

25
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,649
Yun-sang!

26
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,151
-Hey, Yun-sang, come down here!
-Good morning.

27
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:52,362
What's taking him so long?

28
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,696
Yun-sang!

29
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,490
I'm coming! I'm coming!

30
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,492
-Ah, jeez!
-There you are, you brat!

31
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,327
-Your grandmother was calling for you!
-Hello.

32
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,789
-Yun-sang, help me bring this up.
-That's a fine-looking young man.

33
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,291
Attention, everyone.
The watermelon has arrived.

34
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,670
-Hello, ma'am.
-Goodness, did you go out to buy that?

35
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:11,297
You never seem to be out
when it's time to eat!

36
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,299
How can I leave when I gotta cook?

37
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:16,094
Grandma, I told you
not to go around carrying heavy things.

38
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,263
-I was out.
-Wow!

39
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,640
Here. Have some. "Ah!"

40
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,851
-Hmm?
-Mmm!

41
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,812
This soybean paste is excellent.

42
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,607
Look. You see these hands of mine?

43
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,569
Why is it that they never get
any fruit with flavor?

44
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,530
Who cares
when you raised such a lovely grandson?

45
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,949
Say "ah!" Try a bite. Yeah.

46
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:39,450
How is it?

47
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,244
-It's sweet!
-Good!

48
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,414
These hands chose
right for once? Cut some for the kids.

49
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,418
Hey, why don't you two
start a family already?

50
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,419
-Huh?
-What?

51
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,337
Yeah, leave your grannies here.

52
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:55,008
We'll live happily ever after,
teasing each other all day. How's that?

53
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,093
Sounds great!

54
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,470
We didn't have any luck
with husbands or children,

55
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,514
but we raised our grandchildren
well enough.

56
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,808
-Right.
-It should be our turn to have fun.

57
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,893
-Don't you think?
-Mmm.

58
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:05,810
-Yeah!
-Just us!

59
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:06,769

Se-kyung.

68
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,442
Mmm?

69
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,577
It's time to switch out
with Sung-jae.

70
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,756
Jin Se-kyung, you're under arrest

71
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,841
for the murders of Bae Jong-su
and Lee Jae-min.

72
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,930
I recommend you come with us quietly.
You have the right to remain silent.

73
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,934
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

74
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,477
-You can't do this.
-Let's go.

75
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,605
-You can't do this out of nowhere!
-Yun-sang!

76
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,315
-Se-kyung!
-Yun-sang!

77
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,900
-Se-kyung!
-Ms. Jin!

78
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,862
Se-kyung!
Let go of me! Se-kyung!

79
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,115
Se-kyung, Se-kyung.

80
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:46,327
How's it going?

81
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:49,622
There's no need for concern.

82
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,791
We're just safeguarding her
for a little bit, okay?

83
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,628
Can't have her acting
reckless now, can we?

84
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,381
The team leader will personally
watch over her because, you know,

85
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,426
the girl's clearly important.

86
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,388
Se-kyung! Se-kyung! Se-kyung!

87
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:35,710
Arriving at rally point
in one hour, over.

88
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,112
Hyung! Sung-jae!

89
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04,238
Yun-sang.

90
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,408
They just arrested Se-kyung.

91
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,743
Se-kyung? Why?

92
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:09,869
The JIU, they…

93
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:15,500
-Damn this fucking phone!
-It's gonna be okay.

94
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,754
Captain Kang, Yun-sang just said
that the JIU took Se-kyung this morning.

95
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:20,713
What?

96
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,384
They said something about
preventing "reckless acts."

97
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,177
What do they mean "reckless acts"?

98
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,137
They said
she has to wait until the--

99
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:31,891
Yun-sang.

100
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,394
Yun-sang, you there?

101
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,939
Get me the JIU control room.

102
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:40,566
We haven't been able
to get through since this morning.

103
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:47,323
NO SIGNAL

104
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,575
He said to pack
as lightly as possible.

105
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,370
Uh, so I'll return to pick you up.

106
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,788
-Ma'am?
-Oh, yes.

107
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:56,582
One more thing.
Use this phone from now on.

108
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:59,252
I'll get in touch with you.

109
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,093
Grandma, w… w… what did he say?

110
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,678
I don't know.

111
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,639
What did he mean? Where is he taking us?

112
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,352
Why is the signal gone?
Why won't it go through?

113
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,272
Oh sh--

114
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,358
Seriously, what the hell
is happening right now?

115
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:28,823
Father!

116
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,741
-I checked this morning.
-Yeah?

117
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,869
Someone called
and told Ms. Kim to get ready.

118
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:35,788
She's the mother of the chief of staff.
They're leaving. It's happening!

119
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,291
That means the chief of staff
is leaving too.

120
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:41,419
Yeah, but the whole thing is a little odd.

121
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:43,713
I'd assumed their driver
would know everything,

122
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,548
but he didn't even hear about it.

123
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,217
So they're really doing it.

124
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,846
Oh, it's Captain Kang.

125
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,014
Give me the phone.

126
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:55,725
Hey, In-a.

127
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,227
It looks like the operation
is happening today.

128
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,812
That's why they took Se-kyung.

129
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,231
Listen.

130
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,860
You have to move as fast as you can.
Do you hear me?

131
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,200
I couldn't remember
where I left the car keys.

132
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,326
Okay, I'll be back.

133
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,495
-Hurry up and go. Drive safely.
-Yeah.

134
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,704
Be careful!

135
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,924
It sure must be nice for Yun-sang.

136
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:29,717
How so?

137
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,596
Unlike us, he actually has a choice.

138
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,982
Hello?

139
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,068
Hey!

140
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,374
Oh, what brings you here?

141
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:48,337
What's that?

142
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,841
Take this drive. It's my research.

143
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,761
Ah!

144
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,310
Yes, of course. Go right ahead.

145
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:11,319
Listen up. Give this
to the chief of staff. Go right now.

146
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,209
Oh, Thomas.

147
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,088
It's a shame. Poor Clara.

148
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,300
She had to be so stubborn
up to the very end.

149
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,264
You were right, Father.

150
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,602
I'd like to come with you, but…

151
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,275
I can't leave without Se-kyung.

152
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:55,029
Persuade her for me.
I know she'll listen to you.

153
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,201
I now see my responsibility
to help build a world that survives.

154
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,040
But I could never leave on my own.

155
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,672
No. Of course you can't.

156
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,132
I understand.

157
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,927
What would life be without your Clara?

158
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,763
Thank you, Father. So…

159
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,771
-Sir?
-Jin Se-kyung.

160
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,481
Release her.

161
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,983
She will be coming with us.

162
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,610
Oh, yeah.

163
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,091
Team Leader!

164
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,059
Let's move it!

165
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,733
Looks like Ha Yun-sang
saved you, after all.

166
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:30,958
Captain!

167
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:32,960
Mess Sergeant.

168
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,254
Be careful.

169
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,006
-Captain.
-What? What?

170
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,471
Listen, I need to tell you something.
Something big.

171
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,055
What is it?

172
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,975
The ammunition the JIU keeps looking for…

173
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,311
First Sergeant Park buried it.

174
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,189
Sergeant Park,
I thought these guns and ammunition

175
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,815
were supposed to be sent to the SMU?

176
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,443
At first, I thought it was
a normal operation,

177
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:01,280
but when the sergeant was discharged
after the coup, I secretly dug them up

178
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,115
and moved them with Corporal Pang.

179
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,201
Are you telling me to move all of this?

180
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:08,621
Hey, if we tried moving all of this,
the world might just end tonight.

181
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,622
Uh, yeah.

182
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,499
-Are you trying to die?
-No, but--

183
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,042
What do you think we should take?

184
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,710
-The ammunition.
-Just the ammunition.

185
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,086
Pass it. Pass it, hurry.

186
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:20,674
First Sergeant Park
came to see me several times after that,

187
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,176
but I never told him anything.

188
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:25,429
These weapons, the ammunition…
It was always meant for the SMU.

189
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:28,057
So everything you've been doing
has been for this?

190
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,267
Even the chicken coops, then?

191
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,061
Guilty as charged.

192
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,364
In that case,
we'll keep them buried here for now.

193
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:45,908
Hmm.

194
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,451
Wait.

195
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,954
What? Buried?

196
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:51,539
Right here?

197
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:06,262
So how did you like the prison food?

198
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,099
I think they're out of rations too.
I didn't get anything.

199
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,435
You probably have better food
back at base.

200
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,528
Hmm. Shall we?

201
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,833
Ms. Jin hasn't called yet, right?

202
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:38,085
No, I tried calling her again.

203
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,129
She didn't text back either.

204
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,547
I don't care! He's coming with me!

205
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,507
That guy,
he was the one with the gold…

206
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,135
-He's dragging Young-ji away.
-We have to go now!

207
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,636
He--

208
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,812
-Hey, wake up.
-Huh?

209
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,272
Your passengers are here.

210
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,159
Are you leaving us behind?
Huh? Is it true?

211
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,664
You're abandoning us?
How dare you treat us this way!

212
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,166
Tell us where you're going!

213
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,543
What is this?
What the hell is going on, huh?

214
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,212
Are you all packed, Mother?

215
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,214
Uh, tell me.

216
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:26,258
Are you positive there are seats left?

217
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,346
Song said he'd come for us earlier,
but he's not here.

218
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,974
Listen, if there's space
on any of those flights

219
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,519
for an old lady like me,
In-tae should go instead.

220
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,772
So tell us where to go.

221
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:43,817
Don't worry. Mr. Song will be there soon
to bring you here. I'll see you then.

222
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,797
Grandma.

223
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,133
Are… are they r… r… really coming for us?

224
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,636
They're not going to come. We have to…

225
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,721
W… w… where to?

226
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,141
-The… US Army base?
-No, not there. No.

227
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:20,896
W… wherever it might be, I… I'm not going.

228
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,107
I… d… don't trust him.

229
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,694
In-tae, you are still his boy, okay?

230
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,030
He's your father.
He won't be leaving without you.

231
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,282
-I just…
-What is it?

232
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,910
I want to stay with you.

233
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:38,163
How could you say that?

234
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,624
This has been decided! Enough!

235
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,738
My fellow soldiers,

236
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,656
this is an emergency.

237
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,575
Everyone, wake up!

238
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,630
Welcome back, Father Baek!

239
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:34,303
I had hoped to offer some wine to you
as a welcome back gift.

240
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,889
It's a shame we don't have anything left!

241
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,060
Uh, Se-kyung. Se-kyung, where is she?

242
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,438
What? Not happy to see me, Father?

243
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,403
Long time no see, Father.

244
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,989
Father Woo, I need you to be honest here.

245
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,742
You're a bit angry, aren't you?
Why weren't you included?

246
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,536
You were left out of the big plan!

247
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,497
If anything, it's a relief.

248
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,749
My heart can't take
any more inner turmoil.

249
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,959
Though I am a little hurt, Father.

250
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,711
Uh, where… where's Clara?

251
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,422
Can you find her for me?
She's coming with us.

252
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,010
She's right here.

253
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:37,699
You told me I should confess my sins…
so that they won't pile up, right?

254
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,660
I have so much to confess.

255
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,830
Do you think you'll have time for this?

256
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:46,792
First,

257
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,046
I repent for the time
I ever doubted you, Father.

258
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,467
But there's still many things
I'm curious about.

259
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,253
Mr. Song.

260
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,338
It's been a while.

261
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:40,888
Let's have a chat.

262
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,483
Come here, you.

263
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,402
This is insane!

264
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,124
He's my source.

265
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,793
-You got all the info you need?
-Yeah.

266
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,796
-Can I broadcast from over there?
-Go ahead.

267
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,820
When Asteroid Dina hits,

268
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,406
pretty much everyone will die.

269
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,908
Everyone knows that.

270
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,369
But friends,
there's something you don't know.

271
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:48,372
Today might be the last chance
to escape this country

272
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:49,998
before it's destroyed.

273
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,377
No one's been able to sleep with
all the planes and helicopters, right?

274
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,920
Why do you think that is?

275
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,256
It's because there are
a few traitors among us

276
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,259
trying to crawl their way out
to save themselves.

277
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,386
The US military base?

278
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,554
That's not for us!

279
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,432
Do you think the elites
actually care about us?

280
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,768
No, that airstrip is much too exclusive.

281
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:13,230
It's been reserved by the good ol' USA
to get their people out.

282
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,357
It's not the military base.

283
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,317
It's the emergency airstrip.

284
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:20,028
Uh, aren't there still planes
at the US military base?

285
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,447
I know. It's a distraction.

286
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,202
-Check your maps and get ready to move.
-What's your plan?

287
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,161
We avoid a shootout

288
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,622
by getting all the Woongcheon citizens
to stop the takeoff.

289
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,665
What comes after that?

290
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,334
We get as many kids on board as we can.

291
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:37,963
That's good.

292
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:42,175
We move out quickly,
in coordination, without chaos.

293
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:45,762
I can't promise there won't be any chaos,
but that's the plan.

294
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,431
Given the situation,

295
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,975
what's a little more chaos?

296
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,143
I agree, sir!

297
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,399
Why can't I get through?

298
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,568
This is driving me crazy.

299
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,906
Are there any clocks in this dump?

300
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,743
Hey, you. What time is it?

301
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,579
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just go. Forget it.

302
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,206
Excuse me. Excuse me, Doctor.

303
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,752
I thought you were just
taking out the kid's appendix!

304
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,047
Are you planning
to keep him in there all day, or what?

305
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,675
I'm sorry, sir.
We're trying to get anesthetics.

306
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,219
-Huh?
-But the phones aren't working.

307
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:29,806
What do you…
What about Young-han's surgery, then?

308
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,601
I'll keep calling.

309
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,562
-Close the door.
-How are--

310
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,938
Uh, excuse me.

311
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,280
Deputy Mayor! Deputy!

312
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,032
What? Wait, wait, wait!

313
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,618
Don't tell me they've already--

314
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,745
I'm right here!

315
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,831
Oh, oh! Are you okay?
They haven't caught you yet?

316
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,958
I should've
quit this job a long time ago.

317
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,877
Ah! It's crazy out there!

318
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,171
Everyone's rioting
and running over to the airstrip!

319
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,090
-Airstrip?
-Yes!

320
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,342
-What airstrip?
-The emergency airstrip!

321
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,928
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Let's go!

322
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,596
Yes, okay. Let's go. Come on.

323
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,015
Sister, what's the situation
at the church?

324
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:15,185
Uh… I think she's still negotiating.

325
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,657
There's more.

326
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,700
I have another sin to confess.

327
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:39,084
Captain, we're
approaching the emergency airstrip.

328
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,710
Good, just follow my orders.

329
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:59,479
-Yeah! It's going!
-What are you waiting for?

330
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:00,522
It's going!

331
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:37,476
Who are these people?
They aren't from the training center.

332
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,895
-Get out of here. Turn around!
-Shit.

333
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,190
-We're not leaving. Just drive. Drive!
-Watch for threats.

334
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:46,610
There are troops supporting them.
I thought you handled this, Major Jang!

335
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:49,404
-What the hell is going on here?
-It's Kang In-a's unit.

336
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:53,200
-Drive through them. Run 'em over!
-Stop! Don't turn around! Keep going!

337
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,834
Major Jang, you were
supposed to take their ammunition.

338
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,795
I did. Their guns are empty.
I took all their ammunition.

339
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,130
Let's go! Come on!

340
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,179
Do not engage! Stand your ground!

341
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,224
Well? Is the plane here yet?

342
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,236
It's gotta be somewhere.

343
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:44,209
Okay, enough of that.

344
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:48,004
Father,
I repent for this sin as well.

345
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,682
Draw your weapons.

346
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,312
Damn it! I can't see a thing!

347
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,482
-I'll try getting through.
-Come here. Just wait here, okay?

348
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,323
-Honey, where are you going?
-Stay here for now.

349
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,741
What's going on?

350
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:18,994
Stay in the car.

351
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:25,584
Stay here, Ha-yul.

352
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,762
-Everybody okay?
-Woo-chan, are you okay?

353
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,099
Hey, Ha-yul! Get over here!

354
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,476
-Woo-chan, wait.
-Ha-yul, where are you going?

355
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,312
Get in! Hurry up!

356
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,023
Get in.
Get in and close the door.

357
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,526
Jin-seo, you get in too.
Is everyone in?

358
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,578
Oh my God!
Why are they shooting? Why?

359
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,510
Stand down, or we'll fire! Stand down!

360
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,012
Go back!

361
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:23,642
You bastards! You think I'm scared of you?
Huh? Stand down!

362
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:28,980
Shoot us, you cowards!
Go ahead and shoot! Shoot!

363
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:30,732
Shoot us!

364
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,941
Clara.

365
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,779
That's enough confession.
Let's continue with this later.

366
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,657
Oh no. I finish what I start.

367
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,241
Clara.

368
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,868
Where's Chief of Staff Cho Gwang-hyeon?

369
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,705
Ah, could it be you don't know?

370
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,583
Where are you boarding the flight?

371
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,128
There's only one military aircraft
at the US base.

372
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,382
There isn't enough space
to transport everyone who bought a ticket.

373
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:59,177
Clara, why are you throwing
this precious opportunity away?

374
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,186
All you'd have to do is give one order.

375
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:11,356
One order, and every child
in Woongcheon would have a spot.

376
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:22,158
I don't have the power to do that.

377
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:43,930
This was your last chance
to save yourself, and you threw it away.

378
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,308
I'm sorry, Father,

379
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,811
but the truth is we tricked you here.

380
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,689
What?

381
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:08,121
Father, please,
just take the children.

382
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,167
Let him go.

383
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,252
Father!

384
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,679
We can't even
get on the road to the airstrip.

385
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,514
It's completely blocked with cars.

386
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,807
Stop, stop, stop!

387
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,895
There's no need to go that way.
I'll make a call.

388
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,734
Oh. Hi, Mark.

389
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,278
Auntie, look.
It's an airplane! Wow!

390
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:41,863
Mom, there's an airplane.

391
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,246
What? Look at the airstrip!

392
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,340
Glide slope, glide slope.

393
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,968
We're dead men already!
Think I'm afraid of your bullets?

394
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,470
Shoot me!

395
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:21,236
Pull up.
Terrain ahead. Pull up.

396
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,003
Over here! Over here!

397
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,588
Come back!

398
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,799
Come back!

399
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,468
There are children still here!

400
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,970
Come back!

401
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,806
Come back!

402
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:21,796
Excuse me.

403
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,344
Excuse me.

404
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,056
-Oh. Hi, Mark.
-Oh, hello.

405
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,397
We can't leave yet.

406
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,400
My children are still on their way.

407
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,905
Can't you go any faster?
We have to go faster.

408
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,115
Where's the entrance?

409
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,451
You were the reason
I was able to hold on.

410
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,537
I wanted to believe it wasn't true
until the very end.

411
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:57,040
What part of "faster"
do you not understand?

412
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:01,878
But now I don't have a reason
to hold on anymore.

413
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,173
There! It's right over there.

414
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:17,685
Take off right now.

415
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:28,988
Wait!

416
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:30,907
Damn it!

417
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,368
No!

418
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,037
Ah! Not yet!

419
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,058
It can't be!

420
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:02,355
Come back! You can't leave me here!

421
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,817
You can't!

422
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:42,311
The JIU is withdrawing.
What should we do?

423
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,858
Captain, we're awaiting your orders.

424
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,693
Captain?

425
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,698
Let them go.

426
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:58,411
Send all the people there back home,
then return to base.

427
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,554
SURGERY IN PROGRESS

428
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,727
This is breaking news.

429
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,438
The military transport aircraft
that took off today

430
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,442
from the Woongcheon US military base
for a safety zone in the United States

431
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,694
crashed into the Pacific Ocean.

432
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:18,699
Search and rescue operations are underway,
but so far, no survivors have been found.

433
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:20,535
I repeat.

434
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,162
The military transport aircraft
that took off today

435
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:26,833
from the Woongcheon US military base
for a safety zone in the United States

436
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,377
crashed into the Pacific Ocean.

437
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,378
The cause of--

438
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,559
G… Grandma.

439
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,939
Wow, it's getting chilly.

440
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,691
-Here's your coffee.
-Thank you.

441
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,359
Is this spot okay?

442
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,862
Yeah, it's nice.

443
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:39,989
Fire's going.

444
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,291
Do you recall?

445
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:52,752
About five years ago,

446
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:56,505
our apartment was so old,
the paint was chipping off

447
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,258
to the point where the buildings
all looked identical.

448
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,553
The kids couldn't find their way home
and didn't know what to do.

449
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,806
"Wait, is it this one?
Is it that one?"

450
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,891
That's right.

451
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,312
Then one kid drew arrows on the street

452
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,273
because he thought
it'd help him find his way home.

453
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,358
I remember that.

454
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,902
So then all the other kids
started doing it.

455
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,571
And pretty soon,
the whole street was covered in arrows.

456
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,530
It was a mess there.

457
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:24,158
Oh boy! Things were funny back then, huh?

458
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,160
Dumb kids.

459
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:29,830
At the very least, they should be
remembering how to get back.

460
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,749
Did they have to make a mess
on the street?

461
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:32,708
You forgot.

462
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:39,173
The entire thing was Min-ho's idea.
Drawing arrows on the street.

463
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,761
He got some chalk from his school
and started drawing arrows.

464
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,012
Impressive ones.

465
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,682
You got annoyed then too.

466
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:59,360
Before we left, you were, uh,
cleaning up his room, right?

467
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,322
-You noticed that?
-Of course I did.

468
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:06,617
How could I not notice
with all that clattering around?

469
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,663
I guess so.

470
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,836
He was such a kind boy.

471
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,423
Our Min-ho.

472
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,678
Just a little longer,

473
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,640
and the three of us can be together again.

474
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,544
-Yeah! Get a load of these, eh?
-Whoa!

475
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,755
I call these
spaceship rice cakes, eh?

476
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,340
What? He's just being silly.

477
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,259
Look, these are genuine North Korean
rice cakes. Pretty big, huh?

478
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,178
They look like spaceships, right?

479
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,888
I'm getting in the holiday spirit!

480
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,599
-All done! Check 'em out!
-Whoa!

481
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,851
-They came out pretty!
-They look delicious!

482
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,561
-Oh yeah!
-Yeah. You see?

483
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:17,438
The spaceship cakes look the best, right?

484
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,566
-I'll try one.
-Here it comes! Eh?

485
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:23,652
Hey, try a bite. That's it!
That's right, yeah.

486
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:26,989
-The spaceships are good! They're good!
-Goodness.

487
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,325
Cold. It's cold!

488
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:32,578
Ugh! Water's valuable.
You can't use it all, okay?

489
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,080
As if that'll make you rich.

490
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,045
Our last Mid-Autumn Festival.

491
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,466
Do you think
we should celebrate this year?

492
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,427
Mid-Autumn or New Year's.

493
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:52,473
It's empty without the kids.
I'm sad again.

494
00:39:56,143 --> 00:39:59,355
How about we watch something together?

495
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,902
Like a disgusting horror movie
where everyone gets killed.

496
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,030
What's the point
of watching everyone get killed on TV?

497
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,490
It's so depressing.

498
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,660
Oh, I don't know.

499
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,829
I figured if we watch that,

500
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,165
we can at least say
that even with the asteroid,

501
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,709
it's still a lot better
than dying like that.

502
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,421
Are you kidding?

503
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:26,590
We'd be fools to watch movies
at a time like this.

504
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,135
Who cares if we're fools?

505
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,763
At least
we're fools together, right?

506
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,931
Of course.

507
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,059
Death.

508
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,271
Destruction.

509
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,398
Pain.

510
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,066
Life.

511
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,944
-Dude, we'll be dead at 14.
-Life!

512
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,487
Why are you laughing?

513
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,365
-Stand and fire!
-Stand and fire!

514
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,786
-Return!
-Return!

515
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,831
-Kneeling fire!
-Kneeling fire!

516
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:07,173

517
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,265

00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:36,577
Yes, okay.

523
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,871
Jeez!
Look at all the stuff they had.

524
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,956
How much do you think it's worth?

525
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,044
She could've
shared this sooner, right?

526
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,546
You should be happy
she's sharing it with us now.

527
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,299
Hurry up and take it
before she changes her mind.

528
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,134
Thank you, rich lady!

529
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,429
Hey, what are you staring at?

530
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,931
You're young and strong.

531
00:41:57,014 --> 00:42:00,100
Come out of there
and help us carry all of this, huh?

532
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:01,936
Hey.

533
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,862
-Keep them separate, then count.
-Wow, the rich do live differently, huh?

534
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,989
There, there, there.

535
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:16,700
Oh, Sister,
can you lend me a hand?

536
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,202
Look at all the stuff!

537
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:21,997
-I know. We finally have rice again.
-That's the last of the rice.

538
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,833
-Should we finish dividing it?
-He'll come.

539
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,461
My son will come.

540
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,879
I know he will.

541
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,467
-That's what he said before he--
-You saw the news, didn't you?

542
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,515
This must be divine punishment, isn't it?

543
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,641
Yeah.

544
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,810
Your mistakes led you here.

545
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,229
You created a lot of suffering
for everyone.

546
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,773
You made my grandma's life so difficult.

547
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,821
I lived my life wrong, didn't I?

548
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:58,742
Even so, I thought I'd at least
raised my own son not to.

549
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,745
It's all right.

550
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:05,958
None of us have been abandoned.

551
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,335
Huh?

552
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,880
Instead, everyone here survived.

553
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,184
What do you think?

554
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,520
This place is pretty big.
Think it'll be enough?

555
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,606
Yeah, this is great.

556
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,483
Thanks for arranging this place for me.

557
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,819
Of course. I'm happy to help.

558
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,034
Yun-sang,

559
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,621
this project of yours sounds pretty fun.

560
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:49,960
You writing down everyone's stories.
It's like a time capsule.

561
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:54,006
Yeah, I've been coming up
with fun ideas for our town.

562
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,509
I have a few others in mind, too,
for my spare time.

563
00:43:57,593 --> 00:44:01,639
You know, I'm not sure you'll have any.
Over 200 people have already applied.

564
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:02,681
Huh?

565
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,684
Take your time looking around.

566
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,189
Oh. Ah, hello.

567
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,692
Do you have
the documents I asked for last time?

568
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,319
I'll have them ready
by this afternoon.

569
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:17,655
The afternoon?
Sure, there's no need to rush.

570
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:23,994
-Have you eaten?
-Oh, it's all right.

571
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,330
I'll have some lunch later.

572
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,800
-What did you think?
-That was amazing.

573
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:38,759
Oh, hello.

574
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,011
It's cold today.

575
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:43,931
Hello. Oh, you came!

576
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:47,101
-I had a craving for this.
-The hand-pulled dough soup is amazing.

577
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,977
Wait, wait, wait. Come over here.

578
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:50,979
-Hello.
-Hello, Sister.

579
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,940
Have you heard the news?

580
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,109
It's about Father Woo.

581
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,302
Father? It's time to eat.

582
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:37,568
From now on, you don't have to worry
about bringing me my meals.

583
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,612
Starting today, I'll manage the church
as just a layperson.

584
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:41,613
Lay--

585
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,824
Layperson?

586
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,951
Manage the church?

587
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,621
I already sent in my resignation.

588
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,083
Father!

589
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:57,254
Please, Father. Father!
Father, this isn't right at all!

590
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,214
There's no way
the parish elders would allow it!

591
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,799
What parish elders?

592
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,218
The bishop and the head nun
are in a nursing home.

593
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,304
Oh, Father, you can't! Please!

594
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,347
How can you even think of doing this?

595
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,682
I've been with you since…

596
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,268
ever since you were
in seminary school, haven't I?

597
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,813
I know you're very upset by this,
but I'm sorry.

598
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,941
You can't! Father, you can't!
You just can't!

599
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,568
Father! Father!

600
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:23,572
Just what are we
supposed to do now, Yun-sang?

601
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:24,698
This is a disaster!

602
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,075
The Cheondong Church won't have a priest!

603
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,119
Father, please!

604
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:33,874
What's this about?

605
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,543
You should've at least told me.

606
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,922
Well, I thought
you would've guessed, Yun-sang.

607
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:46,845
Another surprise stunt.
You love doing this, don't you?

608
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:49,473
Surprise stunts? As if.

609
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:53,018
What are you talking about?
You think I could plan anything right now?

610
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,438
I guess, maybe not, but still…

611
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:58,857
Oh, wait.

612
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,067
What?

613
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,864
Oh, hello.

614
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:13,038
Did you… get any sleep last night?

615
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:15,582
None.

616
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:23,298
He kept repeating the same thing
over and over again all night.

617
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:25,843
I was going insane.

618
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:28,762
Hyung.

619
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:32,975
You should record him, hyung.
Record it and play it for him.

620
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:37,020
Show that crazy man
how crazy he's become.

621
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,313
Petty little…

622
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,815
You're crazy!

623
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,650
You do it, then.

624
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:50,450
Hyung.

625
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:56,874
Here you go.

626
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:00,168
-Thank you for the food.
-Enjoy your meal.

627
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,128
I will.

628
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,629
-Father.
-Ah, yes.

629
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,715
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you, Sister.

630
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,431
Mr. Woo Sung-jae.

631
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:13,974
I hear you ditched the robes.

632
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,061
They've all heard the news.

633
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,563
You know already?

634
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,773
If Sister Regina knows,
then everyone knows.

635
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:22,983
Huh?

636
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,485
Is someone talking about me?

637
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,035
You see that, huh?

638
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,454
He quit an hour ago
and already forgot how to pray.

639
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,916
You know, I'm actually glad
that you're back to just Sung-jae.

640
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:39,875
You look good.

641
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,293
Mmm.

642
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:43,211
You're right.

643
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,088
Let's eat.

644
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,775
