1
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:11,136
It makes perfect sense
that the owner of an empty supermarket

2
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,264
is holding a gun
so no one will steal anything.

3
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:20,311
In our world,
law and common sense isn't important.

4
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,271
Mmm?

5
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,107
-It's all about how happy you are, hon.
-Mmm.

6
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,862
Is there any point to living

7
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,032
in this kind of world?

8
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:34,784
Uh,

9
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:39,831
so if we're all gonna die anyway
when the asteroid hits,

10
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:40,874
you think

11
00:00:42,709 --> 00:00:44,919
that we should just kill ourselves, hmm?

12
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,088
And besides,

13
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,467
knowing those assholes
are gonna die, too, is nice.

14
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,469
They make me sick.

15
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,930
Why don't we just do it?

16
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,641
Why wait for the asteroid, huh?

17
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,643
Unni, no.

18
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,315
Here, have this.
You're drinking like a fish tonight.

19
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,457
Bae Jong-su.

20
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:26,920
I didn't do it.

21
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,342
It was you.

22
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:07,335

Oh, unni.

36
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,464
Oh, you startled me, Se-kyung.

37
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,925
Good morning.

38
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,219
I'll get you some food.

39
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:41,763
-I already put some stuff together.
-Hold on. Uh…

40
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,058
I just came to say hi.

41
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,229
Did you?

42
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,522
What do you want?

43
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:54,901
Se-kyung.

44
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:57,654
Never mind.

45
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:00,073
Se-kyung!

46
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:01,783
Huh?

47
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,370
I'm leaving soon, okay?

48
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,372
I'm going home.

49
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,403
When was this taken?

50
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,781
Aw, so cute.

51
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,369
Why are all these photos out, hmm?

52
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,123
I wanted to archive our lives.

53
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,416
Keep some memories.

54
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,211
For the aliens to see?

55
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,171
Correct.

56
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:01,592
Hmm? Wait a minute. Does that…
Are you archiving our fights, too, then?

57
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,636
Of course I'll skip all that.

58
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,888
You better do that, or else…

59
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,352
-I'll be leaving all of this research.
-Hmm.

60
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,771
But I wanted to include
some other things too.

61
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:16,649
Hmm.

62
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,610
-Are you going to work?
-Mmm.

63
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,238
-I'll give you a ride.
-Are you leaving too?

64
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,906
Yeah, I'm meeting Professor No.

65
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,828
I'd listen to this song
every day while I was in the US.

66
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,248
It always reminded me of you.

67
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,251
I kept it on my phone.

68
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,463
-Pretty sweet, aren't I?
-Mmm.

69
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,519
Yun-sang.

70
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,021
Huh?

71
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,899
They want you… to go back.

72
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,943
Go where?

73
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,152
You know you should.

74
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,366
You need to leave and save yourself.

75
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,410
The lab needs you.

76
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,204
You'll be safe in the US.

77
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,998
-Se-kyung, how could I ever--
-Wait.

78
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,879
-Let's discuss it later, then.
-Uh, no, just…

79
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:05,091
Mmm, um, thanks for driving me. Take care.

80
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:07,677
I'll be leaving, then.

81
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:09,637
Se-kyung…

82
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,139
Se--

83
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:13,599
See ya.

84
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,134
Hmm.

85
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,409
You have to stop thinking about this.
Everything's done, Se-kyung.

86
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,661
All right?

87
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,579
We didn't have anything to do with it.

88
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,123
Neither of us were involved,
and there's no reason

89
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,668
for either a teacher
or an officer to be there.

90
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,253
Understood?

91
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,368
-Morning.
-Hold up.

92
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,662
What?

93
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,790
Do you remember the last time
you saw Father Baek in the church?

94
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,838
It was in the evening on the day
the military took him away. He was here.

95
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,924
I recall seeing him
in the church hall praying on his own,

96
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,467
as you were just now.

97
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,640
After that, both he
and the administrator disappeared.

98
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:04,520
So I think that they must've left
at the same time and are hiding together.

99
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,481
It can't be a coincidence.
That's what I think, anyway.

100
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,233
And you're sure about this?

101
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,487
I just wanna hear the facts right now.

102
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,949
Oh. All business now, are we?

103
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,410
I'm being honest.

104
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:21,704
I've shared everything I know, okay?

105
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,913
I have nothing else.

106
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,881
They're all signed,
so you can just hand 'em out.

107
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:42,141
I heard you work with more than
just floating bunkers around here.

108
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:47,104
That you offer special consultations
for people with the right qualifications.

109
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:49,565
A way to escape.

110
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,402
So you know.

111
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:57,198
Escaping's not what's important right now.
That's a given.

112
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,241
Great guys like you,

113
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,118
you deserve quality.

114
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,666
You likely already know
all of us elite are gonna leave this city.

115
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,336
Let's see.

116
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,800
Here. Global capital wants to utilize
Korea's technology and resourcefulness

117
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:17,885
in the post-asteroid world.

118
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,097
So all of these big shots here
are preparing for that moment.

119
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,476
Whoa! Didn't mean to smile that big.

120
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,269
Oops!

121
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,859
Uh, so we first have
to make sure to weigh this

122
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:37,488
because the recipe says
500 grams of curry powder.

123
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:40,282
Oh goodness. My hands
can feel the weight, all right? Okay!

124
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,827
I can't remember
the last time I ate this well.

125
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,495
Are we done with the meat yet?

126
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,080
Ooh! It smells good, huh?

127
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,416
-We haven't eaten this well in so long.
-I know!

128
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,838
Thanks to Mrs. Kim,
who's given us hope today,

129
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,674
you all have your daily bread right here.

130
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,551
-Thanks so much.
-Ah! Yes, thank you.

131
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:01,053
It'll be a great morale boost
after the fire.

132
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,764
That speaker said that…

133
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,769
…that all of the money was taken up.

134
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,526
I heard it went to some kind of company.
What do you think?

135
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,907
-You ought to stir that.
-Ah, yeah.

136
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,994
Oh! This smells amazing!

137
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,078
Mmm.

138
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,251
A priest can't suspect a fellow priest.

139
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,797
If there was a competition
to pick the most indecisive person

140
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,883
in the world, I'd be the one to beat.

141
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,720
That would never happen.

142
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,765
They'd be too indecisive
to ever commit to any competition.

143
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,933
So what are you gonna do about this?

144
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,812
I'm just so frustrated.

145
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,065
Hyung.

146
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,448
Have we talked about what my lab studied?

147
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:07,578
We looked for patterns
in all sorts of genetic variations.

148
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:12,082
And… at the embryonic stage,
you sometimes find genetic defects.

149
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,751
Our research was on how to alter them.

150
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,880
So that's why they're so interested
in taking you to the US.

151
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,508
What are you planning to do?

152
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,344
Are you gonna go with them?

153
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:31,560
I wanna finish my work,

154
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,562
but…

155
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,023
You can't leave Se-kyung behind.

156
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,048
SURVIVOR COUNSELING REPORT

157
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,258
Okay, let's see.

158
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:48,888
Originally, I was with my family…
…when I entered the facility.

159
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,347
A facility sent me there,

160
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,934
but I have no idea what happened
after I went into the training center.

161
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,604
Those memories are completely gone.

162
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,898
Managers kept a close watch…

163
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:10,826
TRAINING CENTER MANAGER IM?

164
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,293
The number you have called
does not exist.

165
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,003
Please hang up and try again…

166
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,756
What's this training center?

167
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,219
-It's nice to see ya.
-Hello there.

168
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,721
-Hi!
-How's it going?

169
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:31,722
Meow!

170
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,766
-Oh, this way.
-Meow, meow.

171
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,268
-Let's go inside.
-Here I come, kitty!

172
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,854
-Tae-mi. Tae-mi, Tae-mi.
-Meow. Meow. Tae-mi.

173
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,985
Tae-mi, Tae-mi, Tae-mi.

174
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,696
I heard that people
have been stealing pets these days.

175
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,990
-I'll take that.
-I thought they'd all get eaten.

176
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,533
-Tae-mi, I love you.
-Unni.

177
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,868
-Hmm?
-Can Tae-mi have some?

178
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,203
You wanna play chase?

179
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,164
They had a couple of extra cans
at the supermarket.

180
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,208
They're still good. Haven't expired yet.

181
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,878
Mmm, she's never had this,
but I think it's okay.

182
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,713
That's it. Good, Tae-mi.

183
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,591
Tae-mi's mine. Hey, I'm holding her!

184
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,843
-Thanks. Just leave it there.
-Mmm.

185
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,554
Your family, they moved in here
a while ago. Right, unni?

186
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:13,973
Mmm.

187
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,102
I went to high school and college
at a city pretty far away.

188
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,188
Since I was gone and never home,

189
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,399
I only met Ms. Jin
when I came back recently.

190
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:27,277
You were a good student, I suppose?
Did you choose the college?

191
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,737
I guess so.

192
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,990
I just chose the one with the best dorms.

193
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,910
You can say that
'cause you had such great grades.

194
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,620
The rest of us don't have a choice.

195
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,747
You can't choose if you fail everything.

196
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,832
True.

197
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,042
-I want a jellybean!
-Unni?

198
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,795
Is that your brother in the photo?

199
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,592
Yeah.

200
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,721
Oh! You two look alike.

201
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,765
Why is your dad's face…

202
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,476
Um, did your dad, um…

203
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,481
Uh, they're still alive.
It's just… they live somewhere else.

204
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,484
Wait a sec. He looks familiar.

205
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,199
Uh, Chae Young-han.

206
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,453
He left after our first semester
and went to a different school.

207
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:18,996
You know Young-han?

208
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,040
-Oh yeah!
-Right.

209
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,042
He was really good at the cello.

210
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,376
He played a lot.

211
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,961
Mm-hmm.

212
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,588
Where did the little ones go?

213
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,923
-This way.
-Hae-chan? Woo-chan?

214
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,008
Soft.

215
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:33,677
We're playing with the kitty.

216
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,262
She's so fluffy!

217
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,018
Hey, unni?

218
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,104
Where did your brother go?

219
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,273
Uh, he's, um…

220
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,275
Our mother took…

221
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,863
I… I liked meeting all of you today.

222
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,740
Thanks for saying hello.

223
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,366
Right before he went away,

224
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,369
he wanted me to go
to this training center with him, so…

225
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,371
He even gave me a pamphlet for it.

226
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,124
But, of course, my dad wouldn't let me go.

227
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,630
I think I like kitty cats
more than dogs.

228
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:10,964
What's your favorite?

229
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,754
Young-han, come with me.

230
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:51,839
Let's go home.

231
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,135
I don't think Mom would be
too happy about that.

232
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,594
She'd go crazy on us.

233
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,348
It's a good time for us to leave.

234
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:05,561
Mother won't suspect anything.
Don't worry. I'll come get you.

235
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,899
I'll go and find some people
who can help us out, okay?

236
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,693
No one knows about your phone, right?

237
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,404
Mm-mm.

238
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,128
This place is so remote. Jesus.

239
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:37,926
Hello?

240
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,138
Yeah, I'll be right there.

241
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:43,849
What?

242
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,477
Oh, hang on.
What do you mean today won't work?

243
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,354
I'm already here!

244
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,359
Well, I'm at…

245
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,945
I'm almost there.

246
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,657
What? They want to meet tomorrow?

247
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,994
How would I know
what your father's thinking?

248
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,787
I don't even wanna know.

249
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,831
What if he gets into trouble?

250
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,877
If he makes trouble…

251
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,048
then you and I are gonna leave him.

252
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,300
Booyah!

253
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,140
You know, I'm scared when he's around

254
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,601
and when he's out of sight.

255
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,982
Some tteokbokki
would be so good right now.

256
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,943
♪ The glory of eternal life ♪

257
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,238
♪ Is brimming within my heart ♪

258
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,950
♪ The glory of eternal life
We shout with all our might ♪

259
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:47,371
♪ Let us sing our praise
For a brand-new world ♪

260
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,122
Eternal strength and…

261
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,290
-Push back!
-Here we go!

262
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,493
Hey, Mom?

263
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,080
What if the asteroid never hits us?

264
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:32,541
Huh?

265
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,670
What if it disappears,
or the scientists got it wrong?

266
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:00,986
I wanna live at home
with my mom, Woo-chan, and Ga-eul.

267
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,991
Woo-chan practiced hard at the jump rope.

268
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:09,369
And now, we can easily get up
to the 24th floor.

269
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,959
When will my mom and Ga-eul come back?

270
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,338
I miss them.

271
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,391
When Asteroid Dina hits,

272
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:34,311
pretty much everyone will die.

273
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:38,315
But some won't even live long enough
to die with the rest of us.

274
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,526
Hello, friends.

275
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,737
Another day passes.

276
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,324
What can we do
with the time that we have left?

277
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:54,206
The fire that burned down our church
and all of the missing extension funds.

278
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,083
Aren't you curious?

279
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:58,668
What's the link between these events?

280
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,215
I can only wonder
if the truth will ever be revealed.

281
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,216
Hyeon-jae.

282
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:05,967
Private Na Hyeon-jae.

283
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,762
It's hot today. How about some water?

284
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,180
I'm fine, sir.

285
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,100
Aren't these chickens so funny here?

286
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,062
They thought they were gonna get eaten,
but they're living in luxury instead.

287
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,980
You lucky little chickens.

288
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,277
And when I see 'em all right here,

289
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,948
I feel like everything will be all right.

290
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,575
I learn from the chickens.

291
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,995
I try to be present.

292
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,789
Eat, exercise, and live well.

293
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,417
Oh, the chickens.

294
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,252
Ah! I think it's feeding time soon.

295
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,629
But aren't those chilies spicy?

296
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:44,589
They can't taste spice, so it's all right.

297
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,508
It all makes sense now!

298
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,969
Giving them gochujang…
Bok-sun is a smart lady.

299
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:49,970
Bok-sun?

300
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,556
An anime chicken.

301
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,099
Ah.

302
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:12,993
Um, hello?

303
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,164
Anybody there?

304
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,793
Young-han?

305
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,754
Young-han.

306
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,799
Young-han! Young-han!

307
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,179
Chae Young-ji.

308
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,314
Enough of this.
It's time to come back.

309
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,066
Don't do this.

310
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:30,946
Please just let Young-han go.

311
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:36,326
I beg you! Please don't keep him
locked up there in that crazy place!

312
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:40,580
I'm hanging up now.

313
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,596
Tae-mi.

314
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:01,685
Unni, are you okay? Are you sick?

315
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,186
I just, uh…

316
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:04,854
I got a call just now.

317
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:08,358
-What? What's going on?
-It's so…

318
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,279
I didn't wanna cry
until I could rescue him.

319
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,372
Help me!

320
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:25,667
It's Yo… it's Young-ji!

321
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,464
What's wrong, huh? What is it?

322
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:34,342
Here, sit down. You're okay.

323
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,429
Here. What? Tell me, okay?

324
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,097
-Ms. Jin…
-Yeah?

325
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,265
Young-han, he…

326
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,350
-Yeah?
-…called from the training center.

327
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,769
-Calm down. It's okay.
-He couldn't say anything.

328
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:45,979
And mother was…

329
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,272
The training center?

330
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,773
Relax, huh?

331
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,735
I got a call from my brother.

332
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:54,195
Young-ji, your brother
is at the training center?

333
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:58,783
Is that where you were staying?

334
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,119
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

335
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,039
Tell me more about this training center.

336
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:18,470
WOOYANG TRAINING CENTER

337
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:24,392
In-a.

338
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,729
Chae Young-ji, okay.

339
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,565
-Do you know where she was staying?
-Huh?

340
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,401
So you know the girls
that we rescued and took in?

341
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:36,279
There were three girls among them

342
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,616
who said they were from a facility
I thought was a kids' home.

343
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,118
I'm realizing now
that it's something else.

344
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,579
I was so out of it during the church fire

345
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,873
that I couldn't see everything
that was happening.

346
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,334
It was all right there, but I just--

347
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,545
You gotta slow down
and start again from the top.

348
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,506
Just breathe, Se-kyung, okay?

349
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,424
-So what's going on?
-Mmm.

350
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:02,722
The girls you brought in, In-a.

351
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,433
Bae Jong-su,
Lee Jae-min's victims, those girls…

352
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,310
The girls had all been at this…

353
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:10,146
It was a health
and education business originally.

354
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:11,981
Not anymore.

355
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:15,568
That business is now a cult that targets
young kids and their families.

356
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,070
There are kids trapped there, In-a.

357
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:20,073
I think the cult's scheming
to secretly evacuate the country.

358
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,744
The brothel's girls were all in that cult.
They tried to leave.

359
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,579
Innocent kids are stuck there.

360
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,667
Listen to me. Young-ji was crying earlier
and then told me about it.

361
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,753
You had to donate all of your assets
in order to be admitted.

362
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:38,466
That would buy you a ticket for migration
for you and your family to leave.

363
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,886
Originally, I was with my family

364
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,556
when I entered the facility.

365
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:48,685
She saw it firsthand. She ran away
and tried to rescue her little brother!

366
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,811
Wait a second.

367
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,146
No, that can't be it.

368
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,773
You… you're imagining things again.

369
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,609
-Don't look for patter--
-How could you say that? It's not that!

370
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,448
I understand
that you're in a tough situation.

371
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,033
I get it.

372
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,370
Your unit's been under
strict surveillance. In-a!

373
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,373
The higher-ups may not care. Yeah?

374
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,042
It doesn't mean that you shouldn't care!

375
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,503
Besides, can't we just
evoke Martial Law, huh?

376
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,588
Come on!

377
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:18,923
How can you…

378
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,469
-You saw how many bruises Young-ji had.
-And if you're wrong about it?

379
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,428
Huh?

380
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,472
Looking into situations is one thing.

381
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,807
Martial Law is
something else entirely, all right?

382
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,893
-And what happens if I'm right?
-What?

383
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,352
In-a, I saw a name.

384
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:32,896
"Manager Im."

385
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:36,065
He's with Bae Jong-su, Lee Jae-min,
those guys. I'm sure of it.

386
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,568
He's in their pocket,
managing the training center.

387
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,738
I know you believe me.

388
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:43,823
So?

389
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,700
What do you say?

390
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,178
-No. I said no.
-Come on!

391
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,764
-Why not?
-Come on. No means no.

392
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,016
-This way.
-Let us help you. Ms. Jin.

393
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:13,269
I know. I'm sorry.
Go home. Stay safe at home.

394
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:14,437
Hurry up and go.

395
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:19,400
Bye.

396
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,629
Young-ji, you can't go back there
on your own.

397
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,758
I just didn't know
what else I was supposed to do.

398
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:45,885
It must've been hard.

399
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,388
I know you're worried about him.

400
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:55,103
You stay safe here.

401
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,231
I'll contact you later,
but if you don't hear from me,

402
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:00,900
the captain'll find you.

403
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,241
How's it going?

404
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:51,910
I'm leaving for a bit.

405
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:53,953
Oh, you are?

406
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,455
Keys? Can I drive your car?

407
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,332
I'll drive you.

408
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,876
Ah, it's okay. Don't worry about it.

409
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,336
I'll be safe.

410
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:04,464
Eyes on the road. Check all the mirrors.
I can drive myself.

411
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:07,884
Se-kyung.

412
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,260
Huh?

413
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,264
I'm supposed to buy all of this?

414
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,020
Um…

415
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,898
Come in.

416
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,910
Uh, come here. Come here.

417
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,254
Tell me what's going on.

418
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,799
It's not what you think it is.

419
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,472
Se-kyung, talk to me. Hmm?

420
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:04,440
I… I just need to go to work.
That's all, okay?

421
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:10,363
Are you seriously doing this?

422
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,992
Can you stop lying to me?

423
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,504
You saw what happened.

424
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,548
Yun-sang knows now,
so we have to go without her.

425
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,175
On our own? But--

426
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,136
Look. Young-han gave me this.

427
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,805
This is it.
I remember him saying I could visit.

428
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:38,266
So how did you escape the facility?

429
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:40,977
Her mom runs the place. She's the boss!

430
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,229
I just wanna make sure that Ms. Jin…

431
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,273
-Hey.
-It says it right here.

432
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,275
"Youth training center. All are welcome."

433
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,069
Let's pretend we're interested,

434
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:53,239
then we'll escape with your brother
through the secret passage.

435
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,093
Manager Im, speaking.

436
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:17,013
Uh, Manager Im, it's Young-ji.

437
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:42,205
I'm on my way there
with Yun-sang. I need help.

438
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,085
Captain.

439
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:03,184
I'm looking for a training center
near the city's dam.

440
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:05,353
-Okay. I'll take a look.
-Mmm.

441
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,034
"Wooyang Training Center."

442
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,048
Over here!

443
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,536
Do I get discharged

444
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,329
or stay?

445
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,082
I leave?

446
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,793
I stay.

447
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,546
Damn it.

448
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,131
Leave?

449
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:20,052
What the fuck?
I thought he was guarding the chickens.

450
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,637
That son of a…

451
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,056
Hey!

452
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,058
Hey, punk!

453
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,435
What about the chickens?

454
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,979
Guard them, you son of a bitch!

455
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,981
Hey! The chickens!

456
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,232
Oh shit!

457
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,984
Oh shit! What the fuck?

458
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:37,945
Go!

459
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,792
What are we doing now?

460
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,169
Well…

461
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,883
Se-kyung, Yun-sang.
You two come ride with me.

462
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,676
Mmm.

463
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,391
Are you really making a move?

464
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,937
Yeah, I looked into it.
I've confirmed the location.

465
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,147
I'll let you know
when I get closer to the center.

466
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,316
Captain, I think you should reconsider.

467
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,402
-It's only a matter of time--
-I'll take any blame, okay?

468
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:21,989
Yun-sang, get in.

469
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,075
Uh…

470
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,047
-It's huge.
-Holy… Look at that.

471
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:39,340
So many windows.

472
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,760
Wow, that's awesome.
This is a training center?

473
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,053
-Hey.
-Wow.

474
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,305
Yo! What are you doing?

475
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,599
Just let me hold your hand.

476
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:19,297
It's good to see you, Ms. Chae.

477
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,685
Young-han's friends are here.

478
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:33,686
Okay.

479
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,813
Pretty spacious, right?

480
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:37,315
There she is.

481
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,694
This is Mr. Cheong Su-geun.
The one I told you about.

482
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,280
Have you toured the place yet?

483
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,741
Not a full tour, but I saw on the way in.

484
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,034
These facilities…

485
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:50,745
How much did this cost?

486
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,164
A pretty penny, I imagine.

487
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,540
Let's continue, then.

488
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,375
After you.

489
00:38:58,878 --> 00:38:59,879
Young-han.

490
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:00,921
Noona.

491
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,467
Hi, I'm Park Jin-seo. It's been a while.

492
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,636
You're way taller now.
We used to be the same height.

493
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,388
How's it going?

494
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,140
Good. How are you guys?

495
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,184
Hey, you look great.

496
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:15,770
So-min.

497
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,480
Uh, so tell me about this place.

498
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:18,939
Oh.

499
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,734
I'll show you around, okay?

500
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,402
The facilities here are great.

501
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,072
That all right to do?

502
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,657
Come on.

503
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,871
That's the secret passage
Young-ji used to escape.

504
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:38,334
We better hurry.
It gets dark early in the mountains.

505
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,262
Oh, uh…

506
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,347
Be careful.

507
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,766
Uh, okay. I'll be all right.

508
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,029
Sorry, Yun-sang. Um, my hand…

509
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:12,034
Se-kyung, I should go.

510
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,954
-I won't let anything bad happen.
-Sh!

511
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,872
You're gonna make me forget the route.

512
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,836
And, you know,
it'll be too obvious if you're there.

513
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,763
Se-kyung. Se-kyung!

514
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:41,856
Please stay inside.

515
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:00,666
Over here.

516
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,590
-Se-kyung.
-Huh?

517
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,260
Come back right away
if you can't find him.

518
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,645
Support Unit arriving in ten minutes.

519
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,232
Alpha confirmed on standby
at target location.

520
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,782
Once the lieutenant arrives,
I'll be joining her at the center.

521
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,659
You have to make sure
that the area is secure.

522
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,036
Understood, ma'am.

523
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,873
Don't worry too much.

524
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,125
We've got support on the way.

525
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:07,608
Here. Come on in.

526
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,155
Ah!
Your facilities here are incredible!

527
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,741
-Aren't they?
-What a beautiful hall!

528
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:17,535
It's like they say,

529
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,036
regardless of your trade,

530
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,622
you have to be able
to play an instrument, hmm?

531
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,998
Am I right?

532
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:24,625
You're acting like you know.

533
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,086
Of course.

534
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:31,048
He has a young daughter.

535
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,259
He might be useful.

536
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,851
That man keeps following us.

537
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,106
Young-han, do you still play your cello?

538
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,983
-Can you play for us today?
-Huh?

539
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:51,777
Should I?

540
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:58,659
Is it okay for us to watch
Young-han play the cello for a while?

541
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,709
Se-kyung, take a picture of that photo.

542
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,151
Why is he still there?

543
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,152
Unni.

544
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,708
Where's my mother?

545
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,504
I miss her so much.
Can you please go get her?

546
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,923
I haven't seen her in so long.

547
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:56,777
Excuse me.

548
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:57,903
It's not time yet.

549
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,689
They were all just in here.

550
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,482
Go to the control room.

551
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,317
Once you find them,

552
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,529
close off the surrounding locations.

553
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,587
Ma'am, practice has been suspended.

554
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,631
Okay, that's it for today.

555
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,729
All members of the Wooyang family,

556
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,606
please gather at the main hall.

557
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,399
I repeat.

558
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,277
All members of the Wooyang family,

559
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,279
please gather at the main hall.

560
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,203
It's this way.

561
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,039
You see that ladder below?

562
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:16,208
It's the way out. Just be careful.

563
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,377
Is this the secret passageway?

564
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,379
Yeah. Watch your step, okay?

565
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:23,632
Careful.

566
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:30,848
CAN'T FIND YOUNG-HAN

567
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,933
NO SERVICE

568
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,402
We must follow
the principles of the universe

569
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:45,404
to return to our roots.

570
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:49,283
Even if the asteroid comes,
the Earth will not be destroyed.

571
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:23,233
But all life on Earth will cease to exist.

572
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,068
Yes, this way.

573
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:26,236
Hello?

574
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,114
Wait.
Is there no service here?

575
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:30,490
Yes, yes, follow me.

576
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,618
This way. Gotta hurry. Come on.

577
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:35,412
All right.

578
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:37,789
But do not be afraid, everyone.

579
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:39,082
What's going on right now?

580
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:42,336
You are all standing
in the dominion of salvation.

581
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:44,338
Nothing.

582
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,924
'Cause this is all as it should be.

583
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,051
Our facility is safe,

584
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:51,845
and we will be leaving with our children.

585
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,722
-Excuse me--
-Hey, hey, hey.

586
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:55,057
Under a new sky…

587
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,099
What the…

588
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,893
…a new land in a beautiful place…

589
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,436
You're trapping me in here?

590
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,397
Where there is no death or pain…

591
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,733
You're here for a consultation.

592
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,027
You won't mind that, I'm sure.

593
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,489
-That'll be all.
-Uh, who-- Hold it!

594
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:13,033
Don't worry.
We're just continuing your consultation.

595
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,243
-There ya go.
-Let me go!

596
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:16,828
Hey!

597
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:18,789
Move.

598
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,332
Yes, ma'am.

599
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,961
Get out there and bring them back!

600
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:38,850
LOVE, FAITH, SALVATION
WOOYANG TRAINING CENTER

601
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,394
You can't barge in like this.

602
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,562
This is a military investigation.

603
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:44,523
You have no choice but to comply.

604
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,441
Shit!

605
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,790
According to Martial Law,

606
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:04,751
military commanders have the right
to investigate in emergencies.

607
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,546
Proceed!

608
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:08,714
Yes, ma'am!

609
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,676
Everybody, it's up to you.

610
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:17,431
The world's current leaders
won't matter at all.

611
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,017
And now, we must follow the principles of…

612
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,560
You have no right to be here.

613
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:23,603
Tell me who the man on the screen is.

614
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,522
I advise you to cooperate.

615
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:29,943
The military can initiate
any investigation at its discretion.

616
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:33,822
Anyone who chooses not to comply
is subject to immediate execution.

617
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:38,160
Lieutenant, do a sweep
and check for anyone underage.

618
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:40,537
Report any findings to me
and take the children to safety.

619
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,663
Copy, Captain.

620
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,749
Are you really doing this, Captain?

621
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,209
They're all our children.

622
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,420
-And you want to take them?
-Commencing search!

623
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:50,172
-Searching!
-Yes, ma'am!

624
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,049
Stop all these soldiers.

625
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,634
Stop them!

626
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,512
Excuse me! Over here!

627
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,557
Is the parent of Kim A-jin here?

628
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,268
-The parent of Kim A-jin!
-Let go of her!

629
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:05,145
It's not a difficult question!

630
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,064
-Kim A-jin!
-Yes, that's me.

631
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,357
Do you even know where
your daughter is right now?

632
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,609
Yeah, she's meditating.

633
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:13,195
I think it's ten o'clock.
Um, we're pretty sure, yeah?

634
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:17,282
Your daughter was being forced to work
at an adult entertainment establishment.

635
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:19,576
The facility was raided.

636
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,828
We rescued your children,
and they're now in treatment.

637
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,207
-That's bullshit!
-Quit lying to us!

638
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,250
Who's that man on the screen?

639
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,086
He's under arrest.
Step forward immediately.

640
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,463
-How dare you!
-He's our leader!

641
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:34,132
He always gives us guidance
in our time of need.

642
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,929
You don't know
where this guy is.

643
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:42,682
And yet, you're all gonna put
your children's safety in his hands?

644
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,184
Search it now!

645
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,393
Yes, ma'am!

646
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:51,149
All life on Earth
will cease to exist.

647
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:54,194
A choice to those
that have faith will be given.

648
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:57,030
And before that day arrives,

649
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:00,242
we must make thorough preparations
and be ready.

650
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:03,161
Now, let us all pray together.

651
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,496
Repeat after me.

652
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:11,044
Oh shit!

653
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:23,515
Look. It's gold.

654
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:26,643
Go!

655
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:27,561
Now!

656
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,107
Yes, deputy mayor.

657
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,317
I'm planning to take
all the children with us

658
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,153
and anyone else who wants to leave.

659
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,696
Hold it! Just wait!

660
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:40,282
Let's make the preparations.
Yeah. Okay.

661
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,163
In-a, are we not taking the other kids?

662
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,251
We have no choice.

663
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:55,213
Those families offered up everything
to escape, and they're refusing to leave.

664
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:57,549
They're still legal guardians.

665
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,348
So I just need to take care of something.

666
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:07,601
Okay.

667
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:21,823
Hey, you can't leave the car!

668
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:23,992
Kids.

669
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,161
Young-ji.

670
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:28,288
Get in the car.

671
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,540
Hurry up. Get in. Hurry, hurry.

672
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:36,796
Se-kyung.

673
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:39,507
Se-kyung.

674
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,848
Come on.

675
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,185
Who are you? Oh shit!

676
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,520
Shit!

677
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:54,940
Who are you?

678
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,401
-Put the gun down, or I'll fire!
-Who the hell are you?

679
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,620
Everyone's on board.

680
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,375
The transport vehicle.

681
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,294
-Check on those shots.
-Yes, ma'am.
