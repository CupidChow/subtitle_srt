00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,193
I humbly

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,488
ask that you grant me strength today.

15
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:16,117
That I may convey your grace and mercy
to these gathered believers.

16
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,581
That I may…

17
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,965
Honestly, I wish you would just
take all this stuff away.

18
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,474
This is Martial Law Command.

19
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,351
The curfew has been lifted.

20
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:46,064
The current time is 5:00 a.m.
on August 17th, 2025.

21
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,611
Where have you been, Father?

22
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,531
Oh, I just went out for a little walk.

23
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:58,201
Ah. Oh, I've laid out
your vestments in your room.

24
00:01:58,284 --> 00:01:59,244
Right. Thanks.

25
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,347
Oh! Good morning, Sister.

26
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,312
-Uh, Sister?
-Oh, hey.

27
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,439
I'm not religious, but let me help you.

28
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,524
Oh, thank you.

29
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,401
This is heavy.

30
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:36,781
One more.

31
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,201
One, two.

32
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,250
Uh, so

33
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,753
is there…

34
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,965
…any more I can do to help out?

35
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:57,302
Ah, that's sweet of you to offer, but--

36
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,219
Actually, sure.

37
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,805
We need all the help we can get today.
Thank you so much.

38
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:02,348
Follow me.

41
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,365
Hey, Idol Star!

42
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,993
I bet you scored with fangirls
all the time, huh?

43
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,122
You didn't debut though.

44
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,042
I guess that mostly applies
to A-listers, then.

45
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,336
Please, stop. I don't wanna hear this.

46
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,129
Come on, kid, what's the matter?

47
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,382
With your looks, the chicks
must've been crawling all over you!

48
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,051
"Oppa, Oppa."

49
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:44,766
If you made any videos with those girls,
you should share 'em, all right?

50
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,478
-I said stop, damn it!
-Fucker!

51
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,271
-Hey, hey, hey!
-Fucking asshole.

52
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:52,774
-Break it up! Come on!
-He wants some more! Let go!

00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,108
You're dead, bitch!

00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,276
-Guys!
-Hey!

55
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,445
-Stay down!
-Hey! Hey!

56
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,490
-That's enough! Break it up! Enough!
-Let me go! Let me go!

57
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,158
Stop it! Stop!

00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,534

00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,494

That's enough! Break it up!

00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,915
Let me go! Let go!

62
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,084
-Bastard!
-Hey!

63
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,336
Goodness.

64
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,968
Look. Right here.
There's a good spot.

65
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,137
Let's put them up together.

66
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:27,976
Good job.

LOOKING FOR MY MOM
OH SEON HYANG, AGE 42

00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,230
WENT MISSING ON MAY 2, 2025
WHILE LOOKING FOR OUR DOG

69
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,941
Please let Mommy
come back to us soon.

70
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,737
-Father.
-Yeah.

71
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,990
Father! I've heard
there's been an accident.

72
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,992
A car crash in the eighth district.

73
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,827
What? What happened?

74
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,245
Was anybody badly injured?

75
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,415
Both the liturgist and the lector
were driving in that car.

76
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,376
They're fine,
but they won't be here in time.

77
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,502
What do we do?

78
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,879
Can't be anyone in the choir. Um…

79
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,592
Could you help me with this, Sister?

80
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:25,885
-Me?
-Yes.

81
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,971
Uh, I have to take care of you
and the altar boys.

82
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,267
Sister Christina?

83
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,852
Mi-ryeong, you mean?

84
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:35,770
Yeah.

85
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,773
Would she be okay with that, you think?

86
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,608
I mean, after what happened to her son…

87
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:44,570
She came to church for confession,
and she has experience with big events.

88
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,864
-Goodness, Father, there you are.
-Ah, hello.

89
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,950
-Hello, Sister. Thanks for being here.
-Oh, hello.

90
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:52,245
I hope you have everything you need.
Do you think we'll have it ready in time?

91
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,789
Uh, I think so. Thank you for everything.

92
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:58,167
If preparations were this troublesome,
the church would've been better.

93
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,628
Oh no! We couldn't do that!

94
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,548
By having it here,
this event can be for everyone.

95
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,175
I'm just thankful
I could assist in making that happen.

96
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,511
-Of course.
-I'll let you get ready.

97
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,762
Right.

98
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,597
-Oh, hello!
-Hello.

99
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,392
Yun-sang! Uh, uh, anything else I need?

100
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,227
Relax, man. You'll be great.

101
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,312
Nervous?

102
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,480
A bit.

103
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,731
Come on. Let's take a photo.

104
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,816
-Yeah?
-Okay.

105
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,109
-Oh.
-Sister, you too.

106
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,193
Oh, I don't think so.

107
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,486
-Uh, what?
-No, no, no!

108
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,655
One, two…

109
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,116
Dude, at least smile.

110
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,118
Oh, right. Smile, boys.

111
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:36,038
One, two, three.

112
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,585
THE LATE KIM MIN-HO
SEPTEMBER 1, 2011 - MAY 10, 2025

113
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,718
Good morning!

114
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,761
-Good morning!
-Good morning!

115
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:54,807
What the--

116
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,101
Why all the security?

117
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,230
Oh, come on.

118
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,359
Snooping on the neighbors, are we?

119
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,114
Is this another scheme of yours?

120
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,576
Huh? What'd you say?

121
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,370
It's time to go.

122
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,663
We have the memorial.

123
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,419
Yeah, it sounds like an enormous project.

124
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,131
And if you would like
Dr. Ha to lead the research,

125
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,300
then there's no question.

126
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,097
We need to take him.

127
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:39,560
No, no. I won't be asking him myself,

128
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:43,147
but I do have someone
I know that he will listen to.

129
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,651
All right. Goodbye.

130
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,580
In-tae.

131
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,170
Cho In-tae. Cho In-tae!

132
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,756
In-tae.

133
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,049
In-tae!

134
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,509
Mother, get in.

135
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,179
Unbelievable.

136
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,981
Guarantee a migration plan!

137
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,108
Guarantee a migration plan!

138
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,068
Everyone has a right to life!

139
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,112
Everyone has a right to life!

140
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,114
Guarantee a migration plan!

141
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,074
Guarantee a migration plan!

142
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,118
-Guarantee a migration plan!
-Hi, Captain.

143
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,287
-Guarantee a migration plan!
-Im Seon-ju, here.

144
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,289
-Everyone has a right to life!
-So listen.

145
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:44,250
Uh… today is the memorial mass.

146
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,960
Could you provide some security?

147
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,629
I'd love to help,
but I'm afraid it can't be done.

148
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,092
I don't have the soldiers,
and we're dealing with an issue here.

149
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,385
Is that so?

150
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,930
I can attend to help out a little,
but that's it.

151
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,933
Then it can't be helped.
I'll see you later. 

152
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,227
Yes, until then. I'm sorry about that.

153
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,313
No worries. 

154
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,152
Four of our soldiers
are refusing to get discharged.

155
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,197
They have nowhere else to go
and no way to make a living.

156
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,367
That punk Kim Hyeon-sik
is the worst of them.

157
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:22,538
He's always fraternizing with civilians
when he's on guard duty.

158
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,999
He'll cause trouble sooner or later.

159
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,213
Take a program.

160
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,215
Guarantee a migration plan!

161
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,426
Everyone has a right to life!

162
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,219
Everyone has a right to life!

163
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,138
Guarantee our right to live!

164
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,515
Oh, the VIPs are here.

165
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:45,019
Oh! That guy over there
is our hotshot chief of staff.

166
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,104
"Hotshot"? Who is he?

167
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,190
Welcome, sir.

168
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,360
Take a program.

169
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:56,364
He's attending the mass
at the request of his elderly mother,

170
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,074
so please keep this quiet.

171
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,492
We don't want any trouble.

172
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,995
Yes. Understood. This way.

173
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,205
Eternal life!

174
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:13,005
Don't be fooled, everyone!
All that you've heard is a lie!

175
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,157
We read now
from the First Epistle of John.

176
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,576
"No one has ever seen God."

177
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,328
Excuse me, sir.

178
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:46,872
The man with the camera
is Dr. Ha Yun-sang.

179
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,332
I'll call him over later.

180
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:51,043
"And his love
is made complete in us."

181
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,254
This is the word of the Lord.

182
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,549
Thanks be to God.

183
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,842
Hallelujah.

184
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,689
Countless Woongcheon citizens

185
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,066
were cruelly taken from us.

186
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,067
Min-ji!

187
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,111
Sang-ho!

188
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,287
What do I do without you?

189
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,888
Su-yeon!

190
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:12,458
These feelings…

191
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,086
…this envy and hate for others,

192
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,299
is accompanied with agony from within.

193
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,969
This emotion that we all understand,

194
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,724
this helplessness we feel
at being abandoned,

195
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,228
it destroys our minds and maims our souls.

196
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:34,647
Yet, despite it all,

197
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,192
reconciliation can be found.

198
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,698
There's not much time left now.

199
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,200
Everyone…

200
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,953
…now is the time for forgiveness.

201
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,208
-Everyone, this--
-I can't hear you.

202
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,044
-Hey! Can you hear him?
-The microphone isn't working.

203
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,756
I can't hear you.

204
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,717
-We can't hear you!
-Sorry, please.

205
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:05,469
Uh, hello?

206
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,305
What? What? What is it? What's the issue?

207
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,807
-I don't know.
-Ah shit!

208
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,604
Forgiveness and reconciliation?

209
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,984
Forgiveness and reconciliation
can only be achieved with money.

210
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,989
You are all being fooled!

211
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:31,287
What's he saying? What's going on, huh?

212
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,413
Everyone.

213
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,748
Everyone, calm down.

214
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:41,171
There was a period
of ultra-low interest rates recently.

215
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:45,509
But in that same period,
gold prices were rising.

216
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,012
Your dear, beloved Father Baek

217
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:52,349
took all the funds of your many years
of church offerings and donations.

218
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,728
He abused your trust
and stole your money to buy gold.

219
00:14:55,811 --> 00:15:00,316
Stacks and stacks of gold bars,
all paid for by his loyal followers.

220
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,775
The payment method?

221
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,027
Bank transfer.

222
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,450
If that's true,
then where is Father Baek now, huh?

223
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,660
Show yourself,
and tell us what's going on!

224
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,412
-This is insane.
-My fellow citizens.

225
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,914
Your president is gone,

226
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,917
and all the other important figures
have gone missing.

227
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,335
But of course,

228
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:23,464
we mortals don't have the slightest chance
of migrating to a safety zone.

229
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:26,175
-We want the truth!
-Mother, we should go.

230
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,097
Mr.-- You're leaving? Let me just--

231
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,766
Get the investigators here!

232
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,564
Now, where did Father Baek
use all of that precious gold?

233
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,524
-Where the money ended up…
-Father?

234
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,735
-…isn't what's important.
-Where are you going?

235
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,403
The important thing is--

236
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:52,368
The corruption is finally coming to light!

237
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,245
-Please! Don't! Stop it!
-Where is it? Don't lie to us!

238
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,916
-Where'd that priest run with our money?
-Do not be deceived.

239
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,460
These are the words of a faceless swindler
hiding in the sha--

240
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,670
Hey! Stop!

241
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,304
You okay?

242
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:16,141
Sit down! Sit down, everyone!
Sit down now!

243
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,107
Everybody sit back down! That's enough!

244
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,780
We've just received a report
about dangerous misinformation.

245
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,616
According to Special Martial Law,
Section Three, Clause Four,

246
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,786
anyone spreading false rumors can be
arrested and detained without a warrant.

247
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,872
That's bullshit!
This matter is between us and the church!

248
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,458
The same goes
for obstructing an investigation.

249
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,545
-Father.
-Please stop scaring people.

250
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,338
This isn't helping anyone.

251
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:49,883
I'm asking you, as a priest, to please
take your investigators and leave.

252
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,428
We can handle this situation by ourselves.

253
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,850
Come on, everyone!
Let's go to that corrupt church!

254
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,477
-Come on! Let's go!
-To the church!

255
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,732
Hey, hyung!

256
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:09,737
Oh no.

257
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,947
-Hey! Just wait a minute, Father!
-Father!

258
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,491
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Not so fast.

259
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,785
Wait!
Why is the JIU stopping us?

260
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:22,041
Look at them! They're like
lost little lambs, aren't they?

261
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,085
They should get the chance
to scream at God to save them.

262
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,254
Right, Ms. Deputy Mayor?

263
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,300
Captain Kang, your soldiers have
nothing better to do.

264
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,052
You should've provided security today.

265
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:36,096
Oh, right! You guys are out of bullets.

266
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,557
What are you doing?

267
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,267
Hurry Sister! Go to the Church!

268
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,146
Yun-sang. Have you made a decision yet?

269
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,147
Clock's ticking.

270
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,573
Will you get lost already?

271
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,663
-They're hiding our money!
-Hyung, this is crazy!

272
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:05,084
-Let's go and see for ourselves!
-Seriously, why are you acting like this?

273
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,212
-I'm asking you to stop!
-I wanna know where Father Baek has gone!

274
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,547
Hyung! Please! Seriously, stop it!

275
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,592
Listen to me! Hold on!
Please, hold on. Let me--

276
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,071
Oh my God!

277
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,833
How could this ha--

278
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,300
Wait.

279
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,094
This can't be real.

280
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,099
How could--

281
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,705
Father, was there anyone left
inside the church during the fire?

282
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,290
No.

283
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:29,042
Everyone was in the city square
for the mass.

284
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,086
There's no way anyone was inside.

285
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,797
Have you had
any short circuits recently?

286
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,050
I doubt it. It doesn't seem very likely.

287
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,928
May I see the church's floor plan?

288
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,723
Floor plan…

289
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,433
I'll bring it to you.

290
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,611
See you around, Dr. Ha.

291
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,874
I don't think that voice
had anything to do with the JIU.

292
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,169
But why would anyone disrupt a memorial?

293
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,796
Does anyone need a reason?

294
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,341
Hmm?

295
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,219
The world is ending.

296
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,096
Nobody cares.

297
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,268
No one cares when we're all gonna die.

298
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,783
-He's so cute!
-Doggie!

299
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,743
I can't believe
they burned the church.

300
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,829
At least they got the fire
under control quickly.

301
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:48,914
Huge cheeks!

302
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:50,832
-That's a relief.
-But still…

303
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,417
-So-min.
-What's his name?

304
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:55,045
Take Hae-chan and Woo-chan home.
I'll be there soon, okay?

305
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:56,004
Thanks.

306
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,923
-The kids wanna stay with you.
-What?

307
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,217
-We'll be nearby.
-All right.

308
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,969
-Wanna go to the playground?
-Yeah!

309
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,972
-Let's go. To the playground.
-To the playground! Let's go!

310
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,599
-Should we go on the swings…
-Don't go too far away now.

311
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,893
-Okay.
-So-min, kids, be careful.

312
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,895
-I wanna ride on the swings first!
-Okay.

313
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,689
-The swings, huh?
-Yeah.

314
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,441
Should I push you?

315
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,902
Yeah, I wanna swing high!

316
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,530
-Let's hurry up, then!
-It's fine. They'll be all right.

317
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,740
They're small enough
that they don't attract attention.

318
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,076
They'll be safe.
You don't have to worry about it.

319
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,124
Hey, you know…

320
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,629
…I said some things during confession
I shouldn't have.

321
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,549
I'm afraid I'll be suspected.

322
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,844
I just said how I wish sometimes

323
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,471
I could get the money back
I gave the church in donations.

324
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:50,309
Do you think I sounded like
I wanted to burn the place down, huh?

325
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,228
-Actually--
-You think it does, hmm?

326
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,650
I… I said something similar too.

327
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,902
Huh? Wait, really?

328
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:04,156
You think there'll be a lot of people
trying to get their money back, then?

329
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,451
I think after this fire,
it'll all get swept under the rug.

330
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,661
Well, not if I have
anything to say about it.

331
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:22,174
Ow!

332
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:24,676
I almost died of embarrassment
because of my dad.

333
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,054
My mom
is probably still in shock.

334
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:30,015
It burned even before the asteroid hit.

335
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:33,018
So, I guess it's just
burning a little earlier.

336
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,812
Yeah. When it hits,
everything's gonna burn anyway.

337
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:40,317
-Is Sister Regina okay?
-Oh! There's Jin-seo. Let's go.

338
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:41,777
Sure.

339
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,448
You have to be
extra careful today, okay? Be safe.

340
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,407
Okay.

341
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,455
I can't believe this happened.

342
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,833
How could they do this to a church?

343
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,422
It looks like
all organizations are the same.

344
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,220
Young-ji, did something like this
happen before?

345
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,771
Shine the light here.

346
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,981
You idiot! How could you
set the church on fire?

347
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,108
So?
The place was empty. 

348
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,152
And nobody got hurt. 

349
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:10,365
If we want to give people money to escape,
the vault door needs to be opened.

350
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,450
Shut up!

351
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,839
What's this?

352
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:29,634
Father Baek's storage room.
We don't have a key or know the passcode.

353
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,929
We have to check in there
as well. Can we open it?

354
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,932
-No, this is--
-Sure, sure! Go right ahead.

355
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,893
-Open it.
-Hmm.

356
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:07,923
Sister.

357
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:13,261
This can't be.

358
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,932
The door is fireproof.
Everything inside is fine.

359
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:26,274
It seems the cause
was a faulty circuit breaker.

360
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:30,153
Luckily, there seems to be
no structural integrity issues,

361
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:33,281
but there could still be
live embers tucked away.

362
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,741
Be on the lookout for those.

363
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,452
What did they say?
It's probably not arson?

364
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,870
I don't know what to think.

365
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,040
Oh, no. Who would set a church on fire?

366
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,460
Goodness, my heart is still pounding.

367
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,045
Oh.

368
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,422
When Namdaemun Gate burned down,

369
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,467
at first,
they said it was an accident too.

370
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,511
Ah! You'd think people would know

371
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,597
setting a church on fire
is a one-way ticket to hell.

372
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,683
That's some imagination
you two have got there.

373
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,769
Reality is stranger than fiction, my dear.

374
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,772
That's true.

375
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,649
That's true.

376
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,360
I didn't think it'd be empty though.

377
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:14,030
What?

378
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,992
-Huh?
-What do you mean?

379
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,203
The safe was empty?
So where's all that gold?

380
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,124
-Father!
-Oh my, Father!

381
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,542
-Is he all right?
-Father!

382
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,669
-Goodness. What do we do?
-Oh my!

383
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:32,299
Was this all the equipment
used during the memorial?

384
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:33,550
Uh-huh.

385
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:36,970
So, besides…
all the staff working at city hall

386
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,139
and today's vendors,
did anyone else help?

387
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,056
Take this.

388
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,434
-Any volunteers or outside groups?
-Not ours.

389
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,644
-Wait, this isn't yours?
-No, it's not.

390
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:48,773
-And this isn't the city's either?
-Yeah, that one's not ours.

391
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,941
-Wait, what?
-Here.

392
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,110
Does anyone know where
this thing came from?

393
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,113
This speaker?

394
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,990
Huh? What's happening?

395
00:26:57,073 --> 00:27:00,619
It seems this doesn't belong
to the city hall or the vendor.

396
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,871
-What?
-That's so strange.

397
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:04,414
This belongs to the church.

398
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:09,961
Hey.

399
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,088
Are you okay?

400
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,009
Father.

401
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,387
What happened?

402
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:20,805
How are you feeling now?

403
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,975
Everyone was so worried.

404
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,687
You're the only priest now.
We can't have you dying on us.

405
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,065
Why would you say that?

406
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,318
-Ah! Wait, wait!
-That's not what I meant.

407
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,155
I'm just relieved he's okay is all.

408
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,868
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

409
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,370
-Here, Father.
-Ah!

410
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:45,538
Thank you.

411
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,168
Hey, In-a. Excuse me.

412
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,464
Have some water.

413
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,757
Ah, okay.

414
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,224
When this church was built,

415
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:08,978
your grandparents
gave a… rather large offering.

416
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,315
And that's when they told me

417
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,943
they hoped one of their grandsons

418
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,487
would become a priest someday.

419
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,699
So I told them not to worry about it

420
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:25,578
and to send the youngest of the three,
Sung-jae, to seminary.

421
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,085
Why?

422
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,504
Why choose me, Father?

423
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,966
Samuel said unto Jesse,

424
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,927
"Are these all the sons you have?"

425
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,263
And Jesse answered,

426
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:45,140
"There is still the youngest."

427
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,392
"He is out tending to the sheep."

428
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,729
Samuel told them to send for him.

429
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:54,691
And when he came,
the man was the picture of health.

430
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,359
A fine appearance as well.

431
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,279
And, of course, handsome features.

432
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,699
"Fallen at last"!

433
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,535
"Fallen at last"!

434
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,372
"Fallen is Babylon the Great"!

435
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,166
"Fallen at last"!

436
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,005
"Fallen at last is Babylon the Great"!

437
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,216
They ate everything we had.

438
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,178
People need to see
that kind of organization fall

439
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:25,013
to know that the world is changing.

440
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,727
Humans are foolish, after all.

441
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,353
Dad, this is not okay.

442
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,689
The guys need to bring
their own food from now on.

443
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,524
It's our duty to share what we can.

444
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,817
Are you kidding me right now?

445
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,653
A parent should first make sure
that their kid doesn't starve.

446
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,989
Jin-seo.

447
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,283
Let me tell you about the welfare state.

448
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,534
They never--

449
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,749
You're letting mosquitoes in.

450
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,419
I'm so hungry.

451
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,683
I can't stand it.

452
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,187
Can you imagine anything worse?

453
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,440
All of that money vanished into thin air.

454
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,026
Can you please stop that?

455
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,695
He would say,
"Teresa, your faith is unmatched."

456
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,405
"Teresa, what a saint you are."

457
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:27,492
Ma, what's the point
of having money right now?

458
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,537
The point?

459
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,247
Hey.

460
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,084
It's not the money that's important.
It's the fact that it's gone.

461
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,168
What do you mean?

462
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,878
If all the gold is gone,

463
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,297
that means Father Baek

464
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,299
left with everything.

465
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,885
How could he do this?

466
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,763
He abandoned all of us,

467
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,100
his many followers,
all of us so blind in our faith.

468
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,060
How could he just leave us like this?

469
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:57,856
-It's too awful. Too awful to believe.
-Hey, you're on my foot.

470
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,734
Why did it have to happen to me?

471
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:08,241
The world is ending soon,
but it's trying to end me first.

472
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,160
Ha-neul!

473
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:14,998
Where are you?

474
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,669
You have to come home!

475
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,866
Goodness! What a day.

476
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,118
I know.

477
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,704
Are you headed out?

478
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,707
No.
I'm waiting for In-a and Yun-sang.

479
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,752
Captain Kang? Where did she go?

480
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,838
She went to city hall
to check some sound equipment.

481
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:04,923
Ah.

482
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,635
Oh! Hey.

483
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,094
All right, here we go.

484
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,890
Oh, Sister.
I had something I wanted to ask you.

485
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:17,518
Do you know if this speaker
belongs to the church?

486
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,687
Yeah. It does, doesn't it?

487
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,357
-It does?
-Uh… Oh! I think so?

488
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,275
Earlier this morning, Sister and I put--

489
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,569
Oops, I guess I just forgot!
Thanks so much.

490
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,072
I noticed
this thing has Bluetooth.

491
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:32,909
So they probably used that earlier today

492
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,161
to connect to it.

493
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,206
So that's how it happened?

494
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,041
I think so.

495
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:42,752
How else would they
have taken over the sound system?

496
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:45,171
Sister.

497
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,091
Sorry, but may I see your phone.

498
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:49,759
My phone?

499
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:50,969
Yes.

500
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,096
My phone?

501
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:54,681
Um…

502
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:08,403
Okay, it was me.

503
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,279
Fine, I put it there!

504
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:19,038
Then… whose voice was it?

505
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,415
I'm not at liberty to say.

506
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,624
Sister.

507
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,680
All right, then. I suppose I must speak.

508
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:38,808
Think about it.

509
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,436
The church extension funds.

510
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,396
Where'd all that money come from, huh?

511
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,816
All of it came from the people
like Sister Teresa,

512
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,152
who saved her earnings little by little.

513
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,904
Her income from
all those bus rides to contractors.

514
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:56,868
Some of that money also came from
massive donations by rich members.

515
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,786
Does that make it any less valuable?

516
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,832
It doesn't matter whether or not
they earned their money through hardship.

517
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,543
The fact that they were willing
to share their money with the church

518
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,128
should be respected.

519
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,881
It was theirs either way,
and it's our duty to return it.

520
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,967
But, Sister, how could you even think to--

521
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,054
Jesus Christ!

522
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,097
I knew I could be excommunicated.

523
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,018
Father Baek and the administrator
are off somewhere.

524
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,645
So when this news
inevitably gets out there,

525
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,439
the decision falls to you!

526
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,358
I'm so disappointed.

527
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,405
Now, thanks to the fire,

528
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:38,242
we finally got to see the inside
of that storage room downstairs.

529
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,412
The safe was empty,

530
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,124
and all of Father Baek's many treats,
the wine, the chocolate,

531
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,544
the cheese… all of it was gone!

532
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,754
Unbelievable!

533
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,718
Listen to me.

534
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,890
Since I chose to dedicate
my entire life to this church,

535
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,892
I feel responsible.

536
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,316
Our dedication makes us all responsible!

537
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:14,278
I'm telling you, Father,
I'm seeing this through to the very end!

538
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:15,780
Sister, please.

539
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:17,990
Sister!

540
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,181
About D-Day…

541
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,644
…perhaps we should push it up.

542
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:35,860
Even a small event like this
can gain momentum.

543
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:36,944
It worries me.

544
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,405
The whole situation could get out of hand.

545
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,158
All life on Earth…

546
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:43,910
I understand.

547
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:47,538
-We will find salvation.
-Let's move quickly.

548
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,334
The day of judgment is coming.

549
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,296
Find hope in this glorious end.

550
00:36:56,172 --> 00:37:00,009
You are all at the threshold of salvation.

551
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,844
Those who are saved

552
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:05,014
will live in a dazzling heaven on Earth.

553
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,101
Those who are chosen
will safely board the ark.

554
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,103
Those who have not been chosen

555
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,689
will be swept away in the floods.

556
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,524
THE BIBLE

557
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,247
In-seong.

558
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:30,873
In-seong.

559
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,668
Oh, my In-seong.

560
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:42,426
GOD'S A DICKHEAD

561
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:45,846
What is this?

562
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,433
FUCK
THIS FUCKING SUCKS

563
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,103
THE ASTEROID KILLED JESUS
YOUR GOD'S A WEAKLING

564
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,729
FUCKING CHRIST

565
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,745
So, we all, uh, would like to know

566
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:13,582
where… where all the church money,
uh… disappeared to.

567
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,253
Is it true that Father Baek
ran off with our money?

568
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,422
It's time we get some answers.

569
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,382
Father.

570
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,676
Let me apologize.

571
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:28,306
The memorial mass should have taken place
at the church, after all. I'm very sorry.

572
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,557
Ah, it's all right.

573
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,812
So, uh, is Sister Chae-hwan
not coming today?

574
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:38,607
Uh, no. She wasn't feeling well,
so I told her to rest.

575
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:40,276
As for the fire,

576
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,363
it seems it was caused by
a faulty circuit breaker.

577
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,408
It is an old building, after all.

578
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,995
Father,

579
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:54,165
regarding the… voice yesterday.

580
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,584
Do you have any idea who…

581
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,294
I'm not sure.

582
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,130
But speaking as a priest,

583
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,924
I believe the issues raised by that voice

584
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,093
should certainly not be overlooked.

585
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,554
Yeah. Yes, I agree.

586
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:12,183
We should confirm whether or not
the accusations are true.

587
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,434
I'm confused.

588
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,936
We don't have the information we need.

589
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,814
How can we track down the culprit?
They know something we don't.

590
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:22,860
To ruin such a holy mass
is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.

591
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,571
A grave offense. A breach of Canon Law.

592
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,781
I agree.

593
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,658
And your son even took the time
to attend it with you.

594
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,495
That's not
what's important right now.

595
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:37,333
You're being ridiculous, all of you!
The task at hand is to find our money!

596
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,464
Setting aside the money issue,

597
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:47,343
the good faith of the membership
has been abused!

598
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,970
That, in and of itself,
is blasphemy against the Holy Spirit!

599
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:54,058
What we need is to do a thorough audit
of all the donations to the church!

600
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:58,687
I can't help but think
of Father Baek right now. I can't help it.

601
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,657
-Oh my goodness!
-Jeez, that scared me.

602
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:12,701
What?

603
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:22,503
I was thinking…
this may not be related to anything, but

604
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:26,715
I think it'd still be best
to reinforce the walls if possible.

605
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,719
I know we have less than 200 days left.

606
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:35,808
Even so, just leaving the church
in this state with all of its broken walls

607
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,518
for almost a year feels…

608
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,396
I can't live like that.

609
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:42,314
I think that, even with just one day left,

610
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:46,026
it's our responsibility to keep
our stomachs full and our minds happy.

611
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,112
I have some close friends in construction.

612
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,989
They're not working much these days,

613
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:53,075
so I spoke to them about this,
and they're willing to help.

614
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,454
Please. We're trying to talk about
something important now.

615
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,999
-You can bring that stuff up later.
-Hold on. What she's saying is important.

616
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:00,916
I agree with you.

617
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,170
I don't feel good at all
about leaving the church like this either.

618
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,130
Me too. I'd love to help.

619
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,798
-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

620
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,638
Why do you stick your nose in
church business? What gives you the right?

621
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,183
How about all the money we've given
to the church over the years?

622
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,684
"We"?

623
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,144
What do you mean by "we"?

624
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,272
How can you even face yourself
after attacking the church like that?

625
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,441
How can you face your daughter?

626
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,736
You know, I've been so embarrassed by you.

627
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,780
I haven't set foot
anywhere near the church in ages.

628
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,741
But for Ha-yul, things are different.

629
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,160
She still has her friends
and her teacher there.

630
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,995
Oh, so it's my fault again, huh?

631
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,414
Fine, we'll just all die together, then.

632
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,082
What makes you think you can decide that?

633
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,293
It's not the point either.
What gives you the right?

634
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:47,296
Now, be honest with me.
Why are you going to those meetings?

635
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,050
When Father Baek was still around,

636
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:53,594
you donated to the fund
without my permission.

637
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:56,138
He took that money
and bought gold to save himself.

638
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,765
Of course I'm pissed off!

639
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:03,437
You know, that money was from an account
my parents made for me.

640
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,023
-It's not yours!
-So what? That's irrelevant!

641
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,025
Now it's gone, and we have to find it!

642
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,694
I can't take it anymore!

643
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,549
Hey, Mi-ryeong, you in there?

644
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,223
Are you okay?

645
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:45,187
That's becoming a habit lately.

646
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,607
I guess it's because
Min-ho's birthday is coming up.

647
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:51,610
Oh yeah?

648
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,492
I can understand that.

649
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,872
Oh, that's right.

650
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:07,376
There was a meeting just now.
At the church, about the fire earlier.

651
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:11,171
That guy, you know?
Your friend Ha-yul's father?

652
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,340
He was just there making a huge scene,

653
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:17,011
shouting at poor Father Woo the whole time
to give back the extension funds.

654
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:21,348
Uh, he's… he's been a little crazy
right now, you know? 'Cause of money.

655
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,225
Oh, just spare me that!

656
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,810
We all want our money back.

657
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:29,440
Honestly, this disaster
is making everyone wanna kill themselves.

658
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,280
You just try to cheer up for now, okay?

659
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,872
-No, no.
-It's scary.

660
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,374
There was a fire
at Cheondong Church.

661
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,503
I was so upset to see
that the church was burned.

662
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,380
Ha!
Puppies are supposed to be cute!

663
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,341
Auntie and the men
in the neighborhood

664
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,925
said that they would fix it.

665
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:03,349
There are 188 days left.

666
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,517
The days are slowly counting down.

667
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,603
If the asteroid comes,

668
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,105
even scarier things will happen,
won't they?

669
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,234
Woo-chan, help me.

670
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,488
Stop! You know I'm ticklish!

671
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,615
Woo-chan, help me.

672
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,745
174 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

673
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:31,669
IN-A

674
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:32,878
Man, it's hot.

675
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:08,080
Hello.

676
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,290
There you are!

677
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,334
You finally came out.

678
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,045
There you go.

679
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,297
Nice to meet you, Choco.

680
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,344
There you go.

681
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,739
Regarding the recent incident in the unit,

682
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,366
we've concluded
that both parties were at fault.

683
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,912
Without respect between soldiers,
there will be no survival.

684
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:51,457
If this kind of incident occurs again,

685
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,543
you will be strictly disciplined
according to military law.

686
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:57,588
I knew it. Yep. Sergeant Kim again.

687
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,758
God, that fucking moron!

688
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,928
Prick.

689
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,054
Oh!

690
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,516
-Sir.
-Mmm.

691
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,934
You're off guard duty for a month.

692
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,103
You'll be on cleaning
and maintenance detail.

693
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,482
Uh, he was being insubordinate.

694
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,776
Now I'm stuck on cleaning duty
like some kind of grunt?

695
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,194
Shut the hell up, sergeant.

696
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,780
You got some nerve
after the mess you got yourself in.

697
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:24,990
I can't do it.

698
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,786
I'd rather get discharged than be
the battalion lackey and run errands.

699
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,996
Oh, you want that? Huh?

700
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:35,626
Na Hyeon-jae still gets
to keep going out as the driver!

701
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,002
Says who, huh?

702
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:38,504
Huh?

703
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,425
There you are!

704
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,762
I asked for you.

705
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,057
Okay, listen up.

706
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,059
Our duty here

707
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:56,104
is to protect these fine animals,
using every means possible,

708
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,358
from anyone looking for
an opportunity to steal them.

709
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,693
Hey, Hyeon-jae, come here.

710
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:04,947
Come here, I said.

711
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:06,990
Put that down and come here.

712
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,785
-I'm fine, ma'am.
-Come on! Put that down.

713
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:11,370
Don't be refusing orders now.

714
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,413
-Yes, ma'am.
-Put it down.

715
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:23,924
I need you on even higher alert
than when you're on guard duty.

716
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,717
Understood, ma'am.

717
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,594
Aren't they so pretty?

718
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:34,101
Oh, hello! You're all here!

719
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,104
-Hi!
-Oh yeah! We'll need the truck…

720
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,606
-Sister, this should be enough.
-Right this way. Oh yes!

721
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,732
-Hey.
-Go on in.

722
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:44,236
Once we get the outer wall done,
we'll have things practically wrapped up.

723
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,946
For now, let's make a plan inside.

724
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,659
Wow, you weren't kidding!

725
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:53,829
Those friends of yours
were the real deal after all, huh?

726
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:57,499
They sure are!
Even back in the North, they were special.

727
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,503
You know,
"glorious technicians for the nation."

728
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:04,006
-Yeah.
-Gye Hyang!

729
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:06,049
You see that? Good as new, right? Huh?

730
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:09,344
Oh, looks great!
No wonder you used to get paid so much.

731
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,430
Oh, we're getting paid now, are we?

732
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,766
"Used to," okay? You're volunteers
trying to deepen your faith.

733
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:18,103
You're gonna die soon, so be grateful
for the chance to do some good!

734
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:20,647
Yeah, I guess,
but take a look at this!

735
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,276
Since these are old tiles, new ones
were hard to get. We'll be a bit short.

736
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:26,695
See? Looks patchy everywhere.

737
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:29,531
Not at all! Don't worry about it.
It looks great!

738
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:31,450
It's way better than black soot anyway.

739
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:33,160
You're doing a great job!

740
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,371
-Yeah, yeah, heard you loud and clear.
-All right, since you said it yourself.

741
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:37,539
That's right.

742
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:40,125
I bet North Korea
must be a mess right now.

743
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,794
Yeah, it is.

744
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,255
You know, I used to dream
of saving enough money to, uh,

745
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,175
take a trip back there
and bring over the rest of my relatives.

746
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:49,092
Uh-huh.

747
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,513
You have to hold it right.
You're throwing off my balance.

748
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,808
It's not my fault.
My arms are too short. Let's just drag it.

749
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:04,066
Poor thing.
The Sister must still be in shock.

750
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,109
Her face is all puffy.

751
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,867
Well, the church is her home,
and she saw it in flames.

752
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,119
Sister, are you okay?

753
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:19,289
I don't know how
we're gonna finish this all.

754
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,459
People used to come here to take photos.

755
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:25,545
It was designed by a famous architect.
Now it's in shambles.

756
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,090
Ah shit!

757
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:31,510
Ugh! What's the point
of all this useless scrubbing?

758
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,597
Scrubbing can't fix something
that's broken and twisted!

759
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:38,392
Oh! Did I splash on you?

760
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,727
Oh, I did. I'm so sorry.

761
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:43,605
You still feeling down?

762
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:44,898
Sister!

763
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,276
Why don't you start the group meal?

764
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,070
Don't just stand there confused.

765
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,155
Go about your duties
as you've always done.

766
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,826
Yeah, I can do that.

767
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:59,079
All right, then.
Move along! Off you go!

768
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:08,422
I mean, are you all right, huh?
What can I do?

769
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,302
Let me take care of this.
I've got it.

770
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,847
Oh my, there's so much work.

771
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:19,433
-Do you youngsters need a break?
-No, sir!

772
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,811
Would you look at that?

773
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,188
Yes, Bishop, this is Father Woo.

774
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:27,774
Yes.

775
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,446
They ruled it an accident.

776
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,074
Yes, yes.

777
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,578
Ah, yes, of course.

778
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,372
Yes, yes.

779
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,125
Well, that's good, I suppose.

780
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,127
I'm glad it wasn't arson, at least.

781
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,839
Well, since the insurance
isn't paying for it,

782
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:53,216
it doesn't really matter
what caused the fire.

783
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,845
The parish is gonna offer to help, right?

784
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:58,638
Oh, of course.

785
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,892
Just because Father Baek is gone
doesn't mean they'll forget us.

786
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:05,103
Then, do you think the parish
has some kind of plan for us?

787
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,480
Yeah, probably.

788
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,024
Oh dear.
I don't know what to think anymore.

789
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,098
-What's up?
-Is everything done?

790
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,182
Mmm.

791
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:47,938
What did the parish say?

792
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,274
Father Baek left. Now the fire too.

793
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,736
They can't be happy.

794
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,156
Still no answer.

795
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:02,661
My guess is they want us
to take care of it on our own.

796
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:06,289
So I'm thinking about what to do now.

797
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:10,377
It's not like you can do it alone. Right?

798
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,504
And you don't even know what's going on.

799
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,049
You did look pretty cool earlier

800
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,510
when you told that investigator
to back off and leave.

801
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,428
-I did?
-Yeah, you did.

802
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,439
Why do you think he left?

803
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,819
How could he abandon us like this?

804
00:52:37,154 --> 00:52:39,948
There was something
that Father Baek used to say a lot.

805
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,911
That we're always on our way to maturity.

806
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,331
That makes no sense at all.

807
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,172
Excuse me.

808
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:58,133
-Would you like to eat first?
-No, let's eat together.

809
00:52:58,216 --> 00:52:59,718
-All right.
-Thank you.

810
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,631
If I had to choose,

811
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:41,676
I would spend every day we have left

812
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:45,138
hunting each of those bastards down

813
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,100
and punishing them for my son.

814
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:52,020
I don't expect to be forgiven.

815
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:58,860
With thoughts like that…

816
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,657
I won't be able
to see Min-ho again, will I?

817
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,083
Sister Christina.

818
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,922
"Revenge is my job."

819
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:21,508
"I will seek vengeance for you."

820
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,387
That is what the Lord says to us.

821
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:49,619
-I want a sausage!
-Dear Lord.

822
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,413
We thank you for all the grace
you have given us.

823
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:52,789
I want a sausage!

824
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,249
Amen.

825
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:56,126
I want a sausage! I want a sausage!

826
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:59,170
Goodness me!
This little pup must be starving!

827
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:01,548
-It's coming out. Thank you for the food.
-I want a sausage!

828
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,966
Everyone enjoy.

829
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:04,843
Enjoy your meal.

830
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:08,596
Since you all worked hard today,
let's share a drink. One glass each.

831
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:11,474
-Mmm.
-Where's unni, huh?

832
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,019
Oh, uh, she said her stomach hurt
and went home.

833
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,520
She told me to have dinner here.

834
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,689
Wait, what? How did she get
an upset stomach?

835
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,399
I don't know. She just said it hurt.

836
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,193
Well, still,
it's not good to skip meals.

837
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,654
-Is it good?
-She must be stressed out.

838
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,576
Father,
so about the mass going forward…

839
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,377
It's me. Se-kyung.

840
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:43,233
Where did my drink go, unni?

841
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,319
You said we'd drink this together.

842
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:50,365
What?

843
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:53,284
I just had one thing on my mind tonight.

844
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,787
I walked home thinking about this drink.

845
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,581
I thought we were
gonna have a glass together.

846
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:08,591
Uh, what do I do now?

847
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:12,929
-What to do.
-Here.

848
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,306
I put yours aside.

849
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:22,856
You had it ready.

850
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,023
Thanks, unni.

851
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,952
Let's clear our minds for now.

852
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,874
Together until the end.

853
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:42,667
Hmm?

854
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,289
It's really coming down.
