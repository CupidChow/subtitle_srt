13
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,025
Hey.

14
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,736
What's taking your teacher so long, huh?

15
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,406
Does she even care about you?

16
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,912
Stop it!
What do you think you're doing?

17
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,789
-Ms. Jin!
-Speak of the devil.

18
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,711
Just in time. We need your help.
She won't listen to us.

19
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,547
Ms. Jin, I really wasn't trying
to do anything. I swear.

20
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,383
Help you with what?

21
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,135
She owes us maintenance money.

22
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,387
I know how much money she's making.

23
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,724
I told her we'd take ration tickets,
but the little shit won't listen.

24
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,772
Ration tickets.

25
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,861
That's all I got.

26
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,071
Take whatever you want.

27
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,157
So-min, come here.

28
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:58,743
Wow!

29
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,120
Are you okay?

30
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,038
-You're not hurt, are you?
-I'm okay.

31
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,498
What a relief.

32
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:04,833
Huh?

33
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,044
Give me your hair clip.

34
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,260
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Yeah.

35
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,803
-Let's go.
-Were you scared?

36
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,221
-Yeah.
-It's okay.

37
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:19,305
Hey, lady.

38
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:22,642
He said you should buy a new bike.

39
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,396

Thank you so much.

These truly are
the last two bottles I have,

64
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,614
and my heart is breaking, but…

65
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,243
Go on! Go have yourselves another round.

66
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,037
Go, go, go! I'll clean up here. Go! Go!

67
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,297
-Why you--
-Ow!

68
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,217
Are you trying
to kill your poor mother, huh?

69
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,844
Who, you, Mom? Like I could do that.

70
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,555
-Hey, you said you were desperate to live!
-You brat!

71
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,934
So-min, stop it and go inside.

72
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,236
Oh, my baby! My baby!

73
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,324
Ms. Jin, have you ever
seen a child so immature?

74
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,827
Why do I have to be mature
when you aren't at all?

75
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,370
-You little--
-All right.

76
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,376
Nice, yeah?

77
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,629
Scaring your ignorant and immature mother.
It's nice knowing everything, huh?

78
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,800
-Where was she? Where?
-Unni, it's so late. Just go inside.

79
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:02,552
I'll leave this here.

80
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,720
-Bye, Ms. Jin.
-Bye.

81
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,097
-I'm sorry for the trouble.
-No worries. Take care.

82
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,391
Se-kyung!

83
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:10,977
Hi.

84
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,150
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. Sorry. The car ran out of gas.

85
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,321
You see, uh, I dropped the car off
at the church just now.

86
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,656
-Ah, it's late. Let's go.
-Ah.

87
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:26,909
Let's go, let's go!

88
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,370
-Jeez, man! You startled me!
-What?

89
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:32,540
-Hey, hands to yourself!
-What do you mean?

90
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,168
How long has it been
since we last did this?

91
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,045
Just the two of us…

92
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,255
Yeah.

93
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,632
It's been a while.

94
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:44,927
-Still have butterflies?
-Huh?

95
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,097
-Gotta keep up!
-That's what you said earlier.

96
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,308
-Get off me!
-Fine.

97
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,893
Ah, that.

98
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,562
I'm just worried about Yun-sang, you know.

99
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,689
Ow! Dude?

100
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,316
-And you?
-Hmm?

101
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,693
Are you really okay?

102
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,449
Cheers.

103
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:16,376
This stuff's so good.
I should've had more back then.

104
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:20,671
Right, but a certain someone used to say
that wine was just an expensive scam.

105
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,549
Who was that again?

106
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,510
-Me?
-That's what you said.

107
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,720
That wine was just for showing off.

108
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,849
Well, that was blasphemy
on my part.

109
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,810
Truly blasphemous.

110
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,357
I wish we could spend
our last moments together like this.

111
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,360
Well, that's done. Sorry. Empty.

112
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,445
Did we really drink it all?

113
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,447
I guess so.

114
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,575
It's still nice to sit here.

115
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,080
Hey, when did you get those?

116
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,081
Hmm?

117
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,251
I expect nothing less
from Ha Yun-sang.

118
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,961
Congrats, my friends.

119
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,295
Congrats, my friends.

120
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:05,049
My friends are getting married soon!
Congrats, congrats, congrats!

121
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:08,719
I hate it when he dances.

122
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,179
-Se-kyung.
-Hmm?

123
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,140
Still doing soccer these days?

124
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,646
-Come on!
-What?

125
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,816
Those aren't soccer cleats.
They're for mountain biking.

126
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,110
-Very disappointing, Mr. Priest.
-Ah! Sorry.

127
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,070
And you don't "do soccer."

128
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,947
You trying to sound dumb or what?

129
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,407
Or is that your humble act?

130
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,741
Mm, mm, mm.

131
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,164
-Help me out.
-Mmm.

132
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,834
You're tipsy.

133
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,881
It's starting to get late.
Let's finish our glasses. Call it a night.

134
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,966
No, no.
Wait till after the curfew ends.

135
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,885
-I have more booze.
-That's all right.

136
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,596
-No. I have more booze. Here.
-Really?

137
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,682
Yeah. My grandma made it.
Just have a taste before you go.

138
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,309
-In-a, you have a taste too.
-Huh?

139
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,895
Yeah, just a little taste, In-a.
What do you say?

140
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,606
-What?
-Yun-sang, you remember this, right?

141
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,858
My grandma made this
the month before she passed away.

142
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,693
Yeah, I do indeed.

143
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:10,156
She gave it to us
for a particularly special occasion.

144
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,909
She wanted us to keep it
and drink it at our wedding.

145
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,204
We almost never get together like this.
Just one more before you go.

146
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,413
We really have to go.

147
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,041
-Let's have one more.
-Just one more, what do you say?

148
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,334
We have to go. Come on!

149
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,419
Can't you two,
of all people, break curfew?

150
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,338
-A soldier and a priest?
-Huh?

151
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:28,925
No, it's just… we have a civil inspection.
We agreed to go.

152
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,968
Normally, he wouldn't be allowed,
but with me, he's exempt.

153
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,888
-Ooh, got something important to do!
-But I already opened it.

154
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,641
-Thank you for your service.
-Just one more drink. In-a?

155
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,684
-One for the road.
-We really should be…

156
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,728
-Go on, get. Goodbye.
-Bye.

157
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,771
Good night!

158
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:52,240
Isn't it a miracle to see our dear friends
Yun-sang and Se-kyung together

159
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,533
in their loving home?

160
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:57,161
Ugh, enough! Seriously.
Stop being so… sentimental.

161
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,498
-This is Martial Law Command…
-Ah, In-a.

162
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:01,624
-What?
-Captain?

163
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,043
-What?
-Am I actually exempt?

164
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,171
Is it really okay to be out right now?

165
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:09,924
It is.

166
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,300
Really?

167
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,927
The curfew will begin now.

168
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,557
Man, you opened it just like that.

169
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,726
That was supposed to be for our wedding.

170
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,945
Do you still wanna have a wedding?

171
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:36,701
That's the whole reason I came back.

172
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,914
This is all I have left to do.

173
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,712
To give you the happiest day of your life.

174
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,651
It's still doing that, huh?

175
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,572
I think it's funny
how it goes off randomly.

176
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,409
Yeah.

177
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,338
Let's just… clean up for now, yeah?

178
00:10:34,842 --> 00:10:36,385
All right. You got it.

179
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:38,971
Mm-hmm.

180
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,272
Be careful.

181
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,570
Come on. Why are you trying
to carry all those in one hand?

182
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,365
I dunno. I just always wanted
to try this, I guess.

183
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,076
-Looks cool, don't you think?
-Be careful.

184
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,202
Be careful!

185
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,875
Are you okay?

186
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,378
Oh my…

187
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,924
Serves me right.

188
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:16,759
Don't you think?

189
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,177
-Um, uh…
-It's okay.

190
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,136
Hold on.

191
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,183
Se-kyung.

192
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,478
It's okay, Se-kyung. Really.

193
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,064
-Wait. Just wait a second.
-Come on. I said it's okay.

194
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,148
No, Yun-sang.

195
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,401
-Hey, Se-kyung. Come on.
-I'll do it. I'll do it for you.

196
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,735
What's with you today?

197
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:43,160
I've got it.

198
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,662
All right. Got it.

199
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,288
Take this.

200
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,984
Wait.
Why are we here, of all places?

201
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,489
I hear you have
a network of connections here.

202
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,033
There's a lot going on
in this part of town,

203
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,827
and I could really use your help.

204
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,829
I only know a handful of people here.

205
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,166
Father Baek was the one who had
the powerful eating out of his hands.

206
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,797
Jeez. The world's ending,
but this place stays the same.

207
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,342
Hey, doesn't the curfew start
in 30 minutes? In-a, watch out.

208
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,680
What jerk rides his motorcycle
through here?

209
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,978
Oh, Father! What brings you out this way?

210
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,855
Sit down for a moment.
I'll make you noodles.

211
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,441
Uh, ah, not now.
My friend here is a little lost.

212
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,360
Any news from Father Baek?
Heard anything yet?

213
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,529
No, unfortunately not.

214
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,741
Oh no! We're all so worried about him.

215
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,787
He was in my dream last night,
saying, "Stella, Stella…"

216
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,746
Ah, I see.

217
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,956
He kept calling me
by my baptismal name.

218
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,999
What does it mean?

219
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,919
-Father, do you think it was a sign?
-Hyeon-sik. Kim Hyeon-sik.

220
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,171
Hey, you hippie! Get lost!

221
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,589
Come here.

222
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,258
-Come over here, kid.
-Okay.

223
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,887
Here, have some chicken.

224
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,847
It's all yours.

225
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,266
-Thank you, sir.
-Sergeant Kim.

226
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,352
-Yes?
-Come here.

227
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,062
Oh!

228
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,563
-Hey, you.
-Yeah.

229
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,106
-Give me that.
-Okay.

230
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,943
Try this. It'll blow your mind.

231
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:41,695
-Oh, no, no. Thank you.
-It's our new product.

232
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,323
-What? No, I'm okay.
-This stuff is fuckin' strong.

233
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,825
Ugh, just take it.

234
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,535
Just be careful.

235
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,995
You'll end up dead
if you take it all at once.

236
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,832
Thank you, sir.

237
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:53,999
Go fucking wild.

238
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,417
Okay, thank you.

239
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,503
Father,
when can I go to confession?

240
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,922
I need to confess all of my sins,

241
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,633
but I won't get the chance
with the asteroid!

242
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,012
-What do I do?
-It's all right.

243
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,098
-I'll be able to go to heaven, right?
-There, there.

244
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:12,309
-Working here is the only way…
-Yes. It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

245
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,531
The gambling houses
and the brothels here are all connected.

246
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,660
On the surface, it looks like
Master Sergeant Park runs the place

247
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:32,288
with other discharged soldiers,
but actually,

248
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,582
the escaped convicts manage everything.

249
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,625
I've sent countless anonymous reports,

250
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,336
but the Joint Investigation Unit
hasn't made a single move.

251
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,548
Are you saying the JIU
is protecting the escaped convicts?

252
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,467
I think there's someone
above even the JIU.

253
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,428
There's a rumor going around.

254
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,431
All the money from this district
is funneled somewhere else.

255
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,809
By the way, Captain Kang,

256
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,813
the JIU is still looking
for the missing ammunition.

257
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,817
Are you sure you're okay
taking part in this operation?

258
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,623
197 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

259
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,375
Greetings to all of
the citizens of Woongcheon.

260
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,628
This is Deputy Mayor Im Seon-ju.

261
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:25,132
At this time, we're experiencing
a shortage of goods for daily necessities.

262
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:28,594
We're also seeing numerous scams
promising an escape from the country.

263
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:32,932
Woongcheon City declares
that it will take strong action

264
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:36,018
against all crimes of fraud
and price gouging.

265
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,063
You can report any such crimes
to my office.

266
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:45,861
-Yun-sang.
-Oh, Jesus!

267
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,446
-Oh! Sorry, sorry.
-Oh, Se-kyung.

268
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,240
I'm headed out.

269
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:54,078
Oh, I wanted to give you a ride,
but this damn thing won't start.

270
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,372
Oh, no. It's okay.

271
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,498
See you tonight.

272
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,916
Uh, all right.

273
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,334
-Oh, Se-kyung.
-Yeah?

274
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,003
Uh, your bike isn't here.

275
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,964
It's at city hall.

276
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:09,969
Bye, then.

277
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,346
See you tonight.

278
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,401
♪ We were born as men ♪

279
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,445

280
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,948
♪ You and I lived for the honor… ♪

281
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,201
Hey! Over there! Over there! Get it!

282
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,369
Hurry, hurry!

283
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,165
-Hey, get it! Grab it!
-Watch it!

284
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,667
Hey, hey, hey.

285
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,796
Hey, come on!

286
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,799
Come on.
Let's get her home. Back to the coop!

287
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:51,468
Captain. I'm here with a request.

288
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,432
-Well, Captain…
-Yeah?

289
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,892
…I'd like you to attend
the completion ceremony.

290
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,978
-Ceremony?
-Mm-hmm. Yes.

291
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:02,104
Right this way.

292
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,272
Form up!

293
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,734
Second platoon, back from night shift.

294
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,152
-Mmm.
-Captain.

295
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,653
Good work.

296
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,239
Hey, Sergeant Kim.
When are you getting discharged?

297
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,825
-One, two, three, four.
-Oh.

298
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,368
Good work.

299
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,829
-Thanks.
-One, two, three, four.

300
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,581
Hut! Two, three, four.

301
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:21,540
This way.

302
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,624
Keep up!

303
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,919
Listen up!

304
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,465
Our first and, sadly,
last fertility project

305
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,258
will be a success no matter what.

306
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:34,011
To the rooster
and to the rest of his tribe.

307
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,679
Attention!

308
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,014
Attention!

309
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,807
Ready to.

310
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,895
And now, let us proceed
with the ribbon-cutting.

311
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,397
Ha!

312
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,482
That's right!

313
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,485
Fine work here. It'll last ten years!

314
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:51,820
Sir, but there's only 198 days left.

315
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,656
197.

316
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,616
Applause!

317
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,494
I don't see Corporal Pang. Is he off-duty?

318
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,496
-Sir, I'm right here!
-Right.

319
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,583
Come on. Come on. Come on. Just go.

320
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,878
He's gonna hurt himself. Hey, be careful!

321
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,713
Okay! Thank you, sir.

322
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,507
I was talking to the chicken.

323
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:15,928
Let's go.

324
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,764
Now, that over there is a girl?
How can you tell, huh?

325
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,182
Sergeant.

326
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,935
I want one-on-ones
with every sergeant in the company.

327
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,729
-We'll meet at headquarters.
-Okay.

328
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,232
Yeah, but Ms. Jin said
not to go out.

329
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:32,027
If we pay up to the collectors,
and they pay up to the managers,

330
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,071
who do the managers
have to pay up to, then?

331
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:37,449
-Hmm, the rich people still here?
-It's not even in dollars.

332
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,910
The real rich people
left Korea a long time ago.

333
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:45,207
Apparently, right at the last moment,
the government-in-exile will leave

334
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,918
and Korean banknotes
will be converted to national bonds.

335
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,211
That's what my dad said.

336
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:53,048
Wow, that sounds really smart,
even if I don't understand it at all.

337
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,385
Does that mean
that the Korean government is moving?

338
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,137
To where?

339
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,681
I heard North Korea
is moving to Western China.

340
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,141
They'll get their own land.

341
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,685
And apparently,
China's making some room for 'em.

342
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,311
I don't care about that.

343
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:10,023
I only care about making a deal
with Sergeant Kim to buy a gun.

344
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,275
Keep it down.

345
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:13,902
The kids can hear you.

346
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:18,824
Hold on. Are you saying…
you're gonna make a deal with him?

347
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,367
He asked for dirty videos.

348
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,744
Are you seriously gonna record 'em?

349
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,250
Forward march!

350
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,669
Captain, Sergeant Kim Hyeon-sik.

351
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,506
Sit down.

352
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,761
I know you work the overnight shift.
Sorry to cut into your sleep.

353
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,764
I heard you volunteered
for the night shift

354
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,224
ahead of your subordinates.

355
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,270
Higher command wants us
to discharge all soldiers

356
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,355
who wish to leave, regardless of rank.

357
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,067
Your discharge is way overdue,
but you have yet to apply.

358
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,654
What higher command wants is
fewer mouths to feed

359
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,239
since we're short on supplies.

360
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,575
If you were to ask me,

361
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,369
I'd rather us all stay together
until the end,

362
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:05,787
but

363
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:10,459
that only applies to soldiers
who respect and want their position.

364
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,795
You are always welcome
to leave as recommended.

365
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,716
Yeah, I considered discharge,
but things here are still better than…

366
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,220
Some choose to stay

367
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,181
but forget their responsibilities
as an officer.

368
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,435
Those officers are an embarrassment,
don't you think so?

369
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,190
Um… Yeah, I totally agree.

370
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:36,652
It's important
to remember our duties as officers.

371
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:42,032
Glad to hear we're on the same page.
Let's spend our time together wisely.

372
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:45,077
You're a soldier of
the armed forces of Korea.

373
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,620
I advise you to behave and cut ties

374
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,248
with any inappropriate connections
you may have.

375
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,669
If you can't do it on your own,
my help is available.

376
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,295
Understood?

377
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,632
Forward march!

378
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,676
One, two, three, four.

379
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:03,220
One, two, three, four.

380
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,180
One, two, three, four.

381
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,225
Shit. What the fuck was that about? Fuck!

382
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,645
Good God, that was terrifying.

383
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,730
Shit.

384
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,865
Jesus Christ!
How can you sleep at a time like this?

385
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,372
Have you made a decision
on the bunker yet?

386
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,250
You scared the crap out of me. Jeez.

387
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,294
Is that why you're here?

388
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,004
So that's a "no," then?

389
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,589
You're just gonna sit around
waiting to die?

390
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,177
If you have the money,
you can go ahead on your own.

391
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,762
Unbelievable.

392
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:47,180
Moron.

393
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,852
-Why do you always wear sunglasses anyway?
-Hyung, is Mi-ryeong here?

394
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,937
-Oh, Yun-sang, hi.
-Hey!

395
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,568
Is he the one back from the US?

396
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,948
-Excuse me. Did you come back from the US?
-Oh!

397
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,784
Yeah.

398
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,494
Ah, that so?

399
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,372
I don't know if you've heard,
but my daughter Ha-yul

400
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,623
was a student of Ms. Jin's.

401
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,833
I know her very well.

402
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,210
Uh… Ah, nice to meet you.

403
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:19,379
Ah, yes. So good to meet you.

404
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,591
Yeah. Oh! Watch your step! You okay?

405
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,176
Anyway…

406
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,723
I was wondering.
How did you get back here?

407
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,391
Huh?

408
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:35,103
I mean, since you came here from the US,
you must also know the way back.

409
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,189
How about you help me out?

410
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,858
Come on.

411
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,153
-You scared him away!
-Tell Mi-ryeong I stopped by.

412
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,404
Cut it out, man!

413
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,784
-Are you okay?
-He's bleeding a lot.

414
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,410
-Don't cry.
-Oh no!

415
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,663
What's going on? How'd he get hurt?

416
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,374
He fell while jumping rope.

417
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,461
Noona made me jump rope
when I was too tired.

418
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,963
She keeps making me do it.

419
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,007
Your legs need to be stronger.

420
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,092
You'll thank me.

421
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:09,388
Woo-chan, have some water.

422
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,181
You get a shark Band-Aid.

423
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,851
What's with all the jump-roping anyway?

424
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,313
If we wanna run away someplace
high up, then we need strong legs.

425
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:19,523
Somewhere high up?

426
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:21,858
I found this spot. It's really high up.

427
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,946
Hey. Tsunamis aren't the only thing
to worry about.

428
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,489
Hey, stop.

429
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,616
Tsunamis are the least
of our problems, really.

430
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,326
That's enough, Jeong Ha-yul.

431
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,744
They should know.

432
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,538
It's okay, Jin-seo.

433
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,790
I already know all that.

434
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,918
-All fixed, yeah?
-Let's go.

435
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,839
Don't be mean to the kids.

436
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,133
What? It's not like
I'm not telling them the truth.

437
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,509
-Oh my God!
-They're still little.

438
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:51,430
What's with the mess in here, huh?
I cleaned the house before I left earlier.

439
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,856
Though it is nice
you're all safe at home together.

440
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,524
I suppose a bit of mess is okay.

441
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,152
So you're okay with us making a mess?

442
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,780
I'd rather you make a mess at home.

443
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:12,784
If you only knew how anxious I get,
then you'd understand. Hmm?

444
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,750
-You kids want something to eat?
-Yeah.

445
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:24,212
-Yes, please.
-Sure. Let's make potato pancakes.

446
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,466
Potato pancakes, potato pancakes.

447
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,895
With the temperatures rising,
the unidentified bodies

448
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,396
are decomposing rapidly.

449
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:46,318
There are so many of them that
we'll need to skip funerals from now on.

450
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:51,239
Hmm?

451
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,576
-Oh, Se-kyung, you got a new bike!
-What?

452
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,535
-Oh!
-Uh…

453
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:57,871
You said your bike got totaled.
When did you buy a new one?

454
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:58,872
No, I…

455
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:00,665
Oh wow!

456
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,376
I mean, your taste in bikes
is a little weird,

457
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,961
but this looks brand-new!

458
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:07,839
Wow, it's hard to even
buy things secondhand these days.

459
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,925
-Good for you, Se-kyung.
-Seriously.

460
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,843
She can ride to the market!

461
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,428
Like there's any market to ride to.

462
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,014
It'd be perfect to go
on a nice, long ride around here.

463
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:16,932
NO CALLER ID

464
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,684
But look at this!
Who put this pinwheel here?

465
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,229
Huh?

466
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,650
How do you like the bike?

467
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,945
I'll give you the key in person.

468
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,337
This is… this is bait, isn't it?

469
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,924
That's twice now.

470
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,093
He used So-min to try me the other day,

471
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,761
and now he's making his move.

472
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,516
He wants to get rid of me.
I'm a nuisance to his business.

473
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,524
Listen, In-a…

474
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,152
I can't manage this alone.

475
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,697
I've been getting threats.

476
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,157
Every day since Yun-sang came back.

477
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,995
This man called me
during the welcome-back party too.

478
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,374
I guess he thinks
that I killed Bae Jong-su.

479
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,003
For now,
send a text that you'll meet him.

480
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,255
Okay.

481
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,279
Oh!

482
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:56,948
Ah!

483
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:57,991
Whoo!

484
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,410
Woo-hoo!

485
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,495
Yeah! Yeah!

486
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:04,748
Oh man.

487
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,710
You all right there?

488
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,049
You know, hyung…

489
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:19,262
Se-kyung still hasn't told me
about anything she went through.

490
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,891
I'm starting to think
she won't tell me at all.

491
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,896
We all went through a lot
while you were away.

492
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,940
That's not the same thing though.

493
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,030
Here's a little advice.

494
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:41,034
We're all doing the best we can
to enjoy the short time we have left.

495
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:44,663
That can't happen if we ignore the issues
that have been piling up in our lives.

496
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,498
That also goes for relationships.

497
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,750
Just tell me what your point is, dude.

498
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,627
That you're thinking about this
the wrong way.

499
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,545
You once said that you fell for her

500
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,131
because she was generous
and strong-willed, et cetera.

501
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,092
But all of that
is just your outward perception.

502
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,220
Real people are
much more complicated inside.

503
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,431
You know, all the advice you give me

504
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,768
always sounds so deep
when I first think about it, but

505
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,646
there's never any substance.

506
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,481
That's true.

507
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,150
You figured it out.

508
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:17,028
So don't you treat me like
an inspiration vending machine.

509
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,823
-Oh, Father!
-Over here!

510
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:23,201
The phones must be broken again.
Ugh, I've been trying to call you all day!

511
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,244
Oh, really?

512
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:28,498
You should go now…
and call the clergy house.

513
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:29,999
Oh man.

514
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:33,002
Those geezers keep calling for me
when I barely even know anything.

515
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:36,172
How can you call them geezers?
God won't be happy with that.

516
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,010
You seem to be enjoying yourselves, huh?

517
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,346
How can you play tennis
at a time like this?

518
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,393
Hey, 'cause of you,
I'm getting a bad reputation.

519
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,979
-Go on! Hurry up.
-All right, then.

520
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:56,192
Hey, just so you know,
they might want a memorial service.

521
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,277
Huh?

522
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,112
Come on. No way.

523
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,365
-Take this, asteroid!
-Huh? Oh!

524
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:55,877
Hey.

525
00:29:58,755 --> 00:29:59,881
-Captain.
-Hi.

526
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,592
-Sergeant.
-Yes.

527
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,969
Please handle
the inspections for me tonight.

528
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:08,431
The platoon leader
is out tonight, too, though.

529
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,808
What of it?

530
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,518
Uh…

531
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,144
Um…

532
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,232
Yes, Captain.

533
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,947
SMU, commence operation.

534
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,593
I have nowhere to go.
I have nothing to do on the outside.

535
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,889
Yeah, maybe I should.

536
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:49,741
The substations will be shelters

537
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,117
during the asteroid collision?

538
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,829
Hilarious.

539
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,498
Hey, I'm sorry.

540
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,091
I dropped the keys on the tracks
by platform two.

541
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,218
Should be easy to find.

542
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,645
Watch your step.

543
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,122
RESTRICTED AREA

544
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:41,209
WOONGCHEON CITY
SHELTER NO.3 CONSTRUCTION SITE

545
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,127
You're a real tough girl, huh?

546
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,797
You pissed your pants
over a stupid bike.

547
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,760
Don't worry, Ms. Jin.

548
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,597
I'll take good care of the kids
until the very end.

549
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:41,602
Huh?

550
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,774
What the hell?

551
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,755
Shit!

552
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:51,297
Bae Jong-su.

553
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,674
Did you kill him?

554
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,428
Keep walking.

555
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,777
Go get it.

556
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,195
Just shoot me.

557
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,325
Just fucking shoot me!

558
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,294
You fucking…

559
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,885
Don't move!

560
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:27,643
We have survivors here.

561
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:31,314
For now, transport the survivors
to the city hospital.

562
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,940
Yes, we'll check inside.

563
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,400
You're kidding me.

564
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,443
Right.

565
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,904
-Uh-huh. Go on inside.
-I'll head inside.

566
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,491
Captain Kang mobilized
the former SMU members.

567
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,409
Let go! Damn it!

568
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:46,037
For now, the top priority
is the safety of the survivors.

569
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,663
Christ, it's a shit show down here.

570
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:51,125
I know we don't have the people.
Request emergency volunteer workers.

571
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,543
Good.

572
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,837
Go on upstairs. Take a look around.

573
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:55,755
Uh, wait.

574
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,674
The Joint Investigation Unit is here.
I'll call you right back. Okay?

575
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,176
Team leader!

576
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,347
Deputy Mayor,
what brings you here at this hour?

577
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:07,058
The Special Missions Unit is great,
don't you think?

578
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:10,186
Thank God someone knew about
the terrible crimes being conducted here.

579
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:14,106
Yes, well, uh, looks like
everything's been taken care of.

580
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,442
Hey, stop. Don't push me!

581
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:18,027
-Let's go!
-I said don't push me.

582
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,946
Hey, the JIU will handle the rest.

583
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:22,406
We'll process all the criminals
and victims, all right?

584
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,825
-Go! Go!
-What are you talking about?

585
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,119
-Keep moving!
-Take the criminals with you!

586
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:30,206
-Stop! Don't push me!
-The abused girls are coming back with us.

587
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,917
-I said don't push me!
-I'll take care of the survivors.

588
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,628
We're in charge of that.
Isn't that right, Lieutenant?

589
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,296
Did Captain Kang order this?

590
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,382
I'll have to call and check.

591
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:42,468
Captain Kang gave us the order, sir.
No need to confirm it with her.

592
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,222
Transfer the victims to the health center
and return to your unit.

593
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:47,348
Understood.

594
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,684
Team leader,

595
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,852
don't just put this aside.

596
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,022
All these criminals need to be prosecuted.

597
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,317
-How could they do this?
-Do your job for once!

598
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,236
-Let go!
-This is not right!

599
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,282
Report to Mr. Song,
and keep Master Sergeant Park quiet.

600
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,039
Team Bravo, mission accomplished.

601
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,251
Yeah,
people just keep coming out!

602
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,420
What's going on?

603
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:25,029
I guess
we're accomplices now, aren't we?

604
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,089
In-a.

605
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,136
You're not an accomplice.
It was your civic duty.

606
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,598
A private citizen stopped
something terrible from happening.

607
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:53,599
That's all.

608
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,852
But this is where it should stop for you.

609
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,730
That organization
isn't gonna bat an eyelash

610
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,816
just because one of their minions died.

611
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:11,283
What are you doing? Let's go.

612
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,577
I don't know.

613
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,956
What do you mean,
"you don't know"?

614
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,416
-Get it together!
-No.

615
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,053
You said you'd live until the end.

616
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,473
So why are you
putting your life in danger?

617
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:35,975
Huh?

618
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,106
Who knows?

619
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,646
Take Yun-sang and get out of here.

620
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,611
Hey, come on up now.

621
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:12,947
Hurry up! Come on!
