Yun-sang.

14
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,893
I'm going downstairs for some coffee.

15
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:03,748
DO NOT ENTER

16
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,874
Ms. Jin.

17
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,918
-Hmm?
-No one's in there.

18
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,129
Huh?

19
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,968
Guess I was only half awake.

20
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:18,138
I smelled coffee in my dream,
so I just came down for it.

21
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,393
That's right. It's vacant.

22
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,145
-Right.
-Ms. Jin?

23
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,729
-Huh?
-Um…

24
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,691
Bae Jong-su? He's dead.

25
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,236
Oh.

26
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,322
Huh.

27
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:56,634
The end draws ever nearer,
and you're listening to pirate radio.

28
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,261
Greetings, fellow soldiers.

29
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,890
I'm your favorite moon-dwelling rabbit,
Oktokki, with some news.

30
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,725
That monster who broke out of prison

31
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,936
and committed unspeakable things
against innocent children,

32
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,898
that evil punk, Bae Jong-su, is dead.

33
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,066
According to the Joint Investigation Unit,

34
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,611
the sick bastard put a bullet
through his own eye.

35
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,488
Whether he did it to himself
or if it was someone else,

36
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:18,698
who gives a crap?

37
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,202
The JIU was more than happy
to sit on their hands

38
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,412
while these scumbags roamed free.

39
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,289
But then… boom!

40
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,875
Down comes divine punishment!

41
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,835
You done here? Let's go.

42
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:38,760
Hold on. Let me see.

43
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:54,108
Remember, these assholes
broke out of prison amidst the chaos,

44
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,693
kidnapped children to sell,

45
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,029
and left them to die
in shipping containers.

46
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,489
I gotta say, it sure feels good…

47
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,865
This makes no sense.

48
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,576
I don't care if it was suicide or murder.

49
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,912
Either way, I'm just glad he's dead now.

50
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,665
The asteroid will
crash into Earth in 200 days.

51
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,250
And the safety zone?

52
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,168
Do you really think
you can survive…

53
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,128
Ugh! This is the worst.

54
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,798
I'm sick of being afraid of those jerks.
It really pisses me off!

55
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:20,009
If only someone could…
take out the whole gang or something.

56
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,761
If I had a gun, I'd just shoot 'em myself!

57
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,930
I am the punisher! Beware!

58
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,266
When the asteroid Dina comes,

59
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:28,059
pretty much everyone is gonna die.

60
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,520
-Ugh, gross.
-It doesn't matter what you do.

61
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,650
DELETING

62
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:40,905
I hope you've been
saving up your money, kids.

63
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,032
Your monthly maintenance fees are due.

64
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,659
We're still a little short.

65
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,079
You see? Bae Jong-su's death
doesn't change a thing.

66
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,331
Let's beg her again.

67
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,792
I'll see if I can negotiate.

68
00:04:55,336 --> 00:05:01,342
♪ Born as a valiant son of this nation ♪

69
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,052
Yes, sir.

70
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,057
At ease. They say it's a suicide.

71
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:11,602
But… Um, the shot's angle
clearly looks like a homicide.

72
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,688
The JIU was sloppy, as usual.

73
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,733
They don't care about
some dead jailbreaker criminal.

74
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,564
Jesus, will you tell me what's going on?
I want answers!

75
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,692
Um, sir. Sir.
Please calm down. I'll-- I can explain.

76
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,277
Uh, as you know,

77
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,697
every country has different
eligibility conditions for migration.

78
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:50,076
In your case, you were trying
to go to the United States.

79
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,579
They're a member of the International
Convention on Personal Data Sharing.

80
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,499
Look here. Anyone who has broken
the Children and Youth Protection Act--

81
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,501
I can see the list!
Why in the world am I there?

82
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,254
Well, sir, if you've ever
frequented establishments

83
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,089
that use underage workers,
that could be why.

84
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,424
Right.

85
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,176
Also, as part of the agreement,
all your personal data is shared,

86
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,095
including… including medical records.

87
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,931
So, for some countries, you have--
Where are you going, sir?

88
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,392
Sir, you need to provide
your COVID vaccination card

89
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,561
and, um, proof that you're STD-free!

90
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:20,189
Ugh! That guy's an asshole.
I feel for his wife and kids.

91
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,903
Look, kid, our manager
is waiting for the maintenance fee.

92
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,572
This has a lot of movies on it.

93
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,906
The fuck is this?

94
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,408
An antique or something?

95
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,953
I can pay you the rest soon
when I sell the drive I'm working on.

96
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,455
How can I trust you?

97
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,375
If you think we're gonna go soft
'cause one of the lieutenants is dead…

98
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,544
You should bring those chicks over, hmm?

99
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,546
-We'll have some fun!
-Huh?

100
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,424
Ha-yul? Leave her out
'cause her dad's a creep.

101
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,092
So-min though…

102
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,803
Her mom's a lot scarier though.

103
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,557
Just do what we say.

104
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,392
I don't need your opinion,
you little shit.

105
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,603
Do not doubt.

106
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:02,148
-Our future selves are waiting for us.
-Eternal life!

107
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,691
Be free of all doubt!

108
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,527
A new, inextinguishable sun is burning.

109
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,863
-Eternal life!
-Eternal life!

110
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:11,532
The asteroid collision is just a lie.

111
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,993
The asteroid does not exist.

112
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,412
Don't be fooled, brothers and sisters.

113
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,831
The asteroid collision
is the start of eternal life.

114
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,626
It is a new beginning. Listen, everyone…

115
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:22,919
What are you doing here?

116
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,796
-You here alone?
-Uh-uh.

117
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,425
Don't wander around. Go home.

118
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,760
-Go on!
-Okay.

119
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,470
This kid…

120
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,265
-Be free of all doubt!
-Free yourself from it all!

121
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,017
Do not doubt!

122
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,228
Listen, even if
there was an asteroid collision,

123
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,896
the Earth would not cease to exist.

124
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:44,065
No living organism
can be completely exterminated.

125
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,858
This is impossible. I'll tell you why.

126
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,360
All right, sir, please stop.

127
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,946
Patrol is hard enough. It's so hot today.

128
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,364
Eternal life!

129
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,368
-A new sun is burning.
-Eternal life is not a religion.

130
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,370
-Eternal life!
-Eternal life is not a religion.

131
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,164
Eternal life!
Be free of all doubt!

132
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,293
-Hey.
-Hey! How'd it go?

133
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,088
What did they say?
They threatened you, didn't they?

134
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,883
No more than usual.
They told me to stick to the pay schedule.

135
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,010
Write something. Here.

136
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,345
What should I write?

137
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,472
D-200.

138
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:21,686
I'M SURE IT'S NICER THERE

139
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,191
All right, all right! Quiet down, please.

140
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,277
Oh yes! Ha-yul? Hey.

141
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,029
Ms. Jin, why are we the only ones
writing down our secrets?

142
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,739
You should have to tell us one of yours.

143
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:39,203
Something that the principal
should never find out.

144
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,872
Come on, just one!

145
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:42,957
Hang on.

146
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,002
Remember, at work,
the principal is my boss, yeah?

147
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:46,919
It's too risky.

148
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,463
Plus, you'd be sad if you couldn't
see me anymore, wouldn't you?

149
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,548
So enough already.

150
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:53,175
Sit down. Open your books. Guys!

151
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,261
-Tell us one!
-Guys.

152
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,013
Tell us one!

153
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,765
Tell us one! Tell us one!

154
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,559
Tell us one!

155
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,978
All right. Draw the curtains, then!

156
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:05,771
Cover those windows up!

157
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,026
You wanna know my secret, huh?

158
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:13,571
So, um, my secret is…

159
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,323
Hmm…

160
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,955
Okay, just a minute.

161
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,958
-Wow! What is that?
-What is she doing?

162
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,128
Whoa. What is that?

163
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,381
Be quiet, everybody!
Quiet, guys!

164
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,550
Is that a butterfly?

165
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,510
Ms. Jin,
do you like butterflies?

166
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,929
-Is that a butterfly?
-She has three butterflies.

167
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:42,266
-I wanna get a tattoo too.
-Wow! That's so cool!

168
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:43,976
Hold on, all right?
Make a line.

169
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,562
Okay, that's enough now.

170
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,731
You munchkins wanna slack off, huh?

171
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,733
Come on, back to your seats. Sit down.

172
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:55,780
All right,
since we're all sharing secrets,

173
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,323
I'll make an announcement.

174
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,201
-I'm going to make a soccer club.
-What?

175
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,702
-Why?
-Really?

176
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,204
-Why?
-Any takers?

177
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,538
-Yeah!
-Oh! Me! Me!

178
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,332
-I'll be the manager!
-Oh wow!

179
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:09,210
I'll be the awesome, awesome,
super pretty cheerleader, then!

180
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,128
-Ha-yul! Min-ho.
-I'll be goalkeeper.

181
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,673
-Wow, a lot of you are interested.
-I'll cheer them up.

182
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,093
I guess we'll need to have tryouts, then.
Open your books.

183
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,679
Come on, you rascals.

184
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,473
-You have to learn something!
-Please? I wanna talk about soccer!

185
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,268
-Eternal life!
-Eternal life!

186
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,230
-Be free of all doubt!
-Be free of all doubt!

187
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,357
-Ms. Jin!
-Yeah.

188
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,109
The deputy mayor
is looking for you.

189
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,026
Okay.

190
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:21,675
It was chaotic here
early this morning. Did you all see?

191
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,554
Soldiers swarming everywhere.
Even my daughter, Captain Kang, was there.

192
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,473
I heard it was a suicide.

193
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,934
But they're still not sure.

194
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,018
Oh.

195
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,771
That's the house next door
to where you're working now, yeah?

196
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,898
Well, sure, but I didn't know him at all.

197
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,902
I just saw some cars parked there
on my way to work. That's all.

198
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,988
Why kill yourself
with a home like that?

199
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,158
Those fancy houses
even have private bunkers.

200
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,619
I heard you can survive
a nuclear bomb in one.

201
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,663
-Oh, right. You would know!
-Huh?

202
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,289
You can tell us all about it.

203
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,084
You drove the concrete mixer
when those houses were built.

204
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,127
Oh yeah, they're plenty sturdy.

205
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,922
We dug, uh, ten meters into the ground

206
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,800
and covered it all
with a ceiling two meters thick.

207
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:04,385
At the place I work for,

208
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,137
they stocked up
all sorts of things in there.

209
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:11,141
Probably enough to last three years
for her and her grandson.

210
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,060
There's no point.

211
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,979
Everything will be underwater.

212
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,440
Everything! Those new apartments too.

213
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,442
They're nothing but fancy fish tanks.

214
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,403
Yeah, I guess you're right.

215
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:26,073
Of course, we'll all probably burn up
long before the flood.

216
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,701
Looks like we're done
with the young summer radish.

217
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:31,620
We should plant some cabbages
to make kimchi.

218
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,541
Then, once we've made kimchi
to hold us over till next spring,

219
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,084
that'll be it for the world.

220
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,460
Think about it.

221
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,838
I won't have to make doenjang
or soy sauce anymore.

222
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,675
It really sinks in
when you say it like that.

223
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,303
It sure does.

224
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:53,976
Oh my.

225
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,062
Looks like it's gonna rain.

226
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:11,911
WOONGCHEON CITY
SHELTER NO.3 CONSTRUCTION SITE

227
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,005
There's still some water left
on the tracks.

228
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,260
-Watch your step.
-Oh, okay.

229
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,763
We need to go all the way down.

230
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,139
-Ah.
-Over there.

231
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:33,223
Right.

232
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,812
Section One, Section Two. All switched on.

233
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,411
What's with the long face?

234
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,080
Huh?

235
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,460
Stop zoning out over there.
Give me an estimation on this shelter.

236
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,463
You want… my estimate?

237
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,258
Yeah, who else?

238
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,095
You taught Home Ec, didn't you?

239
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,431
These days, I pretty much
only work with children.

240
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,933
And as a volunteer at that.

241
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,060
Besides, what's the point, hmm?

242
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,813
Building these shelters
is just insulting people's intelligence.

243
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,148
Everyone knows that.

244
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:27,611
But this is the safety measure
our all-knowing government came up with.

245
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,616
So we should at least
get a budget together, don't ya think?

246
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,787
I mean, we can't just sit and watch
all these people get scammed and tricked

247
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,123
by private bunker companies and cults.

248
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,543
But you already know
no place will be safe in the end.

249
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,965
-Se-kyung.
-Hmm?

250
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,758
Lighten up, huh?

251
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:56,056
Can't you just imagine
we're building a huge dance hall?

252
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,600
I like the sound of that.
Yeah. Sounds fun.

253
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,477
An end-of-the-world dance party
with the kids.

254
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,854
Mm-hmm.

255
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,277
Jin Se-kyung.

256
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,531
A dance party!

257
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,325
How's this?

258
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,370
-Dance party!
-Oh wow! You've got the moves!

259
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,125
You know, I used to be
this silly and happy all the time.

260
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:26,336
Yeah, and I used to be
a rational and reasonable person.

261
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,255
Oh! My baby Jesus!

262
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,008
Captain Kang?

263
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,260
What are you-- Did you come for me?

264
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:36,472
In-a?

265
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,141
Yeah.

266
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,398
So many people are still missing.
We don't know if they're alive or not.

267
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,819
Barely anyone comes here
to visit these days.

268
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,157
Remember, this whole square
used to be crowded.

269
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,080
I guess we're all pretty tired.

270
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,716
I'm just gonna come out and say it.

271
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,302
The dead guy, Bae Jong-su…

272
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,098
he was a total scumbag.

273
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,938
Jailbreakers, armed imposters,
low-life gangsters.

274
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,069
Under Martial Law,
they should be executed.

275
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,321
But this is something else.

276
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,743
Fake suicide.

277
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,584
Probably a warning to the other gangs.

278
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,961
A punishment, then.

279
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,379
No.

280
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,093
Personal revenge is not punishment.
It's a crime.

281
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,053
No matter what.

282
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,724
If anyone thoroughly investigated this--

283
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,476
"Anyone"? Such as?

284
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,354
You know the JIU won't do it.

285
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,731
You're right.

286
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:12,943
Neither can I.

287
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,655
My unit doesn't have jurisdiction.

288
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,158
But if I were to investigate it…

289
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,829
you'd be the prime suspect.

290
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,628
I did nothing.

291
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,049
-Why?
-You had a grudge against him.

292
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,135
Everyone did.

293
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,599
-If there's any chance it was you--
-Do you hear what you're saying?

294
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:50,480
I just hope you'd never even think about
doing something like that.

295
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,567
Mm-hmm.

296
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,328
I know things will never go
back to normal.

297
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,460
But a crime is still a crime.

298
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,339
Look, it seems like
no matter what I tell you,

299
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,174
you're gonna be suspicious of me.

300
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:20,093
-Say you didn't do it. I'll believe you.
-Well, I didn't.

301
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,596
I didn't do it.

302
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,727
I gotta go.

303
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,191
Forget it, then.

304
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:42,282
Just don't go around alone from now on.

305
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,952
And don't go out late at night.

306
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,370
But I work late, so…

307
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,708
Look.

308
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,089
Do you know what those scumbags are like?

309
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,301
They're powerful and ruthless.
They play dirty, and they never give up.

310
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,344
You can't--

311
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,348
Even if some punisher gets rid of a few,

312
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,142
there will always be
more crawling behind, out of the gutter.

313
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,604
They traffic people for sex.
Do you understand?

314
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,029
See ya.

315
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,358
302 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

316
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,450
Okay. 

317
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:08,368
So the priest was the first one here, huh?

318
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,662
Dancing like a raver in his sacred gown!

319
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:14,833
Didn't wanna be late,
so I came straight after.

320
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,043
No time to change.

321
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,422
We can't be late
when Se-kyung calls us.

322
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,340
You got that right!

323
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,217
Yun-sang, you're in your lab.
Can you be on a video call?

324
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,929
It's not like I have a choice.
I'm stuck in here all day.

325
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,268
These little guys are
practically my family now.

326
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:36,897
Oh wow! They're so cute!

327
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,150
Hey! 

328
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,571
Ever wondered
how many hairs are on a mouse?

329
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,574
Guess how many strands they have
in a five-millimeter area.

330
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:51,328
What? Are you working on hair loss pills
or something? A special new drug?

331
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,789
Oh man! Ha Yun-sang.

332
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,709
Come on home. Come on, huh?

333
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,462
Work will still be there
after your wedding to Se-kyung.

334
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,214
They say, "Out of sight, out of mind."

335
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:05,801
That happens to long-distance couples.
They forget each other and call it off.

336
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,844
What do you know?

337
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:11,098
-Good-looking jerk.
-Hey, priest, knock it off. Huh?

338
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,060
-All right, fine. Look.
-By the way, guys.

339
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:17,020
-I got promoted.
-This is what you want? Dancing?

340
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,439
-How do you like the new fit, huh?
-Like this?

341
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,817
-Kang In-a. Bam!
-Okay!

342
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,320
So, about our wedding… 

343
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,700
At least try to look excited.

344
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,036
Okay. How about…

345
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,788
Hmm… Mm-hmm.

346
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,790
We'll just do it
like a video game side quest.

347
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,959
Is Father Baek still going to officiate?

348
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,461
-Mm-hmm.
-I hope I'm not bothering him.

349
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:44,381
You know how much he adores you.

350
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:00,772
I think it's bedtime.

351
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,191
Are you gonna stream tomorrow?

352
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:06,945
In-a's gonna make a video.
I'll send it after the game, yeah? Okay?

353
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:15,120
WE HOPE YOU GROW UP WITH DREAMS
AND HAPPINESS IN YOUR LIVES!

354
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,205
2025 WOONGCHEON'S FRIENDLY SOCCER MATCH

00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,534
-Let's go!
-Go! Keep running! Run!

366
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,247
Come on!

367
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,294
Oh, come on, Mom!

368
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,546
It's okay, it's okay.
Min-ho, stand up.

369
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,924
Go Cheondong!

370
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,598
Completely shameless.

371
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,934
Yun-sang would fly back home
if he knew you were here.

372
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,268
What was that?

373
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:23,563
If Yun-sang knew you were here,
he would definitely fly back home!

374
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,190
Well, we're still waiting!

375
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,362
Come on, press up!

376
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,156
-Let's see some tackles!
-Great job.

377
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,992
Let's score more
in the second half.

378
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,745
Yeah! Good work!

379
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:46,002
-Are you okay? Are you okay?
-Hey, that's a foul!

380
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,859
Yeah!

381
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,949
Don't start going easy
on them, all right?

382
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,744
You all let them score, didn't you?

383
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,329
-I saw it all.
-What?

384
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,373
I'll have you know that was a clean goal!

385
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:26,876
Se-kyung.
I always knew you could play soccer,

386
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,878
but I never expected you
to set all this up.

387
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:32,090
I wanted to share my hobbies with them!
You'll understand if you teach kids.

388
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,175
You're great.

389
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,302
What is this?

390
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:38,597
-What? You pulling a prank?
-You didn't get anything?

391
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,307
-Let me check.
-What's happening?

392
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,726
-Look at this.
-I have no idea what this is.

393
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,607
-This is crazy.
-What is this?

394
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,025
I think it's a prank.

395
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:52,611
Hey, did you get it too?

396
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,033
What's that matter? Are we playing?

397
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,118
Are you all too tired?

398
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,704
Uh, Mom, watch my stuff.
I got an emergency call. I need to go.

399
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,372
-Hey, In-a!
-Hey, hey, hey! In-a!

400
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,625
In-a! In-a!

401
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:08,793
Wait, what?

402
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:12,088
"An important global announcement
will be made at midnight tonight"?

403
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:16,301
-Ms. Joo, In-a had to answer a call.
-That's normal for the SMU.

404
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,720
We're sorry,
but due to network difficulties--

405
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,896
Oh shit! We're fucked!
We're all screwed!

406
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:31,024
Noona, why aren't they playing?

407
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,317
Is it over?

408
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,401
Maybe?

409
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,320
I don't know.

410
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,698
-Let's go.
-Okay.

411
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:46,998
While tracking the orbit
of the asteroid 2012, Dina,

412
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:49,501
which disappeared in 2013,

413
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,712
we discovered
that it is heading towards the Earth.

414
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,757
We recognized the possibility
of a collision with the Earth,

415
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,385
and we did our best
to eliminate the threat,

416
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,886
but we failed to deflect it.

417
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,689
ASTEROID COLLISION ON KOREAN PENINSULA
THE LAST 300 DAYS

418
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:19,364
After 300 days from now,
the asteroid, which is 900 meters long…

419
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,074
-Let's stop feeding her.
-Okay, Mommy.

420
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,492
…will crash into the Earth.

421
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:25,078
Mom? Mom?

422
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,663
-Yeah?
-My phone has no signal.

423
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,957
I think tomorrow's schedule
will be canceled.

424
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,417
-Hello? Hello?
-What?

425
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,335
-There's no reception.
-Hey, you there?

426
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,588
The affected area is expected
to reach all of Japan,

427
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:40,885
the Korean Peninsula, Eastern China,
and the Indochina Peninsula.

428
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,095
What are we gonna do?

429
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,430
-Oh shoot!
-Yeah!

430
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,223
-Hurry up!
-Okay, I'm coming!

431
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,977
The impact would cause
a climate change beyond imagination.

432
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:55,191
And it would take at least 30 years
to restore the ecosystem of the Earth.

433
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:12,250
Dear citizens of Woongcheon.
This is Deputy Mayor Im Seon-ju.

434
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,210
Where is the asteroid?
I can't see it.

435
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:17,797
In light of rampant conspiracy theories
taking advantage of our anxieties

436
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:22,051
and the rise of crime, such as looting,
violence, as well as kidnapping of minors…

437
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,178
SEONJIN STAFFING INC.

438
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,264
…Woongcheon City declares
that it will take strong action

439
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,767
against any and all such disruptions.

440
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,730
Fellow citizens of Woongcheon,

441
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,273
as of this broadcast,

442
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,859
we have 199 days left.

443
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:38,860
Oh!

444
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:40,904
Okay, lunchtime!

445
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,072
This remaining time we have
with our loved ones…

446
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,700
-There we go.
-Oh boy. He likes it, doesn't he?

447
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:48,077
Hello, sweetie. Here's your food.

448
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:53,041
…than ever for us to be there
for one another until the last moment.

449
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,378
And that's a wrap!

450
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,006
Good work, everyone.
That's it for tonight.

451
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:04,093
Um, let's see. We have potatoes
and some Spam, I think. That's it, sir.

452
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,304
Wait. Where are the sausages I brought?

453
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,891
Don't get me started on those, Sergeant.

454
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:13,478
Those three boxes of sausages were
the most disgusting thing I've ever seen.

455
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:17,190
When I first opened them up,
it was just… the most vile thing.

456
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,566
I'm telling you, okay?

457
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,026
The ice block inside had melted.

458
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:23,488
There was meat-water… Disgusting.
…all over the place. Imagine the smell!

459
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,032
Also, there were tiny bugs crawling out!

460
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,535
-Enjoy your meal.
-Enjoy your meal.

461
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,453
-That looks pretty good.
-Thank you.

462
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:32,956
What the fuck is this? Ugh.

463
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,124
We work our asses off
just to eat this shit?

464
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,836
You know what's worse?
I've got guard duty.

465
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,838
We don't even get
Spam anymore.

466
00:30:41,297 --> 00:30:43,591
I'm gonna need
to take it up with our captain.

467
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,301
Really? That's a little…

468
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,554
Seriously though.

469
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,557
Putting ranks aside,
I could eat that for breakfast.

470
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,433
-Yeah, okay.
-Hyeon-sik.

471
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,522
No matter how messed up the military gets,

472
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,608
we don't allow insubordination, all right?

473
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,072
Enjoy your meal, Sergeant.

474
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,116
Ignore him, all right?

475
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,033
What do you say?

476
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:11,494
We play a little game later?
For a bit of money?

477
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,454
Oh yeah! We get paid today!

478
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,958
Ah, at least I've got
that to look forward to.

479
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,668
Tell me about it, huh.

480
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:31,973
ETERNAL LIFE STUDIES

481
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,474
Man, I'm starving.

482
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:40,523
There are three features
that distinguish quantum physics

483
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,066
from the classical physics.

484
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,736
The first is quantized energy,

485
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:48,865
which means that factors like momentum
are determined by a certain value.

486
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,075
The second is wave-particle duality.

487
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,493
On a microscopic scale,

488
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,371
these two properties
can be observed at the same time.

489
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:58,124
The last is the uncertainty principle.

490
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,879
This means some properties of things
cannot be observed at the same instant.

491
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:06,382
Excuse me, does that mean
our bodies will also become quantum?

492
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,759
Exactly! Look, everyone.

493
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,969
Eternal life is not a delusion.

494
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,804
It's cutting-edge medical science.

495
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:15,600
So, if we look beyond the apocalypse,
we'll find another world

496
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:18,811
made up of all the waves
that have accumulated there so far.

497
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,939
Eternal life!

498
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,693
Ugh, so gross.

499
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,363
Ugh.

500
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,161
The asteroid collision is
the beginning of eternal life.

501
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,538
Be free of all doubt.

502
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,291
Our future selves
await us on the other side.

503
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,543
-Eternal life.
-Eternal life.

504
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:46,089
♪ Through asteroid Dina
We move beyond Earth ♪

505
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:49,384
♪ To life eternal, to life eternal ♪

506
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,594
-I hope they have cream buns.
-I want fishcakes.

507
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,513
-They're out?
-You have to do it right.

508
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,931
It'll be like a shockwave.

509
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,433
-Like a storm with a giant earthquake.
-I got it.

510
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,811
-A tsunami and a great flood?
-Check it out. Looks good.

511
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,771
-What happens to the asteroid?
-Thanks, man.

512
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,106
Oh. Um, you still owe us some…

513
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,607
-Oh, ration ticket.
-Yeah, thanks.

514
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,484
It'll smash into Earth,

515
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:08,820
and the debris will
shoot up high in the air.

516
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:12,323
Oh, and then fall down like hot sky magma.

517
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,576
Or like a shotgun floating in the air
and blocking all sunlight.

518
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,829
I heard about that. Impact winter.

519
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:20,748
Yeah. Temperatures will drop,
plants will die,

520
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,667
then so will animals, one by one.

521
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,878
Just like how the dinosaurs went extinct.
It'll be goodbye for us all.

522
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:27,755
-Two ramyeon, please.
-Ramyeon?

523
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,090
-Yes!
-And plain!

524
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,050
You can't have both.
Once choice each.

525
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,177
-Huh?
-What do you mean? Why not?

526
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,847
We're low on supplies.
You should think about other people.

527
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,600
Where are you going?

528
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:45,773
Uh… just going to renew my gun license.
It's expiring soon.

529
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,235
-You're up to something, aren't you?
-Don't worry about it.

530
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,904
See you later.

531
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,747
Don't be stupid, all right? Huh?

532
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,248
I'm not that guy now.

533
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:03,374
See you later.

534
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:13,509
-Bye.
-Bye.

535
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,055
If he comes back here again
with some weird contract,

536
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,015
I'm kicking him out and locking the door.

537
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:21,517
It's like that guy wants
to be scammed by people.

538
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,069
How is he like this?

539
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:34,322
Even after losing our boy, he's still so…

540
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:40,369
I'll take over. Hmm?
You should take a five.

541
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,288
Yeah. Mmm.

542
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,709
-Good morning, Auntie.
-Hi, kids.

543
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,924
She must miss Min-ho.

544
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,425
Yeah.

545
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:58,763
Ugh! Why are all the dads
in the world so stupid?

546
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,057
How would I know?
It's not like I have one.

547
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:02,391
You want that?

548
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:03,434
Uh-huh.

549
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,355
-Thank you.
-We'll be off.

550
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,732
-I left them on the table.
-Okay, see you.

551
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,109
-Have a good day.
-Have a good one.

552
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:19,492
THE LATE KIM MIN-HO
SEPTEMBER 1, 2011 - MAY 10, 2025

553
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:22,829
If you want out of this country,
this is where you get info.

554
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,414
Oh, hi!

555
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:27,375
What is this?
Is there gambling here?

556
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,543
It's been a while.

557
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,878
What's with you, man?
Why would you bring me here?

558
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,713
Listen, I can't be around this.

559
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,258
Hey, wait up. Wait!

560
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,968
Chill out. Just follow my lead.

561
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,428
Okay, but hang on.

562
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,975
Does this floating bunker really work?
What's the down payment?

563
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,310
-Ah, yes! We have a few options.
-Would you just follow me?

564
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:47,353
Give me a second.

565
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:48,646
I see. Okay.

566
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,482
-Place the blinds, please.
-Thank you. Jeong.

567
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,485
This floating bunker's the real deal.
We don't even need a broker!

568
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,029
150k with a 50,000 deposit!

569
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,033
I need a permit to leave.
This dumb thing doesn't have that at all.

570
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,994
They expect us to pay
and take their word for it?

571
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,746
Did you get your money back
last time from the other guy, then?

572
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,542
The money you paid?
You know, to that guy? For departure.

573
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,961
That jerk ran off already.

574
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:12,920
Exactly.

575
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,507
You paid for that upfront.
Guess we can't trust anything.

576
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,217
What'd the broker charge ya?

577
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,637
Way too much.

578
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,056
It needs to be low-cost and efficient.

579
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,641
I don't know about efficiency,

580
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:29,187
but if you want something cheap,
you need to trust me and look at this.

581
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,981
-Let me know what you think.
-I'm not gonna pay to drown in that thing.

582
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,483
Ah, Jeong, it was designed by scientists,

583
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,819
so I doubt drowning
is gonna be an issue here.

584
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,154
Oh, look at that!

585
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,324
Let's go!

586
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,994
You know what?
I'm feeling extra generous today.

587
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:46,704
Wanna hear some hot intel?

588
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,956
-Yeah!
-Tell us!

589
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,417
Let's say the asteroid crashes into Korea.

590
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,920
What's the chance
it wipes out everything on Earth?

591
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,296
Is it high or low?

592
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,339
Low!

593
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,925
It's low, yeah? Not very high at all.

594
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,052
Let's say you manage
to live for two weeks after that.

595
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:05,514
The probability of you then surviving
the disaster is definitely high, I'd say!

596
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,017
-Sounds pretty good, right?
-You think he's right about that?

597
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,269
…you're still gonna have
lots of problems.

598
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,397
Why? Because there are just
too many people in this world.

599
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:18,027
All it takes is one quick look around,
and you'll agree. There are so many--

600
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:19,528
Hang on.

601
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:24,075
Are you… Jeong Su-geun?
The YouTuber with a million subscribers!

602
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,785
-It is him!
-You are!

603
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,246
You see that. Everyone recognizes you.

604
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,498
Nice to meet you.

605
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,251
Oh, I'm honored, really. Now, where was I?

606
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:37,171
Anyway, there are too many people
in this world, right?

607
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:41,133
Humans have done incredible things.
We've built civilizations, yeah?

608
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:44,679
Our technology, our medicine,
our triumphs, and our tragedies.

609
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,931
Overcoming all kinds of obstacles,

610
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:49,517
and now,
we face humanity's final challenge.

611
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,018
So tell me, everyone,

612
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,354
the new world is coming.

613
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,106
Are you one of the chosen, huh?

614
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,649
-Yes!
-Yeah!

615
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:57,608
Tell me!

616
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,110
You bet I am!

617
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,196
If you are, then let's play,
my fellow chosen ones. Another round!

618
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,700
-Go get the chips.
-Sounds pretty great, huh?

619
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,917
-Things are not looking good.
-She's really bad at this.

620
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,044
-She's gonna die, huh?
-Yep.

621
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,004
YOU DIED

622
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,589
You're kidding me!

623
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,801
How come you always die on that stage?
You were so close.

624
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:27,305
-Hey, you try beating it. It's super hard.
-What do you mean?

625
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,723
Obviously, I was the best.

626
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:32,018
-Yeah, right. You're the worst.
-Jin-seo, what was your score again? 15?

627
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,061
I was just taking it easy on you guys.

628
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,188
-Remember the last game you tried?
-Come on!

629
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,400
Huh?

630
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,318
-Oh!
-Huh?

631
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,694
Another blackout?

632
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,155
Nothing works
in this stupid country!

633
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,781
The lights will come back on.

634
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,993
-Hey, this one's amazing.
-Got more for us to watch?

635
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,619
-You gotta bring more.
-Sure.

636
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:53,164
-Like maybe some music videos?
-Yeah, okay.

637
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,336
How are things at home?

638
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,130
My dad's impossible.
He's a lost cause.

639
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:04,216
-Yeah, I get that.
-What are you complaining about?

640
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,885
My dad's like that too.

641
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:09,722
Hey, your dad might embarrass you,
but at least he didn't do anything dirty.

642
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,893
-Huh? The lights are back on!
-Oh? The lights are on!

643
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,936
-Okay.
-You wanna play more?

644
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,521
-Hey, wait!
-Wait up!

645
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,740
Whoa, you're pretty good.

646
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:30,826
Obviously, come on! Aim for the center…

647
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,788
Nice Shot!

648
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,232
Don't go.

649
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:14,912
Are you Ha-yul?

650
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,247
Yeah.

651
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:17,998
What do you want?

652
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,586
You don't take after your dad, do you?

653
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,171
She really doesn't.

654
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,340
I bet your mom is a lot prettier.

655
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:30,219
Aw, stop it.
You're scaring her.

656
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,429
Pathetic.

657
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,639
I have something to show ya.

658
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,147
Here!

659
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,611
Keep watching.

660
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,029
Look at her face.

661
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:00,791
That's your dad, right?

662
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,548
Oh!

663
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,133
-No, stay back!
-She fell.

664
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,015
Summer will come.

665
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:19,768
Then fall, then winter.

666
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,563
And when spring comes…

667
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:28,319
I can't believe that there's only one
of each season left before the end.

668
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,737
Stop being so depressing!

669
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,197
I'm not wrong though.

670
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,119
No, a woman like you
should just be whistling her entire life.

671
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,580
Make me some coffee.

672
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,873
Oh, please. What coffee?

673
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,086
Can you try not to look like that?

674
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,880
Ha-yul isn't
going to listen to you this way.

675
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,924
This is just what I look like!

676
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:52,635
Look at that condescending face.

677
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,639
It feels like you're saying
I'm an idiot when you get that look.

678
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,723
Plus, your eyes are scary.

679
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:01,644
'Cause you say stupid, pointless things
all day, like right now!

680
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:03,604
Is it you, Ha-yul?

681
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,440
Where the heck have you been?

682
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,275
None of your business.

683
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,860
You little…

684
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,404
How long are you gonna keep
this attitude, young lady?

685
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,365
199 days.

686
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,494
You think I don't see
what's going on here?

687
00:42:18,994 --> 00:42:20,621
You're glad about the asteroid,
aren't you?

688
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,122
Oh yeah, so glad.

689
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:25,668
-You're going nowhere with those grades.
-Goodness, please don't start that again.

690
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:29,088
Even with my miserable upbringing,
I managed to get into a good school.

691
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:31,006
So what's your excuse for slacking off?

692
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,758
I've paid for all your trips abroad.

693
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,594
I get you the latest smartphones
as soon as they're released!

694
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,762
What have you done, huh?

695
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,222
Stop, stop!

696
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:41,350
You're always taking your anger
out on her!

697
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,394
-How does this make anything better?
-That's great!

698
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,187
Just take her side like always!

699
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,648
I'm disgusted. You're all crazy.

700
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,615
At least we got some snacks, right?

701
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,953
Yeah. It's hardtack,
but that's better than nothing.

702
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:04,582
There are still
so many people leaving.

703
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,333
They're not leaving.

704
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,794
They're just siphoning gas
from abandoned cars.

705
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,718
Yes, Sergeant.

706
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,096
For now, we need
to check the remaining stock.

707
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,640
First, we'll see what we need
and how much,

708
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,350
then we can make another plan.

709
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,521
Sounds good to me.

710
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,608
-Hey, Captain?
-Hmm?

711
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,401
A shuttle bus broke down up ahead.

712
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:43,704
INSPECTION UNDERWAY
HALT

713
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,292
-How long is this gonna take?
-Come on already.

714
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:51,128
-We've been here forever.
-We've been waiting forever.

715
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,137
-What's going on?
-How long till we get out of here?

716
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,223
-Please. How quickly can you fix it?
-The officers are here to help.

717
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,266
Don't worry.

718
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,353
I don't think we can
fix this bus right now.

719
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,812
What do we do?

720
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,731
-Okay.
-You gotta be kidding me!

721
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,691
Listen, it may be uncomfortable,

722
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,985
but we can take you all
on our supply truck.

723
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,780
Everyone, please exit the bus
in an orderly manner,

724
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:18,947
and we'll get you on.

725
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,784
-Excuse me.
-Sure. Take your time.

726
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,327
In-a.

727
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,789
Hi. High five!

728
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,499
-This is so stressful.
-Hmm.

729
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,801
-In-a.
-Please have a seat inside.

730
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:41,136
-Kang In-a.
-Watch your step, ma'am.

731
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,517
What can I do for you, Father?

732
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,269
-You coming back from somewhere?
-I was summoned by the bishop.

733
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,480
-Oh, I see.
-Mm-hmm.

734
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,608
-Uh…
-All done?

735
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,860
-Wait, wait, wait.
-Oh, right.

736
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:57,945
Oh, thank you.

737
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,325
-This is ridiculous.
-Huh?

738
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,327
How are they asking
such a talented officer

739
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,745
to beg for onions and potatoes?

740
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,205
I mean, don't get me wrong.

741
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:10,374
Onions and potatoes are needed,
but still, it…

742
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:16,046
-In-a, stop! In-a, stop it! Stop it!
-I'm on duty right now, Father.

743
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:17,798
Watch how you speak to me.

744
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,467
All right, I get it. All right.
Just let go, please.

745
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,095
Tie it up.

746
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:24,096
Yes, ma'am.

747
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,642
Thank you for your hard work.

748
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:32,521
Hey. Let's move.

749
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,607
Stop the car.

750
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,443
Wait here, please.

751
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,201
What is this?

752
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:49,747
Can you call the dispatcher?

753
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,750
They'd have my new registration number.

754
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:54,501
Sergeant.

755
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,713
-What's going on?
-I need your help.

756
00:45:58,213 --> 00:45:59,506
They won't let me through.

757
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,175
He doesn't have a passport.

758
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:04,595
And this certificate here
is the only thing to verify his identity.

759
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,139
-Go, I'll take care of it.
-Yes, sir.

760
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,432
Step out of the vehicle.

761
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:11,518
Just call him.
It's his problem too.

762
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,978
If he wants his bus back…

763
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,316
Thank you for the ride, man.
I appreciate it.

764
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:41,632
What?

765
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,717
Not four digits maybe?

766
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,470
I'm gonna break this damn door!

767
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:47,763
Oh no! No!

768
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:50,224
Wait. You… you might
set off the alarm!

769
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,518
What am I supposed to do, then?

770
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,937
I have no way of knowing
how many digits there are!

771
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:06,740
That'll take forever!

772
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,763
I finally see her,
thanks to you, Father.

773
00:47:30,347 --> 00:47:32,140
Why don't I see you at mass anymore?

774
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,476
Don't tell me you're facing
the end on your own.

775
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,186
You know, your mom--

776
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,396
No, it was Sister Myeong-ok

777
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:40,023
who said you loved coming to church
when you were young.

778
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:43,026
Well, back then,
I was coming for all the snacks.

779
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,029
Father Baek used to have
all sorts of treats stashed away.

780
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:49,783
Well, he still does.
In a secret room downstairs.

781
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,952
Ah, is that so?

782
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,746
Really? Then I guess
I should raid the place sometime.

783
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,042
Wait, you're serious?

784
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,963
I don't know the passcode.

785
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,426
If I just knew how many digits.

786
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,420
So this is the guy?

787
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:47,257
WOONGCHEON CITY MARTIAL LAW COMMAND
JOINT INVESTIGATION UNIT

788
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,217
-Uh-huh.
-After you.

789
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,225
You enjoy the meal?

790
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,394
Oh, I see you did.

791
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:01,855
Do you smoke?

792
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,566
No, I don't.

793
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,610
We've verified your identity,

794
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,654
but since your travel route
was a bit unusual,

795
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:10,656
there's a lot the JIU needs to confirm.

796
00:49:11,156 --> 00:49:14,368
From now on, you'll be monitored
by Deputy Head Song over here

797
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:16,536
and me, the investigation team leader.

798
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,539
It's almost like I'm a wanted man here.

799
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,546
Yeah.

800
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,757
In a way, you are.

801
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,310
You'll make a report every day.
5:00 p.m., rain or shine.

802
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,937
Where you are. What you're doing.

803
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,939
It's not about you, of course.

804
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:45,983
It's just, given your profession,

805
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,735
there are some sensitive issues
to keep an eye on.

806
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:50,612
Okay, then.

807
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,574
Thank you for your cooperation today.

808
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,661
Remember, 5:00 p.m.

809
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:06,128
Honestly, you were safer in the States
than you are at home.

810
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,964
I don't know who this friend
you came back for is,

811
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,966
but they must be special, huh?

812
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:13,468
Everybody else is
dying to get out these days.

813
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,929
City hall will be
contacting you soon.

814
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,889
Tell them you're not missing anymore.

815
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:23,061
Oh, and right here, this man.
He'll make sure you get home safely. Yeah.

816
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,105
He must be very tired from his journey.

817
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:28,400
Use every shortcut you know,
and get him home as quickly as you can.

818
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:29,359
Got it?

819
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,653
-This way.
-Please.

820
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,709
Excuse me, Mr. Ha.
Your seatbelt.

821
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:53,133
Now, off you go. Go.

822
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,364
-Ms. Jin! Whoa!
-Jesus!

823
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,618
How are you so scared? What's with you?

824
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,207
I thought I told you to go home early.
What are you doing out?

825
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,126
-You're out late, too, though, aren't you?
-Well, I'm not a kid.

826
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:30,462
No fair.
It's not like I'll get to grow up.

827
00:51:35,008 --> 00:51:36,009
Are you all right there?

828
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,553
-All right, go home already.
-Okay.

829
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:42,182
By the way, So-min's worried about you.

830
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,185
Worried? About me?

831
00:51:45,268 --> 00:51:47,521
So you shouldn't be
staying out late either.

832
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:15,757
Good evening.
Did you all arrive home safely?

833
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:20,137
Because this is the time of night
when those scumbags roam the streets.

834
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,223
My friends, we need
to stick together till the end.

835
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,892
I'm sure you all remember
the deplorable incident

836
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,894
where dozens of missing
and kidnapped children

837
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,230
were found dead in a shipping container.

838
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,899
This Oktokki has found out the reason.

839
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,401
After the asteroid collision,

840
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:37,571
what's the one thing
the king of survivors will need?

841
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,490
Slaves to rebuild the capitalist system.

842
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,659
An obedient working class.

843
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:46,955
The future needs its labor force,
and children will be its backbone.

844
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:50,167
That is why
all those kids keep disappearing.

845
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,797
These scumbags kidnap children
to offer them up to their king.

846
00:52:55,881 --> 00:53:00,260
What they receive in return
is a guaranteed ticket to the safety zone.

847
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,429
A ticket to the safety zone!

848
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,436
Those trash bastards!

849
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,317
Oh dear.

850
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:28,788
Taller every day.

851
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,097
Calling me himself, huh?

852
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,185
-Hello?
-Why haven't I heard from you?

853
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,979
Did you sort out the goods?
What about the safe?

854
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,232
I took everything and left quickly.

855
00:53:57,442 --> 00:54:00,695
But Jong-su's phone was missing,
along with some of the goods.

856
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:03,490
You should talk to Manager Im.

857
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,450
About what?

858
