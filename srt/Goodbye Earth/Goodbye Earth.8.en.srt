1
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,128
Hey, you. Over here, Yun-sang.

2
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,921
Huh?

3
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:48,465
What?

4
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,723
Ah, it's all right.

5
00:00:57,432 --> 00:00:59,059
I'm okay.

6
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,644
What was that?

7
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:03,605
What?

8
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,816
Uh, no. Never mind.

9
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:08,818
It was nothing.

This next glass is for all the people
who loved Café Moira.

23
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,171
When the asteroid comes,

24
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:55,216
pretty much everyone will die,
no matter what they do.

25
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,348
All aboard the Death Express!

26
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,310
Okay, everyone!
First things first.

27
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,562
Everybody gets a checkup, okay?

28
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:10,023
-Then you can-- Father, please come in.
-Hello.

29
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,025
Then you can rest
or play if you want.

30
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:12,942
Are you okay?

31
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,904
So listen to the doctors,
and be extra good during your checkup.

32
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,197
-Hi.
-Hello.

33
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,781
-Hi.
-Good, you're here.

34
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,742
-Oh, Young-ji.
-Hey.

35
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:23,036
-Just follow the doctor, okay?
-This way. No, no…

36
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,787
-Se-kyung.
-Hmm?

37
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,289
-You okay?
-Yeah.

38
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:27,957
-Thank you so much.
-This way.

39
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,127
-I'll go take care of Young-han first.
-Okay.

40
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,212
Se-kyung.

41
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,134
Yun-sang needs someone with him.
I'd go, but In-a and I have to go--

42
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,303
-Of course.
-Thanks.

43
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,890
-Come on. This way.
-That's it. This way, yeah.

44
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,143
No, hold on. Take them inside.
Take them inside, please.

45
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,645
-Director, excuse me.
-Yeah?

46
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,272
I know you'll handle things,

47
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,025
but if investigators or the parents
come looking for the kids,

48
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,318
please call us at the base.

49
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,570
I'll keep an eye out.
Don't worry. They're in good hands.

50
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,613
Thanks.

51
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,826
Things are mostly wrapped up here.

52
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:09,791
Oh jeez. How'd those jerks know
to come here so fast?

53
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:14,921
Hmm.

54
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,715
You don't seem to be hurt anywhere.

55
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,092
Captain Kang In-a.

56
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,718
A word.

57
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,932
-We'll need Private Na Hyeon-jae too.
-And her. She's an accomplice.

58
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,600
And him. He was a witness.

59
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,477
-As for the shooter--
-Excuse me.

60
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,355
Can't you start
this investigation tomorrow?

61
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,732
If we could, then we
wouldn't have rushed over here.

62
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,362
Do you think they're gonna run off
in the middle of the night?

63
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,031
-Ma'am. Ma'am!
-I mean, this is ridicu--

64
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,700
-Jeez.
-I can take it from here.

65
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,582
Private Na Hyeon-jae
is receiving treatment.

66
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,169
And these two are civilians
with no involvement in the incident.

67
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,087
Have it your way.

68
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:57,839
Stay here with them.

69
00:04:58,423 --> 00:04:59,632
Keep an eye on the injured.

70
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:04,345
Captain Kang, you'll come with me alone.
I'll be waiting out front.

71
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,684
In-a.

72
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,521
It's my fault.

73
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,902
Uh…

74
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,156
Did you find any gold there?

75
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,242
What? Uh…

76
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,453
I…

77
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,914
That information is confidential, Sister.
I can't disclose that to you.

78
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:55,021
If Father Baek were still here,
he'd just have to call and say,

79
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:58,358
"I heard some people from my congregation
are being investigated."

80
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,318
"I hope it won't take long. Thanks."

81
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,990
And that would solve everything.

82
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,004
Who are you? Oh shit!

83
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,384
Shit!

84
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,059
You.

85
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:34,727
Who are you?

86
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,979
Put the gun down!

87
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,816
-Comply, or I'll open fire!
-Who the hell are you?

88
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,035
-Are you Private Na?
-That's me, Na Hyeon-jae.

89
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:35,997
Where were you hurt again?

90
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,129
You shot someone.

91
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,841
Yeah. The guy there, um,
the suspect, was about to shoot.

92
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,009
Suspect?

93
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,513
How did you know
this man was involved at all?

94
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,140
It looked that way in the moment.

95
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,645
Did your captain order you to shoot?

96
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,814
-No, I--
-Oh!

97
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,941
You made the call yourself.

98
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:04,942
Uh…

99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,085
This is Martial Law Command.

100
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,754
The curfew has been lifted.

101
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:29,383
The current time is 5:00 a.m.
September 4th, 2025.

102
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,346
Dial 999 to report crimes

103
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,516
and 333 to report safety issues.

104
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,809
"Self-defense," was it?

105
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,811
It was an urgent situation,

106
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,064
so I chose to proceed with the operation.

107
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,858
We found evidence of kidnapping
and child abuse that we--

108
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,236
You ignored procedure
and trespassed on private property,

109
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,862
and a civilian was shot.

110
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,281
In what world is that justified?

111
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:58,371
The gravity of the circumstances
called for action immediately.

112
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,164
Abuse was reported by the victim,

113
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,667
according to Section Two,
Clause Three of special Martial Law--

114
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,834
Captain Kang.

115
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,796
That's not why Martial Law exists.

116
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,638
Reverted to
the national treasury.

117
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,267
If these people are really carrying
that much gold on them,

118
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,935
they're planning something big.

119
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,604
Like funding their escape, perhaps?

120
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,898
A chartered plane,

121
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,484
investments, resettlement funds.

122
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,819
How much is all that?

123
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,030
I did some calculations.

124
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:35,491
Since it was a pyramid scheme,

125
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,494
I can only guess
how many people they got to sign up.

126
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,082
But one thing I know for sure,
those people got scammed.

127
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,208
Don't you agree?

128
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,336
In-seong was so handsome.

129
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,423
According to the kids,

130
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,759
Captain Kang brought the military
to the scene and helped Ms. Jin,

131
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,512
which is how they were all able to escape.

132
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,349
Ever since they were young,
if Se-kyung needed help,

133
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,726
In-a would come running.

134
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,311
Huh.

135
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,480
Oh, hey. Your daughter, is she all right?

136
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,565
Yeah.

137
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,611
I thought my heart was about to give out.
I was so worried.

138
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,738
But the kids are holding up all right.

139
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,490
They're all out playing today
like nothing even happened.

140
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,951
Oh goodness! That's a relief, at least.

141
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:22,496
Given the state of the world these days,
you never know what might happen next.

142
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,414
Oh! Careful now.

143
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,293
That's true, but even so,

144
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,129
who would've guessed
that the kids would run off

145
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,256
and do something like that on their own?

146
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,720
Have you heard what they're saying?

147
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,764
That they saw gold bars
at the training center.

148
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,515
Has the church
told you anything about that?

149
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:45,603
Ah! I was wondering why
you suddenly volunteered to help.

150
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,063
Ah! No, I didn't.

151
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,190
It's just that-- I just--

152
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:52,902
With the church fire
and the extension funds disappearing,

153
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,237
I couldn't help wonder if those gold bars…

154
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,575
Actually, Sister Regina
seemed curious about that too.

155
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,701
You know,

156
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,330
if we could get our hands
on just one gold bar,

157
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:05,790
we could all get out.

158
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,542
Oh, that's enough.
Come on. Start cleaning over there.

159
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,336
-Sure.
-Careful, now.

160
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,379
Right.

161
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,881
Where were
the gold exchange regulators?

162
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,758
How is gold regulated anyway?

163
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,011
Where did all that gold found
at the training center come from?

164
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,347
I'm curious as to how
the gold exchange is reacting

165
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,598
to this situation.

166
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,017
Normally, gold exchange fund operators

167
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,978
are supposed to carry
a certain amount of real gold.

168
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,481
They pay a fee
to keep it somewhere secure,

169
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:31,691
like a bank vault.

170
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,777
They use this as insurance
for any number of contingencies,

171
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,654
but it's only partially guaranteed.

172
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,408
The thought being that no thief
would be able to steal it anyway.

173
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,077
The Board of Audit and Inspection
is supposed to check

174
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,289
if those gold exchange fund operators
have the gold they're supposed to.

175
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,375
Then how did
something like this happen?

176
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,877
I don't find it at all surprising.

177
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,921
The money that disappeared
from the church vault

178
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,172
was converted into gold.

179
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,090
You know why?

180
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,008
Because the more volatile
the stock markets,

181
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,344
the more investors prefer
stable assets like gold.

182
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,804
But that begs the question,

183
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,600
how were these people able to amass
such a spectacular amount of gold bullion

184
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,310
out there at the training center?

185
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,272
Physical gold is supposed to be
under thorough regulation

186
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,357
by the fund operators and gold exchange.

187
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:17,361
So how were they able to draw out so much
without anyone noticing?

188
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,779
There's only one explanation.

189
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,324
Simply, they've been planning this
for a long time in advance!

190
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,659
Eternal life!

191
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:29,123
This plot was already in motion
a year before the asteroid announcement.

192
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:32,209
The gold regulation system
was a mess even back then.

193
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,294
In fact,

194
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:36,338
I am very concerned about the impact
that this scandal will have

195
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,841
on the global economy in the future.

196
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,304
But I want all of you to remember

197
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,347
that we are much stronger than gold.

198
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,933
We are stronger than gold!

199
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,685
We are stronger than gold!

200
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,811
Eternal life!

201
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,979
Eternal life!

202
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,983
The asteroid collision
is the dawn of a new world!

203
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,651
Be free of all doubt!

204
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,781
Our future selves
await us on the other side!

205
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,158
-Be free of all doubt!
-What the heck?

206
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,785
Just when he was making sense.

I have a friend who told me

214
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:28,432
she's pregnant.

215
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:29,558
She just found out.

216
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:34,563
And she's not sure
if she should… keep it or not.

217
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:38,442
Even if she does have the baby,
it won't see its first birthday.

218
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,568
Hang on.

219
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,696
Who is this friend of yours?

220
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,032
Is it Se-kyung?

221
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:49,161
Oh! No! No! It's not Se-kyung, okay?

222
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,538
Uh, it's, uh,

223
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,915
another girl I know.

224
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,506
Ah, how exciting.

225
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,008
All we do is dig up spinach.

226
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:03,926
Yeah, I know.

227
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,679
We're stuck here while those bastards
fly away with all of our money.

228
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,888
You know?

229
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,267
I always heard that dreaming of gold
means a child is on the way.

230
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,561
Oh brother. Those darn gold bars.

231
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,688
Dream or not, I just wanna see the gold.

232
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,732
Keep digging. Maybe we'll find some.

233
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,359
Or is it the wrong spot?

234
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,736
You're a greedy one, aren't ya? My God!

235
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,371
Se-kyung really wants you
to get some rest.

236
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,875
You were right, hyung.

237
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,251
Hmm?

238
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:41,088
I keep seeing new sides to Se-kyung
that I never knew about.

239
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,051
Why don't I know
any of these things?

240
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,975
You're finally moving beyond
your preconceived notions.

241
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,020
Now you know all these new things.

242
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,230
I wish I didn't have to know.

243
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,025
Well, if it weren't for
the end of the world…

244
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,736
…you likely never would've.

245
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,369
Is this how the world ends?

246
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,582
Are we all doomed to live like fools?

247
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:21,712
Se-kyung, me, everyone?

248
00:15:23,964 --> 00:15:24,882
The whole planet?

249
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,009
I guess we're just…

250
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,138
a bunch of fools.

251
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,283
Uh, as you may know,

252
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,369
I'm a rather well-known figure.

253
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:56,455
For many years,
under my own name, in fact,

254
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:00,626
I… I hosted a beloved program
for a very influential outlet.

255
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:05,714
So, uh, for your evacuation plan
to run smoothly,

256
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:08,884
if I can make a suggestion,
you need to distract everyone.

257
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,263
If I could be of any use, I'd happily…

258
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,891
Uh, excuse me, ma'am?

259
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,309
Director? Chairwoman?

260
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,190
We have no use for any of your devotion.

261
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:24,984
You have a family.

262
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,527
Give it to them.

263
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,498
If you convince your wife and daughter
to come with you voluntarily,

264
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,709
perhaps I'll reconsider then.

265
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,920
Oh! You won't regret this!

266
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,506
I'll come back with my family,
and we're in, right?

267
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:51,301
The past few days
have been rather unexpected,

268
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,262
but that doesn't change anything.

269
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,472
The evacuation will continue as planned.

270
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:58,559
The last payment for our charter
will be submitted,

271
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,894
and we will all board
on the scheduled date.

272
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,897
That's great,
but can you show us any proof?

273
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,486
Proof exists, but I need you all
to swear a vow of secrecy.

274
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,405
If the truth gets out,

275
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,657
the children could be put in danger,

276
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,451
the public could be provoked,

277
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,828
and we could be at risk
for another attack.

278
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,835
-I swear it!
-I swear too!

279
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,754
-Yes, I swear!
-I swear too!

280
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,089
-I swear I won't tell!
-Me too! Please!

281
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:30,090
Quiet!

282
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,512
The cabinet will all be on
the same chartered flight,

283
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,015
as well as the officials.

284
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,933
-Huh?
-These people here.

285
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,143
That's those…

286
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,020
-Are you serious?
-That's them!

287
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,396
-Yes!
-Yes, yes!

288
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,899
Guys, that's exactly
what it means!

289
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,109
You will be traveling with them.

290
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,569
So rest assured

291
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,572
that our evacuation
is to proceed as planned,

292
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,033
so long as you guard this secret.

293
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:58,911
Code blue!

294
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,122
Code blue in the critical care unit
on the second floor.

295
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,123
Doctor!

296
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,416
Make way.

297
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,459
Code blue.

298
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,754
Code blue in the critical care unit
on the second floor.

299
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,014
Manager Im just died
while receiving treatment, sir.

300
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,435
One, two, three.

301
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,104
One, two, three.

302
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,023
-Nurse Kim, the compressor.
-Yes, Doctor.

303
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,367
What do you think you're doing
with my patients?

304
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,120
All the children from the training center,
including Chae Young-han,

305
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,579
are important witnesses.

306
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,289
I'm just following my orders.

307
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,167
Orders? What orders? On whose authority?

308
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,503
The words you keep repeating
over and over aren't helpful!

309
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,421
The JIU has authority here.

310
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,548
Yes, but

311
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,385
I'm Young-han's family. Can you--

312
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,512
No visits allowed, not even family.

313
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,305
"Not allowed"?

314
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,599
I wanna know who gave
this ridiculous order!

315
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,892
Manager Im.

316
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,310
Yeah, the training center.

317
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,688
They're saying he died.

318
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,117
Yeah.

319
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,703
Cardiac arrest?

320
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,330
I'm not surprised.

321
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,000
Absolutely no creativity.

322
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,045
Oh. Those are for you.

323
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,547
Make sure to eat, okay?

324
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,846
-Pass it over here!
-Cover him!

325
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,432
-Whoa!
-Here, here!

326
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:49,313
Good work.

327
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,445
-Go get some rest.
-Yes, ma'am.

328
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,868
-How are you, ma'am?
-I'm fine.

329
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,787
Just received a report
that Manager Im is dead.

330
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,917
Yes, deputy mayor.

331
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,544
They banned all visits
for training center kids.

332
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,670
Out of nowhere!

333
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,299
-Okay, thanks.
-Hey.

334
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,056
Young-han said he wanted to tell you about
something during the session.

335
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,269
It's about Father Baek.

336
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,772
He said he saw him.

337
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,733
Young-han did?

338
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,527
He told you that he saw Father Baek?

339
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:38,987
Uh-huh.

340
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,240
When? Where was it?

341
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:45,661
The training center owns
several prayer houses in the area.

342
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:49,122
The staff would occasionally
take Young-han to visit one of them,

343
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,667
and my brother saw him there a few times.

344
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,211
So if you're still
looking for Father Baek,

345
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,129
it might be good to check there.

346
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,553
WOOYANG TRAINING CENTER OPENS

347
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:08,767

349
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,405
I talked to someone
who saw Father Baek.

350
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,075
He's at one of these addresses.

351
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,536
Let's go.

FATHER WOO SUNG-JAE

353
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:40,048
Do not be deceived by this. These are
the words of a faceless swindler hiding--

354
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,133
Hey, stop!

355
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,343
-Father!
-Oh my!

356
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:46,596
Captain, I think you should reconsider.
It's only a matter of time before--

357
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,140
I'll take any blame, okay?

358
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,148
What was that?

359
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,364
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

360
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,716
You should get some rest.

361
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,809
The harder I try to make it work…

362
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:19,439
the more I seem to be ruining things.

363
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:23,944
You don't.

364
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,031
It's my fault.

365
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,472
I should've thrown that out.

366
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:59,039
This is the real deal.

367
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,958
A whole organization
dedicated to our safety

368
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,210
and valuing families.

369
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:06,379
Please. I won't take you against
your will, so just hear me out.

370
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,756
Sweetie.

371
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:11,176
Listen to Daddy, okay? Huh?

372
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,221
From now on, everything will be different.

373
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,347
Look. Here.

374
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,725
See? How's this, hmm?

375
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,395
-Why won't it--
-The power is out.

376
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,231
-Huh?
-The power is out.

377
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:25,232
Oh.

378
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:28,401
Ah, then, uh, honey,
do you want anything to eat?

379
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,737
I'll prepare anything you'd like.
Let's see.

380
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,405
What's wrong with him?

381
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,991
Oh! Daddy can make ramyeon!

382
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,204
Uh, packet or cup?

383
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:42,290
Eh?

384
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,460
What's with the big effort
all of a sudden?

385
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,045
It's disturbing.

386
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,554
Remember Seok Tae,
my little brother in Pyongyang?

387
00:25:55,637 --> 00:25:56,805
Yeah.

388
00:25:56,888 --> 00:26:00,100
They dragged his family to Chŏngju
to mine for gold there.

389
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:02,018
I heard it from
my other sibling in Dandong.

390
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:05,981
Pyongyang is a mess these days.
The whole city's empty.

391
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:10,068
Everyone's been carted off
to mine for zinc, gold, and iron.

392
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,029
They're mining everything they can,
but I don't get the point of it

393
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:16,157
when everyone's gonna die
when the asteroid plummets into Earth.

394
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:18,535
It all reminds me of
the Chollima Movement.

395
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:20,537
Chollima was nothing compared to this!

396
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,165
They're not feeding people,

397
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,293
and I've heard stories
about workers dropping dead.

398
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,129
Ugh! Don't think about it, huh?

399
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,714
You just eat up, okay?

400
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,465
Eat as much as you can, hmm?

401
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,598
The engineering building
is completely empty.

402
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,142
Everyone from the lab.

403
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:44,060
Yeah, they all left.

404
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:47,397
But thanks to that, I have the lab
all to myself, which is nice.

405
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:51,484
It's good to see you again. Really.

406
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,488
Well…

407
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:00,827
it's a little awkward to ask
how you've been since I left

408
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,495
when I already know the answer.

409
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:06,750
Yun-sang,

410
00:27:07,417 --> 00:27:08,710
why'd you come back?

411
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,046
Why are you still here, professor?

412
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,675
You young people deserve a chance.
I'm old and useless now.

413
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:16,885
Ah, don't say that.

414
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,429
Who would wanna take in
a withering old man right now?

415
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:22,807
Professor.

416
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:23,975
Oh, Gi-pyo.

417
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,270
You mentioned this dissertation earlier.
I found it in the back.

418
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:32,192
You should come with us.
You'll see Yun-sang win the Nobel Prize.

419
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,028
There's lots of good news on the way.

420
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,530
Dr. Ha.

421
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,784
The director of the lab
really wants to see you.

422
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,620
Stop by when you're done here, okay?

423
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,082
My, my.

424
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:49,668
Gi-pyo's been trying hard
to pin you down, hasn't he?

425
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,176
I'm not sure exactly what
Gi-pyo has in mind.

426
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:01,262
Though… if there's an opportunity,

427
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,057
I think you ought to seize the chance.

428
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,726
Listen, son. At my old age…

429
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:12,148
witnessing humanity's last days,
or half of the world's anyway,

430
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,566
isn't too bad, actually.

431
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,151
You're still young.

432
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,946
You deserve a chance at life.

433
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:24,369
I know that designing genetic variation
will be a key project in the safety zones.

434
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:27,163
You can't let your knowledge go to waste.

435
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,336
From everything I've heard,
I know they're planning to leave.

436
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,504
Will you join them?

437
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:40,468
This opportunity will be the last.
I encourage you to think carefully.

438
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,356
STATEMENT
NAME: NA HYEON-JAE

439
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,286
That's right.

440
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,413
Hey.

441
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,499
Hey.

442
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,712
Hey, heard you killed someone.

443
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:19,174
Wow! You're a murderer, you psychopath.

444
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,804
I can't even sleep at night
because of you, you fucking psycho!

445
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,181
-Kim Hyeon-sik.
-Idiot.

446
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,558
You know what I've realized?

447
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,145
You're really innovative
with the stupid crap you say.

448
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:33,813
You're wrong though.

449
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,775
You see, I'm the real psychopath here.

450
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,652
Got it? Get over here.

451
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,322
Come here. It's okay. I'm not gonna bite.

452
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,742
I got a VIP seat for you right over here.

453
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,660
Sit down!

454
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,164
Mrs. Cluck, why don't you
come out of your coop

455
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,874
and peck out this bastard's eyes?

456
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,793
On the count of three. One, two--

457
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,378
Oh shit!

458
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,216
Go on, get out of here!

459
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:04,010
That prick really is
dumber than a chicken.

460
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,348
-Good riddance.
-Attention!

461
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:10,183
-Hello.
-Ma'am!

462
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,437
-Oh, Captain!
-Yeah?

463
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,688
Hey, hey, you guys!

464
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,023
Come here! Hurry!

465
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,067
They laid eggs. They laid eggs!

466
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,985
-The gals really did it!
-They laid eggs?

467
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,198
I'm proud of you, Mrs. Cluck!

468
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,956
Private Na Hyeon-jae!

469
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,500
You were simply carrying out your mission.

470
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,877
For now, just focus on your duties.

471
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,630
-Yeah.
-That's right.

472
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,257
Y'all had a rough time out there.

473
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,175
-Hey, Ji-su.
-Yes, what is it, ma'am?

474
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,511
-Take him to go rest.
-Come on.

475
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,055
So tell me, Sergeant,

476
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,684
how is it that you know
what anyone has gone through recently?

477
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,649
Wow. You're more observant than I thought.

478
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,611
Oh, ma'am.

479
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,490
Mess Sergeant, it's the JIU.
They need you.

480
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:12,829
The Mess Sergeant?

481
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:13,830
Yeah.

482
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,542
I'll talk to them.

483
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,586
Captain.

484
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,341
Ma'am.

485
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:29,596
Goodbye, ma'am.

486
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,308
-Let's move it.
-Yes, understood.

487
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,059
-Load it here.
-Okay.

488
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,438
-Does this go here?
-Yeah.

489
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,651
We're taking this one too.

490
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,237
Oh wow! Is this the end of Captain Kang?

491
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,865
Stop picking fights
and get discharged already.

492
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,199
I'll put you on the list.

493
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:51,868
Huh?

494
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,748
Doesn't matter that you got disciplined.
If you wanna leave, we won't stop you.

495
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,669
Why are you picking on me?
This unit's filled with losers.

496
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,795
A bunch of trash.

497
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,714
-Hey, watch it!
-Easy, easy.

498
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,424
I'll leave now, sir.

499
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,134
Check all the firearms.

500
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:11,179
Seize all ammunition,
including the guard duty reserves.

501
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,430
Yes, sir.

502
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,350
Aw, you don't wanna mop, huh?

503
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,893
Then get discharged, asshole.

504
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,853
Yeah, that mop smells like shit.

505
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,104
Human trash.

506
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,482
Fuck this shit!

507
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,692
Look out! You pissed him off!

508
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,527
Sick of these fucking morons.

509
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,154
Sergeant Kim is such a prick.

510
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,031
Think I have
nowhere else to go?

511
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,032
Fuckers.

512
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,910
-What's for lunch today?
-I hate that guy.

513
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,120
-Hey.
-Hey.

514
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,998
-Is this First Sergeant Park?
-Yeah, what is it?

515
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,875
Hi, this is Sergeant Kim.

516
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,335
Ew, I'm deleting this too.

517
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,462
Everybody's obsessed with this gold.

518
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,090
No one even cares
that a bunch of kids got rescued.

519
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,132
Ugh, ew.

520
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,052
I mean, I get why they're excited.

521
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,763
Apparently, there's about
500 kilos of gold.

522
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,599
Any country in the world
would take you if you had that.

523
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,727
Is this how we have
to spend our last days?

524
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,437
Deleting disgusting videos?

525
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,314
I'm so sick of this.

526
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:07,568
Yeah, the asteroid will just
destroy this stuff anyway.

527
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:24,419
Every time I delete this porn,
I have to think about my disgusting dad!

528
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,087
I think I'm going crazy!

529
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,424
Now he wants to talk all of a sudden?

530
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:31,843
Wow.

531
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,845
What's the point of talking?

532
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,805
What do you think?

533
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:14,779
Father?

534
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:19,158
How did you… how did you get here?

535
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,159
Did you know?

536
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:21,994
About the passageway?

537
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,497
Oh, no. I just found out about it too.

538
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,207
From this.

539
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,416
It was on the dashcam.

540
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:39,387
Look. The church extension funds
are definitely in that bag, right?

541
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,357
Where have I seen
that driver before?

542
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,988
Standing next to him is Manager Im,
the guy from the training center who died.

543
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,823
All of this is so strange.

544
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:14,130
Where was Father Baek
going with all of that money?

545
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,424
Was he abandoning us?

546
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,385
Well, Father, you must be happy.

547
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,096
Father Baek might actually be alive.

548
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,392
Hey, Father,

549
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:29,437
can you try saving this video
on your phone?

550
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:32,523
I tried to download it earlier.

551
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,736
It didn't work 'cause my phone's too old.
I tried so many times.

552
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,946
I was this close
to ripping everything out.

553
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,741
Why do you need the video?
Who are you sending this to?

554
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:46,287
-Don't tell me you're gonna publi--
-Ah! Don't worry, Father.

555
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,415
I may not always think before I speak,

556
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,626
but that doesn't mean
I don't think at all.

557
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,719
Give me your phone.

558
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,108
Dear Lord…

559
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,946
all I could think about today

560
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,866
was this quote from the Book of Psalms

561
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:28,329
that Father Baek would often cite
and give as a topic for contemplation.

562
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:34,460
"Remember…

563
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,424
all the futility created for us…

564
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,975
all humanity has a destiny
from the creator."

565
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:09,829
Look who decided to show up!
Come on in. We'll take a picture.

566
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:12,164
-Yun-sang. Yun-sang!
-Oh, hey!

567
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:17,503
Look here. Say cheese, all right?
One, two, three!

568
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:21,382
-Now you can eat.
-Gosh, thank you.

569
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,467
Careful!
Can't afford to spill anything!

570
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,469
Mmm, this is good!

571
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,513
That's yours,
but this one is all mine.

572
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,433
-Oh, look at Ji-eun.
-Get a room, you two.

573
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,393
-Ugh, seriously, unni?
-What are they doing?

574
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,936
-Unni!
-Say cheese!

575
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,980
-Ah! Cut it out!
-Ah, let them be!

576
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,982
Can't you all see their love?

577
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,066
-Anyway…
-Yeah?

578
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,444
You're not actually closing
the store, are ya?

579
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,779
Of course not. We have Ji-eun here.

580
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,782
Plus, Sister Gye Hyang over there,
who just told me that,

581
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,826
since she doesn't have
that many days left,

582
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,870
she wants to try out something new.

583
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,955
And you'll keep Moira open, won't you?

584
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,458
Where else am I going to go
to listen to music?

585
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,918
Well, of course, my dear.

586
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,879
Don't worry. We'll stay open for you.

587
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,174
I haven't seen Sister Chae-hwan.
Where is she?

588
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,051
Oh! That reminds me.

589
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,596
Your daughter. Is In-a still coming later?

590
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,056
-Ah, I don't know.
-Hey, uh…

591
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,142
Uh, she's not dating anyone
these days, is she?

592
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,227
-Ah! That's enough. My goodness.
-What do you mean?

593
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:18,147
Hey, hey! Se-kyung, Se-kyung.
Yun-sang, Yun-sang.

594
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,232
-Hey, listen up, you two!
-Huh?

595
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:22,318
You should go to the parish
and get married already.

596
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:25,321
-Right! Yeah!
-That's right! Come on, now!

597
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,697
Tie the knot!

598
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,325
-Tie the knot! Tie the knot!
-What are you waiting for?

599
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,952
-Hurry up! You know I'm leaving soon.
-Okay, hold on.

600
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,330
-Yeah.
-All right, come on!

601
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,623
Tie the knot, or take a shot!

602
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,958
-Ooh, I wanna shot!
-Tie the knot, or take a shot!

603
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,086
-This is so random.
-Oh no, you get out of here.

604
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,879
-Back off!
-Just the girls, okay? All right.

605
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,506
Smile and say cheese!

606
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,258
-Okay.
-Cheese!

607
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,844
-Aw, that… that looks great.
-How'd it come out?

608
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,971
-Right, it's not ready yet.
-Give it a sec.

609
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,973
Oh, I know what we should do!

610
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,601
Let's hear a goodbye speech
from Mi-ryeong.

611
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,104
Ah, come on! What goodbye speech?

612
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,981
-Attention!
-Okay, okay. Then, everybody, sit down.

613
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:04,026
-Let's hear it.
-Sit down. Come on.

614
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,571
Oh my gosh. This is embarrassing.

615
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,699
-Aw, what? You gonna cry?
-No! Don't cry!

616
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,326
Let's see those tears!

617
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,369
Ah, you!

618
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,040
Since it looks like this country is
about to go down,

619
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:22,586
and… we don't have too many days left,
you may be asking why I'm doing this.

620
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,132
I guess I just wanted to do something

621
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:28,342
I wouldn't have normally done.

622
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,846
-I dunno. Come out here a sec.
-Huh? What?

623
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,432
-Hey, why me? What… what are you--
-Oh, stop it!

624
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,059
Uh, years ago…

625
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,063
…this man came here to Woongcheon with me.

626
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:46,110
We've run Café Moira
and Wondermart together ever since.

627
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:49,238
And Wondermart will be left
in good hands, you know?

628
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,365
Ji-eun will take care of it.

629
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:55,411
And the café, I'm sure
you'll keep cherishing it, won't you?

630
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,580
And now,

631
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:02,751
because this man here says
he'll come with me on another journey, I…

632
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,838
Gosh, I didn't wanna cry!

633
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,423
Ugh, what's wrong with me?

634
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,470
-Aw, come on now, honey.
-Don't cry.

635
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:15,973
Don't cry.

636
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,809
-Unni. Don't cry, unni.
-Don't cry.

637
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,605
Don't you cry.

638
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,691
Myeong-ok, get in here.

639
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,862
-Let me get a hug from you.
-Yeah.

640
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:31,864
Oh dear.

641
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,659
Don't go. Please don't go.

642
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,495
Don't go. Don't go.

643
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,915
Goodness, it's a sea of tears.

644
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,168
-You take care of yourself.
-Oh, why do you have to go?

645
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,174
-Se-kyung.
-Okay. That's enough!

646
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:54,053
Let's take a group photo
with the women of Woongcheon FFC, huh?

647
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:56,764
-You girls get over here.
-No more crying now! No crying!

648
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,307
-Come here.
-FFC, FFC, FFC.

649
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:01,268
-Okay, the camera's ready.
-F whatever!

650
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,395
-Everybody, squeeze in!
-Yup, right here.

651
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,481
-All together now. FFC!
-You got a chant?

652
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:08,442
All together! Go FFC! Woongcheon!

653
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,654
-All together! FFC!
-FFC!

654
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,280
You know what I just realized?

655
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:16,033
This'll be the last picture
of us alive, huh?

656
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,621
Together to the end!

657
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,482
Huh? Oh!

658
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,694
You finally got discharged?
When did you get here, you bastard?

659
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,237
Hey, move it. Out of the way.

660
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,426
You hungry? Let's eat.

661
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:19,888
Come here, kid. Say hi.
You'll be working together from now on.

662
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:22,182
Sit down.

663
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,476
Sit!

664
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,439
Forget the army chow.
Let's eat some real food.

665
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:32,818
You know Manager Jeong's boys, don't you?
You'll be in charge of them.

666
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:37,114
I thought you said you'd introduce me
to a broker to get me to the US.

667
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,035
Drink up.

668
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,787
Wait, wait!
Wh… what are you doing?

669
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:45,581
-Don't touch me! Hold on!
-Shut it!

670
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,717
No gun on him. He's not the one.

671
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,178
Why the fuck would I
carry a gun around here?

672
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,679
Searching me is bullshit!

673
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,062
-Hyeon-sik.
-First Sergeant Park?

674
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,190
I thought these guns and ammunition
were supposed to be sent to the SMU?

675
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,984
Sergeant So,
a soldier does what they're told.

676
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:15,277
Keep your mouth shut.

677
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:16,987
Yeah, just shut up.

678
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,614
Hey, Hyeon-sik. Take this box.

679
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,700
This shit is heavy.

680
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,662
-Did you check that yet?
-Yeah.

681
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:33,587
The ammunition we hid that night

682
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,756
suddenly disappeared without a trace.

683
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:39,593
You didn't take it.
It wasn't So Ju-yeon either.

684
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,556
"It's bullshit," you said?

685
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,892
You're preaching to the choir there.

686
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:48,977
Out of

687
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,271
all those thugs who had guns, one is dead,

688
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,981
one went missing,

689
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,900
and the last one had a heart attack.

690
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,907
Be careful, kid. It's rough these days.

691
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,119
The higher-ups
are starting to get nervous.

692
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,829
They want us to lay low.

693
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,415
Inconvenient 'cause there's
a bunch of shit we gotta do.

694
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:11,375
Hey, call Manager Jeong.

695
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:14,670
Here you go.

696
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,880
Same thing for the late-night snack?

697
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:17,965
Mmm.

698
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,970
Hey, Hyeon-sik. The food's getting cold.
Hurry up and eat.

699
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,518
You're hopeless. You should've at least
changed out of your uniform.

700
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,147
We got some big rooms on the second floor.
Go on. Pick one.

701
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:41,905
Hey.

702
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,542
You look even uglier without your uniform.

703
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:54,960
Shut your hole.

704
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,795
Why'd you ask to meet?

705
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,508
I have something I wanna ask you.

706
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,052
Like what? You wanna go on a date?

707
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,680
Who the hell would wanna date you?

708
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,852
Uh, it's…

709
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,105
Could you

710
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:16,690
get a gun?

711
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,358
I wanna get a gun.

712
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:21,320
Huh? Why would you ask that?

713
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,113
You were a soldier, weren't you?

714
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,033
Don't tell me you left without taking one.

715
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,160
Hey, not even officers can do that.

716
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:33,999
Listen.

717
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,005
It's okay. Just come here.

718
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,176
Deal?

719
00:46:44,843 --> 00:46:46,261
What do you say?

720
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:53,727
Just give it some thought, hmm?

721
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,945
Oh, where did everyone go?

722
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,154
They didn't even eat.

723
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,408
What is that?

724
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:10,244
Oh my.

725
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,455
Goodness, that little-- Shoo! Go!

726
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,583
Ah! Go!

727
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,191
Father.

728
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,488
-Come on. Open up.
-Father, please open up.

729
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:48,824
Father Woo Sung-jae.

730
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,162
-Let me.
-Okay.

731
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,752
Damn it. Hey! Sung-jae!

732
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,506
Fasting won't change anything.

733
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:09,219
You have new information.

734
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,680
You need to start thinking
about what to do!

735
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:15,559
Are you praying?

736
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:19,521
Is praying gonna change the situation?

737
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:24,443
Woo Sung-jae, open the door!

738
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,945
We need to come up with a plan!

739
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,535
Woo Sung-jae!

740
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,331
Open the door, Woo Sung-jae!

741
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,460
Open the door!

742
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,171
Sung-jae.

743
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,041
We have to find the link.

744
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:23,752
How is Father Baek
connected to all of this?

745
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,339
I can't believe he's doing this to us.

746
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:29,967
I have no idea.

747
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,386
Unfortunately, my hands
are tied at this point.

748
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,472
If I try anything right now,
they'll definitely…

749
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:37,391
Just focus on feeding your soldiers.

750
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:39,267
Yun… Yun-sang, I'm taking the car.

751
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:41,228
Se-kyung, wait. Where are you going?

752
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:43,438
Yun-sang,
I brought the lab director with me.

753
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,606
Dr. Ha.

754
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:49,861
I heard you came by the lab
several times without visiting us.

755
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,571
I find that very hard to understand.

756
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,573
Uh, sorry about that.

757
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,535
No need to say sorry.
It's all good. Right?

758
00:49:56,618 --> 00:50:00,455
Of course.
No need to dwell on such minor details.

759
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,249
If I may, Dr. Ha,

760
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,210
I have this wonderful bottle of liquor
for you. How about it?

761
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:08,171
Let bygones be bygones.
You see, I've moved on from the past.

762
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,716
So let's put any misunderstandings
behind us.

763
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:12,259
Shall we?

764
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,053
I'll come visit you at the lab
some other time. Right now, is--

765
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,888
-Se-kyung. Excuse me.
-Se-kyung could join us.

766
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:20,017
-Yeah, she'd be more than welcome.
-Oh yes, of course.

767
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,060
-Excuse me. I'm sorry.
-Wait! Hey, Yun.

768
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,271
-Dr. Ha! Dr. Ha!
-Yun-sang!

769
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,399
He still doesn't seem
to understand the situation.

770
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,901
Don't worry. He's just a little naive.

771
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:32,195
Forget it. Naive, my ass.

772
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:33,613
Let's go!

773
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,909
Se-kyung, hey!

774
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,287
In-a!

775
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:42,831
Se-kyung, wait!

776
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,112
This is Ha Yun-sang calling.

777
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:24,581
Hey, guys,

778
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:27,375
you need to keep your promise, okay?

779
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,754
How much gold are you willing to give us?

780
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,214
Uh, well,

781
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:34,966
around 800 kilograms.

782
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:38,595
But this isn't everything.
We'll bring more, okay?

783
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:42,891
Yeah. Can we trust them?

784
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,976
-Mr. Song.
-Yeah, I think we can.

785
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,229
-I'll notify the others.
-Mm-hmm.

786
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:48,855
Sounds good.

787
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:53,485
They're quite desperate, sir.
I think we can do it on your terms. Okay.

788
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,529
All right, we have a deal.

789
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,239
Okay.

790
00:51:57,948 --> 00:52:00,450
-You guys like coffee? How about it?
-Sounds good, yeah.

791
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,868
-Let's go.
-Let's do that.

792
00:52:08,291 --> 00:52:10,585
Here. A bulletproof vest.

793
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:12,754
Please put that on.

794
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,299
I'm going in alone this time.

795
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:19,678
Like hell you are.

796
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:21,138
Hurry up and put it on.

797
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:23,890
It'll just take a second.
You don't even have any bullets.

798
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,520
It doesn't matter.
It's my duty to protect civilians.

799
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:33,275
I'm just going in to check
and coming right back.

800
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:39,573
Se-kyung.

801
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,909
Will finding Father Baek
really change anything?

802
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,327
What are you planning to do?

803
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:46,913
That'll be up to him.

804
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,166
We all saw the video on the dashboard cam.

805
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:52,794
-Father Baek is probably long gone now.
-No, he isn't. He's still here.

806
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,758
Young-ji's little brother saw him there
in one of their houses.

807
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:00,760
What?

808
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:04,181
I've been wondering what could be done

809
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,641
ever since the church burned
and the money disappeared.

810
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:08,310
-This could--
-Listen, Se-kyung.

811
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:10,729
The world's ending.
Don't make your life mor--

812
00:53:10,812 --> 00:53:12,814
We can't just stand by, In-a.

813
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,608
If Father Baek is still there,

814
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,861
I'm gonna find him and beg.

815
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,029
For what?

816
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,240
Don't be so naive.

817
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:24,284
He's not gonna take your kids
to a safety zone.

818
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,122
I'll need your assistance, then.

819
00:53:29,873 --> 00:53:32,292
Yun-sang's, Sung-jae's, yours.

820
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,252
Okay?

821
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:40,008
So stay safe until then.

822
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:45,639
Don't worry too much, In-a.

823
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,641
I'll be careful,
and I won't take long, okay?

824
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,648
At the very least, wear this, please.
I need to see you put on the vest.

825
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:57,067
It's a little heavy
since it's an older model.

826
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,361
Can you just wear it? Please, Se-kyung.

827
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,529
Come on.

828
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:04,866
I'm running behind already,
but I'll put this on for you.

829
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,619
You're kidding me.
A second isn't gonna kill ya.

830
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:09,704
-I put it on.
-But a bullet sure will.

831
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,706
What about an asteroid, then?

832
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,502
Seriously, that mouth of yours.

833
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,671
I'll come back later today, hmm?

834
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,976
Don't worry too much. I'll be back soon.

835
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,019
-Remember? You promised. Yeah?
-Yeah.

836
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,562
Mmm. I promise.

837
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:47,033
Wow!
You still have ingredients?

838
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:50,328
I heard a bunch of places around here
had to close down.

839
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,580
The nightclub managers provide everything.

840
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,791
Where do they get it, then?

841
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:55,834
Who knows?

842
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:59,004
All I know is that
they take their cut off the top.

843
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,797
They leave me with almost nothing.

844
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,424
Oh well.

845
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:05,719
They say that rations are going up,
so at least I won't starve.

846
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:13,977
Ma'am, just one more thing.
Do you know who the managers are here?

847
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:17,314
Pretty much everyone is a manager here.

848
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:19,691
Manager Lee. Manager Kim.
It's all bullshit.

849
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:22,902
You see, um, the guy I'm looking for,

850
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:25,822
he doesn't work here,
but he seems close to the managers.

851
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:28,533
He works for another group
as an accountant.

852
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:32,037
This guy. I think his name is Manager Im.

853
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,246
I heard he died.

854
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:35,832
So you know.

855
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,542
Of course I know him.

856
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:41,254
Father Beck was always coming here,
trying to turn him into a better man.

857
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,757
Him, Bae Jong-su, and Manager Lee.

858
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,633
I don't know why
the nightclub managers here

859
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:48,720
would be paying him off
or what they were hoping to get.

860
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:57,062
-Hey, Sergeant.
-Is that her?

861
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:02,609
-Step out of the car.
-Oh.

862
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:04,027
Sir!

863
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:06,863
Well, well, well.

864
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:08,573
Good evening.

865
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,538
What are you doing here?

866
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:17,540
Huh?

867
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:19,667
Yeah.

868
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,169
Let's go.

869
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:22,545
Will you two be okay?

870
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,091
Yeah, thank you. So can you leave now?

871
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:27,592
Sure.

872
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:32,263
You should close your window.
You'll let the mosquitos in.

873
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,893
What do you have to do with the JIU?

874
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,315
He told me to call if I needed help.

875
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:46,027
Don't tell me you thought
I'd let you go alone.

876
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:51,157
Close that.
He wasn't kidding about the mosquitos.

877
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,159
Uh, okay.

878
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:56,413
Um…

879
00:56:58,748 --> 00:56:59,791
When we get there…

880
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,962
we'll have to ask him what happened

881
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:07,173
and see if he admits
to the things we already know.

882
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:12,804
Safe travels.

883
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:20,270
Also, I wanna be the one driving.
