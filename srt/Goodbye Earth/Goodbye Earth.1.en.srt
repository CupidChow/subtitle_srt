You back, Mom?

7
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,114
She's not here. Not even today.

8
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,078
We're all doomed!

9
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,894
-We don't have to worry…
-Hae-chan, it's okay.

10
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,646
…about asteroid collisions anymore.

11
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:27,605
Aw.

12
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,150
Scientists have
worked hard to discover several ways

13
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,152
to alter where an asteroid goes.

14
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,155
One of the main ways is
to create a direct collision

15
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,866
that will send the asteroid down
another path.

16
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:41,786
And now, this particular asteroid
is called Didymos.

17
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:44,539
It has a small moon
that circles around it.

18
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,083
-"Didymoon." Have you heard of it?
-Yeah!

19
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,210
Yeah, so, know what I got here?

20
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,631
I don't know!

21
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:56,593
Yeah, it's a probe.
How have you never heard of that?

22
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,844
So what, know-it-all?

23
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,222
Three years ago, so in 2022,

24
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:04,392
this probe went into space
for ten months and flew,

25
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,935
then crashed into Didymoon.

26
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,480
That's one way you can change
the orbit of an asteroid.

27
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,734
And, you'll remember, I'm sure,

28
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,903
a small shift can make it miss the Earth.

29
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,283
Hae-chan, that makes you
feel better, doesn't it?

30
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,627
The asteroid's coming!

31
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,047
It's gonna kill us all!

32
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,888
Isn't that just great!

33
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:44,766
Great! Just our luck!

34
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,728
Great!

35
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,484
"My older brother is
blowing up a big balloon."

36
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,278
"Stop blowing.
It looks like it's going to pop."

37
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,490
We're all gonna die!

38
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:03,243
-"I have butterflies."
-Hear that? Wow!

39
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,245
Great!

40
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:12,627

00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,641
Take a break and play with us, huh?

73
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:14,976
You're training too hard!

74
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,644
You should sit down.

78
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,453
Hello there. I'll be back, Yun-sang.

79
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,341
Attention, please.
This is Sejong International Airport.

80
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,928
We are currently experiencing delays
for the flights to safety zone countries.

81
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,888
We kindly request that passengers wait

82
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,848
while paying attention
to the announcement.

83
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,857
Everyone, this way.

84
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,943
-Hi, excuse me.
-Yeah?

85
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,529
I have a son who's leaving today
with his family.

86
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,821
-I'm worried.
-Uh-huh.

87
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,741
I've heard that there aren't actually
any supplies in the bunkers

88
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,910
and that the evacuees will be abandoned.

89
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:59,455
That's never gonna happen, sir.
It's all fake news, okay?

90
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:04,043
Hey! Yeah. All of this is under
the international treaty, okay?

91
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,628
I wouldn't worry about it.

92
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:08,130
-Are you going to Nigeria?
-Not us. My son's the one leaving.

93
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,216
Okay, then leave.
You really shouldn't be out here.

94
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,093
Come on, let's find them.

95
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,011
…Sejong International Airport…

96
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,846
Ah, there they are.

97
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,475
Jae-won! Over here! Jae-won!

98
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,145
South Korea! South Korea!

99
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,565
Mom, here! Mom, right here!

100
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,607
Ah!

101
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,818
-Please, you didn't have to come.
-Oh, you're here.

102
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,446
We've been
looking for you everywhere.

103
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,491
Oh, thank goodness.

104
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,493
They said
we can't bring these on board.

105
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,746
How are you supposed to live
without deonjang and gochujang?

106
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,665
-You can't bring any of these?
-It's the rule.

107
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,459
What about this, then?
You have to bring this with you.

108
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,003
No, no, no, really.

109
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,380
-Su-dong, you'll need this more here.
-We're fine over here.

110
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:52,174
-It'll be harder overseas.
-You should be the one to have them.

111
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,510
Take these.
You gotta make sure you all eat well.

112
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,638
Our position has changed,
I need to tell you. We're refugees now.

113
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,807
And it's gonna be okay.

114
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,518
-I asked about the rumors.
-There is nothing we can do now.

115
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,395
They're false, okay?

116
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:08,274
Don't listen to any of that.
And it's all just a bunch of nonsense.

117
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,651
They'll be fine,
so let's send them off with a smile.

118
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,403
It'll all be okay.

119
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,864
-We promise to come get you.
-All right. It's okay.

120
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,783
-We'll come back for you.
-Don't worry about us.

121
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,663
We're happy just knowing
you'll be safe. Don't worry.

122
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:24,832
Ha-yul.

123
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:29,128
Be careful with your parents, okay?
I hope you'll make some friends too.

124
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,008
Jin-seo, don't cry.

125
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,928
You're gonna do well, okay?

126
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,099
It's good that things
are a lot calmer now.

127
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:44,393
It'll make your trip less chaotic.

128
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,729
The people in line aren't angry.

129
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,314
They actually look kind again.

130
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,567
Yeah, it was pretty scary
for a while there.

131
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,194
Yeah, things are calmer now.

132
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,489
So we should leave, don't you think?

133
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,659
-Just a minute.
-Hmm?

134
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,911
Are you positive I won't die if I leave?

135
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,371
It's important that I know.

136
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,209
Mm-hmm.

137
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,961
Ha-yul. Hurry up.
Let's go. Come on. Hurry.

138
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,131
-Let's go already!
-Uh…

139
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,592
This way.

140
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,013
-Oh…
-Ms. Jin!

141
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,306
-Oh.
-Ha-yul!

142
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,307
So-min.

143
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:27,144
-Um…
-What is this?

144
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:29,980
You're giving me a love letter?

145
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,067
Read it when you're alone, okay?

146
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,944
Uh…

147
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:37,405
Ha-yul! It's time, come on.

148
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,616
Hey, hey. Take care, okay?

149
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,120
Come on, let's go!

150
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,622
May we have
your attention, please.

151
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,749
It is important to remain calm…

152
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,252
You're okay. Come here. It's okay.

153
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,795
Please have a safe trip.

154
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,338
Mmm.

155
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,299
It's okay.

156
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,389
Due to the delay
in the repair of communication facilities

157
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,142
that were destroyed
during the asteroid crisis,

158
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:09,311
inconveniences are expected to continue.

159
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,774
To minimize the disruption caused by
the suspension of public transportation,

160
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:18,195
city hall is operating a free shuttle bus
to Seoul four times a day.

161
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,699
Distribution of emergency supplies
that were previously unavailable

162
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:22,616

163
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,660
This way, sir.

164
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,828
Watch your step.

165
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,083
-Oh, you're here, Ms. Jin.
-Morning.

166
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,919
-Oh, hey.
-Hi, good morning.

167
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,672
We'll start
distributing ration tickets.

168
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:39,008
-Good morning.
-Oh, it's you.

169
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,677
-Will you be helping out at the hospital?
-Uh, yeah.

170
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,638
I have survivor family counseling sessions

171
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,725
and then some personal errands at 2:00,
so I should be there at 4:00, okay?

172
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,977
Sounds good to me.
All right, take care, then.

173
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,395
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

174
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,231
DISASTER MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT

175
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,442
You update that thing every day, huh?

176
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,445
What, are you happy?
Looking forward to D-Day or something?

177
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,073
That's not true.

178
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,293
201 DAYS LEFT
AUGUST 5, 2025

179
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,003
Dear citizens,

180
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:20,508
asteroid Dina is going to collide
with Earth in 300 days.

181
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,344
As NASA announced,

182
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:27,348
the Korean peninsula will, unfortunately,
be the impact location.

183
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:31,352
Therefore, the government
will set up a migration plan.

184
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,231
Until then,
to protect the lives of the citizens,

185
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:39,944
as of midnight of April 29, 2025,

186
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,614
martial law will be declared nationwide.

187
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,118
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention.

188
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,495
300 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

189
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:53,791
Please remain calm and walk slowly
while traveling through the area.

190
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,252
CITIZENS RIOT AT NEWS OF MARTIAL LAW

191
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,420
ARE THEY ABANDONING
THE COUNTRY AMID CRISIS?

192
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,922
CHAOS AND FEAR AROUND THE WORLD

193
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,304
Why are you hiding? Huh?

194
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,558
Our building's getting ransacked
right now.

195
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,395
You okay? Huh?

196
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,858
Go down the hall!

197
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:21,193
Shoot anyone who's not cooperating!

198
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:31,495
Come on! We need to hide in here!

199
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,256
Don't worry about me, okay?

200
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,593
These guys are only here
to ransom the higher-ups.

201
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:49,805
I'm nobody here.
I don't think they'll hurt me, so…

202
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,390
Mmm. Okay, then.

203
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,100
TIME FOR THE WORLD TO UNITE

204
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,060
I'm more worried
about these guys.

205
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,772
They know something's wrong.
They're acting stressed.

206
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,941
Oh, yeah.

207
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,863
Are things okay on your end?
I know it's getting pretty intense.

208
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:09,408
There's a riot
going on outside.

209
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,368
Is Father Baek doing okay?

210
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,203
I'll come back as soon as possible.

211
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:17,541
I'm already on a few flight waitlists.
I'll find the first seat available.

212
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,252
You wanna come back? Are you insane?

213
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,795
It's a big war zone here.

214
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,131
That's why I should come back.

215
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,928
Man, I'm just glad I went out
and got our rings though.

216
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,512
REFUGEE RESOLUTION UNDER CONSIDERATION

217
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,098
This one is yours, and this is mine.

218
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:37,144
I'm wearing 'em both
so I don't lose 'em. 

219
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,521
-You and your optimism.
-Hmm.

220
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,487
Stay put until the riots calm down, yeah?

221
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,032
Your lab is protected
by the government over there.

222
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,701
You'll be safer in the States--

223
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,286
Don't move! Hold still.

224
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,539
-Hold still, everybody!
-You safe being there?

225
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,083
Move now. Hurry!

226
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,501
Shut up and face forward!

227
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,544
Go! Don't move!

228
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,004
-Keep walking!
-Shut up!

229
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,881
-Please!
-Let's go!

230
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,091
Stop!

231
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,468
Make sure the door is locked.

232
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,804
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

233
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:15,933
You shouldn't be making
any noise there. Let's end the call.

234
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,559
It's no problem.

235
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,895
-Nobody's…
-Clear. Clear.

236
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,355
Check in there?

237
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,899
-Um…
-Try that room.

238
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,236
I think it's so loud
that no one will be able to hear us.

239
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,989
GLOBAL APOCALYPSE IN 300 DAYS

240
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,490
Move. Move faster!

241
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,742
KOREAN PENINSULA TO BE ENGULFED IN FLAMES

242
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:38,080
Everybody, line up against the wall.
Face the wall. I don't want trouble!

243
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,625
Hands behind your back.

244
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,294
You too. Come out now!

245
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,188
No, please stop!

246
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,607
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

247
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:10,487
Please stop! Don't hurt me!

248
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,037
No, please!

249
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,123
MIGRATION PLANS IN PREPARATION
CITIZENS' SAFETY COMES FIRST

250
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,052
Open!
Open this fucking door!

251
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:35,888
-Yun-sang.
-Get up!

252
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,723
-Ha Yun-sang!
-Get the fuck up!

253
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,975
-You hear me? Ha Yun-sang!
-Go to the priest.

254
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,185
Go to Father Baek!

255
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:50,903
I realize this goes against
the ban on rallies, but this is too much.

256
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,906
They only came here to pray,
one by one, out of anxiety.

257
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,241
It's not like Father Baek is
deceiving people

258
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,494
and going around spreading rumors
or any lies, you know?

259
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:01,455
He's only helping those
who really might be in dire need of…

260
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:04,875
No more.

261
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,253
Let's not worry.

262
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,799
Pray, instead.
We will all meet again soon.

263
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:15,636
Even if it takes time, we must believe

264
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,387
in the power of the Lord.

265
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,808
He will see us through it.
Let's pray for us all.

266
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:26,230
These soldiers here,
they're only doing their jobs.

267
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,357
Pray for them.

268
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,692
They're here for your own good.

269
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,361
Please get in the car.

270
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,488
-Unbelievable.
-Out of the way!

271
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,281
Now!

272
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:44,915
Wait. Where's he going?

273
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,584
-It's about Yun-sang. Hold on. Yun-sang.
-Father Baek.

274
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:48,585
Help us!

275
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,798
…gatherings are prohibited
by martial law. Understood?

276
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,598
Oh no. What have I done?

277
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,767
-How can they…
-I shouldn't have let them in.

278
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,644
Of course you shouldn't have!

279
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:09,189
-They're kidnapping him!
-How can they do this? It's ridiculous.

280
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,316
They just ran in here
and took our priest away.

281
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,485
-I can't believe this.
-Believe this.

282
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,778
Ah, this is stupid!

283
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:17,364
We should've blocked the whole road
and not let them come in here.

284
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,158
Who do these people think they are, huh?

285
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,952
How dare they take Father Baek away
like some criminal!

286
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,288
I know he will return soon.

287
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,623
Have a bit more faith in Father Baek.

288
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,587
Knowing what he's like,
he probably already has a plan.

289
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,506
Wait, do you know something
that we don't?

290
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,218
I say that we should all just pray.
That's all we've got. Let's go!

291
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,348
-Wait! Everyone! Everyone!
-Hurry. Let's go.

292
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:46,351
Actually, for now,
you should all just go home.

293
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,147
We aren't supposed to gather
for the time being.

294
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,608
Just for now, let's--

295
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,067
Ms. Jin! Se-kyung!

296
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,864
While high military command
was attempting to take refugees overseas,

297
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:02,659
a rebellion erupted within the military,
leading to a civil war.

298
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:06,496
Loud gunfire and smoke
have been reported in metropolitan areas.

299
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,290
WEDDING
HA YUN-SANG, JIN SE-KYUNG

300
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,958
Is Yun-sang not coming?

301
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,502
A daily peace rally
is being held downtown…

302
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,712
You okay?

303
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,631
…prepare safe migration plans.

304
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,050
From young students to the elderly,

305
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,636
citizens of all ages
are gathered at the square,

306
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,221
desperately crying out for survival.

307
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,388
POSTPONED

308
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:24,598
For our next story,

309
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,226
there was a mass jailbreak
at Woongcheon Prison.

310
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,561
Many of these jailbreakers
are violent criminals

311
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,730
who have committed murder and kidnapping,

312
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:35,317
so authorities are emphasizing the need
for caution during this dangerous time.

316
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:00,092
Everyone, don't fall victim to fear!
All of these rumors are lies!

317
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:03,220
Do not panic!
There is no selective migration!

318
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,263
PREPARE MIGRATION PLANS

319
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,639
SAVE THE CHILDREN AT LEAST

320
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:09,268
This is reporter Kim Min-ho
from Cheondong Middle School.

321
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,854
I'm currently out here
at the Woongcheon citizens' peace rally.

322
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,357
Do you think it's true
that an asteroid is coming?

323
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,234
You all have to listen to me.

324
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,944
Just look at me.

325
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,406
-Don't let these false rumors fool you!
-Don't be fooled, everyone!

326
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:26,201
Stop putting your trust
in these toxic, untrue lies.

327
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,329
As a citizen of Woongcheon,
what do you think, Ha-yul?

328
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,373
-So-min?
-Hi there!

329
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,457
Jin-seo?

330
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,714
-That is the government policy!
-You're lying!

331
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,466
Oh? It's Ms. Jin.

332
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,718
Ms. Jin!

333
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,927
We're right here!

334
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,721
Ms. Jin! We're here!

WOONGCHEON CITY HALL

336
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:07,826
Class 2-2, get yourself back!

337
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,287
Cheondong Middle School!

338
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,873
Let's first get the children out safely!

339
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:16,293
-Class 2-2 from Cheondong Middle School!
-Let us in! Come on! Let us in!

340
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,218
Ms. Jin! Help!

341
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,470
Ha-yul.

342
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,766
Ms. Jin!

343
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,061
MY DEAR CLASS 2-2

344
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,812
Su-yeon, where are you?

345
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:40,442
-I'm hiding in a bathroom.
-Ms. Jin, I'm so scared.

346
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,819
-I'm with Jin-seo.
-They took them away.

347
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:46,031
Come to the right back corner
of the square. We can all hide here.

348
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,908
They're taking our friends.

349
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,692
Ms. Jin!

350
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,205
Hey, stop!

351
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,050
Upon the surrender of
the rebel forces' leadership,

352
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,887
we are now approaching the end
of the long-waging civil war

353
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,264
that broke out after the asteroid crisis.

354
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:35,640
279 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

355
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,350
Hey, block off this side too.

356
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,618
Ms. Jin.

357
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,870
-Uh, it's okay.
-Don't cry.

358
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,330
-Please, Ms. Jin.
-Oh!

359
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,289
Here.

360
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:07,088
Oh no!

361
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,386
Ha-yul.

362
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:16,806
Ha-yul.

363
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,439
MS. JIN

364
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,030
Ha-yul.

365
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,451
It can't be here. It's not here.

366
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,497
No, that's not it. It's impossible.

367
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,208
It's not possible, nope, no.
His shoes can't be here.

368
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,587
Min-ho's shoes can't be here.
This is unreal! No way! No, no.

369
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,714
Impossible. How could they be here?

370
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,424
Couldn't possibly be here.

371
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,469
It's not any of these.
They're not his shoes.

372
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,137
-There's no way.
-Ms. Yeo.

373
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,182
Ma'am.

374
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,601
It's, uh,

375
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,478
Min-ho's.

376
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,363
Oh, my son!

377
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,242
Auntie.

378
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:18,743
Auntie.

379
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:20,870
Please get up.

380
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:22,664
Ms. Yeo.

381
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:24,916
Ms. Yeo.

382
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,918
The majority of
the identified victims

383
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,170
were Cheondong Middle School students

384
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,923
who went missing
during the asteroid crisis.

385
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:36,261
The group of kidnappers were the prisoners
who broke out from Woongcheon Prison.

386
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,388
We suspect that they kidnapped children

387
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:42,267
and confined them in a container
with the intention of human trafficking.

388
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,768
The Woongcheon City Government

389
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:47,772
will stand with the victims' families
in these times of pain and sorrow,

390
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:52,319
and we promise that we will do our utmost
to remediate the situation.

391
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:56,531
We will do our best to make sure
that this tragedy will never be repeated.

392
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:26,061
201 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

393
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:44,496
Mr. Jeong Su-geun.

394
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,831
US-bound, correct?

395
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,584
Everything here looks good.

396
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,711
There you are.

397
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:52,629
Thank you.

398
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,798
-Next, please.
-Okay, come on.

399
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:57,342
Come on! Hurry it up! Let's go!

400
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,135
TRAVEL DENIED

401
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,512
Excuse me, sir?

402
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,721
One moment, if you please?

403
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:02,972
-Yeah?
-Can you come back here?

404
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,182
Dad, come back.

405
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,395
Hello.
He's rejected from the embassy.

406
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,313
Uh, is there a problem or something?

407
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,735
What's this?
Do we have some sort of issue?

408
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,404
There has to be a mistake here.

409
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,739
We booked through
an investment migration group.

410
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,659
I even donated to the affiliated
youth program there to secure our entry.

411
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,160
Please take him away.

412
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,454
-This way, sir.
-This is absurd!

413
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,123
Please check it one more time for me.

414
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,750
Discuss it with them.
That way, please.

415
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,586
Seriously?

416
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:36,047
Next, please.

417
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,593
Please come in order. In order!

418
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,761
I mean, please, sir.

419
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,764
At least have the decency
to tell me what you're checking on though?

420
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,518
You took our phones
and our passports already.

421
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,562
We should just stand here and wait now?

422
00:28:51,104 --> 00:28:53,273
I have anxiety, you know what I'm saying?

423
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,025
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please.

424
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,612
We apologize for any delay
you may have incurred.

425
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,782
Please be assured
we are doing everything we can

426
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,869
to move people through the line
as quickly as possible.

427
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,290
Something really wrong must've happened.

428
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,252
Are you seriously that surprised at it?

429
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,712
Don't be mean to your father.

430
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:18,214
I'm not being mean
if he's really stupid though.

431
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,718
Hey, isn't that guy Jeong Su-geun?

432
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,845
-Where? Oh yeah.
-He is.

433
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,555
-That's Jeong Su-geun.
-It's him.

434
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,185
Why is life so fragile?

435
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,730
The ones who deserve to die
run around like they own the place.

436
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,356
Dear Woongcheon citizens…

437
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,525
I told you we don't have
any bread coming in.

438
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:41,863
If you need help,
dial 222 for emergency rescue.

439
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:45,283
-Butterfish?
-Ten right here. They look great.

440
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,453
We're charging two ration tickets
for one butterfish.

441
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,414
That's expensive.
How many are there?

442
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,791
We have ten.

443
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,920
Seasonal fish is hard
to come by these days, isn't it?

444
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,296
Yeah, they are.

445
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:00,632
Ji-eun? Not here today?

446
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,801
She left to go see that guy this morning.

447
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:04,385
-They're still together? Morning.
-Mmm.

448
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,138
Together till the end!

449
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,015
See you later at Moira!

450
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,350
Together till the end.

451
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,853
Oh, hey, Father.

452
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,897
Did you run out of food again?

453
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,149
Tell me what we can do for ya?

454
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,487
Ah, so she, uh…

455
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,073
We had planned on going to church again

456
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,952
until a baby cat about his size here
came in and took these great vegetables

457
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:29,994
and made them, uh…

458
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:31,579
Really, a baby cat?

459
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,123
You keep lying like that,
and you'll be going to hell.

460
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,545
Oh, just so you know,

461
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,880
our door is open to you.

462
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,591
You can stop by anytime to pray.

463
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:47,178
The Lord is always here for you,
so don't be a stranger.

464
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,014
Day or night, anytime you need,

465
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,434
we are all by your side
to help however we can.

466
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:57,105
Hey, now. Bark. Scare him off!

467
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,069
All right. Goodbye.

468
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:10,827
You take care of yourself now.

469
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:12,829
See you around, okay?

470
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,956
I'll bring her with me next time.

471
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,550
Sorry there. I asked for too much.

472
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,345
Come on now.
The warehouse boss insisted on it.

473
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,972
So no apologies necessary.

474
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,099
That was nice.

475
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,894
Probably already know.

476
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,146
Only immigrants who bring
a lot of Korean goods with them

477
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,231
are accepted into safety zone countries.

478
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,526
I mean medical supplies,
equipment, cosmetics,

479
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,612
and even things like snacks,
ramyun, and gum.

480
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,571
IM LOGISTICS CENTER

481
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,615
The elite are taking
all of our resources with them

482
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,617
and leaving very little for people here.

483
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,579
Production and distribution lines
are still running now, but…

484
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,080
-Oh, Mr. Moon.
-Yes?

485
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,832
The crates need to go
on the military truck.

486
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,125
Okay. This way.

487
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,298
-Wow, this one's for me?
-Yeah, yeah. Of course, have some.

488
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,259
How is it?

489
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,637
Whoa, it's really good!

490
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:14,432
I bet it's been tough
feeding your unit three times a day.

491
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:16,809
We never seem to have enough.

492
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:20,146
We might have to give out
the rations reserved for combat next.

493
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,650
Don't be too stubborn about this.

494
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,486
Applications for discharge
need to be encouraged.

495
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,572
They'll be just fine. The ration system
should be expanding soon.

496
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:32,283
You know, half of the people who leave
end up in gangs.

497
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,788
Those people find trouble
anywhere they choose to go.

498
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,832
Some things are just out of our hands.

499
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:43,795
Besides, we're at the end,
so there's no point really, you know.

500
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,922
My time is up anyway, so I've made peace.

501
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,385
I'm so sorry for that, sir.

502
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,470
They shouldn't have let you go
because of my mistake.

503
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,514
It's truly quite all right, In-a.

504
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:58,351
The factory will be
running out of supplies any day now,

505
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,603
so I should start
getting my supplies in order.

506
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:03,606
Maybe bum around a bit,
live off the rations.

507
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,485
Hey, Colonel Choi!
Can you give me a hand over here?

508
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:08,861
Yeah, I got you!

509
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,282
You be good now.
I'll see you when I see ya.

510
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,209
I'm coming!

511
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,628
THE CITY OF THE FUTURE

512
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,507
Are you going to apply
for a discharge, Private?

513
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,802
Even if I left,
I have nowhere to go.

514
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:36,264
Starting next week, you can apply
for a discharge, regardless of rank.

515
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:44,147
Bring them over as soon as they're
cooked. They get four pieces each.

516
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,069
Wow, look at all of them
lining up for Spam.

517
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:53,031
Listen up! The side dish today is Spam!

518
00:33:57,452 --> 00:34:00,496
Make sure it goes around for everybody.
I don't wanna get shot.

519
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,917
Ugh! No matter what, we need to make sure
everyone's full here, huh?

520
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,627
I mean, the vegetables are good.

521
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,421
Animal meat had better be there, though,

522
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:11,090
or they get a little cranky
if you know what I mean.

523
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:14,343
Kim Hyeon-sik. Hey, come on. Take it. Now.

524
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,220
You're all so stingy here.

-This one?
-This one's a reality show. One ticket.

533
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,745
I'll take these. Three tickets.
Keep up the good work.

534
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:42,163
Thanks. Take care.

535
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,873
You Quiz on the Block
highlights are on it.

536
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:44,916
-Yeah?
-Oh yeah.

537
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,459
-I can trust you?
-Yeah, yeah.

538
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,418
Okay.

539
00:34:50,963 --> 00:34:51,881
Ten bucks here!

540
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,716
Ten bucks? Oh wow!

541
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,553
Oh, it's Ms. Jin.

542
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:00,848
You're all at home, right?
Together till the end. Good night.

543
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,851
Everyone!
Don't let yourself be swayed!

544
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,021
Thrust those dark temptations away!

545
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,274
Be sure to share the truth
with anyone that's not on board!

546
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,819
Only our eternal life matters!

547
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,238

00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,241
WITH KNOWLEDGE COMES ETERNAL LIFE

549
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:21,119
You can live in an eternal world
where death doesn't exist!

550
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,871
Where asteroids are
nothing to be worried about.

551
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,916
They've inflated the economy
through wars so far,

552
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,960
and now that it's reached its limit,

553
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:33,840
they're trying to rain down
nuclear bombs on us from space!

554
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,174
Can you believe that?

555
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,136
Don't be fooled, everyone!

556
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,139
-We aren't beholden to anybody.
-Stop lookin' there.

557
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,515
-Why?
-Do you hear that?

558
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,058
It looks pretty fun.

559
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,227
What do you know about fun, huh?

560
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,939
You don't have to rub it in.
We can't all be kids of fun dads.

561
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:52,150
I ask you
to make this important choice!

562
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,360
The best fathers
are the ones that don't exist.

563
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,154
Don't be swayed!

564
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,906
It's out there for you.

565
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:01,659
-Imagine it.
-Hold on!

566
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,387
What am I talking about?

567
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,182
Don't you know that
science is bigger than life!

568
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:27,351
It's impressive, you know,
that you got all of these.

569
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,853
It's just you two today?

570
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,063
Where's your friend?

571
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,358
-I put some old ones in there. No charge.
-You're only selling that?

572
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,319
Got any Japanese or American porn?

573
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,904
Homemade too?

574
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,614
We don't have any of that smut.

575
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,533
Ah, I bet not. You're minors.

576
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,912
But if you do happen
to get some good stuff, let me know.

577
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,580
I'll make sure you get paid right.

578
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,624
Hold on.
We don't take Korean bills at all.

579
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,626
Only US dollars or ration tickets.

580
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,961
-Ah, so demanding.
-Oh! Oh! Oh!

581
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,630
The CO is here. It's Captain Kang.

582
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,007
Hurry, hurry! Let's go! Come on!

583
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,355
KIDS ARE NEAR THE SHELTER
KEEP AN EYE ON THEM

584
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,731
Shift change now.

585
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,025
Shift change!

586
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,318
Magazine out.

587
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,653
Magazine out.

588
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,573
Ammunition removed.

589
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,785
-Hand over magazine.
-Handing over magazine.

590
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:30,706
Ammunition, clear!
Empty magazine, clear too.

591
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,542
-Insert magazine.
-Insert magazine!

592
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,925
Park Jin-seo! Yoo So-min!

593
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,344
You get my text, huh?

594
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,179
Get home now, okay?

595
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,431
Come on. Hurry up.

596
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:52,937
-Unni.
-Yeah?

597
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,855
Can you tell them not to leave town?

598
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,901
Okay. Yeah.
I'll be sure to give them a warning.

599
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,237
These kids are just bored, you know.

600
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,323
They don't go to school
because of that asteroid.

601
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:06,867
Hey, you guys.

602
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,745
You both need to listen to her.

603
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:13,708
No wandering off, especially at night.
You understand?

604
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,167
-Okay.
-Yeah, okay.

605
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,670
How's business?

606
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:18,587
SEONJIN STAFFING INC.

607
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,797
Fine, I guess.

608
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,842
'Cause it's the only way
people can watch anything.

609
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:27,680
It doesn't make any sense.
Why is everything still out of service?

610
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,515
It's only in Korea too.

611
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,267
I think other countries
still have Internet,

612
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,476
but they shut it down here.

613
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,564
Yeah, I know.
I just don't get what the point is.

614
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:38,399
You don't have to get it.

615
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,110
I wish
I saved some stuff from YouTube too.

616
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:43,029
Right?

617
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,613
I never thought of downloading videos

618
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,949
'cause I could watch anything
when I opened up the app.

619
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:47,950
He was so gross.

620
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:49,201
What? Who's that?

621
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:53,164
This big piece of human trash.
He had a filthy mouth.

622
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,500
He told me to make home movies.

623
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,878
We always do our best
to delete that stuff.

624
00:38:58,961 --> 00:38:59,837
Well, yeah.

625
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:03,007
-Ha-yul thinks we should have a gun.
-What?

626
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,052
That's dangerous!
No way can you have a gun.

627
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,721
Are you trying to get yourself killed?
Don't even think about it!

628
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,389
Okay. I get it.

629
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,933
Oh, let's go to Ha-yul's, okay?

630
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,353
-Hmm?
-She gave me her bicycle.

631
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,605
You know,
since mine's always breaking down.

632
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:19,607
Mmm.

633
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:23,444
That was really nice of her to do.
I don't know if you should take it though.

634
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,988
This is the Martial Law Command.

635
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,324
The curfew will be in place in one hour.

636
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:32,411
It is now August 5th, 2025,
at ten o'clock p.m.

637
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,918
Seriously, Ha-yul,
what's wrong with you?

638
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:41,128
How come
the lights are still on?

639
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,131
-What's going on?
-Did someone break in?

640
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,300
Maybe they forgot to turn them off
when they left.

641
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,259
What?

642
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,886
-That makes zero sense!
-Wait.

643
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:49,804
Huh?

644
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,430
I guess
they weren't able to leave.

645
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,932
It's Ha-yul's parents.

646
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:55,142
Didn't you say
you saw her off at the airport?

647
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,478
-Get off! Don't touch--
-Don't take my stuff!

648
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,396
Ha-yul!

649
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,564
-They look like they're fighting!
-Give it!

650
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,817
-Mom, let's go that way.
-They're coming outside.

651
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,360
Ha-yul, don't be like this.

652
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,489
-Ha-yul!
-You get back here!

653
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,326
-Is something going on with Ha-yul?
-Get back inside!

654
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,745
Why are you being difficult?
Where are you going?

655
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,832
I told you I'm staying with a friend!
I'm sick of everything here!

656
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,835
What friend? What kind of friends
would a little brat like you have?

657
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,795
Why?
'Cause your friends all suck?

658
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,214
Not everyone's like you.
My friends aren't trashy frauds.

659
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,633
-How dare you!
-So shut up already and let me leave!

660
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:29,844
-Ha-yul, how could you say that!
-Why that little…

661
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,429
-Oh.
-Listen.

662
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,972
Here!

663
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,307
Ha-yul!

664
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,810
Are you okay? Here, let me--

665
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,103
Don't touch me!

666
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,355
Oh, uh…

667
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:45,401
Wait, uh, you all knew
we couldn't fly out earlier?

668
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,903
Oh no. I just came
to, uh, to get the bike.

669
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,905
Uh… uh, we were just stopping by.

670
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,366
Well, we ran into some issues, so…

671
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,410
It's, uh, pretty late.
Let's go inside, sweetheart.

672
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,328
-You can play tomorrow.
-Just give me my phone.

673
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,455
Come on. Now, wait!

674
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,873
-Ha-yul!
-Don't you dare!

675
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,127
Stay here and fight!
I'm leaving this house!

676
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,170
You two make me sick!

677
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,881
Ms. Oh, you should separate me
from my violent dad.

678
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,674
You saw. He threw a dress shoe at my head.

679
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:11,844
Uh, you saw that? They were really light.

680
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,554
Just sneakers.

681
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:16,891
Uh…

682
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:17,975
Well, I, um…

683
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:22,521
Excuse us, then.
We didn't mean to interrupt anything.

684
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:23,439
Sorry.

685
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:26,609
-Oh, uh, no, not at all.
-It's, uh, um… Not at all. Yeah.

686
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,446
Hey! Let's go!

687
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,491
I'm so tired. It's grueling.

688
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:34,617
Ha-yul!

689
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,205
We've tried everything.
We just can't get her to behave.

690
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,874
It's our fault for spoiling her.

691
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:42,917
Hi again.

692
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,877
It's really good to see ya.

693
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:48,214
You know, she's not, uh,
not actually a horrible kid.

694
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,633
Isn't that right, babe?

695
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,847
Yeah, well…Uh…

696
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,767
Since you're all back here now, uh,

697
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,061
you don't care if she sleeps over, do you?

698
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,020
At our home?

699
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:06,440
Then… I'll send her back in the morning.

700
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:10,653
So please don't worry.
And I'll get out of here, I suppose, okay?

701
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,697
She'll be all right there, okay?

702
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,824
How did things get like this?

703
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:23,123
I'll separate you again in the morning,
too, if he's gonna hurt you.

704
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,837
Say goodbye to Daddy?

705
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,465
Ready.

706
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,176
Good evening.

707
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,100
Please inspect
the soldiers' belongings tonight.

708
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:47,231
A little harsh, don't you think?

709
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,858
They're working really hard.
Let's be more understanding.

710
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,612
They're stuck here
until the asteroid comes to kill them all.

711
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,741
We should do a good job of feeding them
before snooping around the barracks.

712
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,452
I'm sure it's still better
than being caught by the police.

713
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,706
-Anyone on the lookout?
-Yes, I'm watching.

714
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,043
Wow, it's I Live Alone!
How did you get that?

715
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:10,045
We'll start bidding
at three ration tickets.

716
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,381
-Three tickets!
-One, two, three.

717
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,761
Evening, ma'am!

718
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,638
Good evening.
All clear on duty.

719
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:21,640
Only say "all clear"
when there's nothing wrong.

720
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,684
We'll be searching your belongings now!

721
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:25,728
It smells terrible in here.

722
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:28,689
This used to be a kids' classroom.
Have some respect.

723
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:31,025
-What is this? Pick it up.
-Yes.

724
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:34,153
You all need to shower more,
just so you know.

725
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,822
Even if it's the end of the world,
still shower.

726
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,699
For God's sake,
keep your pride as a soldier.

727
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,743
We'll be taking any and all contraband.

728
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,745
Personal items are not allowed.

729
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,752
-Staff Sergeant.
-Sir.

730
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,254
-Go look around.
-Yes, sir.

731
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,006
Kim Hyeon-sik. Bring it here.

732
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,174
Uh…

733
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,343
I already saw it.

734
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,678
Uh, it's just an innocent thing.
Not a problem.

735
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:02,598
Martial Law, Section Four,
Clause Three and Four, a clear violation.

736
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:05,851
Engaging in illegal trade
with civilians is not allowed.

737
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,439
Do I make myself clear?

738
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:11,940
Yes, ma'am.

739
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,192
Yes, ma'am! Loud and clear!

740
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,989
Hae-chan, Woo-chan, time for bed.

741
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,033
Okay. Even the Visa was fake.

742
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:23,994
The broker ran off
when he knew we'd been caught.

743
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,789
-Draw a dinosaur too.
-Yeah.

744
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,874
-Draw lots of them.
-What's that?

745
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:31,418
-All right. Have a good one.
-Want some water?

746
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,962
-Noona, look at this.
-Okay, bye.

747
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,297
It's so good!

748
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,257
-Ms. Oh.
-Huh?

749
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,259
-What's this here?
-What?

750
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:42,096
-Oh, that's pickled radish there.
-It's just so good.

751
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:43,722
-You like?
-Yeah.

752
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,391
-Go eat some more, okay?
-Thanks.

753
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:48,310
Cookie! Cookie! Cookie!

754
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,645
I want one too.

755
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:55,150
Who let you in here at night?
There are rules, you know?

756
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:58,779
I just told them I'm a teacher here.
They let me right in.

757
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,115
Okay. What's going on?

758
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:03,909
Hmm?

759
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,710
Ms. Jin.

760
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:17,631
Someone moved into the house
next door to me a while ago.

761
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:25,139
They have fancy cars parked outside,
and it's often noisy with loud music.

762
00:45:33,939 --> 00:45:35,858
I'd recognize his face anywhere.

763
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:42,030
It was the man
who got my classmates killed.

764
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,494
You know how it is.

765
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:50,247
There's no use in reporting
it to the Joint Investigation Unit.

766
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,966
So they came back
after they weren't able to leave Korea?

767
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:03,135
Mmm. She's staying with a friend.

768
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,305
She said her parents were fighting,
so she went there.

769
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:09,224
But she's probably
also trying to avoid him.

770
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,270
You gotta keep an eye on the kids.

771
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:19,109
Is that it?

772
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,446
How is that going to fix anything though?

773
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,283
-How can you just stand by?
-What do you want from me?

774
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,911
You know there's little I can do.

775
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:32,581
It's not fair that these things happened.
They're just kids.

776
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,000
You're heartbroken, I know.

777
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,879
She's practically begging us to help.

778
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,882
At this point,
it's too late for us to do anything.

779
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:47,095
Se-kyung, my unit has no power at all.

780
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,974
The firearms the soldiers are carrying
on guard duty?

781
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:53,393
Most don't even have bullets.

782
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,562
Does that surprise you?

783
00:46:57,022 --> 00:47:00,484
Each gun should be loaded with one blank
and at least ten live rounds,

784
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,027
but our supplies are very low.

785
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,449
Especially so
since the ammunition theft incident.

786
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,745
I knew
we had issues with that case,

787
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,580
but I couldn't do anything alone.

788
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,666
What do you mean, In-A?

789
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,296
Well, uh…

790
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,632
299 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

791
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,717
Special Missions Unit, all withdraw!

792
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,011
The rebel leaders are running away.
We need to stop them.

793
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,597
I repeat. SMU, we need to retreat.

794
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,933
I can't follow an order
that lets the rebels escape.

795
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:33,851
You're kidding.

796
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,186
We're shooting warning shots first.
Open fire.

797
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:50,659
Cease fire! The penalty for
insubordination during wartime is death!

798
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,870
Captain Kang In-a! Captain Kang!

799
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,163
In-a!

800
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:01,003
The commander was discharged after that.

801
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:06,258
He said it was him who ordered the fire
and took the rap for it all.

802
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,845
So I wasn't charged 'cause of him.

803
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:14,641
And all that they gave me was
a slap on the wrist that day.

804
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:20,063
They did transfer me
out of the Special Missions Unit though.

805
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:24,401
They treat me
like an outcast here.

806
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,698
I'm the highest ranked here
in the hometown unit, so it makes sense.

807
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,701
It's not fun…

808
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,914
but I'll accept it, I guess.

809
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:41,710
I guess you should.

810
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:43,837
Yeah.

811
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,515
Even so…

812
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:56,934
What?

813
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:01,063
What do we do with those guys, huh?
Let 'em go?

814
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:06,735
These kids, they're 14
and have 200 days to live.

815
00:49:06,818 --> 00:49:08,278
It's cruel, you know?

816
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,864
To live out
the rest of their days in pain.

817
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,867
Those bastards slaughtered my students.
I witnessed it.

818
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,536
Just hope they shoot each other
in the back, yeah?

819
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,254
The kids, they all need you.

820
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,590
Be careful too.

821
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,134
I'll see ya.

822
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,353
Oh.

823
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,231
Thanks so much for the advice, then.

824
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,275
So helpful.

825
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,340
SO-MIN: MS. JIN, YOU'RE HOME, RIGHT?

826
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:53,902
-Unni.
-Oh!

827
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:56,738
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, you scared me.

828
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,198
Are you, um…

829
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,701
What are you--

830
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,954
Why aren't you going inside?
Did you two fight?

831
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,080
Uh,

832
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,208
just happened to see
that Yun-sang's lights are on.

833
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:12,963
If Yun-sang had come back,
we would've known.

834
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,799
She must really miss him.

835
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,682
If you see her tomorrow,
please ask her to give me a call.

836
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,143
Wait.

837
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,562
-Are you actually in a fight?
-I guess so.

838
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:30,438
I'll see you later.

839
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:39,229
This is the Martial Law Command.

840
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:41,189
The curfew has been lifted.

841
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:46,569
The current date and time
is August 6th, 2025, at 5:00 a.m.

842
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:49,072
Dial 999 to report crimes

843
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,783
and 333 to report safety issues.

844
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,993
If you have a telephone inquiry,

845
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:56,621
please dial zero and speak to an operator.

846
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,706
Please have a safe day.

847
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:17,350
The believers think
that Father Baek passed away.

848
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,270
We have to check inside this room.

849
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:23,898
Today, we celebrate
the Feast of the Transfiguration.

850
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,609
All right, I have to go.

851
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:29,946
…bringing flowers and any offerings
you may have to the altar.

852
00:57:30,447 --> 00:57:31,948
Please take out your hymnal,

853
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:37,245
where you will see we will be singing
from pages 65 and 121.

854
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,122
Ah!

855
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,677
Oh my. Look at that.
Better fix that later.

856
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,804
All these things.

857
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,994
Let us tell the earnest prayers
we have prepared

858
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:20,079
to God, the Father Almighty.

859
00:58:20,663 --> 00:58:24,209
Give us this day our daily bread.

860
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:28,379
And forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those

861
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:31,049
who trespass against us.

862
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:34,052
And lead us not into temptation,

863
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:36,221
but deliver us from evil.

864
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:57,700
You're five minutes late
today, Se-kyung! Always so slow!

865
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,787
Wow, she's not looking too good.

866
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:02,622
Pass, pass, come on!

867
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:05,375
Doing that too much is bad for you!
Take a break! Come on!

868
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:08,419
Stop for a while!
You need to stop, or you'll be in pain!

869
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,922
Go! Go, go, go! Go!

870
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:20,723
Ah!

871
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,445
Thank you. I'm okay.

872
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,698
I don't wanna hear it.
You need to eat, okay?

873
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:39,450
Eat up. We need to support each other.

874
00:59:40,702 --> 00:59:41,869
Till the end.

875
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,665
Mmm. You're really great.
