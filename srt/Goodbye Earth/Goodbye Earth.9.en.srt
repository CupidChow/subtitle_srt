00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,633
Be your own superman

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:10,385
and work hard so--

3
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:12,971
Min-ho, make sure to remember
this is all thanks to me.

4
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:14,973
-Thanks.
-Hey!

5
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,934
-You can do anything you want.
-I put this picture up…

6
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:21,646
Min-ho, did you tell Yun-sang
that you're gonna be a scientist like him?

7
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,857
Uh, no. His fan club only.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,358
-A toast!
-Cheers.

9
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,694
Beer always tastes best
after soccer practice.

10
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,279
-Well said.
-Yeah.

11
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,781
-Hello.
-Oh! Hello, Father.

12
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,783
-How was mass?
-Did you get your revenge?

13
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,410
What do you think?

14
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,536
-Father Woo.
-Yep?

15
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:37,579
You want a drink?

16
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,456
Let me tell you.
This one can hold his liquor.

17
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:42,208
You probably got that from your grandad.

18
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,086
Maybe so. He gets everything else
from you, though, Father.

19
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,796
Ah, you're always so kind to me.

20
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,007
-Oh, Clara?
-Uh, yeah?

21
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,550
How's your soccer team coming along?

22
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,178
Ah, really great! It's a good team!

23
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,262
Yeah.

24
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:57,724
She spends all her time there,
even though it's not a professional team.

25
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:01,227
-What's the point?
-You know I like passing out at night.

26
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,146
-Exercise is good for you, and it's fun.
-Right.

27
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,357
You pass out and never hang out.
A man gets lonely!

28
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:09,319
Come on, Yun-sang.
We're always together at night.

29
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,113
-What?
-Don't need that information, Se-kyung.

30
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:15,116
-Whoa! Keep those stories to yourself.
-There's a child here!

31
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,994
How dare you!
That's not what I said at all.

32
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,371
I didn't mean that!

33
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,874
About your wedding…
It's gotta be coming up.

34
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:23,875
I'll be officiating.

35
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,127
Please do!
Thank you in advance.

36
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,546
-Hello, Father.
-Oh, hello.

37
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,131
-Thank you.
-Hi.

38
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,051
Hey, come back, Father!

39
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,847
Yeah, a disgusting turn.

40
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,725
-What was that, honey?
-All right, come on now.

Um, why are we meeting here?

56
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,515
I apologize.
It's 'cause my phone has no reception.

57
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,018
It wasn't the plan
for you to come all the way here.

58
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,106
Come look at this.

59
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,734
Ah. Yeah, that's him.

60
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,111
Th… that's my dad's driver right there.

61
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:21,534
Do you recognize this address?

62
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,124
Oh! Out of the five addresses,
I know this one.

63
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:32,212
It… it's the last place my dad's driver
w… w… went to drop something off.

64
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,088
You have to tell the captain
everything you know.

65
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,298
Okay. I'll do it.

66
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,971
Yeah, I hear you. Go ahead.

67
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,556
I can talk right now.

68
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,766
Yun-sang's driving.

69
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,644
Yeah. Can you hear me?

70
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,895
-Yeah--
-Hello?

71
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,942
This is driving me crazy.

72
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,028
Hey, Captain, are you all right?

73
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:03,243
18-1, GUGAK-RI, EUNGDEOK-MYEON
WOONGCHEON, GYEONGGI-DO

74
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,538
Did you get it?

75
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,457
Oh! Whoa! Whoa!

76
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,417
Oh, a deer.

77
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,585
Thank God.

78
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,087
Oh!

79
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,714
You got my text, right?
We're on our way there.

80
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,882
Hello?

81
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:19,133
You there?

82
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,177
In-a?

83
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,098
Officially, you're on
civilian protection duty.

84
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,849
The shortest route is an hour.

85
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,060
-Report to me in ten.
-Copy that.

86
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,520
Hyeon-jae.

87
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:31,938
Yes.

88
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,649
I'm worried. Are you sure you'll be okay?

89
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,150
I'm okay. Don't worry about us.

90
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:39,237
-I'll be heading out, then.
-Okay.

91
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,056
-Where are you going?
-Eungdeok-myeon, Gugak-ri.

92
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:10,018
You have to go back.
Please turn around.

93
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,732
Who are you looking for?

94
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,069
Answer the question.

95
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,074
Baek. We're here to see Father Baek.

96
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,162
Father Baek has visitors.

97
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,706
Okay.

98
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,334
Let 'em through!

99
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,920
Hello, Father.

100
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,425
You seem to have some concerning guests.

101
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:20,797
Oh!

102
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,757
Se-kyung.

103
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,258
Yun-sang.

104
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,222
A little tough to find this place, huh?

105
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,225
Goodness, you came all this way

106
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,394
just to speak with me.

107
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,314
Right, Clara?

108
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,566
And Thomas.

109
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,529
So happy you're here. Mmm.

110
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,282
We sure have a lot to talk about,
don't we?

111
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:49,951
Ah.

112
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,744
Oh, wait.

113
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,455
Let's start off with confessional.

114
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,667
Don't the two of you have
your wedding coming up?

115
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,837
Ah, no, no, no, no.

116
00:07:02,338 --> 00:07:04,799
Confessional is one on one.

117
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:09,220
You must stand alone right before God
and really confront yourself.

118
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:10,388
That's not--

119
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,515
You know, with confessions,

120
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,851
when it hasn't been done in a while,

121
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,479
it becomes quite difficult.

122
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:41,961
I know.

123
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,506
I know my actions will lead me to hell.

124
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,799
I'm a murderer,

125
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,427
and it's happened three times now.

126
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,304
Sh! Hey.

127
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:53,806
Clara.

128
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,392
Now, what did I always say?

129
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:01,147
If you don't complete your homework
on time, it'll eventually catch up to you.

130
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,857
And the next thing you know,

131
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,525
you're overwhelmed with sin.

132
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,613
It's as if you have scabs
all over your body.

133
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,129
But even with sin,

134
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,007
God will always forgive you.

135
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,550
Every time.

136
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,721
God's forgiveness is endless and kind.

137
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,848
He never tires.

138
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,184
Instead, he always waits patiently.

139
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,106
Yeah, I understand that,

140
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,234
but I have no desire to repent.

141
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:51,531
Well, all right.

142
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,617
I will pray for you

143
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,370
to absolve you of sin.

144
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:02,291
Clara, you still must reflect, repent,

145
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,919
and find the resolve to not sin again.

146
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,547
God will wait for you

147
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,007
with love and patience.

148
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:19,600
Well then, what about you?

149
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,315
God is speaking to me.

150
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,694
You two have a purpose.

151
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:34,365
You may not think it so,
but God always knows.

152
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,911
It can indeed be difficult
to discern God's true intentions.

153
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,998
But the fact that we're here together

154
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,250
must mean something, wouldn't you agree?

155
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,378
On the way in,

156
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,380
I'd hoped that you weren't in here

157
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,966
'cause I had to believe it wasn't true.

158
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:52,967
That you'd--

159
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,721
I'm not sure what you have planned, but…

160
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,725
stop hiding out here, Father.

161
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:05,062
You have to explain to everyone
why you abandoned the church so suddenly.

162
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,034
Yun-sang.

163
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,580
Widen your horizons, child.

164
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,543
The outcome you seek…

165
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,840
…is reductive in nature and lacks wisdom.

166
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,845
Please.

167
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,433
It's not just us. So many people
have been hurt by your actions.

168
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,730
The end is near now.
They deserve closure, don't you think?

169
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,444
I know a four-year-old
who's envious of his older sister

170
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,322
'cause she's seven,
and he'll never get to be.

171
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,074
Have some empathy.

172
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,910
Don't your believers
deserve some compassion?

173
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,329
All of us.
We all trusted you to protect us.

174
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,297
Let's stick to the original plan.
Mm-hmm.

175
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,679
I'll prepare a plan B as well.

176
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,225
Yep, yep.

177
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,615
The best servants of God,

178
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,119
they are the ones who will go.

179
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,664
There is not much time to waste.

180
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,793
I trust you, Yun-sang.

181
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,088
I know you will make the wise choice.

182
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,800
On the day we leave…

183
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,972
an hour in advance, be ready.

184
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,515
I will rescue you.

185
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,532
Oh.

186
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,244
You went outside?
Can't remember the last time you were out.

187
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,914
You know, I was visiting my good friend.

188
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,916
Ah good. Yeah.

189
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,794
You ought to.
Getting some fresh air is nice.

190
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:36,505
-Isn't it better than your bedroom?
-Mmm.

191
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,434
G… G… Grandma? I was…

192
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,269
Huh?

193
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,605
I, uh…

194
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,939
Please don't leave me.

195
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,232
Huh?

196
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,361
Oh, now, what would make you say that?

197
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,655
Uh, my dad's, uh…

198
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,325
Well… well, his driver told me, uh,

199
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,121
you and I have to
move to Dad's official residence.

200
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,790
Don't mind him, In-tae.

201
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,295
The nerve. Spewing nonsense like that.

202
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,925
I would never abandon my grandson.

203
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,510
Though I would leave your dad.

204
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,889
-Don't worry too much now.
-Okay.

205
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,724
-Go get some rest.
-Mmm.

206
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,614
I had wished to provide you an escort,

207
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,200
but it seems that won't be necessary.

208
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,952
Oh.

209
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:54,375
A soldier will be driving you guys back.
Captain's orders.

210
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,170
Everyone on board!

211
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:00,047
Good luck, both of you.

212
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,799
And please,

213
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,885
I pray your choice will be wise.

214
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,152
Come on, Father!

215
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:26,699
Just open the door!

216
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:33,038
-Father!
-Give me something.

217
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,048
Just one word. Please, I'm begging you.

218
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,681
Just enough for me to carry on.

219
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,000
152 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

220
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,710
-Hey.
-Found a CD.

221
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,545
I found this.

222
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,839
Ooh! We can put videos in that.

223
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,341
-Mmm.
-Good find.

224
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,970
I heard that Netflix
won't be coming out with any new content,

225
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,138
not even in the US.

226
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,390
Yeah. Why would they these days?

227
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,976
There's no point
in making movies right now.

228
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,145
Yeah, I don't think
we'll get another season.

229
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,982
There's still a lot of weird directors
that wanna film their stuff,

230
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,026
but they don't have
any actors willing to work.

231
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,820
That makes sense to me.
Why act when the world is ending?

232
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,530
Yeah, I wouldn't act either.

233
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,324
Why else would they keep working?

234
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,034
For more money, obviously.

235
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,579
Wait, what?

236
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,917
Why are there so many people here?

237
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,961
I don't know.

238
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,172
-These guys have different uniforms too.
-Let's go to Ms. Jin.

239
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,548
-Yeah. Let's go. This way.
-Okay.

240
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,300
-You there!
-Hurry.

241
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,552
-Off the platform!
-Hurry up!

242
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,362
So the center's planning with the US.

243
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,577
-Are you--
-Are you gonna be--

244
00:16:38,038 --> 00:16:38,872
Go ahead.

245
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,165
The training center.

246
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,210
With what went on,
I heard a rumor around the base

247
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,628
that you'd be dismissed.

248
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,176
Don't worry about me.

249
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,429
So Young-ji…

250
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,598
-Have you seen her since that day?
-Huh?

251
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,642
Nope. I haven't seen her a single time.

252
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,855
-It didn't seem like she had a cell phone.
-I guess so. It's okay, ma'am.

253
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,073
This airfield is packed
with division-level security right now.

254
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,408
If my instincts are correct,

255
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,618
they're definitely
planning something here.

256
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,663
I think they're trying to get
the remaining citizens home.

257
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,373
There's still a lot of Americans in Korea.

258
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,250
You're kidding me.

259
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,918
Hold on a minute.

260
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,628
The airstrip, right?

261
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,631
The US military base.

262
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,425
It has to be that!

263
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,594
Right. That makes sense.

264
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,096
I guess Sister Regina was right about it.

265
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,557
They're really moving up everything.

266
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,934
Uh, excuse me.

267
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,937
Se-kyung, can I speak to you?

268
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,439
Uh, oh.

269
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:46,857
Okay.

270
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,280
So, Father,
what are you planning to do now?

271
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,741
We have to do something,

272
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,452
and it's gotta be more
than prayers this time around.

273
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,995
Yun-sang.

274
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,372
Did Father Baek say anything else
to you during your visit?

275
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,666
He knows about the fire
at the church, right?

276
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,132
Here.

277
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,343
It's been a while.

278
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,348
When are you and Yun-sang leaving?

279
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,895
Se-kyung.

280
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:26,814
Mmm. What's up?

281
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,650
I wanted to ask.

282
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,278
Did In-a ever say anything to you

283
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,156
about In-seong?

284
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,324
You can tell me.

285
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,159
In-seong oppa?

286
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,247
Did she ever tell you

287
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,083
how In-seong died?

288
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,335
It was an accident, right? At the riot?

289
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,419
Mm-mm.

290
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,590
I guess I'll tell you, then.

291
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:58,554
After the riot,
most of the food was all gone.

292
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:02,516
In-a just disappeared.
She had to leave with her unit.

293
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:08,230
We couldn't reach her,
and In-seong was impatient.

294
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,733
He left to look for food one day.

295
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,820
He drove around everywhere.

296
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,949
He was downtown.

297
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,876
Those beasts, they murdered him.

298
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,961
He never had a chance.

299
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,338
My poor boy.

300
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,215
Killed just like that.

301
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,972
Murdered in daylight.

302
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,143
They got him in the red-light district
right near that brothel.

303
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,234
A parishioner
who'd done business there told me

304
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,530
she saw a tall, thin person there
behind In-seong.

305
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,783
And then, he…

306
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,834
So I told In-a.

307
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:12,669
And she

308
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,755
just said that

309
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,007
it could've been anyone.

310
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,135
A lot of people are tall and thin,
and that I shouldn't think about it.

311
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,304
That I should just carry on with my life

312
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,973
'cause there wasn't much that I could do.

313
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,352
So, sure, I thought.

314
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,979
There's not much time left anyway.

315
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,397
The clock's ticking.

316
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,859
So I told myself not to think about it,

317
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,820
but then these guys
just kept dying one after the other.

318
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,823
I felt like someone was trying
to get revenge for In-seong.

319
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,158
Justice, if you will.

320
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,577
I thought that…

321
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,930
In-a could never just let anything go.

322
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,223
Always so stubborn.

323
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,898
Your daughter's a hero.

324
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,526
In-a

325
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,112
would do anything to keep us safe.

326
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,071
Anything.

327
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,827
Yeah.

328
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:29,955
Do you think it's In-a?

329
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:30,998
Yeah.

330
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:38,714
What a world we live in, huh?

331
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,132
Filled with revenge.

332
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:45,137
And everyone knows that revenge

333
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,057
can never be forgiven by God.

334
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,073
Mess Sergeant, good work.

335
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,291
Does she have to stay around for this?

336
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,835
No, it'd be better without her.

337
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,755
Please head back first, then.

338
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,970
I heard Mess Sergeant So Ju-yeon

339
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,097
used to be a part of
the Special Missions Unit

340
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,474
before transferring.

341
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:32,768
She a buddy of yours?

342
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,436
Hmm?

343
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,654
You've been coming here too much.

344
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:49,409
How can I not when there've been
so many unreported operations?

345
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,870
-There's been just one.
-What about the missing ammunition?

346
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,705
Uh, that's already been addressed--

347
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,209
You know very well
that the ammunition was meant for the SMU.

348
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,544
So don't even bother lying.

349
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,838
Yeah?

350
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,135
-Search the place!
-Yes, sir.

351
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:10,722
299 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

352
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,808
Look at all the cars back there!

353
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,811
Let us pass!
We've been stuck here for hours!

354
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:17,521
The soldiers are blocking it!

355
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,605
Move it!

356
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,357
Still standing by.

357
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:23,151
It looks like they're stopping traffic
with a blockade.

358
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,611
A coup from the military.

359
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:28,365
It's a strategic takeover of our weapons.
We've got a mutiny now.

360
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,117
Those guys will try anything.

361
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,036
A few commanders have joined in as well,
so take caution.

362
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,004
Our unit won't be engaging.

363
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,507
The battalion's orders
are to guard the VIPs.

364
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,925
Understood?

365
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,974
I'm Major Jang, the aide-de-camp
to the division commander. Let us pass.

366
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,183
Yes, sir!

367
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,396
Let's go. Let 'em through.
It's all right. Come on.

368
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:04,109
Let us pass!
We've been stuck here for hours!

369
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,903
We're gonna break through
the opposite lane.

370
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,460
What the hell?

371
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,919
Sir.

372
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,214
That son of a bitch just ran off!

373
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,092
I should've known he'd do that.
Jesus Christ!

374
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,811
Ah!

375
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,688
-Oh, my leg!
-Ju-yeon!

376
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,815
-My leg. Help!
-Ju-yeon, are you okay?

377
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,568
Come on! We gotta stop the bleeding!
Hey, Hyeon-sik! Come here!

378
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,028
Help us.

379
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,197
-Come on! Come on!
-Ah!

380
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,200
General!

381
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,410
You okay, sir?

382
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,162
General! General!

383
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,334
The rebel leaders are running away.
We need to stop them.

384
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,380
Special Missions Unit,
all withdraw!

385
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,423
Sir!

386
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,012
I repeat. SMU, we need to retreat!

387
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,681
I can't follow an order
that lets the rebels escape.

388
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,808
-You're kidding?
-We're shooting warning shots.

389
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,227
Open fire.

390
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,270
Come on, get back!

391
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,233
Come on!

392
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,366
Cease fire! Cease fire!

393
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:38,119
The penalty for insubordination
during wartime is death!

394
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,329
Captain Kang!

395
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:40,956
Kang In-a!

396
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,837
Okay, ladies, still hungry?

397
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,506
Plenty for you to eat.

398
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,969
The world may be ending soon,
but food's still important.

399
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,096
That's it. Yeah, that's right.

400
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,559
-Mess Sergeant.
-Hmm?

401
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,768
Is everything okay?

402
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,437
They let you go?

403
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,195
You know, after you left,
the JIU went through our snacks.

404
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,238
Not sure why.

405
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:16,658
Hey, Pang.

406
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,159
Yeah?

407
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:19,869
All right.

408
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,791
We got things to do.

409
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,752
Okay. Go double time.

410
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,255
I need all these potatoes.
Take everything.

411
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,507
Are we seriously taking everything?

412
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,925
-Yep!
-There's so many.

413
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:37,637
You see? Does anyone happen to know
how to make all these multiply?

414
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:38,888
You got me beat.

415
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,057
First, take your potato. Okay.

416
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:45,103
You see where all the buds
are clumped together over here?

417
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:48,982
You just cut out a little piece
that's around there.

418
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,109
Keep about two or three. Just like that.

419
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:54,988
And then, add some ash to it
from your firewood.

420
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,240
The ash is there
as the potato's protector.

421
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,577
You put it here.
And by doing so, it'll shield it.

422
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,745
Got it?

423
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,289
So now we can plant them
right into the ground.

424
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,335
Wait until summertime,
and these spuds will taste delicious.

425
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,170
Good plan.

426
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,421
That'll be good.

427
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,883
Except, as we all know,
we won't have a next summer.

428
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,009
Oops!

429
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,055
I guess so-- It's hard to--

430
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,892
You know.
I don't like thinking about it too much.

431
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,310
Yeah, I try to forget.

432
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,482
-Hey, guys. What are we making today?
-Some pancakes.

433
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,733
With potatoes?

434
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,485
-You wanna make pancakes?
-You're uptight.

435
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,536
Why are we doing this out here?

436
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:49,542
This good enough for you?

437
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,504
Yeah, I guess. Pass it over.

438
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,144
Can you even shoot, huh?

439
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,313
I can, so come on.

440
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,148
Just give the gun to me.

441
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,324
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

442
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,451
You gotta be careful.

443
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,127
This gun better not be fake.

444
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,405
Yeah!

445
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,620
Meow, meow.

446
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,663
Meow.

447
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,166
-Huh?
-Hey!

448
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,254
-What's this about?
-Come on!

449
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,049
Now get out!

450
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,676
No! No, no!

451
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,179
-No, no, no, no!
-Is she out of her mind? The fuck is this?

452
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,597
-Damn it!
-You won't get by!

453
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,681
Huh?

454
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,142
Oh, okay.

455
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,103
I just need the time and place to meet.

456
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,229
Okay.

457
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,234
Listen to me.

458
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,904
And trust Daddy's plan.

459
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,448
We're out of time, okay?

460
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,367
They're getting a chartered plane.

461
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,744
We need to get on it.

462
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:53,041
And once we do,
there won't be anything to worry about.

463
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:59,088
'Cause everything is just fine.

464
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,968
Anything wrong, honey?

465
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,181
Ha-yul?

466
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,286
That motherfucker.

467
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,374
They're all the same.

468
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,952
I know my actions
will lead me to hell.

469
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,495
I'm a murderer,

470
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,581
and it's happened three times now.

471
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,399
The best servants of God,

472
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,736
they are the ones who will go.

473
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,322
There's not much time to waste.

474
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,451
On the day we leave…

475
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:38,581
an hour in advance, be ready.

476
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,208
I will rescue you.

477
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,589
I trust you, Yun-sang.

478
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:49,050
I know you will make the wise choice.

479
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,818
There they go again.

480
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,248
Se-kyung.

481
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,085
Do you know what's happening?

482
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,258
Why they're here,
circling the area over and over again?

483
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,139
You've probably already heard.

484
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:38,850
It's true, then?

485
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,894
They're really planning to leave?
There's another aircraft?

486
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:43,980
I don't know.

487
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:45,523
Either way…

488
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,861
it can only leave if it takes off.

489
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,071
Why wouldn't it?

490
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:53,781
Huh?

491
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:08,463
Se-kyung.

492
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,424
-Yun-sang. I'll be right back.
-Hmm?

493
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:24,979
I see.

494
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,649
Why didn't you say anything, hmm?

495
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,737
I was embarrassed.

496
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:37,867
Even though everyone already knows
how shameless my dad is.

497
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,410
Ha-yul.

498
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:47,752
Always remember

499
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,379
that your number one priority

500
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,423
is yourself.

501
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,427
-But you're not like that.
-Mm-mm.

502
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,763
That's true for everyone.

503
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,390
Me included.

504
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,727
I have to take care of myself

505
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,396
so that I can care for you,

506
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,732
So-min, and Jin-seo.

507
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,488
You're precious, okay?

508
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,116
Your classmates were too.

509
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,244
Got it?

510
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,293
You can cry.

511
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,962
Come here. It's all right.

512
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,091
You're okay, Ha-yul.

513
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,341
You shouldn't be here, In-a.

514
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:22,096
Don't say that when you've already
prepared all of these supplies for us.

515
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:27,435
Besides, even though this is important,
I have another thing to discuss with you.

516
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,023
I have a plan, but I need your help.

517
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,360
I heard about everything.

518
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,865
It was a good move for your unit
to raid the training center.

519
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,742
And even though
it was probably an accident,

520
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,911
it's a good thing
your friend was there too.

521
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,580
They took all of that as a signal.

522
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:53,085
They're cracking down now.
The JIU is questioning everyone.

523
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,295
That's right.

524
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,924
The JIU is getting antsy, not knowing
where all of that ammunition is.

525
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:59,967
Yeah, I bet.

526
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:03,012
They're searching
every nook and cranny of the base.

527
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,514
And then you come in
with this conveniently timed raid?

528
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,432
Correct.

529
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:09,977
They're trying everything they can
to connect the ammunition to the SMU.

530
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,314
So all your ammunition
has been taken away, then?

531
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:17,276
Yeah. I'm not sure of the plan's details.
I just know it's gonna be big.

532
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,029
They've been organizing this for a while.

533
00:37:20,112 --> 00:37:22,365
That can only mean one thing,
don't you think?

534
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,244
They're leaving.

535
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,198
There's been a change of plans.

536
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:08,869
Before we can evacuate,
we must rescue all of our children.

537
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,290
You all need to be ready
at a moment's notice.

538
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,542
Wait for my call to leave.

539
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,003
Until then,

540
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,548
leaving this building is now prohibited.

541
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,887
Over here. And so what about our kids?
Are they joining us?

542
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:29,098
I need my kids. I can't leave alone.

543
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:30,766
I hear you.

544
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,477
I understand your concerns.

545
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,396
There's no need to worry.

546
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,898
I will retrieve your children.

547
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:43,237
As long as you're ready,
you'll all be on the plane.

548
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,824
We'll break away from disease and war.

549
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,538
And together,
all shall arrive at a new heaven,

550
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,622
a new beginning!

551
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:55,958
All of us…

552
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,337
as God's chosen.

553
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,511
-How's that feel?
-Still examining him?

554
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:09,805
That's okay? And here?

555
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:10,973
Ah!

556
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,767
-Right there?
-Yeah.

557
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,144
-When I press down or pull away?
-Ah!

558
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,605
-They both hurt.
-Both, huh?

559
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,944
There's a lot of inflammation.

560
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,863
-Seems like appendicitis.
-Appendicitis--

561
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,157
You've been in pain for a while,
haven't you?

562
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,660
I tried to say it hurt.

563
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,621
-Yeah. Uh…
-Oh.

564
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,581
They would always say,
"We can't help you."

565
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,541
"Wait till we arrive,
and he'll get surgery."

566
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,711
When's he getting discharged?

567
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,339
We need to wait
for his ultrasound results.

568
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,008
We can't just let him go.
You'll have to wait.

569
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,263
All right? I'll proceed with
the abdominal ultrasound.

570
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:52,348
Okay.

571
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,312
How are you feeling?

572
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,150
ONLY ONE GUARDIAN ALLOWED
IN THE TREATMENT ROOM

573
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:08,948
Okay, here we go.

574
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,118
Just like that. There.

575
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,168
I'm losing my touch here.

576
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:25,005
Ah shit. Okay.

577
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,424
Ah! Uh…

578
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:27,967
Oh. Uh…

579
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,472
Ma'am.

580
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,684
Go get the children.

581
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:38,936
Uh, well…

582
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:40,771
The boy is, uh…

583
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:41,772
He's not healthy.

584
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,566
I said to get them!

585
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,860
Do I make myself clear?

586
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,247
At it again, already?

587
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,166
Don't they eat?

588
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,878
Hey! Hey, Seong-u?

589
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:05,546
Yes, Sergeant?

590
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,631
Just make sure
you don't overcook the rice.

591
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,175
-I won't.
-Thanks.

592
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,718
-Hey, Pang.
-Yeah?

593
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:13,137
You know what to do
with the aged sesame seeds?

594
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,930
-What?
-Aged sesame seeds!

595
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:16,724
-Yeah.
-Mix it all at once.

596
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,061
Here we go.

597
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,731
-Hey, listen up!
-Yes, what is it?

598
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:26,901
We take over the night shift
starting at nineteen hours.

599
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:31,614
-Ji-myeong! Code words?
-Sir? There's no dog hole.

600
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,866
-So we all know those, right?
-Yes!

601
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,951
We still don't have
bullets in our guns.

602
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,286
Hit 'em in the head.

603
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,121
How do we do guard duty
without bullets?

604
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,124
I know that. Okay. Here we go.

605
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,168
Get 'em up!

606
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,669
There's no ammunition.

607
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,755
Makes it hard for us to do guard duty.

608
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,841
You're connected.

609
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,094
Hello? This is Kang In-a speaking.

610
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,597
Tell me what's going on.
Why are there so many helicopters?

611
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,099
Matters regarding the US
are under Martial Law Command.

612
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,518
Are you disobeying orders?

613
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,354
I'm not challenging
the Martial Law Command.

614
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,647
Who is it?

615
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,357
Captain Kang In-a.

616
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,484
I'm calling because
there's anxiety in the community.

617
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,194
Civilians deserve to know what's going on.

618
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,738
Lower-level units
have no access to this information.

619
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,159
But as I said, the pe--

620
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,752
They're not gonna tell us anything.

621
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:29,088
Uh, what now?

622
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,881
They still need their food, right?

623
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:34,802
Take a look around
when you bring them their snacks.

624
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,138
I like your plan.

625
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,028
EMERGENCY AIRSTRIP

626
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,120
I'm at the church.

627
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,521
Ma'am.

628
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:28,981
Hello, sir.

629
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:30,733
State your business.

630
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,778
We're here with
the Combat Support Company.

631
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,072
I hear there are
no night shift changes tonight.

632
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,699
Does your team need a snack?

633
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,494
We had a bunch left over
that our unit didn't need.

634
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,045
Hey!
Late-night snacks over here!

635
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,087
Come and get it!

636
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,214
Enjoy.

637
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,549
-Wait, there's food?
-Hurry!

638
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,301
Yeah!

639
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:17,488
Okay.

640
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,907
Hey, bring this cord
to that walkie over there.

641
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,078
The time and place
might not be accurate,

642
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,872
but, uh, the house, the training center…

643
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,834
If they're flying out,
the military base seems most likely.

644
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,254
But the boarding location
could still change.

645
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,466
Father Baek said something
when we visited.

646
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,261
He wants to get Yun-sang.

647
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,639
He said he'll stop by
an hour before they take off.

648
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,058
-Yun-sang?
-Yeah.

649
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:48,394
He said Yun-sang was important
for the escape.

650
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,649
So it might not be
at the US base?

651
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,693
Maybe it's a private plane, then.

652
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:56,819
Wait a minute.

653
00:44:57,653 --> 00:45:00,447
If it's one hour away
from where Father Baek is,

654
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,701
it could be the other one too.

655
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:07,246
There's an emergency airstrip big enough
for both military and private planes.

656
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,498
So there's a chance the US one is a decoy.

657
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,625
Yeah. Well, we've narrowed it down.

658
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,378
And my guess is that
Father Baek is already on his way there.

659
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:17,798
As for the training center,
there hasn't been any movement yet.

660
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:22,052
Sister, I think you should check again
with your source.

661
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:23,429
Yeah, that's a good idea.

662
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,390
Okay, I'll call you back
when there's news.

663
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:29,351
You received the device, right?
Keep it on you.

664
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:36,442
Just in case something happens
to Captain Kang. Take this.

665
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,694
Okay, I think we've got it.
I'll keep checking, then.

666
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,822
You'll be safe for now.
They probably won't attack a church.

667
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,616
Stay safe, In-a. Get some rest for now.

668
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,245
-Okay, you stay here.
-Okay.

669
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:53,459
Hyung. I mean, Father…

670
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:54,585
Yun-sang.

671
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,338
You two go rest for a bit.

672
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,883
We can switch out at dawn.

673
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:29,745
Hey, So-min.
You're going to see Ha-yul, right?

674
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:33,665
Uh, take her some of
the pickled radish she liked.

675
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:41,173
Here, give this to her.
Take some dried seaweed too.

676
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,342
Auntie, where'd you go?

677
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:46,303
Oh, Auntie's right here.

678
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:16,685
What? You're resting here?

679
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,109
I think it's time we talked,
don't you think?

680
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,211
I suppose. Okay.

681
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:56,808
So what are you gonna do?

682
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:02,314
Stop talking like it's all on me.

683
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:06,652
It is though.

684
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,572
And you know it is.

685
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:14,201
The choice is yours.
I don't know what else to say.

686
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,453
I need to have you with me!

687
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:17,746
You "need" to?

688
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:19,998
Is that all I am?

689
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,417
A thing you "need"?

690
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,586
I understand.

691
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,714
I'm just a flower, a tree, a plant.

692
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,217
A thing in the corner
of a painting you made.

693
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,886
You "need" me. Is that it?

694
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,352
Se-kyung, why…

695
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:44,481
You're twisting my words around.
How does that help anything?

696
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:49,778
Do you really think I could just
leave you behind here?

697
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:53,323
I'm just a bitch who's crazy!
You gotta leave me behind, Yun-sang!

698
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,616
Wake up already!

699
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,535
Se-kyung…

700
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:59,788
…why do you keep trying to leave me, huh?

701
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:04,251
Yun-sang. Hey, listen to me. Stop.

702
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:05,794
Sit down.

703
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,763
I wouldn't be happy.

704
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,061
My kids are dead now.

705
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,732
I'm not able to let it go.

706
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,193
I don't think
I can go on living like that.

707
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:35,157
Only three of my kids are left.

708
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,660
They deserve dignity

709
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,913
and to be safe and taken care of.

710
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:45,417
And to not get threatened or used
where they end up going

711
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,668
until their very last breath.

712
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:49,004
And that's why I went
and killed all of those bastards,

713
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,422
those pieces of shit!

714
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:54,217
Yeah, and I'd do it all again.

715
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,938
I knew, but I still hoped it wasn't true.

716
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,650
-Why did you have to…
-Oh…

717
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,611
Why, Se-kyung?

718
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:24,623
Did you really think these guys
wouldn't find out what you did?

719
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,625
They probably already know.

720
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,376
Yeah.

721
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,172
They can't kill me yet
because they still need you.

722
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,610
Leave me behind.

723
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,826
Instead of me, take the kids with you.

724
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,247
The kids are innocent.

725
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,834
So take them with you, okay?

726
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,712
I'm being too selfish, aren't I?

727
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:17,175
They'd hate me for leaving you behind.

728
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,511
I know they're in good hands with you.

729
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:23,223
They'll treat you well in the safety zone
because of all your skills.

730
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,144
You can take care of them
until they're adults.

731
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:33,150
I know it's sad to separate them
from their families at such a young age.

732
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,362
But their parents trust you.

733
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:38,738
They'll be grateful.

734
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:41,867
They'll be relieved,
knowing their kids are all right.

735
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,541
You know I can't do that!

736
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:51,585
Don't be cruel.

737
00:52:51,668 --> 00:52:53,795
This is the only thing that gives me hope.

738
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,257
I have nothing else.

739
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:24,826
