00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:18,184
52 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION
JANUARY 1, 2026

2
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,557
Hold it! Stop, stop, stop!

3
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,392
-Huh?
-Why is everybody rushing?

4
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,144
You're supposed to follow my hands.

5
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,396
-But your hands move too quickly.
-I don't wanna hear it!

6
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,731
I was trying to sing.

7
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,110
What?

8
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,988
I heard this ragtag bunch was at it again,
so I brought some snacks.

9
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,948
This ragtag bunch can…

10
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,825
We could hear from outside.
It sounded great.

11
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,745
-She said we sounded good.
-My wife and I have been so lonely.

12
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,915
The kids are gone, and there's
not much to do, so here we are.

13
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:24,375
Turns out it's pretty nice.

14
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,629
I've always heard that singing is good
for the lungs as well as the brain.

15
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:29,506
So keep coming, both you and your wife.

16
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,674
It'll give you both the chance
to sing your hearts out.

17
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,218
-Mmm.
-Yeah, of course!

18
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:38,556
-Honey, that's enough.
-Whoa, not bad!

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,226
Ah, don't say that!
Don't encourage delusions.

20
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,228
Carry on. Sorry for interrupting.

21
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,688
-Singing makes all your worries disappear!
-Yeah.

22
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,482
Give me a little more confidence
in the song.

23
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:49,025
-Right.
-Please, louder, okay?

24
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,610
-Okay.
-Jang-beom, Dae-han!

25
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,987
-I don't wanna see you two mouthing along.
-I wasn't mouthing!

26
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,782
-Put in some effort!
-I was mouthing, but I gave it my all.

27
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,742
Three, four…

28
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,202
Starting from the top again?

29
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,579
-Okay, okay.
-Okay.

30
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,498
Two, three…

31
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,048
I didn't stay there for long.

32
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:16,136
Three days with my family
was already too much. I had to leave.

33
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,515
So are you back for good, then?

34
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,183
For now, I suppose.

35
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,145
It was fun wandering around a bit though.

36
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,188
Let's go play soccer again soon.

37
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:28,940
Sounds good.

38
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,751
Just a minute.

39
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:50,587
Hmm?

40
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,714
Did you tell them I'm coming?

41
00:02:54,632 --> 00:02:55,967
-Well, no--
-Ah, wait!

42
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,726
Take my scarf off. It's too much.

43
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,223
Father.

44
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,682
Huh, what is it?

45
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,477
-What is he doing here?
-Goodness, he's here.

46
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,396
-Hello, Father.
-Hi.

47
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,316
Oh, Father.

48
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,780
Okay, that's enough.

49
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,992
-Are you-- Will you be okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

50
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,630
He told me he wanted to see the church,
so I brought him along.

51
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,675
I didn't know that everyone would be here.

52
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,555
What's going on?

53
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,100
It's all right.

54
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,110
Thank you all

55
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,697
for greeting me with such

56
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:42,949
reverence.

57
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:49,163
Once again, I give thanks to the Lord

58
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:54,335
for all his grace, his love,
and for his divine will.

59
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,299
Christmas Day is upon us all.

60
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:01,092
-So let us…
-So he's totally lost it, then.

61
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:03,219
Christmas was days ago now.

62
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,138
…which has led us to doubt…

63
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,389
Hold on a minute.

64
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,226
…a plan
which we cannot even begin to fathom.

65
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,061
Let us repent.

66
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,397
Repent for our many mistakes,

67
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,445
for we are here on Earth
while the Lord is high… above us.

68
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,577
Wait. Where have
the altar boys run off to?

69
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,414
And why are there
no liturgical objects here?

70
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,753
Who is doing the Bible reading today?

71
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,222
-Uh, looks like it went out again.
-Don't worry about it.

72
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:52,685
Oh, Yun-sang, why don't you, uh,
take Father Baek home?

73
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,771
We can't have you catching a cold, Father.

74
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,564
Yeah, take the Father home.

75
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,983
The ceilings are so high up that,
even with the heat on,

76
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,860
this place is chilly, so go on.

77
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,279
Anyone who gets sick this winter
will be vulnerable.

78
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,781
There's no medicine. It's dangerous.

79
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,574
Yeah.
Who knows what'll happen.

80
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,992
Look at his condition.

81
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,327
Eh? Go on.

82
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:14,415
Tell me about it. My wife beat COVID,
but now a simple cold might kill her!

83
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:15,458
-That's enough.
-Ah!

84
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,335
Why is it so noisy outside?

85
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,671
I heard the prisons have failed.

86
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,091
So are the rioters here now?

87
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,594
Hurry! One of you, check outside.

88
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,391
-Huh?
-Let's go, please.

89
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,063
Goodness. How is it so loud outside?

90
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,361
Are you all right, Father?

91
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,371
I heard that the prisons
have been destroyed,

92
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,790
and now rioters are banging on the door.

93
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:56,958
Oh, Father.

94
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,585
-Call Mr. Cho. Tell them.
-Yes, okay.

95
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,879
Tell him we need
extra security around here.

96
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,298
-Did you hear me?
-Uh, okay, Father.

97
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,718
Where on earth
is Mr. Cho right now?

98
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:13,474
Call him at once and tell him he needs
to maintain security in Woongcheon.

99
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,686
-All right? It's madness here! Ridiculous!
-Okay, Father.

100
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:23,192

FLOATING BUNKER PRESENTATION

112
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,008
Dear citizens of Woongcheon,

113
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,094
there are only 20 days left
until the asteroid collision.

114
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,223
Though we cannot confirm,

115
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,559
and we fervently hope it is not the case,

116
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,772
there are rumors that the trafficking
of children and adolescents

117
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,107
has started up again.

118
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,237
It may be best to avoid
going outside at night from now on.

119
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,874
The asteroid is coming,

120
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:06,045
and we have but 20 days left.

121
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,714
In these final moments,

122
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,009
may you find some happiness and comfort.

123
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,636
Thank you.

124
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,276
Good job.

125
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,069
I think that was one of your best.

126
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,118
So, that's it. Our last broadcast.

127
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,953
I guess it is.

128
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,956
Bye forever, then.

129
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,666
Oh?

130
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,295
I've had enough of this
for a lifetime.

Hey, private information.

134
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,380
I won't peek. I promise.

135
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,603
Huh?

136
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,146
Mmm.

137
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:49,523
Mmm.

138
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:51,692
Mmm.

139
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,906
Hey.

140
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,825
-Are you gonna be here all the time now?
-Uh-huh.

141
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,495
We have a lot to get done together.

142
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,126

00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,682
So I'd appreciate your cooperation.

149
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,351
Where do we start?

150
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,521
Let's see…

151
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,621
Thanks for letting me stay here.

152
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,249
I wasn't sure about what to do.

153
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,251
Don't worry.
No one will look for you here.

154
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,671
You're safe and sound
with the neighborhood nutcase.

155
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,507
So, uh…

156
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,384
is there…

157
00:11:58,467 --> 00:11:59,635
-Yeah?
-Uh…

158
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:02,221
Do you have any… any meat here?

159
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,222
Meat?

160
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,184
Jin-seo can't eat meat anymore.

161
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,269
Why?

162
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,354
Well, 'cause you quit.

163
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,314
You had to 'cause you ate all the meat.

164
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,400
I'll make sure we have some next time.

165
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,444
Careful, it's hot.

166
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,284
Is it okay?

167
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,119
I haven't had it yet.

168
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:27,621
Is it good?

169
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,124
-It's good.
-Not bad, right?

170
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:42,928
TAKE WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE

171
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,246
Oh God.

172
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,792
Oh God.

173
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,170
I just can't do it.

174
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,509
We can't even die in peace.

175
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:32,645
Hey.
What are you doing out here?

176
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,314
Hey!

177
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:39,068
We agreed we would starve ourselves
and die a peaceful death!

178
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,655
-Huh?
-Yeah, but it's harder than I thought.

179
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,618
Spicy noodles.

180
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,246
What was that?

181
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,999
I'd kill for some spicy noodles right now.

182
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,545
Oh!

183
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,638
At least we let the birds go.
Are they safe, you think?

184
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,565
Like this, okay?

185
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:19,525
Yeah. It's sticky.

186
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,988
How can I send them away?
Off to some stranger.

187
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,990
I know.

188
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,617
-Can we make a snowman?
-But still…

189
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,329
I wanna make
a really big snowman.

190
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,417
Woongcheon is getting
more dangerous by the hour.

191
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,504
You know they'd be safer somewhere else.

192
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,215
Yeah.

193
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,720
We don't know if anywhere is safe.

194
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,224
If there is such a place,
I haven't seen it.

195
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,642
Make it bigger!

196
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,356
I'm so worried.

197
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:03,652
What if someone exploits them?
Or if they're sexually assaulted?

198
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,117
What if I send them away to a living hell?

199
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,040
And, honestly, I don't think
they'd ever agree to go.

200
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,584
I think it's done.
I'm gonna look for a stick.

201
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,836
Hae-chan, Woo-chan, aren't you cold?

202
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,713
-Uh-uh!
-No!

203
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,593
You have to play together, okay?
No going off alone.

204
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:30,012
It's okay. I won't let them bully you.

205
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,517
Hey, cut it out!
Don't bother the other girls like that.

206
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,149
This site is for
authorized personnel only, okay?

207
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,609
Get out of here, Mister!

208
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,446
Oh my God! Seriously.

209
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:49,865
Huh?

210
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,284
You too, Se-kyung? Are you kidding?

211
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,619
Okay.

212
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:59,083
Everyone in this damn town
is crazy for these chickens. Jeez.

213
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,839
Are you still cold?

214
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,967
Somehow, my brain's tricking me
that it's warm.

215
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,843
-Wishful thinking.
-Better than nothing.

216
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,096
-There's no fuel.
-There you are.

217
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,807
You scared me.
I was just in the area.

218
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,975
Does this work?

219
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,394
No luck. The military
ran out of gas a long time ago.

220
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,772
I'll warm you up.

221
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,192
So what did the candidates say?

222
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,111
Mmm.

223
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,487
Well,

224
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,907
none of them are exactly thrilled.

225
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,120
Ah, we're talking about the kids.

226
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,330
We're still trying
to get them out of the country.

227
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,290
Se-kyung, listen.

228
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,961
The higher-ups
are changing some of the criteria.

229
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,506
They're getting stricter.

230
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,722
Actually, I was hoping Captain Kang
could help us publicize it.

231
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,099
You know, warm people up to the idea.

232
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,935
Folks listen to you
a whole lot better than they listen to me.

233
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,648
Does anyone in our area qualify?

234
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,359
Just Woo-chan and Hae-chan
in our neighborhood.

235
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,902
Woo-chan and Hae-chan.

236
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,321
I say

237
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,949
send the kids.

238
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,870
I know we'll be worried for them,
but that shouldn't stop us.

239
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,790
They could actually be sent
to a really nice place.

240
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,337
We can't just let them
stay here waiting to die.

241
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:35,304
Oh, Young-ji. I told you,
you don't have to keep working here.

242
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,805
14 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

243
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,073
Hey, Sister,

244
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:58,535
if you had just one day left to live
instead of two weeks, what would you do?

245
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:00,579
I'd do exactly the same.

246
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,998
No, seriously. What would you really do?

247
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,626
Well, I've only ever known two things.

248
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,294
To pray and to serve others.

249
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,671
Oh, stop it. That's just church stuff.

250
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:15,135
Listen. Dying tomorrow
wouldn't really change anything at all.

251
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,014
Since it won't matter either way,
I'll just carry on.

252
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,774
What's the matter, Sister?
You don't wanna volunteer?

253
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,651
You're acting a little strange today.

254
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:40,953
Well, it's really cold outside,
just like my poor heart.

255
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,674
Oh, hello.

256
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,052
Where'd you come from?

257
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,220
Oh!

258
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,348
I know you're hungry,
but you can't eat that.

259
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,561
Lucky for you, you don't look too tasty.

260
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,521
They say dogs are
a good judge of character.

261
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,439
In this case, I'd have to agree.

262
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,483
If I die early for some reason,

263
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,777
go ahead and let him eat me.

264
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,822
Ew, well, that's pretty generous of you.

265
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:20,200
It'd be more generous to die right now
so that this cute baby gets his snack.

266
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,288
Keep talkin', and we'll have
hungry wolves barging in here.

267
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,209
You do know that there's
an asteroid flying towards us, right?

268
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,796
That's a terrible excuse
to tell bad jokes.

269
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,839
Wow!

270
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,133
Let's go.

271
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,685
Wanna play?

272
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,314
Why are you out there alone?

273
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,815
Se-kyung slept in today.

274
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,027
Are you looking for a team, then?

275
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,570
You guys wanna play?

276
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,906
Attention!

277
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,490
All right, get in there.

278
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,784
There's nobody left to feed anyway!

279
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,453
-Here we come!
-Yeah!

280
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,246
Let's go!

281
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,708
I thought I'd never play soccer again!
I'll be the goalie. Let's go!

282
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,389
I'm sorry.

283
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,642
It might be silly to leave at this point.

284
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,560
It's not silly.

285
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,481
Captain--

286
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,984
You'll have to handle everything here
after I leave.

287
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,902
I doubt they'll send a replacement.

288
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:25,575
I hope nothing happens, but just in case,
keep an eye on the troublemakers.

289
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,743
No accidents.

290
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,290
There's some live ammo in there.

291
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,000
SNACK STORAGE

292
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:35,210
There's enough to arm all the soldiers.

293
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,462
Thank Mess Sergeant So.

294
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,381
Uh, the ammunition incident--

295
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,174
It's a long story to tell.

296
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,385
But don't worry. That ammo's all clean.

297
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,931
I'm sorry again.

298
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,726
I know it's a lot to take care of.

299
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,942
You are the commander here now.

300
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:03,447
I know you'll do well.

301
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,786
I wish you luck, Captain.

302
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,179
All right, come on.

303
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,853
Goodbye, friend.

304
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,488
In-a.

305
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,907
You look a little different today.

306
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,326
Is Se-kyung here?

307
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,539
Chapter four.

308
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,926
In-a, what are you-- Uh…

309
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:17,104
You should've been the one
to become a soldier.

310
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,523
You're always trying to run into battle.

311
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,194
I couldn't do the uniforms.

312
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,242
I, um…

313
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,619
I finally told my mom how I really felt.

314
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,037
I had an epiphany.

315
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,795
Wow, you have so much energy.
It's all the running you do.

316
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:45,382
Hey, listen!
I'm actually being serious here.

317
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,515
I realized

318
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,476
I've lived my entire life for others.

319
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,942
Hey, what's with the retrospection
all of a sudden?

320
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,403
I wanted so badly to be recognized…

321
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:12,033
…to the point where I…
I felt responsible for everyone.

322
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,622
In-a, you're scaring me.
What are you trying to say?

323
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,790
That you were right.

324
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,086
I was so worried
whenever you were in trouble

325
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,880
and treated you like a child.

326
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,216
It doesn't mean
you're sorry, though, does it?

327
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,135
Are you kidding?

328
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,598
I just…

329
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,820
You have the gun, right?

330
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:33,949
Yeah.

331
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,544
You have to protect her, Yun-sang.

332
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,826
As of this February 8th afternoon,

333
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,746
I hereby report
that I've been formally discharged

334
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,123
and that I'll be leaving.

335
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,421
In-a.

336
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,097
I want you to know…

337
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,020
that I'm so very proud of you.

338
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:33,878
10 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

339
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,986
You know what I want.

340
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,114
Yeah, I do,
you crazy bastard. You want out.

341
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,660
You know some kids, right?

342
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:08,747
This is the last chance to leave.

343
00:29:10,707 --> 00:29:12,667
I'll let you board for three kids.

344
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,585
Okay.

345
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:14,794
Got it covered?

346
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,964
J… just three of them, and we're good?

347
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:19,382
Attaboy.

348
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:26,473
Damn, look at this junkie.
Your eyes look terrible!

349
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,853
Yeah, get me three.

350
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,732
-All right, let's head back.
-Yes, sir.

351
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,067
Good work. Yeah, good job.

352
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:42,071
It… it looks like those bastards
are… are putting kids in containers

353
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,200
and… and… and sending them off
somewhere abroad.

354
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,751
Since this is their last shipment,

355
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,212
they're just focusing
on making the number,

356
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,255
so they might be a little less careful.

357
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,133
This is the last ship that'll leave

358
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,427
before the asteroid hits.

359
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,944
-What should we pack, Woo-chan?
-Um, this and this.

360
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,237
Let's see here.

361
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,198
-That!
-The penguin?

362
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,659
-Is the penguin coming too?
-Yeah!

363
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,619
And my doll.

364
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:32,163
Okay, let's just pack it all.

365
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,581
Where are your other toys?

366
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,128
Here!

367
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,966
Oh, that's great.
Hae-chan, do you need any help?

368
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:46,928
Unni, I don't want to go.

369
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,055
I'm scared.

370
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,272
You don't have to be afraid.

371
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,025
You'll have yummy snacks to eat.
It won't be cold either.

372
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,738
And I know you two…
You and Woo-chan will make new friends.

373
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:10,827
Hae-chan.

374
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,623
You and your brother will be safe there.

375
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,250
You'll both live a happy life.

376
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,085
But why only us?

377
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:22,463
Unni should go. And what about you?

378
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,467
How about I…

379
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:30,263
Uh, Auntie will visit both of you,
okay, Hae-chan?

380
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,806
Don't lie to me.

381
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,480
Hae-chan, come here. Give Auntie a hug.

382
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,485
You too, Woo-chan. Give us a hug!

383
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,779
Give me a hug! That's it.

384
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,827
You too. Get in here, So-min.

385
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,626
That's my girl.

386
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,965
Perhaps the world is ending.

387
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:50,468
Yet, as long as I have my darling wife,
my soul will always--

388
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,178
There are still some boxes left.

389
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:54,764
So what's for dinner?

390
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,486
-I dunno.
-You're cute.

391
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:12,907
HI, THIS IS SUPERMAN AND WONDERMART
THE TIME HAS COME FOR US TO CLOSE SHOP

392
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,465
-Oh, I'll take that.
-Ah…

393
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,427
Oh, it's not too heavy, but thank you.

394
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,388
Are you doing okay?

395
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,809
Mm-hmm.

396
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:45,148
Um… are you just about to start work here?

397
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,942
Ah, not today.
I'm just taking the seniors for a drive.

398
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,027
Ah!

399
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,655
Would you like to come too?

400
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,745
Yeah, sure.

401
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:00,872
Oh goodness.

402
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:04,709
I guess our soccer team is finally over,
now that you're both leaving.

403
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,420
Come on.
They're not leaving forever.

404
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:10,965
Don't worry. When the time comes,
everyone'll be back, right?

405
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:13,551
I'll be back again.

406
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,511
You can count on it.

407
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,598
Oh, but Sister Ji-eun,

408
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:21,100
are you sure you and your baby
will be okay?

409
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,772
Yeah.

410
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,524
You know,

411
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,028
there's a good chance
we won't be back again.

412
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:35,698
Where are you headed?
If it's someplace nice, take me with you.

413
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,241
What are you talking about?

414
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:41,537
Sister Myeong-ok, there's no place left
in the world that's nice anymore.

415
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:45,792
Until we see heaven, this church is
the best place for us to be.

416
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,919
It is indeed.

417
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,337
What's all this?

418
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,172
Oh, Father, hi.

419
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:54,467
I was cleaning the supermarket
and brought some stuff over.

420
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,846
Sister Mi-ryeong, you're leaving again?

421
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:06,687
Sung-jae.

422
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:09,607
Oh my.

423
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:16,823
♪ Where I come from… ♪

424
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:17,740
Noona!

425
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:22,870
♪ Wherever I go… ♪

426
00:35:25,998 --> 00:35:27,667
Mi-ryeong!

427
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,378
-♪ It's not worth my… ♪
-I'm right here, you know!

428
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:32,421
♪ Focus… ♪

429
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,299
Kim Dae-han, if you keep acting so petty,

430
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,260
God's gonna send you to hell
with the asteroid.

431
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:40,012
Don't worry. With a face like that,
you'll fit right in!

432
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,848
I'm going to heaven!

433
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,516
And I'm leaving that one behind.

434
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,825
I'm leaving for Ms. Kim's.

435
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,661
Oh. Do you need a ride?

436
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:04,745
Mm-mm.

437
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,873
We're just gonna talk for a bit.

438
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,470
Did In-a… say if she'll be back?

439
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,274
Why is your door open?

440
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:36,903
I need the ventilation. I'm cleaning.

441
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:40,156
-Feel free to sit.
-Is Se-kyung going somewhere?

442
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,491
Yeah, she's visiting Ms. Kim.

443
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:45,620
Ah. So it's a work trip.

444
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,914
That's too bad.

445
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,209
I came over to give you newlyweds
the holy gift of prayer.

446
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,425
Oh?
You brought out the homemade wine.

447
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,219
Is that what we're drinking tonight?

448
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:05,181
Hey, you know, hyung,
a while back…

449
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,307
Hmm?

450
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,519
…you said

451
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:15,316
I fell for Se-kyung
'cause of my outward perceptions,

452
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,526
that there was more to her I didn't know.

453
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:19,987
I said that?

454
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,618
I think that was true at the time,

455
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,622
and everything I loved
about her then is still true.

456
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,583
But it's a little different now.

457
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:38,589
It's not that I feel like…
like, I need to be by her side

458
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,591
or that I need to protect her.

459
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,388
Just knowing…

460
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,101
that she and I will be together
until the very end…

461
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:53,562
It feels so special.

462
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:02,113
We'll all be dead in ten days.

463
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,658
Are you saying that we're, uh…

464
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,578
we're all special to each other, then?

465
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,878
You wanna be special?
Help me clean, you idiot.

466
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,547
All right, okay.

467
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,799
I'll take special care helping you clean.

468
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,931
Do you have a lot left to clean?

469
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:31,142
Can't you tell by looking?

470
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,853
-I'll just follow you.
-Okay, just hurry up!

471
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,110
Okay.

472
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,867
What was I…

473
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,832
Oh, Ms. Jin,

474
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,544
I… I don't wanna get married.

475
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,339
Then you don't have to.

476
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,927
But, Ms. Jin, didn't you…
You got married, didn't you?

477
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,097
You're right. I did.

478
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,017
But I can't say it's the greatest.

479
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,731
Well, if you did,
why are you telling me not to?

480
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,567
Funny, isn't it?

481
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,329
The kids
should've had more fun.

482
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,998
Why did I tell them
not to do so many things?

483
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,419
Oh. Ms. Jin, are you crying?

484
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,506
Don't cry, my dear.

485
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:46,717
I understand. I know how you feel.

486
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:51,889
You don't.

487
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,060
How could you? Nobody knows. Nobody.

488
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,647
Even I don't know.

489
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,149
I don't know anything.

490
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:09,448
I ask myself, if I'd killed your son,

491
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,827
would things have turned out differently?

492
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:17,706
If I'd been killed
on the day all my students died, I…

493
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:21,127
If, from the very beginning,
I'd just followed Yun-sang abroad.

494
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,428
I… I keep thinking about
all the choices we've made.

495
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:33,264
I think of you too.

496
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,769
If this world is the result
of all of our decisions…

497
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,731
I can't help but imagine…

498
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:47,361
a world where we'd all chosen differently.

499
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,614
I know none of this matters anymore.
It's useless.

500
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,453
I don't want that.

501
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:58,080
No, I don't want that.

502
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,845
Th… these are the only things I have left.

503
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:14,680
The only things that actually work.

504
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,643
Do… do you know how to… handle 'em?

505
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:26,400
Th… those guys… are… are really dangerous.

506
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,110
They have nothing left to lose.

507
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,069
I know.

508
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,030
I don't either.

509
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,991
The end is so near, so wh… why even…

510
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,902
Ms. Jin, it's you.

511
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,446
Why are you so surprised?

512
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,951
Where's Ha-yul?

513
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:27,878
Ha-yul?

514
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,555
Ms. Jin.

515
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:43,644
Did you see, um, any creepy-looking guys
waiting outside on your way over here?

516
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,730
Have you seen any men out there like that?

517
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,482
It's been insane lately.

518
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:51,402
We're so afraid these days
that we can't even go outside--

519
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:56,824
Hey, Ms. Jin.

520
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,953
You didn't see Sergeant Kim, did you?

521
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,289
Nope, I didn't.

522
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,057
SERGEANT KIM

523
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,147
If you leave now,
you can all survive.

524
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,357
I'll be nice to you.
I'll even give you a gun.

525
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,943
All you have to do is
bring your other two friends.

526
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,741
Please don't do anything dangerous.

527
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,161
I don't want you to die.

528
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:47,791
Why would I die, huh?

529
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,171
I'm not gonna die, okay?

530
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,593
And even if I do, it won't be for a long,

531
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,095
long while, okay?

532
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,138
Don't worry.

533
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,141
I have to see you all grow into adults.

534
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,559
Then…

535
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,357
I don't ever wanna grow up.

536
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,669
I didn't know.

537
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,089
Everything kept passing me by,

538
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:48,759
and I didn't even realize it.

539
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:55,724
But now it's time to go.

540
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:59,895
Take me over the mountain
to where my grave is waiting for me.

541
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:12,282
Ah, one more thing.

542
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,370
Goodbye.

543
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,289
Goodbye, world.

544
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,087
Goodbye, my neighborhood.

545
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,758
Goodbye now,

546
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:34,054
you mothers and fathers.

547
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,559
Goodbye, spontaneous musical clock.

548
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:50,821
And the garden we all tended to, farewell.

549
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,951
To the delicious food and coffee.

550
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:04,501
To the freshly ironed clothes
and the bathhouse's steaming water.

551
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,549
To going to sleep.

552
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:13,385
To waking up.

553
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:22,436
To this Earth and all of its
beautiful, magnificent things

554
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,564
that no one knew the true value of.

555
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,069
Goodbye, Earth.
