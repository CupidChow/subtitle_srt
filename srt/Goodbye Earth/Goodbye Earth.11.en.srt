1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,466
Every little bit helps.

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,386
Many of your neighbors are in need.

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:12,554
Thank you.

4
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,559
Please help out those in need.

5
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,603
Just a little help is all I ask.

6
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,191
Merry Christmas!

7
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,735
62 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

8
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,987
I hope you all have a good Christmas.

9
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:30,655
Hello.

10
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,373
There's not much time left now.

11
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,459
Are you scared?

12
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:45,462
Not really.

13
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,631
Actually, I'm kinda looking forward to it.

14
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,550
The asteroid?

15
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,427
Mmm. Bam in the sky.

16
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,888
It's gonna look so cool, I bet.
Don't you think?

17
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:56,806
I don't wanna miss that.

18
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,022
Where's Ha-yul?

19
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,983
Uh… she's still passed out.

20
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,244
What's this?

21
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,330
Are you sticking together
till the very end?

22
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,831
Of course.

23
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,167
The three of us are staying together,
no matter what.

24
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,712
Uh-huh. And once we're all wiped out,
we'll be with our friends again.

25
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,256
-Noona.
-What's up?

26
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,550
What are we getting
for Christmas this year?

27
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,763
Santa's still gonna come, isn't he?

28
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,391
I think he's staying home this year.

29
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,357
Aw, that's not true.

30
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,068
And even if Santa doesn't show,
Mrs. Claus will be around.

31
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:53,238
She'll bring lots of gifts for you.
Hmm? You'll see.

32
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,343
Why are you standing out here?

33
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,972
It's freezing.

34
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:20,765
Aren't you cold?

35
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,978
Hey, we make a good pair, don't we?

36
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:37,323
Honey.

37
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,709
Min-ho wouldn't want this.

38
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,170
Let's say our goodbyes.

Grandma!

53
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,026
Yun-sang, take this.

54
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:19,902
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

55
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,821
Easy, now. Hey, hey!

56
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,240
-Set it here. Good.
-Grandma!

57
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,534
Grandma!

58
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,246
What are you doing there?

59
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,832
Grandma.

60
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,543
What is this?

61
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,215
Jin Se-kyung? Are you all right?

62
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,052
Hold it now. Jin Se-kyung?

63
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:44,969
Huh?

64
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,929
Oh, you're barefoot.

65
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,307
Here. Let's put these on her.

66
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,517
Oh my. This is dangerous.

67
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:55,021
-I was so worried. Oh my goodness.
-Your feet are freezing.

68
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,320
Oh, Father.
Let's bring her back. Oh my.

69
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,743
Thank you.

70
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:13,331
I have a favor to ask
of Ms. Jin, okey dokey?

71
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,876
Oh, thank you, Yun-sang.

72
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,087
Look at her.
She's like an angel. See that?

73
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,638
Listen to me.
Those people are crooked.

74
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,681
And they need to be taken down.

75
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,393
No one should ever forgive
the things they've done.

76
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,603
Se-kyung, you believe me.

77
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,730
-Uh, I agree.
-Let's go find them.

78
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,898
-Yeah, but later.
-What?

79
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,566
Okay? All right?

80
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:49,492
Se-kyung, your grandma,
uh, she hasn't paid us yet.

81
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,745
Uh, I'll go right now to see if I…

82
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,123
What are you talking about?

83
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:59,252
Ms. Kim, her grandma passed away already.
They settled everything when she died.

84
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:03,631
C… come on.
Y… you're not making any sense.

85
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,176
Uh, wait. What's that?

86
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:08,761
Whiskey.

87
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,555
Can she drink that?

88
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:14,851
She had a glass of whiskey every day,
even before the fainting started.

89
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,479
I'm glad I saved a whole ton of whiskey.
Comes in handy now.

90
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,483
Here you go.

91
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,623
She should be napping
any moment now.

92
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,424
What are you doing, Se-kyung?

93
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,051
We need to hurry and catch them.

94
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,887
You know why?

95
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,347
That isn't the son I raised.

96
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,434
Se-kyung?

97
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,897
Please.
I need you to go and catch him.

98
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,609
Bring him back to this house.

99
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,015
You can't die yet, Father.

100
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,686
If you die now, no one will get closure.

101
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,023
You have to confess your sins
and apologize.

102
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,905
You sicken us, you know.

103
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,408
You messed us all up.

104
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,705
You made me too ashamed to stay a priest.

105
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,750
So I quit.

106
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,465
Since you were able to hold onto
that dear life of yours…

107
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,971
you should take this opportunity
to ask for forgiveness,

108
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:18,140
even if we all hate you.

109
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,521
I know you're listening.

110
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,985
Don't embarrass the church any further.
It's the least you can do.

111
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,250
THE CHURCH IS CURRENTLY WITHOUT A PRIEST

112
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,335
PLEASE CONTACT THE CATHEDRAL
FOR CONFESSIONS

113
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,547
Whoa, whoa, whoa, be careful!

114
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,257
Keep going. Just like that.

115
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,595
I don't think Ms. Jin
should have to deal with this.

116
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,805
It barely has anything to do with her.
She's not In-a.

117
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:02,018
My own daughter wouldn't really care
if something happened to me.

118
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,312
Not that I have the right
to judge anybody.

119
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,940
I'm still her mother though.

120
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,615
Sister, the church is
so important right now.

121
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,660
Where else can everybody go to repent?

122
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,874
What do you think, Father?

123
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,044
They went to the parish
but got turned away,

124
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,046
and most still wanna go to confession.

125
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,592
They should talk to
the remaining priest, then.

126
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,344
Father Baek is here.

127
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,481
Where are you going? Eat first.

128
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,274
I don't want to.

129
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,570
I won't force you, then.

130
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,575
If you happen to see your father,
say I need him here.

131
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,452
He's not my husband.

132
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,843
Did you actually sign it?

133
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,763
Wow, that's not smart.

134
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,849
It won't take him long to get rid of you.

135
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,935
Says who?

136
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,688
I'm really close to getting a break.

137
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:33,317
There's no way that you're gonna be able
to outsmart those guys. You know that.

138
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,655
They wouldn't dare do anything
to Jeong Su-geun.

139
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:41,659
They might go after your kids though.
Huh? Ha-yul was it?

140
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,334
None of your business, bastard. Shit.

141
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,378
Mr. Jeong! Best of luck!

142
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,635
Deal me in.

143
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,392
All done.

144
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,565
You guys
shouldn't wander around alone.

145
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,858
Okay. You be safe too.

146
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,152
Why? You think kidnappers will come?

147
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,112
Uh, no, just to be safe.

148
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:19,989
-Unni.
-Hmm?

149
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,615
-Ta-da!
-Huh?

150
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,908
You're-- Is this a gift?

151
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,077
Yeah! A Christmas gift for you!

152
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,498
I love it.

153
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,170
Whoo! Ha ha! Yeah!

154
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,218
Oh! Did you see that?

155
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,971
Tonight's dinner is on me, huh?

156
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,931
Come on. Let's go.

157
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,064
We've completed our tasks for the day.

158
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,609
How many?
Are their belongings with them as well?

159
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,236
Yeah. Confirming 18 unidentified bodies.

160
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:08,996
Why run? It just makes you hungry.

161
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,332
That's the point! I run
to distract myself from the hunger!

162
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,376
Ooh! Ooh!

163
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,463
Here! That's it.

164
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,548
Ah!

165
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,133
So, Captain.

166
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,094
What do you think we should cook
for Christmas dinner this year?

167
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,932
I know the guys won't be happy
unless they get meat.

168
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,976
-So let's catch some wild bunnies?
-Yeah, let's not do that.

169
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,981
We gotta protect the chickens.

170
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:38,192
The whole neighborhood's been eyeing them.

171
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,195
I'll see what I can find.

172
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,741
Oh, your mom stopped by earlier.

173
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:48,577
You saw my mother?

174
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,287
My mother?

175
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,248
Yeah, In-a, your mother.

176
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:05,636
What's the occasion?
I'm not used to seeing you here.

177
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,054
I'm tired.

178
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,056
I'm not in the mood to fight with you.

179
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,685
Are you doing laundry?
Here, I'll help you.

180
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,144
It's all right. I got it.

181
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,361
Hey!

182
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,990
Can you at least say something?
Why do you have to be so cold?

183
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,700
What's there to say anymore?

184
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,578
Please, In-a!
You're a sitting target right now!

185
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,997
They're putting the blame on you,
aren't they?

186
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,541
Can't you see
how worried we all are?

187
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,877
Why did you have to get involved?

188
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,379
Okay, see ya.

189
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,924
Hey, you can't just leave!
Can you just talk to your mother?

190
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,556
By the way,

191
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,726
after everything that happened
with the escape,

192
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,895
I thought for sure
you'd lose your uniform.

193
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,605
But you're all good.

194
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,068
Well, I doubt anyone here
is doing good these days.

195
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,072
In-a.

196
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,575
Is something wrong?

197
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:16,707
-Hey. What's up?
-Hello.

198
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,708
Hey.

199
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,503
So what does Ms. Kim
always wanna talk to you about?

200
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,675
She just talks about
how much she hates everybody.

201
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,679
Father Baek, her son…
They were such a big part of her life.

202
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,057
Did she fall asleep early today?

203
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:36,226
Yeah, she's drinking a lot. Whiskey.

204
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,025
Apparently, it's her medication now.
It's wild.

205
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,570
All of the clinics in town
are out of supplies. It's really sad.

206
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,238
Whiskey's about the best she can get.

207
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,241
Yikes. This again?

208
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,161
I just hope the flu
isn't too bad this winter.

209
00:15:57,748 --> 00:15:59,083
It's so funny.

210
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:04,880
Everyone left survived a civil war,
riots, food shortages, a global pandemic.

211
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,758
After all of that,
a cold is gonna kill us?

212
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,581
I can't stop thinking about
what Father Baek did.

213
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,130
Yeah, I get it.

214
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,174
Though, if you think about it,

215
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,469
Father Baek used to inspire us all.

216
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,433
A shame that this is how
we're gonna say goodbye.

217
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,352
What do you think?

218
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,688
It's how I feel anyway.

219
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,398
I know.

220
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,942
We were so happy just to even see him.

221
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,610
He gave us hope.

222
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,697
And he really had a way
with all the troubled kids at school.

223
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,115
Ah!

224
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,367
It's sad that his reputation
is ruined now.

225
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:19,163
He really did a lot for the community,
which is why it's all so ridiculous.

226
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,206
Yeah, you're right.

227
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,587
I always think of
what Gye Hyang said.

228
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,089
I just can't believe
that she went over there

229
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,467
and donated all of her hard-earned money.

230
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,012
And you?

231
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,473
How I feel?

232
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,144
Years ago, he pulled me aside.
He said, "I know you like girls."

233
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,230
"If you can't change that, you should
live a quiet life alone serving others."

234
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,399
I didn't know what to say,
so I said nothing.

235
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:54,406
I really should've put him in his place
for saying that.

236
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,742
And my mom wasn't exactly
the supportive type.

237
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:03,499
Hey, In-a. I know it's hard, okay?
You should still talk to your mom though.

238
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,793
We don't have much time left.

239
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,879
Hey, I didn't ask for advice.

240
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,423
Okay.

241
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,972
That's cute.

242
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,894
-Hi. I see you too.
-Hi.

243
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,023
Wow, I wonder who made that.

244
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:36,949
What is it?

245
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,201
You can't fall asleep?

246
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,955
Mm-mm.

247
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,626
Should I make us tea?

248
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,301
Why?

249
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,013
Do you wanna talk?

250
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,524
You always seem so far away.

251
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,406
You poor guy.

252
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:20,075
It's okay.

253
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,579
I'll hold you real tight, all right?

254
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,998
Hmm.

255
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,921
Sh. Only happy thoughts.

256
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,887
What kind of happy thoughts?

257
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,568
The world's ending, but we still have
a lot of good moments ahead.

258
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,324
Besides, we've got 60 days.

259
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,243
That's longer than we think.

260
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,956
How's that a happy thought?

261
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,460
Hmm.

262
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,883
Sometimes, I also think about
all the people who escaped.

263
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,427
That's good, right?

264
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,856
Uh…

265
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,992
All I want is to be with you.

266
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:47,621
Mmm.

267
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,420

00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,697

00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,123
-What?
-What's wrong?

286
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,499
Oh, look at that.

287
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,836
Marriage certificate.

288
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,255
-You mean, you…
-Finally, it happened!

289
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,091
-We got married!
-Look what we got. It's official!

290
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,678
Se-kyung,
Yun-sang, congratulations!

291
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,013
Oh, that's so great!

292
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,474
What's happening here?

293
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,309
-That's so great!
-Who just got--

294
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,602
You gotta fill me in.

295
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:37,773
You two actually went through with it!
You're married? Oh my goodness!

296
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,400
This is so great! I'm so excited for you!

297
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,154
Look at this!
They got married! It's official now!

298
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,295
60 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

299
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,757
I'm a war veteran. Got it?
Capital Defense, 26th Regiment.

300
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,509
-The Battle of Baegamsan?
-Really?

301
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,511
-I was there!
-Okay, how old are you, sir?

302
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,721
Let me tell you,
that battle was bloody.

303
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,765
Hold it.
Did you bring any photos with you?

304
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,643
-You need the photos to do this.
-I went to fight at only 18 years old.

305
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,229
Good, good, good.
Let us take them for you.

306
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,731
Okay. But tell me, how old are you, sir?

307
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,149
-Me?
-Yeah.

308
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,652
-Year of the red mouse.
-Oh, come on now.

309
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,695
-How's it going?
-Oh, hi.

310
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,572
-Understood. He's 87.
-Good.

311
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,117
Okay.
Fill this one out and that one too.

312
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,785
Okay.

313
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,370
Thank you.

314
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,082
Hmm.

315
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,918
Thank you. Wow, you came prepared.

316
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,879
Oh. I have nothing else to do.

317
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,509
What's in here?

318
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:52,889
Oh, this is really nice.
The more material, the better.

319
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,015
Okay.

320
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,851
TYPE OF MATERIAL: PHOTOGRAPHS

321
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,437
I haven't seen you much
since the weather got cold.

322
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,855
Your friends all doing okay?

323
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,399
-So-min and, uh…
-It's Ha-yul.

324
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,360
Yeah, the three best friends.

325
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:11,992
Four, actually.

326
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,831
Ah.

327
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,836
Hey, don't you kids
ever get sick of each other?

328
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,717
Uh…

329
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:33,263
So we're… keeping these records
for the future?

330
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:34,514
What's the point?

331
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,266
We're sending it out everywhere.

332
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,935
I wanna keep our town's memory alive.

333
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,438
You never know.
These could end up in a museum one day.

334
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,566
Oh. Other cities might survive?

335
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,403
Mmm.

336
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,823
Should've brought
better stuff, then.

337
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,332
Ah.

338
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,585
Well, the heart sounds very healthy.

339
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:11,176
At this point,
there's not much I can do for you.

340
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,390
Okay.

341
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,603
I think that's everything.

342
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,105
Hang in there, all right? You'll be okay.

343
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,364
Oh, Young-ji, hi.

344
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,783
Oh, how's it going?

345
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:35,909
Hello.

346
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:46,753
-She lives in my neighborhood.
-Oh. Yeah, she's due soon.

347
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,967
So, uh, how's Young-han doing?

348
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,051
Uh…

349
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,470
He's not doing well.

350
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,140
-And the medicine?
-There's no medicine left.

351
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,560
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

352
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,479
The antibiotics have run out.

353
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,941
I wish I could give you the care he needs,
but there's nothing I can do.

354
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,153
I heard about your brother.

355
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,238
Is he still feeling sick?

356
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:58,491
Yeah.

357
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:00,535
Oh.

358
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,873
Uh, so…

359
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,208
It's me. Do you, uh…

360
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,420
I knew from the moment I saw you.

361
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,464
You're from Ulsan.

362
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,301
Yeah. You remember.

363
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:20,388
Mmm. I'm sorry I never got
the chance to thank you.

364
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,684
But I should've.
So thank you, and I'm sorry.

365
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,229
Oh, it's all good.

366
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,818
Is it okay to be away from your unit?

367
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,321
Uh, just for a moment.

368
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,572
Na Hyeon-jae!

369
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,325
Be right there!

370
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,376
Can we, uh, maybe meet again?

371
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,963
Mmm.

372
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:56,841
Do you mean it?

373
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,886
I'll be seeing you, then.

374
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,289
His fever won't go down.

375
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,584
This might feel a little cold,
but it's good for you.

376
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:35,171
Oh, drink some water. Come on.

377
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:38,967
Does it hurt?
Here. Sit up just a little.

378
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,937
There's no medicine left?

379
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,523
Mmm.

380
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,993
Ha-yul's always off
on her own these days.

381
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,370
-You're gonna go look for her?
-Yeah.

382
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:11,499
-What's that?
-What?

383
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,500
Oh.

384
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,880
Biscuits. Take them. I had a few earlier.

385
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,676
I haven't had these in forever.

386
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,762
Where are you gonna check?

387
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,306
I don't know. Maybe her house first?

388
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:48,661
-What? The hell is this?
-Come on. You know me.

389
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,789
-The fuck is this, huh?
-What's your name?

390
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,457
You know me! Here.

391
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,959
Look. Jeong Su-geun!

392
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,129
Of course I recognize you, yeah. Hmm.

393
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,089
I have a ton of gold back home.

394
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,716
Gold bars!

395
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,385
My in-laws used to run a jewelry shop.

396
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,680
Seriously, I'll pay you back soon.

397
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,225
You know I will, okay?

398
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,228
I'll make sure all of it goes to you.

399
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,356
I'll sign a contract.
Just don't leave me here.

400
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,649
Is that so?

401
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,194
You know what we should include this time?

402
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:22,779
Her.

403
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:27,033
Yeah, I bet she's a hot little thing. Mmm.

404
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,417
The hell is this?

405
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,213
-Ah!
-You piece of shit.

406
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,383
Is that gun even real?

407
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:54,018
JIN-SEO: HA-YUL, PICK UP YOUR PHONE
I'M OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE WITH SO-MIN

408
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,356
SO-MIN: WHERE ARE YOU? I MISS YOU!
PLEASE SHOW UP

409
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,306
Please mask up
and wear gloves before going in.

410
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,849
-Okay.
-Sounds good.

411
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,571
Oh.

412
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,997
Oh. She was here.

413
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:06,090
I LOVE YOU, GRANDMA
MERRY CHRISTMAS

414
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,261
She must've been so sad

415
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,639
not to get to see her granddaughter
before she passed.

416
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,058
I don't know.

417
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,977
Maybe she didn't want her granddaughter
to witness her death.

418
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,438
Oh, don't say that.

419
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,337
This won't work.

420
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,965
We should wrap her up and then move her.

421
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,051
We shouldn't have come.

422
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:53,930
It's too late for that.
Come on. Just grab the other end.

423
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,134
What are you doing here?
You should go back.

424
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:33,720
I heard the rations
aren't being distributed anymore.

425
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,346
Are you eating at all?

426
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,557
You do realize
I was in the special forces, right?

427
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,350
A mother can't help but worry.

428
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,898
Let's speak later, all right.

429
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,233
Hey! In-a.

430
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:48,860
What?

431
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,821
Did you honestly think we'd ever be close?

432
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,741
I suppose now that oppa's dead,
there's no one else.

433
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,160
How could you say that? Hey, In-a!

434
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,412
All right, okay, I know.

435
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,872
I'm sorry, In-a.

436
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:02,999
I'm sorry.

437
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,500
I…

438
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,294
Your brother…

439
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,840
I know I've been
too hard on you over the years.

440
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,053
Your brother always got into trouble.

441
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,889
You never made me worry.

442
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:20,183
So I mistakenly thought
you would understand.

443
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:24,937
Everyone in our town
used to tell me all the time

444
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,773
about what a good daughter you were.

445
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:30,318
You did everything right,
and I knew I could always depend on you.

446
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,529
You didn't take a single minute

447
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,656
to ask yourself
why I was such a good girl?

448
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,626
How many times did oppa have you
running to school or the police station?

449
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,004
He occupied all of your thoughts.

450
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,092
There was no space for anyone else.

451
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,970
Do you even know how stressful it was
for a kid to hear that Mom wanted to die?

452
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:03,059
I tried so hard to be good,
and all you did was yell.

453
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:08,356
I was so scared living under that roof,
doing whatever I could to make you happy.

454
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,614
All I wanted as a kid
was your attention and love.

455
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,004
That was all I wanted.

456
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,802
Once I got older, I realized
how ridiculous all that was.

457
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,141
I know why you devoted
so much of your life to the church.

458
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,059
You wanted oppa
to turn his life around, right?

459
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,562
Because I was always just an afterthought.

460
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,690
Don't pretend like I ever mattered to you.

461
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,192
I see.

462
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:55,653
I hear you.

463
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:59,782
Listen, In-a,
all that I want now is for us to--

464
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:02,285
Please, you're only here
because the world's ending.

465
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,923
I have nothing left to say.

466
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,136
You should leave.
I'll see you later if I can.

467
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,182
In-a! Stay! Don't go! In-a!

468
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,653
Ms. Kim? Ms. Kim?

469
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,031
I'm here. Where'd you go?

470
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,583
Anybody here? Anybody?

471
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:51,626
Grandma!

472
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,169
Ms. Kim!

473
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,338
Hey, Grandma!

474
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,633
Grandma, where are you?

475
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,054
-Grandma!
-Over here!

476
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,184
Ms. Kim! It's so cold out.

477
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,565
-Let's get some clothes on you.
-What took so long?

478
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,109
-Here.
-What are you doing out here?

479
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,111
-Your left arm.
-There you are. Come on.

480
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,863
Let's go quickly. Let's go.

481
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,907
Come on, Grandma.

482
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:27,495
You don't listen at all, huh?
I'll carry you out, okay?

483
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:29,664
Mmm.

484
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:50,268
Ugh, I'm hungry.

485
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,770
-I'm gonna leave.
-Hey, wait. No.

486
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:56,232
What? I'm outta here.

487
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,945
We gotta find Ha-yul
before you go. Come on.

488
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,657
-Hey! It's Ms. Jin.
-Huh?

489
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:18,796
Ms. Kim, why do you
keep doing this to us, hmm?

490
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,009
-Am I hurting you?
-Uh-huh.

491
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,052
So much. You're heavy!

492
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,807
There's already so much going on.

493
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:33,060
Hey, you know you're a handful, don't you?

494
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,398
You have some troubles?

495
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,446
A bunch of cockroaches are out again.

496
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:45,489
Crawling out of the sewers these days.

497
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,532
Mmm.

498
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,326
I already know.

499
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,162
Just killing one or two of them
won't solve the issue.

500
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,622
Hmm?

501
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:56,876
Well, you know,
you still have to kill 'em.

502
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,377
I wouldn't just let them be.

503
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:00,838
Hmm.

504
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,257
Everyone else tells me
I shouldn't do anything.

505
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:07,094
Apparently, if I try anything, I'll die.

506
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,597
Hmm.

507
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,891
-Don't die, please.
-Okay.

508
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:14,602
Oh. Not when you're so lovely.

509
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,354
Ah.

510
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,064
Oh.

511
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,067
Mmm.

512
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,380
-Hey! Ha-yul!
-Hey, Ha-yul!

513
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:48,469
-Where have you been?
-Seriously, where have you been?

514
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,805
We promised we'd be together
till the very end.

515
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:51,722
Mmm.

516
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,682
-We waited for you all day.
-Shall we?

517
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,357
Come on.

518
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,111
Why are you acting like this?

519
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,321
The asteroid's coming,
I'm pregnant, and you're not even happy!

520
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,533
There's a baby coming.
Of course I'm happy. Why wouldn't I be?

521
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,035
Oh, so you're happy, then?

522
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,330
How can you be happy
when I'm so miserable? You're the worst!

523
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:20,584
Ji-eun, stop! Can't you wait?
Hold it! Just stop! Hey, stop!

524
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:24,213
Ji-eun, Ji-eun, Ji-eun!
I just wanna be with you. Please? Ah!

525
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,590
Okay. Okay, please, did I… mess up?

526
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,300
I never meant to hurt you.

527
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:30,636
Ah, hey, hey, hey!

528
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:33,347
-Let go! I hate you!
-Ah, okay, okay!

529
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,224
-I will. Just don't get angry.
-Stay back!

530
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,559
Angry?

531
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,186
I've suffered with you long enough!

532
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,273
I've been miserable for ten years
with your crazy mother around,

533
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:45,818
always telling me what to do
as if I don't even matter at all!

534
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,864
Good God, I hate myself!

535
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,783
And now I'm pregnant,
and this stupid baby!

536
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:55,244
-What are we gonna do?
-Don't do that! We'll figure it out!

537
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,996
What did I do? It's all my fault!

538
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,832
Hey, no! Come on!
This isn't your fault at all, Ji-eun!

539
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,588
Don't get mad, okay?

540
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,591
It's not good for you.

541
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,219
Hmm?

542
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,055
Just die, you stupid…

543
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,975
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
How can you all just stand back watching?

544
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:19,518
-You're all ridiculous!
-Let go!

545
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:23,105
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Get off her! Come on! What is this?

546
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,858
What's wrong with you?
You should treat each other better!

547
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,526
What's going on this time, huh?

548
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,029
Oh, come on! Nothing to see here!

549
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,531
Get out! Go home!
Close your doors and go inside!

550
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,034
Just like last time! Oh, they're mad!

551
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:37,912
Oh, Hae-chan, Woo-chan,
no one's fighting here, okay?

552
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,248
Are you feeling any better now?

553
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,541
Mm-mm.

554
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,336
Hey! Offer yourself up to her.
It relieves stress, huh?

555
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:48,005
Here. You need to grab and twist it, okay?

556
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,049
Get him!

557
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,425
Kick his butt!

558
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,594
Now again! Yeah, now throw him.

559
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:57,473
There's nothing to look at here, folks.
Go on! Hey! Let's go! Get out of here!

560
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:58,891
Feeling better, Ji-eun?

561
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,603
You look a lot better now. That's good.

562
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:03,979
Wow, you look terrible.

563
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,656
Testing my patience.

564
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:16,075
Hae-chan, Woo-chan.
Let's go home.

565
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,250
Young-ji, move aside.
Move, Young-ji!

566
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,696
What is it?

567
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,367
I don't know what's wrong with him!

568
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,037
What's wrong with Young-han?

569
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,670
Oh please! You have to save Young-han!

570
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,551
Just let him pass peacefully.
It's gonna be okay.

571
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,550
I'm sorry! Forgive me!

572
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,012
Oh, come on. Here.

573
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,186
You explain yourself!

574
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,107
-Huh? Who are these people?
-Move it.

575
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,693
Sit down.

576
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,155
What happened?

577
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:02,199
You. Read this.

578
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,785
Hurry up and find her.

579
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:07,996
I want his daughter now.

580
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:12,793
AGREEMENT
I HAVE RECEIVED A LOAN OF 800 MILLION WON

581
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,087
Make sure you search
all the rooms up there.

582
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:20,300
I, JEONG SU-GEUN, WAIVE MY RIGHTS
TO MY BODY AND THAT OF MY DAUGHTER

583
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:23,637
Unbelievable.

584
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,014
You! Are you even human?

585
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,684
She's your daughter!
How could you do this to us?

586
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,019
What's gonna happen to her?

587
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:34,440
You can't give my daughter away!
You can't! She's my…

588
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:38,944
Get out! Get out of my life,
and don't come back here!

589
00:45:39,027 --> 00:45:41,572
Go and kill yourself!

590
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,588
FEBRUARY 22, 2026
A PLACE WITHOUT HOPE IS HELL

591
00:46:34,374 --> 00:46:37,127
BYE, YOUNG-HAN, SEE YOU SOON
YOUNG-HAN, HAVE FUN WITH TAE-MI

592
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,217
Hey, let's go.

593
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,469
Let's wait for Ha-yul.

594
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:17,501
"We now bury the bodies
of our brothers and sisters

595
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:20,462
according to the customs
of our Heavenly Father."

596
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:25,509
"Dear Lord, we pray today,
as did the saints,

597
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:30,806
that you will bring these souls
into resurrection unto you

598
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:34,184
and allow them all to rejoice
in the company of saints."

599
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,104
"Please have mercy in their judgment

600
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:40,816
and deliver them
from the bonds of death and sin

601
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:43,068
so that they may reconcile
with the Father."

602
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:46,363
"Let these souls follow you,
their kind shepherd,

603
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:48,824
for you are their eternal king."

604
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:52,452
"We pray that they join you
and your saints with everlasting joy

605
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,414
embraced by the kingdom of heaven."

606
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,598
Jeong Ha-yul, come out!

607
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,182
Ha-yul!

608
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:15,767
Who are you?

609
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,445
Stand back!

610
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:29,031
Where's the priest?
Is there a priest in here?

611
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,825
Hey, Father?

612
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,332
I want a priest.

613
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,583
Sister.

614
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:41,960
Please leave immediately.

615
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,629
We're in the middle of a mass.

616
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:45,255
-Oh!
-Leave. Right now.

617
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,591
Am I interrupting?

618
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,301
What business do you have with the church?

619
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,221
-Stop these guys!
-Get her!

620
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,182
Find Ha-yul!

621
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,975
Over there! Over there!

622
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:58,226
Hey, that's her!

623
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,395
Stop it! No, no, no.

624
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,857
Get down. Let's hide. We'll stay here.

625
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,549
Ms. Jin.

626
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:12,718
Ms. Jin.

627
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,364
Come on! Hurry!

628
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,127
You get your hands off of-- Let me go!

629
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:18,658
In-a.

630
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,660
In-a.

631
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,206
Do you even realize what you've done?

632
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:26,792
Ha-yul.

633
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:30,879
Ha-yul needed me, so…

634
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:32,964
You still shouldn't have.

635
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:45,352
Where did you get the gun?

636
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:47,938
Who cares?

637
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:51,483
What's done has been done.

638
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:57,948
I guess you're right.

639
00:51:58,532 --> 00:51:59,741
It doesn't matter.

640
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,247
Oh God.

641
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:08,500
I must've… I just… I couldn't think.

642
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,130
A murderer.

643
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:19,094
I just… I just really love her.

644
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,107
You rest, all right?

645
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:36,987
The gun?

646
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:39,406
Oh, right.

647
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,553
Take her home.

648
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,514
And don't let her leave.

649
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,560
-Yeah.
-I'll keep everybody quiet.

650
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:35,420
You're okay.

651
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,759
You're safe.

652
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,262
I love you.
