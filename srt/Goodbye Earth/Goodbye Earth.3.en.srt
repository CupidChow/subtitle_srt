Sit down.

14
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,927
Why are you so thin?

15
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,764
I mean, look at you. You must be hungry.

16
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:41,893
The soldiers gave me
rice and soup earlier.

17
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:42,811
Hmm?

18
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,523
Uh, they ran a background check too.

19
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,652
All those guys seemed
to be curious about me.

20
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,161
Ah, you're so tired. Just wait,
and I'll get you something to eat.

21
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,413
-No, don't do that. No, I…
-Yeah? Yeah, relax.

22
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,790
I'll just put something together.

23
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,959
-I should…
-Uh, what'll I make?

24
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,044
Just rest there, okay?

25
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,507
All right.

26
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,802
Let's drink something that's warm.
That would be best.

27
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,762
I have so many things to ask you.

28
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,600
But you should get some sleep first.

29
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:26,563
Then…

30
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,149
Okay, I can use these.

31
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,734
Yun-sang, there's, uh…

32
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,813
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

33
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,733
What is it?

34
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,906
Oh, you must be hot. Let's take these off.

35
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,325
All right? Here, it's okay.

36
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,690
Just what happened to you over there?

00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,065
Just a few more left to go.

40
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,707
As the coup,
led by a few military generals,

41
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:36,919
has intensified into a civil war,
the damage inflicted has risen sharply.

42
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,214
During a battle, a malfunction
in the capital's defense system

43
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,133
caused missiles to be launched,

44
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,428
and the country's largest data center
in Woongcheon was completely destroyed.

45
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,972
Various online services
have come to a stop,

46
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,183
and general communication is unstable.

47
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,227
Over here, Doctor! She needs help!

48
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,606
Hang on. Doctor, she needs help!

49
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:57,815
-Please!
-Help!

50
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:59,776
Hey, Ji-eun. Can you hear me?

51
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:03,154
-Just wait a moment. I'll get a doctor.
-Excuse me. Have you seen my mom?

52
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,698
-I'm sorry. Excuse me.
-Please. We can't find her. Can you help?

53
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,298
We can't find our mom! Please help!

54
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,927
Let's get out of here!

55
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,095
-Over there!
-Their mom.

56
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,020
Hey!

57
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,689
With the delay
in the government's announcement

58
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,817
regarding their plan
for the asteroid collision,

59
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,652
protests are turning into riots.

60
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,861
Looting and arson have begun…

61
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,781
They're stealing everything.
They're probably looting our store too.

62
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,616
-No, no, no, don't go, please!
-Hey!

63
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,993
…peace rally
at Woongcheon City Hall took place…

64
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,912
Let's just be thankful
we're not hurt.

65
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,373
During the rally,
unidentified rioters appeared…

66
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,917
Look at all these people.

67
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,461
Mom, things are weird here.

68
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,754
I'm scared.

69
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,091
But don't worry, I'm hiding with friends.

70
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,469
Remember, Mom,

71
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,930
you're Wonder Woman, and I'm Superman.

72
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,433
They're dragging my friends away.

73
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,519
Mom, these people aren't soldiers.

74
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:17,854
Oh, please.

75
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,814
-What's wrong?
-Oh boy.

76
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:23,526
Just where is he at?

77
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:26,070
-What is it? Huh?
-Huh?

78
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,656
Something must have happened.

79
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,286
Don't go! Mi-ryeong!

80
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,330
198 DAYS UNTIL ASTEROID COLLISION

81
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,291
-Unni! Unni!
-Oh.

82
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,668
I, uh, have a visitor at home,

83
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,962
and I don't have any food left.

84
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:25,880
What's that?

85
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,635
Yun-sang is back?

86
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,471
Oh! Ah! Oh, Se-kyung!

87
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,348
Oh!

88
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,933
That's such great news.

89
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,893
-Mm-hmm.
-Thank goodness, Se-kyung.

90
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,146
All right. Just… Okay, uh…

91
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,898
-I'll put together some supplies, then.
-Uh…

92
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,484
-I'll bring it later. Go, go!
-Oh. I owe you.

93
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,110
-Unni, thanks!
-Okay!

94
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:51,822
That's great.

95
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,121
Together till the end.

96
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,548
Yun-sang's here.

97
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,132
What?

98
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,467
Yun-sang came home.

99
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,386
What?

100
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,346
He's sleeping, so don't wake him up!

101
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,057
Seriously?

102
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,685
PALE BLUE DOT
COSMOS

103
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,980
Finally done reading.

104
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,775
Seriously? You read all of that?

105
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:33,489
I think I now have a vague idea
of what my dad's thinking.

106
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,826
What do you mean? Huh?

107
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,162
What about your mom? Do you resent her?

108
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,873
She ran off and left you,
just like my dad.

109
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,336
-Have you forgiven her?
-It's not an issue of forgiveness.

110
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,339
Actually, it's more like a garden,
you know?

111
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,593
How can you get mad at a flower
for not blooming in the fall?

112
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,469
Yeah, that's a good analogy.

113
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,432
Yeah. I don't even know
if my mom's alive, so I feel that way too.

114
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,184
Are you doing okay?

115
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,189
-What?
-You thought you were evacuating.

116
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,485
Well, uh, I think there are times
when I get angry,

117
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,946
but I'm okay with it now.

118
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,741
It also helps that we're all gonna die.

119
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:19,660
So you're beyond it, then?

120
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,580
Yeah, transcended or something, you know?

121
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,416
Oh.

122
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,209
-Hey, So-min.
-Hmm?

123
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,794
-Come here. Let me see.
-What?

124
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,755
-Your arm.
-What about my arm?

125
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,089
Blue butterfly.

126
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,001
Yun-sang.

127
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,796
Ha Yun-sang. Sleeping?

128
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:39,717
Hey, uh…

129
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,344
Hello? Ha Yun-sang.

130
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,222
-What are you doing?
-Oh! Uh, it's you.

131
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,017
-Oh! Just a minute.
-What about Yun-sang, then?

132
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,602
You've seen Yun-sang?

133
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,813
Not yet. Se-kyung asked me
to drop off some food and supplies.

134
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,190
Ah, uh, ah, ah!

135
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,276
It's really true?

136
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:58,277
Yeah, he's back.

137
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,487
I can't believe this.

138
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,781
Let's go then. Wait, what are you--

139
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,407
-Oh, I'm so sorry.
-Seriously?

140
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:06,035
-I think so. Hello.
-Oh, hi. How's it going?

141
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,703
-Is Ms. Jin still in there?
-Let's say hi.

142
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,538
-Are you there?
-Ms. Jin.

143
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,665
Seems like she already went to work.

144
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,209
All right, let's head out.

145
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,836
-I need to give Yun-sang his food.
-Yun… He, um…

146
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,963
-Yun-sang's back?
-Uh, Yun…

147
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,673
-I just meant…
-Okay, okay. Sh!

148
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:20,674
-Hello.
-Hey!

149
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,592
Hi there.

150
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,052
Hi!

151
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,897
Ah! Look at all these guys.
How did they all sleep in one unit?

152
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,816
Oh, hey! Jin-seo.

153
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,485
Isn't your apartment
the same size as mine?

154
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:40,528
I think so.

155
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:44,573
Hey! Uh, sir.
You can't put those things there.

156
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,408
We all share the main entrance!

157
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,122
Mr. Park?

158
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,000
Mr. Park? You see that?
That stuff right there.

159
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,920
I will be leaving now.

160
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,421
Hey, you can't do this!

161
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,673
♪ Though the asteroid… ♪

162
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,092
Why would you put that
in the front entrance?

163
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,886
♪ All you gotta do
Is approach the light… ♪

164
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,180
So sorry there, ma'am.

165
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,432
I hope it wasn't
terribly loud in there last night.

166
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,269
You should be glad
I'm not calling the cops.

167
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,146
Sorry about that.
I'll move it for you now.

168
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,817

169
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,448
Is it not possible there either?

170
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:28,909
Understood, sir.

171
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,582
We tried to get the supply,
but it's blocked.

172
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:37,793
We came back empty-handed.
This one feels above my pay grade.

173
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,796
Captain, I think you should take a look.

174
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:42,923
Okay, thanks.

00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,078
That you, kitty?

177
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,295
What is wrong?
What's wrong, Corporal Pang?

178
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,589
-What is it?
-What is going on?

179
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,508
Right there!
You see these chickens?

180
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,218
-Look at that.
-Chickens!

181
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,304
They're eating the peppers. Stop them!
We can't afford to lose the peppers!

182
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,099
-Hey, get outta here!
-You gotta be kidding me!

183
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,522
-Why is that one so big?
-Uh, ma'am? Ma'am?

184
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,857
What do we do here?
Shouldn't we chase them out?

185
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,693
-Sh!
-Never a dull moment.

186
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,112
Given the situation,

187
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,114
shouldn't we just make
chicken soup out of these?

188
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,950
-Let's make fried chicken.
-Yeah! Fried chicken.

189
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,660
Yeah.

190
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,706
-Okay.
-No! Stop it!

191
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,707
Okay.

192
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,750
Guys. Guys.

193
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:42,835
Yeah?

194
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,923
Let's show them proper courtesy.

195
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,300
-Huh? What?
-I'm saying just be kind!

196
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,388
-What?
-Ma'am?

197
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,349
What's the point
of an arms inspection

198
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,018
when we don't even have any bullets.

199
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,103
-Oh.
-Please manage the firearms.

200
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,938
Yes, ma'am.

201
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:05,983
Captain!

202
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,318
Captain!

203
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,195
Captain!

204
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,280
What is it?

205
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,364
Question!

206
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,492
How does chicken sound? The chickens.

207
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,286
Please let me make them.

208
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,164
-We're having chicken today?
-Chicken? Seriously?

209
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,750
-I love meat!
-Can you elaborate a little bit more?

210
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,711
They're alive, so it's like, uh…

211
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,174
-We got live chickens.
-Enough of that.

212
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,801
Any meat's fine. Do what you had in mind.

213
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,387
Thank you so much, then.

214
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:36,972
Uh, I'll be back.

215
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,724
Good day.

216
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,892
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE

217
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,685
Excuse me.

218
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,771
This is the list of people
waiting to be discharged?

219
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,856
-That's correct.
-Sergeant.

220
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,734
-Sir.
-Hello.

221
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,444
I have news to report.

222
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:51,987
Proceed.

223
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,364
Well, I wanna make something.

224
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:59,203
Corporal Pang mentioned something about
plywood, so, uh, what are you building?

225
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,205
Ah! Yeah, a chicken coop!

226
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,000
-A coop?
-A flock of chickens came.

227
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,377
Yeah, I gave it some thought.

228
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,921
Let's put them together, yeah?

229
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,173
In a nice, cozy home
where they can breed together.

230
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,591
I mean, it's just perfect.

231
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,135
They'll appreciate it,
and the hens will want to lay some eggs.

232
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,721
Now, this is important, Sergeant.
Make sure you're listening here.

233
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,557
More than just having eggs,
there'll also be chicks.

234
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,476
Eggs will hatch chickens, you see.

235
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,770
The more chicks, the better,
don't ya think?

236
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,315
So then, we'll have a self-sustaining
protein source for the officers.

237
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,192
Wouldn't that be super? So many eggs!

238
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,945
'Cause two will be four--
No, eight! I'll do the math.

239
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,571
Mm-hmm.

240
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,449
Have you talked to
Captain Kang about this?

241
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:38,408
Of course I did.

242
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,661
So would, uh,
three or four guys be enough?

243
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:41,578
Should be plenty.

244
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,957
-Oh, I'll put in the order.
-Good day.

245
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,417
Thanks for your time.

246
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,925
That was asked for very awkwardly.

247
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,266
198 DAYS LEFT
TOGETHER TO THE END

248
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,978
All that we're asking
is for you to report back

249
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,730
that the central government
is working very hard

250
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,983
to safely evacuate our citizens.

251
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,359
That is all.

252
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,902
That's it?

253
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,574
Prime Minister!

254
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:23,078
With all due respect, sir.
What good is that?

255
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,456
That's Im Seon-ju,
deputy mayor of Woongcheon.

256
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,251
The people know that the rich
and powerful have all left,

257
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,878
but the working class is still here,

258
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,630
with their neighborhoods now filled
with gang violence.

259
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,924
Do only the wealthy
deserve safety and peace of mind?

260
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:39,386
Who are we supposed to take
to the safety zones first, then?

261
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,848
We have to know at least
how many people will be going

262
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,016
and when they can go!

263
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,270
Plus, these families need our help.
They have no jobs and nowhere to go.

264
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,981
I see my own neighborhood suffering.

265
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:54,484
These thugs do horrible things,
and they're going after our children.

266
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:59,323
Tell me, what good does repeating all of
these empty platitudes do for any of them?

267
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,492
How do you expect some empty words
to do anything at all?

268
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,994
Hello. Hello.

269
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:06,455
-It's really hot today, isn't it?
-I understand your concerns…

270
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,040
I'll have them check on it.

271
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,418
-Excuse me!
-Even the president is gone!

272
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,378
Se-kyung, Se-kyung, Se-kyung!

273
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,297
We're definitely all going to die
at this rate!

274
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,215
Look at that!

275
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,551
How can he be so irresponsible
to not have any kind of plan?

276
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,178
The deputy mayor is so much better.

277
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:27,601
Oh yeah. No wonder brokers
are running wild over here

278
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,103
as kids are kidnapped and imprisoned.

279
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,147
Oh, these politicians.

280
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,154
What are they supposed to do?
It's not like there are any solutions.

281
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,573
If only we could go to China, you know?

282
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,784
Yeah. China's a huge country though.

283
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,662
And I hear they're about
to close all their borders, huh?

284
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,498
-Hello! I got some squid today.
-How's it going?

285
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:54,920
What?

286
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,630
Just this one box?

287
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,216
Yeah. I almost wasn't able
to get even that.

288
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:01,718
Why did you even go, then?

289
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,931
Think about the gas money just wasted
getting that little box.

290
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,225
Hey! Hang on.

291
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,726
Where do you think you're going?

292
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,649
Hey! Don't you dare! Stop! Stop! Stop!

293
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,858
Where are you going?

294
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,610
Stop the car now!

295
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,281
Jerk!

296
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,370
Of all the guys I could've married. Ugh.

297
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,582
Have you heard? The bunker thing.

298
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,668
-That's happening today, isn't it?
-Mmm.

299
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,670
You know, my mom will be there.

300
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,422
And my dad too.

301
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:40,966
Oh.

302
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,386
It's a scam, Mom.
Why are you going?

303
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,851
Ah, don't worry.
You know it's mostly for the kids, so…

304
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,104
Can't you see
it's obviously a scam? Don't go.

305
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:57,316
Hold it. Hey! Hey!

306
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,780
I don't know where she could've gotten
such a temper like that. Unbelievable.

307
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:06,908
I, uh…

308
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,994
Hae-chan, you know that's not me.

309
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,913
I know, I know.

310
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,959
You know I'm not actually angry at all.
You know I wasn't even yelling.

311
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:20,255
Oh. Woo-chan, why don't we get going
so we're not late to the event?

312
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,882
-Okay.
-Okay. Let's head out.

313
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,886
Downtown's better though.
Let's sell there.

314
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,555
It's not like we'll find customers here.

315
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,474
It can't be helped.

316
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,434
Downtown is too dangerous,

317
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,103
and Bae Jong-su's crew
is probably insane right now.

318
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:36,104
They want revenge.

319
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,567
We should really have
some guns on us right now.

320
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,366
Everyone!
Eternal life is science, not a religion.

321
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,701
Don't you be fooled!
It's what it's all about.

322
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:52,788
Yeah, yeah, we get it.
Now get out of the way, huh?

323
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,206
You're blocking other people here.

324
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:57,042
Do you think that we should have
all of our rights taken away?

325
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,336
This isn't the way
to get your point across.

326
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,464
-We have rights, you know?
-Here. Take care of yourself, all right?

327
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,132
These lowlifes are all bullshit. Come on.

328
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,885
-Eternal life, my ass!
-I want him out of here now!

329
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,261
Let's clear 'em all out!

330
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,513
Listen here!

331
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,727
-I'm sharing the truth!
-Yeah, throw 'em all in jail!

332
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:17,938
Wow! It's such a big sea.

333
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,941
-Amazing!
-Amazing, wow!

334
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,485
-A big ocean, huh?
-And you can explore it.

335
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,820
Okay. Right.

336
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,071
Wow!

337
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,948
-Try it on. Try it.
-Have a good time.

338
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,741
-Put it on! Do it!
-Now, we should…

339
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,076
-All done?
-Yup.

340
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,536
Let's go see something else.

341
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,997
-I can touch things! That's cool!
-Hey, I got it! It's this way.

342
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,708
-Whoa! Over there, over there!
-Whoa!

343
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,794
So amazing!

344
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,591
Uh, you think
we'll really be safe in this?

345
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,177
Woo-chan, let's go.

346
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:52,514
Hello! On behalf of Toit-Technology,
I welcome you.

347
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,851
Today, we have a presentation.
A life-changing floating bunker!

348
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,352
So hello, and let us begin!

349
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,817
Since you all took time
from your busy schedules,

350
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,193
I'll get started right away.

351
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,573
Take a look. Our greatest model yet!

352
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,663
That's right!
This design can ride the waves!

353
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,373
Floating in peace.

354
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,793
Even if a huge old tsunami
comes down like, whoa,

355
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,462
you can survive for up to two months.

356
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:26,089
This cutting-edge, ultra-strong material!

357
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,883
Two months is a long time,
but not to worry!

358
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,760
-It's got a satellite connection…
-Are you hearing this, huh?

359
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:34,764
So, yup, you can even cook in the bunker.
Do you live alone? Then a bunker for one.

360
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,684
Or you! Are you married?
Or perhaps you have siblings!

361
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,144
You can get two!

362
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,106
We can also get you bunkers
that fit up to five.

363
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,608
Toittech's bunkers are world-class!

364
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,818
The pros love our bunkers
'cause they're one of a kind!

365
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,320
We even tested twice in the ocean!

366
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,280
Two professional surfers
gave their approval!

367
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,658
Yeah!

368
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,244
Okay.

369
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,415
Let's be honest
with ourselves today. Uh, yeah.

370
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,127
Tell me. Why did we have a civil war?

371
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,546
What do ya think? Huh?

372
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,841
I'll tell ya why, okay! Eh?

373
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,302
It's easy!

374
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:14,554
The powerful took
all of the transportation options

375
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,640
and just up and left all of us behind!

376
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,891
What else?

377
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,060
Why are we so short on supplies, huh?

378
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:21,895
Where are all of the goods?

379
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,272
The rich are hogging everything
for themselves

380
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,900
and condemning the rest of us to die!

381
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,027
-They are!
-Yeah. They are.

382
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:32,405
Uh, what can be done? My…

383
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:35,909
Okay. What's the point of having a phone
when there's no service?

384
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,078
You can drop that all day long.
It's not like it works.

385
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:41,164
Rich people don't have to suffer
these inconveniences

386
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:43,083
because when they use the Internet,

387
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,125
what do you know?

388
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,378
They have access to satellites!

389
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:49,756
We've all heard those rumors about
secret bunkers and underground cities.

390
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,551
Oh, they're very real.
It's not some sci-fi movie.

391
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,929
They want you to think
that it's a bunch of nonsense.

392
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,389
To just wait and die.

393
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,266
We can't let that happen, can we?

394
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,352
Yeah!

395
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,276
Enough already. Just get to the point.

396
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,738
We all have a choice today.

397
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,328
Are you gonna stay a sheep?

398
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,164
Or will you rise up for what's right?

399
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,001
You have to use your brain.

400
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,423
Oh, sorry about that, folks.

401
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,302
Got distracted for a second there.

402
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,595
So, as I was saying,

403
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,764
our company can only produce
a certain number of bunkers.

404
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:41,182
So what does that mean?

405
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,436
That there's not a lot of time to waste.

406
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,271
Shall we bring out the forms now?

407
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,525
They're only accepting
US dollars and gold.

408
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,236
Wow, the down payment
on this is really high.

409
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:57,657
…but there's the down payment, of course.

410
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,702
You must submit your first payment
within two days

411
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,953
through the specified methods.

412
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,497
We will start now.
First-come, first-served.

413
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,750
Only 50 orders will be accepted!

414
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,628
-Just 50?
-Yeah!

415
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,672
Hey, sir, the down--
This down payment is crazy!

416
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,883
It's a lot for us,
but you act like it's nothing.

417
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,843
Can't you give us a little time
to think on it?

418
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,514
-I'm not forcing ya, am I?
-I'll put my order in!

419
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,311
Hear me! Do not believe this lie!

420
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,521
You're just hurting them all!

421
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,941
The asteroid collision
is the beginning of eternal life!

422
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,660
You're trespassing!

423
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,870
-Block the entrance!
-You can't be in here! Hey!

424
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,246
Let's go.

425
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:49,376
Hey, Jeong, are we sure we can trust him?
These bunkers cost a lot.

426
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,045
It is weird they're demanding
a deposit right away.

427
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,340
Hey, I told you to think it over first.

428
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,218
-It's not like anything's due today.
-How do you know this'll even work?

429
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:02,347
The asteroid collision
is the beginning of eternal life.

430
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:05,850
Everyone! Don't listen to this liar
and waste your money!

431
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,062
Listen to me!
You need to free yourself from lies!

432
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,980
How dare you spew this nonsense!

433
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,191
All you lunatics,
shut up and leave already.

434
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,984
Show some respect, man!

435
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:21,116
-There is no doubt!
-Get these hooligans!

436
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,785
Everyone! Don't let these people fool you!

437
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,453
Don't have any doubt!

438
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,122
Our future is waiting for us!

439
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:30,333
Listen up! Don't you doubt at all!

440
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,128
A new, inextinguishable sun is burning!

441
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:36,214
Don't let yourself be deceived!
Don't doubt at all!

442
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:40,468
Everyone! You must not doubt!
Everyone! Do not doubt!

443
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,179
Eternal life!
All I am asking for is your faith!

444
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,316
Zero-five-two…

445
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,521
Ha Yun-sang!

446
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,106
You're back!

447
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:36,983
Hyung!

448
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,694
How did you get here, huh?

449
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,113
You like over there, huh?

450
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:45,241
Is the US under martial law too?
Huh? Yun-sang.

451
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,455
Are there really shelters and bunkers
in the US?

452
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,791
Do you think it's safer over there? Huh?

453
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:00,465
Hey…
…do you really still have this picture?

454
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,052
Wow! You have a lot of stuff, don't you?

455
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,474
Need help?

456
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,143
Where have you been all these months, huh?

457
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,896
Do you know how worried we were?
We thought something happened to you.

458
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,731
-You can't just ghost us like that…
-Hyung!

459
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,652
Whoa!

460
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,240
I didn't think it'd rain.

461
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,703
Ah, it's so nice.

462
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:36,543
All these idiots
punching us like animals.

463
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:37,752
Despicable.

464
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:42,632
You watch your back.

465
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:45,218
The leader of that pack seems
to be your friend's dad.

466
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:48,137
You used to say
he was one of the best financial analysts.

467
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,014
You don't know what you're talking about.

468
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,727
I'm warning you. Stay away from his son.
You hear me, Ha-yul?

469
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:58,606
Oh please! You're both terrible people.
And if anything, you're much worse, Dad.

470
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:05,572
-Okay. These all belong to you.
-Mom.

471
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,907
-Woo-chan!
-Are you seriously going later?

472
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:08,867
That's yours.

473
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,827
They clearly just want
your money, you know?

474
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,123
Oh yeah?

475
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,916
You know everything about it, huh?

476
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,628
I'm trying to save you and the kids.
Try to understand.

477
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,214
I'm bending over backwards for us here.
Can't you understand, hmm?

478
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,799
Did you seriously say that?

479
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,260
Who even says
"bending over backwards" these days?

480
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,219
Watch it, hey!

481
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,139
It's naive to think that
you can do anything about the asteroid.

482
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,975
Oh yeah.

483
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,520
I'm sure your poor mother is an idiot
and doesn't know anything.

484
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:41,065
-Noona, where's mom's picture?
-You and I need to talk.

485
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,775
I can't find it anywhere.

486
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,847
Open! Open this fucking door!

487
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,060
Yun-sang. Yun-sang! Ha Yun-sang!

488
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,980
Se-kyung, go to the priest!
Go to Father Baek!

489
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,856
Hold still!

490
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,150
Fucking walk. Now!

491
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,572
No sudden movements.

492
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,992
Where is it?

493
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,664
The hostage is bleeding.
Still hasn't talked.

494
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,855
Just leave your bike here,
and let's go out and get a drink.

495
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,024
-Come on. It's D-200 today!
-I just…

496
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,026
-I'm sorry. I'll see you tomorrow.
-All right.

497
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,194
-Are you--
-She probably has other plans.

498
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,821
Stop bugging her. Come on.

499
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:54,323
You're gonna wish you
went out with us, Se-kyung.

500
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,160
Take care, and good job today.
Drive safely now.

501
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,953
Have a good one.

502
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,872
-Se-kyung!
-Yeah?

503
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,916
-You're gonna regret this!
-All right, bye.

504
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:08,755
Huh?

505
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,924
Where's my bike? I thought I left it…

506
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,594
Hmm?

507
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:27,959
JUST YOU WAIT
I'LL MAKE THINGS FUN FOR YOU

508
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,855
Sorry I'm a little… late today.

509
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,065
I did
a little cleaning for you.

510
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,651
You don't need to work so hard, you know?

511
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:36,611
Hmm.

512
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,906
After I woke up, I felt pretty good.

513
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,326
Ah! So energized! Yeah.

514
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,538
But you know, Se-kyung…

515
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,543
I'm so at ease every time you're around.

516
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,506
Hold on a sec, okay?

517
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,092
Let me change my clothes first.
It won't take long.

518
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,012
-Only a second, okay?
-All right.

519
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,666
-You didn't…
-Huh? Oh, changing was a hassle.

520
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,295
What's this? Can I open it?

521
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,256
Of course you can.

522
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:42,426
-Coffee. Whole beans.
-Oh, they're nice beans.

523
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,178
Smells pretty good, huh?

524
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,270
Thank you, thank you.

525
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,107
This is so amazing.

526
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,113
I want some. I don't think
I can wait until tomorrow.

527
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,197
Thank you. Come on.

528
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:05,992
What?

529
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:23,759
Can I stay the night?

530
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,471
Of course you can.

531
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:42,903
Mmm. Mmm.

532
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,326
Yeah.

533
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,119
Yeah.

534
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,912
-Oh, uh…
-Hmm?

535
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,374
About the laundry… I saw your, uh…

536
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,834
You had this, uh, thing.

537
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,592
-Um…
-Uh, it's a big, empty bottle.

538
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:09,805
Uh, you know, I took it to…
over to the riots with all the bodies.

539
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,476
And then I went and spilled it too.

540
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,144
Hmm.

541
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,229
That's funny. Why is that there?

542
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,774
-Uh, Se-kyung, hey.
-Huh?

543
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,447
You don't have to tell me
if it's difficult.

544
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,243
You can wait till… till you're ready.

545
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:35,873
Let's take this slow.

546
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:37,625
Hmm?

547
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:39,835
Okay.

548
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,007
Ah!

549
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:47,093
My turn.

550
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,775
You're out early.

551
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,068
Good morning.

552
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,320
The roosters are crowing. Hmm.

553
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,155
-Good morning.
-Oh, hello.

554
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,660
So, uh… did you all hear?

555
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,954
What? What's up? Any news to share at all?

556
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,915
He's always so slow with this stuff.

557
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,000
A certain someone came back.

558
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:23,337
Uh…

559
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:26,841
Yeah, okay. Who actually
wants to come back to ground zero?

560
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,969
Ah, that's not what's important, okay?

561
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,472
The fact that someone was able to return.
What do you think that means?

562
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:36,142
Oh, that they're just nuts to wanna come.

563
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,727
How could anyone wanna
come back here, huh?

564
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,772
Hold on! Are you saying
we can still leave Korea?

565
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,900
Just some people. Selective migration.

566
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,489
Where did you hear that?

567
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,407
Wait, who's back?

568
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:54,368
How do you get chosen for
selective migration? Where do I sign up?

569
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,537
It's Yun-sang.

570
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,998
-There's gotta be a website…
-Oh, that's…

571
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:02,042
Keep ignoring me,
and your little cousins will get hurt.

572
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,169
Are you ready?

573
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,339
Okay. Here we go.

574
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,592
One.

575
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,094
Two. Start.

576
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,971
Two.

577
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,055
Three.

578
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,100
Okay, let's start it again.

579
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:19,685
And yeah!

580
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:20,728
One.

581
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,647
Okay, start again.

582
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,525
Huh? Oh, that smells good.

583
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,570
Hey, Woo-chan! Where are you going?

584
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:35,242
Oh, Woo-chan. Come in.

585
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,411
Let's wash up. There you are.

586
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,830
There. Okay.

587
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,000
-All done?
-Yeah.

588
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,252
Oh. Uh, wipe 'em.

589
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:46,962
Wipe 'em.

590
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,673
-Wash your hands.
-Oh, wow.

591
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,926
Okay, you're right.

592
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,262
Where's So-min?

593
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,723
I don't know. She didn't come up?

594
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,893
Uh… I don't think so.

595
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:05,189
Due to the delay
in the repair of communication facilities

596
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:08,025
that were destroyed
during the asteroid crisis,

597
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:10,694
inconveniences are expected to continue.

598
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:14,323
Woongcheon City is doing its utmost
to create a plan for the migration of…

599
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:16,909
Uh, excuse me. Is Ms. Jin here?

600
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,702
She was just here a minute ago.

601
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,127
Can you hear me? Ms. Jin! Ms.--

602
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,942
-Ms. Jin.
-Huh?

603
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:51,485
So-min.

604
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,238
Didn't I tell you not to come here? Huh?

605
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:55,573
Go home.

606
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,533
I have something to tell you.

607
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:58,909
What is it?

608
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:00,744
Um…

609
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,665
Um, Bae Jong-su may be dead,

610
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,585
but… others were working with him.

611
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,921
I know. A lot are involved.

612
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,090
We know they're watching us.

613
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,758
I'm worried about the kids too.

614
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,844
Woo-chan and Hae-chan are so little.

615
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,012
Huh?

616
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,395
SHOULD I LET THE MANAGERS KNOW
WHERE YOU LIVE?

617
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,356
You should be careful too.

618
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,609
I'm even more worried now
that Bae Jong-su is dead.

619
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,028
I think there's gonna be trouble.

620
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,325
Did you, uh, come all the way here
just to tell me that?

621
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,043
How long till they arrive?

622
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,753
They should all be here soon!

623
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,212
Oh, the oil is hot.

624
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,839
We need the beer too.

625
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:56,383
Okay, the beer has now arrived!

626
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,594
Wow!
How were you able to get that?

627
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,804
-I was lucky. That's how.
-Thank you.

628
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:03,557
Ah! Yeah! Ha Yun-sang!

629
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,101
In-a! It's good to see you!

630
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,524
-Yun-sang!
-Noona!

631
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,236
Oh my goodness!

632
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,864
-You doing okay?
-Just butterflies.

633
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:23,243
-Who is this?
-Yeah, I'll get us a seat here.

634
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,288
-Oh! Wow, look at that!
-Can't wait to eat!

635
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,498
-What a feast!
-Great.

636
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,583
It doesn't matter. Sit anywhere.

637
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:33,045
And then… they came in yelling, so I said,

638
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:36,882
"Don't hurt me 'cause I have
a really, really important key."

639
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,720
A total bluff, of course.

640
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:50,771
How could a low-level researcher
have anything that important?

641
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:51,897
Oh, Yun-sang…

642
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,442
Yet, somehow, I persuaded everyone

643
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,904
to let me go
and take a military plane home.

644
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,825
So they took me to Japan first.

645
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,537
I kept thinking to myself…

646
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:08,747
Thanks, buddy.

647
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,708
…"I'm all alone here at the airport."

648
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:13,210
I'm nothing but a refugee.

649
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,548
I can't believe this is real.

650
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,552
I didn't know what to do.

651
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:26,849
At least you're finally here now.
It has been quite the odyssey, huh?

652
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:30,728
You really
went through a lot, Yun-sang.

653
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,235
There's no need for applause.

654
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,738
-This deserves an applause!
-Yay!

655
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,240
You two should get married.

656
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:44,450
-Huh?
-Huh?

657
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,618
We must have a wedding!

658
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:47,745
The world may be ending,

659
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,164
but we still need to celebrate,
no matter what.

660
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,500
Okay?

661
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,962
-What do you think?
-Let's do it!

662
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,756
-Come on!
-Shall we?

663
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:05,596
Not again.

664
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,849
Oh, come on!
Why do they gotta do this now?

665
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,267
Let's turn this off.

666
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,103
-Yeah, yeah, don't worry.
-You okay?

667
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,272
-We have a lot of candles too.
-Mmm.

668
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:19,109
-Excuse me! Your uninvited guest is here!
-Oh!

669
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,445
-Come on in!
-Uninvited guest?

670
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:25,824
-Who said that?
-Who do you think? Right here.

671
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:26,909
-This looks good.
-Father.

672
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:29,453
-Huh?
-I took these from the church fridge.

673
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:31,538
-Is that all right?
-Oh, that's perfectly fine by me.

674
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,546
If Father Baek were here with us,
I bet he'd love this sight.

675
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,050
I miss him.

676
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:52,684
All right. So, uh, do you two plan
on getting married soon?

677
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,144
Just do it now!

678
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,480
I'm sure Father would be happy
to officiate.

679
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:58,649
What, me?
Officiate Yun-sang and Se-kyung's--

680
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:00,025
Ah, hold up, hold up.

681
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:01,860
What?

682
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,655
See? Yun-sang's teasing you.
You have to do it.

683
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:07,366
Well, his hard "no"
makes me wanna do it more.

684
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:09,993
-It has to be you!
-I guess I'm officiating!

685
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:13,121
Something came up with the team,
so, uh, I gotta drop by real quick.

686
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,206
Enjoy yourself.

687
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,291
-I'll be back.
-All right, see you later!

688
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,918
-Your debut!
-I guess I'm marrying them.

689
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,003
Can I talk to you for a sec?
Real quick.

690
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:21,547
Oh yeah!

691
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,881
Let's just do it now.

692
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,633
-I'll go talk to her.
-We should.

693
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,344
Can I get the keys from you?

694
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,470
The key?

695
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,764
What's happening?

696
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:34,393
Oh, they need me for the night shift,
so, um, I'll be right back.

697
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:36,895
-You can't go far. It's almost out of gas.
-Mm-hmm.

698
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,356
Cheers, everyone!

699
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,732
Cheers!

700
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:46,029
She said she'll be right back.
It's her work, so…

701
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:49,408
-How about you, then?
-You gotta do it, man!

702
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:50,868
You have no choice!

703
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,620
Father Baek isn't here,
so it's up to you, Father Woo.

704
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,781
Hurry up!

705
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,999
Come on. Hey, go on up there.

706
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:42,920
I said I would get it!

707
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:45,672
I told you!

708
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,103
So-min.

709
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:02,773
So-min.
