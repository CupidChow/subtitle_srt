I just wanted to go on a date with you,

10

but you only meet people through apps, so there was only one way.

11
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,580
I looked for you all over the place, installing all kinds of apps.

so I was going to leave quietly. Good morning.

185
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:59,430
Eat before you leave.

186
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,700
Do you want to eat ramen?

187
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,360
We had ramen... last night.
(T/N: term used as euphemism for "sexual activity")

188
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,130
Good, right?

189
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,110
Yes.

190
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,120
I always cured my hangover with spicy foods. This isn't bad.

191
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,110
Not the hamburger.

192
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,820
To be honest... I have feelings for you.

193
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,580
But they're not a 100%.

194
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,950
It was pretty sudden...

195
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:51,630
I need more time to think about it.

196
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:57,930
To be honest, this is what I expected.

197
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,440
But I still feel happy.

198
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,380
All right. I'll wait for you.

199
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,640
You got it all over your face.

200
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,650
Good boy.

201
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,210
What should we do today?

202
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,890
I don't know.

203
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,410
It's the weekend.

204
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,240
♫ Right now, this moment with you and me ♫

205
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,660
What should we do?

206
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,300
Cheers.

207
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:57,050
♫ I think about you first thing in the morning ♫

208
00:22:57,050 --> 00:23:01,760
♫ You grow in my heart ♫

209
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:08,460
♫ Just looking at your lovely smile makes me happy ♫

210
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,400
[Are you looking for true love?]
[Love Mate]

211
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,300
♫ I'm all right if I'm next to you ♫

212
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,950
♫ I love it when it's the two of us ♫

213
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:22,980
♫ How can I like you this much? ♫

214
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,390
♫ Happy, happy day ♫

215
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,410
♫ I keep smiling ♫

216
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,850
♫ Happy, happy day ♫
