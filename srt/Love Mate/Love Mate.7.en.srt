What about "True Love" appealed to you?

41
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,700
Honestly, I was being materialistic at first.

42
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,350
I wanted to participate no matter what,

43
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,600
since it would be easier to become famous through a variety show.

44
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,850

something moved my heart.

56
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,510

155

You call yourselves date mates, but you're basically in a relationship.

156
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,760
Am I wrong?

157
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,980
That's true.

158
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,580

It's fear.

167
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:03,820

I'm sorry.

173

174
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:45,400
Yi Jun, I was too disrespectful to you, wasn't I?

175
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,240
After all this time?

176
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,580
I guess, after all this time.

177
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,040
It's late, but could you forgive me?

178
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,810
What difference will that make?

179
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,870
I want to get along with you again.

180
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:12,780
You keep counting your chickens before they hatch.

181
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,460
That's not happening.

182
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,890
I know it's not easy.

183
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,200
And I know what I've done to you.

184
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,800
You did everything for me.

185
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,580
When I said I wanted to model,

186
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:33,060
you fed my vanity with shoes and clothes.

187
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,220
And since I was jobless and loafing around at home,

188
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,140
you introduced a part-time job to me and also managed my diet.

189
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,700
And... when I failed an audition,

190
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:49,500
you always cheered me on in case I lost self-esteem.

191
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,520
I remember every single thing you've done for me.

192
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,910
To be honest, you're the one who made me who I am today.

193
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:05,610
I'm really grateful for that... and sorry.

194
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:09,250
And you still did that?

195
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,270
You still made me feel that miserable?

196
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:17,000
I've forgotten all my memories with you.

197
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,120
- So I decline your trip down memory lane.
- Yi Jun...

198
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,170
You want to get along after appearing out of the blue?

199
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:29,340
Sure. It must be easy for you. But I...

200
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,500
Forget it. Let's stop here.

201
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:38,250
I'm really regretful.

202
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:42,590
Please let me repay everything you've done for me.

203
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,760
Cut the bullshit.

204
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,100
What do you want from me?

205
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,460
Is it because of the program?

206
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,920
Do you think I would... approach you with ulterior motives?

207
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,720
I just...

208
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:05,210
realized that there's no one else like you in the world.

209
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,860
If I could go back in time,

210
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,720
I would never do something so stupid.

211
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,700
- Please...
- Let go.

212
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,150
- I'm sorry.
- I said, let go.

213
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,680
Please give me one more chance.

214
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,170
I'll be good to you. Please!

215
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,560
Why isn't he picking up?

216
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,880
Please, damn it!

217
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,240
Hey, Yun Do Kyeong!

218
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,160
Let go of my hyeong.

219
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:39,900
Who are you to meddle?

220
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,720
Me?

221
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,170
Seo Yi Jun's lover.

222
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:53,220
♫ I can't wait to know, Baby ♫

223
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:59,670
♫ There's never enough time for me to love you ♫

224
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,680
♫ At first, I couldn't help my fluttering heart ♫

225
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,660
[Are you looking for true love?]
[Love Mate]

226
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:21,170
♫ When you call me, I get flustered for no reason and blush right away ♫

227
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:27,370
♫ I can hear it louder than the ticking clock ♫
