Please, damn it!

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:10,520
Hey, Yun Do Kyeong!

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,510
Let go of my hyeong.

5
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,130
Who are you to meddle?

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:21,880
Me?

7
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,430
Seo Yi Jun's lover.

8
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,200
Hey, Seo Yi Jun. Is he really your lover?

9
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:45,510
- That's enough, both of you.
- Is he, or isn't he?

10
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:49,870
Yun Do Kyeong. Why should I answer you?

11
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,900
Hey, Jeong Ha Ram. You're being discourteous.

12
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,390
Hyeong.

13
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:02,640
Both of you, leave. I can't deal with this.

14
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,900
I'm sorry that I put you through this.

15
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,630
I'll get going.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,700
You should go, too.

17
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,090
Do you want me to leave in this situation?

Enjoy.

26

Why didn't you tell me?

27
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,460
That Yun Do Kyeong was bothering you.

28
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,850
It has nothing to do with you.

29
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,200
It has nothing to do with me?

30
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,720
Right.

31
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,570
It's my problem, so I was going to solve it myself.

32
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,450
This wouldn't have happened if you had been honest with me.

33
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:35,970
Is it because I'm your date mate?

34
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,590
Is that all I am to you, Hyeong?

35
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,030
You don't know how I feel, do you?

36
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,640
Being whipped around by my ex... was too pathetic.

37
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,930
So I hid it.

38
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,600
I was honestly going to properly end things with Yun Do Kyeong today.

39
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:03,000
But you appeared out of nowhere

40
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,990
and everything was messed up.

41
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,010
I've been extremely embarrassed to see you.

42
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,000
I realized something while looking at the two of you.

43
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,420
What?

44
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:28,400
I'm still... not ready to like anyone.

45
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,400
It's not anyone's fault. It's all my fault.

46
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,700
Honestly, I didn't tell you because a part of me doesn't trust you.

47
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,610
I was afraid I would become petty.

48
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:55,140
I am afraid that fear... won't be easy to overcome.

49
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,820
And I don't want you to get hurt because of me.

50
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:11,470
Let's just... end things here.

51
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,150
We became date mates...

52
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,130
because of my fear in the first place.

53
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,520
Let's stop being date mates.

54
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,700
Nothing makes sense.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:40,120
It's tough to sort out my feelings... and it's tough for you, too.

56
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,850
Let's just end it here.

57
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,110
Team Leader Seo, did you make up your mind about DK?

58
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,260
Writer Jin is totally okay with him.

59
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,440
Yes.

60
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,920
- Let's cast DK.
- What?

61
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,260
He's a hot topic and the best choice in terms of strategy.

62
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,500
And above all, he has a strong will, so let's trust it.

63
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:34,160
- What are you doing?
- Jeong Ha Ram.

64
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,870
We're at work. What are you doing?

65
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,600
What are you thinking, trying to cast Yun Do Kyeong? Huh?

66
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,900
Do you want him to keep bothering you?

67
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:50,620
Being hung up on my feelings is bothersome and a burden.

68
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,320
I'm just going to go with the flow.

69
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,720
And Yun Do Kyeong is a candidate for casting.

70
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,800
He's literally the best.

71
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,290
I don't want to make things harder by overthinking.

72
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,360
The same goes for you.

73
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,640
Can you really do that?

74
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,690
Even to me?

75
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,750
For three years...

76
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,640
I met people through apps without any feelings.

77
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:20,190
Things were nice and comfortable then.

78
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,460
I'll go back to that.

79
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,960
So don't make me uncomfortable like this.

80
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,990
We should have... never started to begin with.

81
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:53,800

Thank you in advance. I'm Yun Do Kyeong.

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,190
Please take good care of him.

86
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,420
And we can't just go home on a day like this, right?

87
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:08,970
Let's go for a team dinner. Pack your things and follow me!

88
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,180
Yi Jun. Do you have a moment?

89
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,470
I heard what happened.

90
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,410
I got cast because you gave the okay.

91
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:55,940
Thanks.

92
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,650
Let's do our best.

93
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:03,670
You're the only one who looks out for me.

94
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:08,340
I just went along with the company.

95
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,730
Don't put unnecessary meaning to it.

96
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,040
And let's keep it professional from now on.

97
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,980
With all due respect.

98
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,990
You got it, Team Leader Seo.

99
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,800
I'm repeating myself, but

100
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't have personal feelings for you at all.

101
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,160
Don't get on my nerves by bringing up the past.

102
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,720
How could I? We've known each other for years.

103
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,410
Please do.

104
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,300
Do Kyeong, let's go.

105
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,740
Anyway, let's grab dinner sometime.

106
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,360
I found a really nice place.

107
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,760
I forgot to give him the draft of our contract.

108
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,800
Go take it to DK. He's probably in the underground parking lot right now.

109
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,140
Me? You can tell his manager to come up.

110
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,120
He's not picking up. Go on.

111
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,610
Geez, seriously.

112
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,960
You always make me do these things.

113
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,280
Always making me do everything. What a hassle.

114
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:50,330
Such a bother.

115
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,240
Yes, CEO.

116
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:56,090
Of course. I introduced myself to everyone.

117
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:00,020
Oh, the friend who created the proposal?

118
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:04,170
What should I do? I've got him in the palm of my hand.

119
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:09,670
Please. He does everything I ask him to.

120
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,860
He's naive, like a fool.

121
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,950
It shouldn't be a problem if I just keep at it.

122
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,440
Yes.

123
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:22,250
Come on, CEO. It's a done deal, so quit worrying.

124
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,790
Yes.

125
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,300
It's all thanks to you.

126
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,120
Don't.

127
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,190
Hyeong.

128
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,260
Let's just go back up.

129
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,630
Why?

130
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,710
Why are you turning a blind eye?

131
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,380
Aren't you angry that he manipulated you?

132
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,130
Just let it be.

133
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,700
Going up.

134
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,150
The door is closing.

135
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,870
I'm going crazy.

136
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,890
Why isn't he picking up?

137
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,200
What's going on with Team Leader Seo?

138
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,950
He's still not at work yet. Did he contact anyone?

139
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,190
Did no one hear from him?

140
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,750
Give him a call and see if he's okay.

141
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,820
This isn't like him.

142
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,560
I'm a relationship virgin, like you said.

143
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,980
And I am fragile.

144
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,410
Nothing makes sense.

145
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,330
It's tough to sort out my feelings... and it's tough for you, too.

146
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,490
Let's just end it here.

147
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,560
- Manager.
- Yes.

148
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,820
- I have to go offsite.
- Sure, go ahead.

149
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,410
Go offsite?

150
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,470
Hyeong! Yi Jun Hyeong!

151
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,110
What?

152
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:36,480
Why did you come? What about work?

153
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,890
Do you think work is the problem?

154
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,190
Where does it hurt?

155
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:45,430
Just... I'm just not in good condition.

156
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,070
It's nothing serious.

157
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,840
You're lying.

158
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,550
You're hurting here.

159
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,060
Meet with Yun Do Kyeong.

160
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:10,360
Meet him and curse him out or argue.

161
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,600
Don't hold back the pain, and don't avoid it.

162
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,820
Don't be afraid and pour out the feelings you stashed away.

163
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,600
Forget it.

164
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,520
Doing that won't change anything.

165
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,990
Why not?

166
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:31,180
Don't let him look down on you anymore.

167
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,910
And I...

168
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,100
I don't want you to close up again.

169
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,880
Expressing and receiving emotions is difficult for me, too.

170
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,480
Other people are the same.

171
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,760
We learn from the pain and all the while, we keep at it.

172
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,090
Running away isn't the answer, Hyeong.

173
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:04,500
I know it's not the answer.

174
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:08,590
But it's not the wrong answer either.

175
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,110
No.

176
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,900
It's wrong to me, and it's awful.

177
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,060
I can't watch the person I like struggle with the wrong answer.

178
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:27,060
If it's hard to do this alone, I'll stay beside you.

179
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:33,150
To be honest, I was confident.

180
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,720
