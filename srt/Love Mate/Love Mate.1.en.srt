I'm certain that viewers no longer believe in the sweetness of love.

67
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:39,802
Because in today's society, love is not an absolute emotion.

68
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:42,192
It's an unnecessary, uncomfortable,

First of all, it's too emotional. It's not objective. How should I put this?

00:13:17,552 --> 00:13:19,652
No, we must!

183
00:13:19,652 --> 00:13:21,182
Do what exactly?

184
00:13:21,182 --> 00:13:25,362
Love sensibility training.

185
00:13:25,362 --> 00:13:28,242
L-Love training?

186
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:31,478

Let's recover our lost sensibilities.

188
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:40,402
This is the only way to save our proposal.

189
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:44,862
Don't you think the method is too peculiar?

190
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:48,032
Just trust and follow me for now.

191
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:11,552
Team Leader Seo,

192
00:14:11,552 --> 00:14:14,862
when was your most recent relationship?

193
00:14:14,862 --> 00:14:16,882
When was it again?

194
00:14:18,572 --> 00:14:20,992
What is the use of recalling that?

195
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,632
Love sensibility? That's ridiculous.

196
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:33,572
I like things as they are now.

197
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:48,922

Wow. What a coincidence.

I'm so glad to see you.

203
00:15:13,342 --> 00:15:15,712
Is it fate and not a coincidence?

204
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:18,232
It's hot. Go somewhere else.

205
00:15:18,232 --> 00:15:20,372
There are so many empty seats.

206
00:15:20,372 --> 00:15:24,542
Why? Isn't it cozy between workplace seonbae and hubae?

207
00:15:26,282 --> 00:15:30,622
You must not be happy to see me at all.

208
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:35,242
Do I have a reason to be?

209
00:15:35,242 --> 00:15:37,702
Wow. You sure know how to hold grudges.

210
00:15:37,702 --> 00:15:40,032
Are you still upset?

211
00:15:40,032 --> 00:15:41,462
Let's go quietly.

I can't.

- Wait, Manager.
- Hey, it's okay.

261
