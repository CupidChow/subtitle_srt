Should I return them?

178
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,230
You don't even mean that. Oh, right.

179
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,090
Here.

180
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,320
Hyeong, you came out nice.

181
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,980
Especially your gaze.

182
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,730
What about my gaze?

183
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:09,260
It's out of the ordinary. It seems like you've fallen for me.

184
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,100
You're right. To be honest, you shook my heart a bit at the time.

185
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,130
Is that why you fainted?

186
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,360
No.

187
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,160
I fainted while holding my breath because I didn't want to breathe the same air as you.

188
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:25,860
I guess I'll just have to believe that.

189
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,550
Oh, let's take a picture.

190
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,050
What picture?

191
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,650
To commemorate our first couple item.

192
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,950
Aren't you tired of taking pictures with me?

193
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,770
As if. Don't be shy and get close to me.

194
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,820
The couple item.

195
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,370
Lift the photo so it's more visible.

196
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,690
Like this?

197
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,590
Yes.

198
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:52,180
Make pretty faces. I'm taking it.

199
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,240
One, two, three!

200
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,340
What the... What are you two doing here?

201
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,110
Oh, I was showing him the cover.

202
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,550
Team Leader Seo, something is going on here, isn't it?

203
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,950
You two seem to be hanging out a lot recently.

204
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,560
No way. You know we're not on good terms.

205
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,110
You're really suspicious.

206
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:41,320
Exactly. You used to argue all the time.

207
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,020
♫ So I just like you ♫

208
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,820
♫ Just stay as you are now ♫

209
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,520
[Are you looking for true love?]
[Love Mate]

210
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,770
♫ You don't need to realize it ♫

211
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:02,410
♫ You're the most brilliant person to me ♫

212
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:04,150
♫ Just like you ♫

213
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:08,730
♫ My heart still flutters when you call me ♫

214
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:12,870
♫ Your soft voice... ♫
