1
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,564
Begin Again

2
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,960
Episode 08

3
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,057
Colds

4
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:55,257
are contagious.

5
00:02:14,628 --> 00:02:15,942
The effect's so strong?

6
00:02:20,114 --> 00:02:20,971
What is that soup?

7
00:02:23,628 --> 00:02:24,828
Whatever, come on.

8
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,942
-No.
-Why are you hesitating?

9
00:02:27,028 --> 00:02:28,142
-What are you doing?
-Come down.

10
00:02:32,228 --> 00:02:33,285
We have to

11
00:02:33,657 --> 00:02:35,400
talk about it tonight.

12
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,428
Why are you tying me up again?

13
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,371
I don't feel comfortable like this.

14
00:02:45,171 --> 00:02:46,028
Ling Rui.

15
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:48,085
Ling Rui.

16
00:02:56,257 --> 00:02:56,971
So,

17
00:02:57,457 --> 00:02:58,400
you married me

18
00:02:59,114 --> 00:03:00,657
just to legally get...

19
00:03:03,628 --> 00:03:04,457
my...

20
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,628
Alright.

21
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,285
I completely understand

22
00:03:17,342 --> 00:03:18,457
why you, Lu Fangning,

23
00:03:18,542 --> 00:03:19,200
would do this.

24
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:21,114
It's just... Why me?

25
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:22,457
Why not you?

26
00:03:23,057 --> 00:03:24,085
You're handsome and well-educated.

27
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:24,857
You have good personality.

28
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:26,085
Of course it's you.

29
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:28,057
Besides, you still owe me money.

30
00:03:28,371 --> 00:03:29,600
You have to pay your debt.

31
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:30,400
It's perfectly fair.

32
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,971
Don't worry.

33
00:03:35,314 --> 00:03:36,571
After I have a baby,

34
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:38,171
I'm not gonna stick to you.

35
00:03:38,571 --> 00:03:39,371
Our marriage

36
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,514
will, as we agreed on the contract,

37
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:41,971
automatically end in one year.

38
00:03:42,085 --> 00:03:42,657
Of course,

39
00:03:42,742 --> 00:03:43,857
I get the baby when it's born.

40
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:45,857
But you're still the father.

41
00:03:46,114 --> 00:03:47,485
You can see the kid whenever you want.

42
00:03:47,724 --> 00:03:49,066
I would never stop you.

43
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,220
However,

44
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,570
if one day

45
00:03:51,657 --> 00:03:53,285
you have a new relationship,

46
00:03:53,564 --> 00:03:54,710
I'm not gonna let the baby

47
00:03:54,771 --> 00:03:55,885
call that woman mother.

48
00:03:56,085 --> 00:03:56,685
So,

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,400
you never had any intention

50
00:04:00,514 --> 00:04:02,171
to keep the father of the child?

51
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:10,142
I'm perfectly capable of handling

52
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,031
the risks and responsibilities

53
00:04:11,075 --> 00:04:11,973
when raising a baby.

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,542
Besides,

55
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,937
I have a stable financial income

56
00:04:14,057 --> 00:04:15,428
to give the kid the best possible life,

57
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:16,028
education,

58
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:17,770
and all my care and love,

59
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,200
to help him grow up.

60
00:04:19,314 --> 00:04:20,314
Why

61
00:04:20,914 --> 00:04:22,571
does he need to have a father?

62
00:04:23,314 --> 00:04:25,142
It's not a question of necessity.

63
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,571
Then what's the problem?

64
00:04:27,914 --> 00:04:28,914
Ling Rui.

65
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:30,685
You've got to open your mind.

66
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:32,542
Think of it as

67
00:04:33,644 --> 00:04:35,540
helping a lovely girl

68
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:36,342
who wants a baby

69
00:04:36,428 --> 00:04:38,200
but can't have one by herself.

70
00:04:40,586 --> 00:04:41,820
I can't do this alone.

71
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,200
I can't do mitosis.

72
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,977
Of course I need your help.

73
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:50,542
Ling Rui.

74
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,628
Look at me.

75
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:55,571
Look at me.

76
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:57,542
With a girl as attractive as me,

77
00:04:57,571 --> 00:04:59,285
someone else would be attracted a long time ago.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,628
Someone else?

79
00:05:02,228 --> 00:05:03,428
So if it's not me,

80
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:05,142
you would find someone else

81
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,228
to carry out your plan?

82
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:10,885
Can't I?

83
00:05:11,485 --> 00:05:12,542
You can't!

84
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,800
Two mature adults

85
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:18,200
raising a child together

86
00:05:18,428 --> 00:05:19,914
would meet a lot of problems.

87
00:05:20,514 --> 00:05:21,200
Not to mention the fact that

88
00:05:21,914 --> 00:05:23,628
you're childish and ridiculous.

89
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,485
Childish?

90
00:05:34,628 --> 00:05:35,428
Childish?

91
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,142
I thought of your feelings

92
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,057
and your ego,

93
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:38,742
so I stayed in there

94
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,571
for such a long time,

95
00:05:39,628 --> 00:05:41,085
and you call that childish?

96
00:05:41,371 --> 00:05:42,514
Immature?

97
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:44,457
How do you know I'm immature?

98
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:45,200
Have you ever seen

99
00:05:45,285 --> 00:05:46,657
before you say that?

100
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:47,564
Anyway, I'm not going to

101
00:05:47,582 --> 00:05:48,515
have a baby with you.

102
00:05:49,428 --> 00:05:50,371
A baby should be a gift

103
00:05:50,428 --> 00:05:51,314
to two adults who are in love.

104
00:05:53,485 --> 00:05:54,457
We're not.

105
00:05:56,085 --> 00:05:57,171
How do you know we're not?

106
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:01,171
I love you.

107
00:06:05,028 --> 00:06:06,000
I like you.

108
00:06:08,771 --> 00:06:09,600
No.

109
00:06:10,514 --> 00:06:11,828
It's not up to you.

110
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:13,257
You're just saying no to anything.

111
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:14,857
Why are you such a pain in the ass?

112
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,114
Anyway, I'm not gonna

113
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,400
have a baby with you.

114
00:06:20,114 --> 00:06:20,714
And neither will you

115
00:06:21,571 --> 00:06:22,628
with someone else.

116
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:27,620
I'm going home for a few days.

117
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,028
Ling Rui.

118
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,314
-Don't come to me.
-Ling Rui.

119
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,171
Ling Rui!

120
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:53,514
One more.

121
00:06:57,714 --> 00:07:00,228
How about I feed it into your mouth?

122
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:02,257
Have you ever stopped eating?

123
00:07:07,914 --> 00:07:08,714
Ling Rui.

124
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:11,285
At such late hours, why you're back?

125
00:07:13,942 --> 00:07:16,200
I have something to do.

126
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:18,571
What is it?

127
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,600
Why are you home so late?

128
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,542
Where is your coat?

129
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,400
My coat...

130
00:07:24,542 --> 00:07:26,342
I left it at the hospital today.

131
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:30,885
I had surgeries all day.

132
00:07:30,971 --> 00:07:31,542
I'm too tired.

133
00:07:31,657 --> 00:07:32,685
I'm gonna go get some sleep.

134
00:07:34,885 --> 00:07:35,800
Did you

135
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,714
have a fight with Lu Fangning?

136
00:07:38,228 --> 00:07:39,200
Fight?

137
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,457
How could I possibly fight with her, mom?

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,942
Not like that.

139
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,444
I'm going to bed. Good night.

140
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,973
Well, off you go.

141
00:07:48,228 --> 00:07:49,085
Are you hungry?

142
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,044
No, I'm fine.

143
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:54,771
What happened to Ling Rui?

144
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,453
Came back to mother's house
in the middle of the night.

145
00:07:56,951 --> 00:07:57,991
What are you talking about?

146
00:07:58,088 --> 00:07:59,084
How could you

147
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,964
say that?

148
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,688
He's a man.

149
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:03,262
Can't he just come home?

150
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,028
She's not wrong.

151
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,428
You're his mother.

152
00:08:08,114 --> 00:08:08,771
Sister.

153
00:08:09,457 --> 00:08:11,457
Why don't you go back to sleep? It's late.

154
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,048
Alright, go to sleep then.

155
00:08:16,342 --> 00:08:18,228
Don't you want to sleep? Still eating?

156
00:08:18,628 --> 00:08:19,542
Go to sleep.

157
00:08:19,714 --> 00:08:20,371
No.

158
00:08:24,942 --> 00:08:25,714
You...

159
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:49,514
Wait a minute.

160
00:08:51,142 --> 00:08:52,200
Hurry up.

161
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,026
Why are you in such a hurry?

162
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,880
I'm just using the toilet.

163
00:08:56,942 --> 00:08:58,057
Keep your voice down.

164
00:08:58,428 --> 00:08:59,485
Look.

165
00:09:00,062 --> 00:09:00,850
Ling Rui has been

166
00:09:01,142 --> 00:09:02,457
cleaning it since this morning,

167
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,031
from this side to that side

168
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:06,480
and back and forth

169
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:08,028
for such a long time.

170
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:09,540
Isn't it normal

171
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,755
for him to clean the table?

172
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,648
Cut the crap.

173
00:09:12,693 --> 00:09:13,710
Is that normal?

174
00:09:16,057 --> 00:09:17,342
When was

175
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,628
the last time he was like this?

176
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,085
Last time?

177
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,314
When was the last time?

178
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,028
No such thing happened before.

179
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:26,514
No.

180
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:29,800
Yazhi, go ask him.

181
00:09:29,942 --> 00:09:30,742
No.

182
00:09:31,685 --> 00:09:32,885
Go ahead.

183
00:09:42,142 --> 00:09:42,800
Ling Rui.

184
00:09:43,085 --> 00:09:44,342
Did you have a fight with Fangning?

185
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:44,971
Give back my money.

186
00:09:46,685 --> 00:09:47,457
I'll leave you to it then.

187
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:53,628
See? I told you I can't.

188
00:09:53,771 --> 00:09:54,400
Why sent me to ask him?

189
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:58,542
Sister, why don't you go?

190
00:09:59,511 --> 00:09:59,982
Me?

191
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,617
He has always listened to you since he was a kid.

192
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:03,142
He'll do whatever you told him.

193
00:10:04,897 --> 00:10:06,970
You're his mother, let's go together.

194
00:10:07,485 --> 00:10:08,942
Let's go. Yazhi.

195
00:10:16,485 --> 00:10:17,400
Ling Rui.

196
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,400
Today is weekend.

197
00:10:20,742 --> 00:10:22,628
Why don't you stay with your wife at home

198
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:24,200
but come here?

199
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,257
Son, will you stop doing that?

200
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,828
You have been doing this

201
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:34,828
from here to there

202
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:35,971
and the other way around.

203
00:10:36,057 --> 00:10:37,342
You didn't take any rest.

204
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:38,800
Good boy, come here. Take a break.

205
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Take a break,

206
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:40,742
okay?

207
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:41,733
Be good.

208
00:10:51,371 --> 00:10:52,657
Hi.

209
00:10:52,771 --> 00:10:54,371
Mom and aunties,

210
00:10:54,514 --> 00:10:55,742
here comes your daughter-in-law.

211
00:10:55,914 --> 00:10:56,828
What are you doing here?

212
00:10:57,914 --> 00:10:58,485
Here.

213
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,571
Help me get the stuff inside.

214
00:11:02,114 --> 00:11:03,400
Fangning is here.

215
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:07,371
Hi.

216
00:11:18,714 --> 00:11:20,200
What's going on here?

217
00:11:21,742 --> 00:11:23,400
I'm going to visit

218
00:11:23,457 --> 00:11:24,971
a friend of mine who lives nearby.

219
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:26,057
Her little baby

220
00:11:26,142 --> 00:11:27,257
is one year old.

221
00:11:27,371 --> 00:11:28,314
These are all the things

222
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,457
that I plan to give her.

223
00:11:31,514 --> 00:11:33,028
You still have friends

224
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:34,657
who live in places like this?

225
00:11:34,742 --> 00:11:35,628
Of course.

226
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,228
All right, you take a seat.

227
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,373
I go get you some fruits.

228
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,770
Mom, please sit.

229
00:11:42,017 --> 00:11:43,710
Hold on, hold on.

230
00:11:43,822 --> 00:11:44,650
Sit here.

231
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:48,220
What is this?

232
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,570
This is socks for

233
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:52,342
the little babies to wear.

234
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:53,795
With their little feet inside,

235
00:11:54,426 --> 00:11:56,140
it's so cute.

236
00:11:57,395 --> 00:11:59,420
It's so soft and tender.

237
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:01,440
Mom, look.

238
00:12:01,542 --> 00:12:02,857
What's this for?

239
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:04,600
It's supposed to be for babies

240
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:05,600
to put their heads on.

241
00:12:06,782 --> 00:12:08,284
With their little heads on top of it,

242
00:12:08,337 --> 00:12:09,884
it's so nice to think of this view.

243
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:12,400
This one's so soft, too. Mom.

244
00:12:12,514 --> 00:12:12,971
Feel it.

245
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,400
You opened the things

246
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:15,428
that you're going to give others.

247
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:16,844
How are you supposed to give it away?

248
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:17,657
No problem.

249
00:12:17,786 --> 00:12:19,120
I'll just put it in later.

250
00:12:20,826 --> 00:12:21,671
When I think about that

251
00:12:22,071 --> 00:12:24,097
little babies' little arms,

252
00:12:24,168 --> 00:12:25,110
little feet

253
00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:26,640
like that little lotus roots,

254
00:12:27,262 --> 00:12:28,782
soft and tender.

255
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,450
Thinking they kick their little legs

256
00:12:31,457 --> 00:12:32,400
and stretch their arms,

257
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:34,648
I feel it melts my heart.

258
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:38,885
Do you like kids?

259
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:41,285
Of course, mom.

260
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,514
In the future,

261
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,485
when you have your own

262
00:12:43,542 --> 00:12:44,228
grandchildren,

263
00:12:44,285 --> 00:12:46,571
I'm sure you'd love them.

264
00:12:46,628 --> 00:12:47,857
Take a look.

265
00:12:53,171 --> 00:12:54,057
Ling Rui.

266
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:55,000
Mom.

267
00:12:58,337 --> 00:12:59,537
Do you remember your card-playing friend?

268
00:12:59,688 --> 00:13:00,450
Which one?

269
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:02,560
Rarely talks, but plays fast,

270
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,644
and always lets you win.

271
00:13:04,364 --> 00:13:05,591
Ever since she got a grandson,

272
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,924
you haven't seen her anymore.

273
00:13:08,124 --> 00:13:09,370
Didn't you tell me that

274
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,800
she cried and told you

275
00:13:11,306 --> 00:13:12,280
after having a grandson,

276
00:13:12,595 --> 00:13:14,657
she was surrounded with diapers and milk bottles,

277
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:16,631
and had to take care of the baby all night?

278
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:17,914
So,

279
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,457
you think it's going to be

280
00:13:19,484 --> 00:13:20,942
troublesome for you to have a baby?

281
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,800
It's a real pain in the ass.

282
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:26,250
I don't think

283
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,902
I'm gonna take care of your kids.

284
00:13:28,862 --> 00:13:30,284
Is that right, sister?

285
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,760
Yeah, we won't.

286
00:13:31,848 --> 00:13:34,515
Mom, I haven't...

287
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,800
Didn't you just say that...

288
00:13:41,485 --> 00:13:42,428
Mom, I...

289
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,400
You know what? Never mind.

290
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,485
Please ask Ling Rui about this.

291
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:53,371
What's going on?

292
00:13:58,028 --> 00:13:59,028
What's going on?

293
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:02,085
What the hell is going on?

294
00:14:02,568 --> 00:14:04,497
What's up with all that?

295
00:14:22,542 --> 00:14:23,428
Fangning.

296
00:14:24,457 --> 00:14:25,857
Sit over there.

297
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,314
Move over and let me sit down.

298
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,428
Fanning.

299
00:14:31,057 --> 00:14:32,314
Try this tea.

300
00:14:32,742 --> 00:14:34,057
Thank you, auntie.

301
00:14:34,428 --> 00:14:35,085
When I went out

302
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:36,771
last time for inspiration,

303
00:14:36,885 --> 00:14:38,800
I watched the old farmer cook this.

304
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,542
Auntie.

305
00:14:40,628 --> 00:14:41,742
I've been preparing for pregnancy,

306
00:14:41,885 --> 00:14:42,857
so I can't drink tea.

307
00:14:44,857 --> 00:14:45,457
Look.

308
00:14:45,742 --> 00:14:47,228
A lot of people think that

309
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:48,542
career-minded women like us

310
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,200
don't have time

311
00:14:49,285 --> 00:14:50,514
to take care of the kids.

312
00:14:50,628 --> 00:14:52,142
But it was a misunderstanding.

313
00:14:52,285 --> 00:14:52,971
Look at me.

314
00:14:53,315 --> 00:14:54,170
I've fully prepared

315
00:14:54,257 --> 00:14:55,600
to welcome

316
00:14:55,685 --> 00:14:56,857
the baby.

317
00:14:57,475 --> 00:14:59,342
Because motherhood is strong.

318
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,080
Our children are our backbones.

319
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:02,110
Isn't that right?

320
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:05,600
Auntie.

321
00:15:07,688 --> 00:15:08,764
I'll drink it.

322
00:15:09,093 --> 00:15:10,586
I apologize on behalf of Fangning.

323
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:13,520
She definitely didn't mean that

324
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:15,671
a woman without children is weak,

325
00:15:15,973 --> 00:15:17,080
and her life is imperfect.

326
00:15:17,142 --> 00:15:18,285
That's not what I was saying.

327
00:15:20,746 --> 00:15:21,475
I know.

328
00:15:21,742 --> 00:15:23,226
I won't take it personally.

329
00:15:24,471 --> 00:15:25,310
Actually,

330
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,685
it's nice to have a kid.

331
00:15:28,542 --> 00:15:30,085
But people like me

332
00:15:30,228 --> 00:15:31,657
who choose not to have children

333
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:33,428
and live on their own

334
00:15:33,714 --> 00:15:34,800
are also living in

335
00:15:34,885 --> 00:15:35,800
a good lifestyle.

336
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,314
Yes, of course.

337
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:39,502
Oh, Fangning.

338
00:15:39,937 --> 00:15:41,280
Your language skills

339
00:15:41,502 --> 00:15:43,164
are pretty bad.

340
00:15:43,715 --> 00:15:45,080
"Motherhood is strong."

341
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,560
That's not how it's supposed to be used.

342
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:01,228
Auntie Yazhi.

343
00:16:01,714 --> 00:16:02,342
I'm here.

344
00:16:02,435 --> 00:16:04,000
Come, sit.

345
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:05,342
Auntie,

346
00:16:06,595 --> 00:16:07,420
haven't you been

347
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:08,510
trying to find a job

348
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,937
and sending out resumes online?

349
00:16:10,714 --> 00:16:11,800
Resumes?

350
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,420
Go ahead, that matters more.

351
00:16:16,177 --> 00:16:17,226
Au... Auntie?

352
00:16:17,914 --> 00:16:18,771
I'll send out resumes.

353
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:25,085
Oh, I forgot to tell you that

354
00:16:25,657 --> 00:16:27,371
auntie Yazhi divorced,

355
00:16:27,971 --> 00:16:29,114
and her ex-husband got the baby.

356
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:30,742
Be careful

357
00:16:31,244 --> 00:16:32,540
with your words.

358
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:43,542
It's tasty.

359
00:16:48,971 --> 00:16:49,685
Mom.

360
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:51,828
Come on in, kid.

361
00:16:52,057 --> 00:16:52,685
Come on in.

362
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:53,828
Close the door.

363
00:16:55,542 --> 00:16:56,371
Come on, come on.

364
00:16:56,457 --> 00:16:57,200
Let me ask you something.

365
00:16:57,314 --> 00:16:57,885
Sit, sit.

366
00:16:59,114 --> 00:17:00,514
Out there, you just said

367
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,228
you want kids

368
00:17:02,342 --> 00:17:03,628
and then you said you don't.

369
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:05,142
What exactly were you thinking?

370
00:17:05,314 --> 00:17:07,285
I don't actually

371
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,914
want a child

372
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,885
very, very much.

373
00:17:10,231 --> 00:17:12,110
Besides, mom, you don't

374
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,186
want it that bad either, do you?

375
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:16,000
I didn't say that...

376
00:17:16,114 --> 00:17:17,114
Of course I do.

377
00:17:17,228 --> 00:17:17,942
You just said that

378
00:17:18,028 --> 00:17:19,828
you don't want to raise the kid.

379
00:17:20,684 --> 00:17:21,368
No.

380
00:17:21,546 --> 00:17:23,420
I was sitting next to Ling Rui,

381
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,332
so I had to say that.

382
00:17:25,555 --> 00:17:26,420
Or else he would

383
00:17:27,057 --> 00:17:28,142
feel embarrassed.

384
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:31,182
Mom.

385
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,914
You might not

386
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,524
gonna be able to have a grandson for a while.

387
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,404
What do you mean by that?

388
00:17:40,257 --> 00:17:43,280
Since Ling Rui and I got married...

389
00:17:44,604 --> 00:17:46,657
Never mind, it's okay.

390
00:17:47,715 --> 00:17:49,377
What's going on? What do you mean?

391
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,986
Since you are married, then what?

392
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:55,902
We're not like a couple.

393
00:17:58,028 --> 00:17:59,200
Not like a couple?

394
00:17:59,314 --> 00:18:00,628
It's exactly like what you're thinking.

395
00:18:03,226 --> 00:18:04,844
There's nothing wrong with my son.

396
00:18:05,028 --> 00:18:06,085
Nothing wrong?

397
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,514
No problem.

398
00:18:07,822 --> 00:18:09,110
Who knows.

399
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,885
A little orange peel.

400
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:19,253
That's enough.

401
00:18:20,115 --> 00:18:21,777
-Oatmeal.
-Oatmeal won't do.

402
00:18:21,848 --> 00:18:23,710
Don't move, don't talk.

403
00:18:25,173 --> 00:18:28,200
Plus wolfberry, black sesame, and green beans.

404
00:18:28,428 --> 00:18:29,142
What is

405
00:18:29,697 --> 00:18:32,071
Ling Rui thinking?

406
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,977
How am I supposed to know what he's thinking.

407
00:18:35,377 --> 00:18:36,880
Perhaps he doesn't love Fangning.

408
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,914
What are you talking about?

409
00:18:39,102 --> 00:18:39,970
How could he not

410
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,542
love a girl like Fangning?

411
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:43,244
All right, stop talking.

412
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,142
It's already a mess.

413
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,355
Just figure out a way to fix this.

414
00:18:46,764 --> 00:18:47,208
Alright.

415
00:18:50,885 --> 00:18:52,057
Why are you still here?

416
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,200
Why should I leave?

417
00:18:54,314 --> 00:18:55,314
I'll be right where you are.

418
00:18:55,371 --> 00:18:56,342
Where else would I go?

419
00:18:58,542 --> 00:18:59,450
Listen to me,

420
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,315
whatever you're planning

421
00:19:01,795 --> 00:19:03,164
is not gonna work.

422
00:19:03,662 --> 00:19:04,746
What are you talking about?

423
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,746
What could I possibly have planned?

424
00:19:07,004 --> 00:19:08,140
Of course I should stay

425
00:19:08,186 --> 00:19:09,340
with my husband.

426
00:19:09,428 --> 00:19:10,000
Right?

427
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,404
Mom, Ling Rui doesn't want to drink it.

428
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,342
Come on, Ling Rui, drink up.

429
00:19:16,542 --> 00:19:17,457
Drink up.

430
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:18,314
Drink.

431
00:19:18,428 --> 00:19:19,314
OK.

432
00:19:24,088 --> 00:19:26,510
Mom, Ling Rui still refuses to drink it.

433
00:19:27,706 --> 00:19:29,315
What's wrong with you, Ling Rui?

434
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,140
Just drink it.

435
00:19:30,228 --> 00:19:31,514
You don't listen to mom now?

436
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:32,914
You don't listen to mom now?

437
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,200
Go wash the cup.

438
00:19:53,314 --> 00:19:53,800
Okay.

439
00:20:04,742 --> 00:20:06,142
He drank up.

440
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,742
Come here.

441
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:17,000
I'll take shower first.

442
00:20:40,228 --> 00:20:40,885
OK.

443
00:20:42,177 --> 00:20:43,200
Come here, come here.

444
00:20:44,257 --> 00:20:45,028
Come here.

445
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:47,571
Later,

446
00:20:47,742 --> 00:20:48,714
he's in the shower now,

447
00:20:48,857 --> 00:20:50,342
you should just sneak in.

448
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,340
-Shall I do that?
-Don't let him hear you.

449
00:20:54,142 --> 00:20:55,342
I'll lock the door.

450
00:20:55,457 --> 00:20:56,657
No one can see you.

451
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,285
Keep your voice down. Don't talk

452
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,666
Mom, no.

453
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:01,466
Stop talking.

454
00:22:01,942 --> 00:22:02,857
Forget it, forget it.

455
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:03,971
Be good.

456
00:22:06,714 --> 00:22:07,828
Just get in there.

457
00:22:54,017 --> 00:22:55,880
She's shy, you know?

458
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,057
Excuse me.

459
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:42,826
Go, go, let's go.

460
00:23:53,173 --> 00:23:54,275
I won't be back for a few days.

461
00:23:54,675 --> 00:23:55,140
No way.

462
00:23:55,564 --> 00:23:56,560
My families are gonna be suspicious.

463
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,457
I've talked to Dad...

464
00:24:03,155 --> 00:24:04,915
I've explained to uncle Lu that

465
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:06,560
I got something to do at home.

466
00:24:06,808 --> 00:24:07,804
I'll stay a few more days.

467
00:24:08,228 --> 00:24:08,857
All right.

468
00:24:09,324 --> 00:24:10,417
No matter what,

469
00:24:10,471 --> 00:24:11,546
I'll stay with you.

470
00:24:12,835 --> 00:24:13,217
OK.

471
00:24:14,702 --> 00:24:15,848
You can stay here.

472
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,140
Sleep on the floor.

473
00:24:18,408 --> 00:24:18,977
No.

474
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,031
Mom wants us to sleep together.

475
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,850
Also,

476
00:24:22,124 --> 00:24:23,671
don't you forget that according to the contract,

477
00:24:23,777 --> 00:24:25,324
in the rest of the year,

478
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,595
you have to fulfill every requirements

479
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,510
as my husband.

480
00:24:27,628 --> 00:24:28,571
Then I suggest that

481
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,857
you should carefully read

482
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:30,871
the fifth item in section six

483
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,000
in the contract.

484
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:34,924
What?

485
00:24:35,928 --> 00:24:37,368
The contract clearly states that

486
00:24:37,813 --> 00:24:39,333
if you, party A,

487
00:24:39,657 --> 00:24:40,942
coerce me, Party B,

488
00:24:41,351 --> 00:24:42,940
to do anything unethical,

489
00:24:43,004 --> 00:24:44,462
or illegal,

490
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:47,564
I would have the right to break the contract

491
00:24:48,457 --> 00:24:50,257
without any legal responsibility.

492
00:24:54,628 --> 00:24:56,600
Oh, I need to add one more.

493
00:24:57,171 --> 00:24:58,114
All the rights and duties

494
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,142
stated in the contract

495
00:24:59,485 --> 00:25:00,600
have to be done

496
00:25:00,693 --> 00:25:02,420
without violating the law.

497
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,960
I, Lu Fangning, am the general manager

498
00:25:04,971 --> 00:25:05,628
of Deer Sing Group.

499
00:25:05,715 --> 00:25:07,200
Why would I do anything illegal with you?

500
00:25:09,171 --> 00:25:09,942
I'll add this anyway.

501
00:25:13,742 --> 00:25:14,514
Very good.

502
00:25:15,028 --> 00:25:15,742
Well, since you've

503
00:25:15,828 --> 00:25:17,057
made up your mind like this,

504
00:25:17,371 --> 00:25:18,057
I'll find someone else

505
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:18,885
to cooperate with me.

506
00:25:18,971 --> 00:25:19,542
Bye.

507
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,628
Lu Fangning.

508
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,028
Marital infidelity

509
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,400
will be considered as your fault.

510
00:25:30,257 --> 00:25:31,428
Your money,

511
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:34,314
your house,

512
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,991
and your favorite Deer Sing,

513
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,685
are all gonna be half mine.

514
00:26:06,571 --> 00:26:07,600
You sleep on the floor.

515
00:26:32,628 --> 00:26:33,628
Comfortable.

516
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,628
Leader,

517
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:01,850
do you think it's going to affect 

518
00:27:02,008 --> 00:27:02,740
director Lu's brain waves

519
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,050
and let him adopt your plan

520
00:27:04,275 --> 00:27:05,866
if you keep staring at this?

521
00:27:11,428 --> 00:27:13,371
I really don't want to work overtime anymore.

522
00:27:16,057 --> 00:27:17,714
I'm the one who's working overtime, not you.

523
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,342
Look how well I did.

524
00:27:27,657 --> 00:27:29,028
If he doesn't like this,

525
00:27:29,142 --> 00:27:30,114
it certainly won't be

526
00:27:30,142 --> 00:27:31,171
because of my ability.

527
00:27:31,914 --> 00:27:33,228
It would be...

528
00:27:34,971 --> 00:27:36,428
You know, the perfect couple

529
00:27:37,714 --> 00:27:39,314
sometimes starts as enemies.

530
00:27:40,257 --> 00:27:41,000
Siyu.

531
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:42,914
Again.

532
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:44,828
Siyu.

533
00:27:47,571 --> 00:27:49,085
It's quite good, isn't it?

534
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,742
Left Patronus.

535
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:55,428
Assistant He, what can I do for you?

536
00:27:57,413 --> 00:27:58,017
Director Lu demands

537
00:27:58,062 --> 00:27:59,208
all of us in the Planning Dept

538
00:27:59,570 --> 00:28:01,057
to gather at the exhibition center immediately.

539
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,555
Make sure you bring all the plans.

540
00:28:10,714 --> 00:28:11,314
In our plan,

541
00:28:11,371 --> 00:28:12,628
we have three days to set up.

542
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:13,571
But right now,

543
00:28:13,628 --> 00:28:14,742
something came up at the last minute.

544
00:28:14,828 --> 00:28:15,800
No construction this weekend.

545
00:28:16,257 --> 00:28:17,028
So we're gonna have to

546
00:28:17,085 --> 00:28:18,028
get everything set up

547
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,422
within today.

548
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,142
But soon we'll be off work.

549
00:28:22,186 --> 00:28:22,900
I don't want to...

550
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:23,820
Working overtime again?

551
00:28:24,114 --> 00:28:25,200
Overtime again?

552
00:28:25,428 --> 00:28:27,171
If you don't want this to happen,

553
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,800
you should have taken the emergency

554
00:28:28,844 --> 00:28:29,946
into consideration

555
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:30,853
when making the plan.

556
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,835
Do you want the company

557
00:28:32,853 --> 00:28:34,560
to pay for the failure of the plan?

558
00:28:35,164 --> 00:28:36,986
The layout of the exhibition must be finished today.

559
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,453
Is there any problem with this?

560
00:28:38,542 --> 00:28:40,257
-No problem.
-No problem.

561
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,142
Speak up.

562
00:28:41,485 --> 00:28:42,771
-No problem.
-No problem.

563
00:28:42,885 --> 00:28:43,714
Once again.

564
00:28:44,285 --> 00:28:45,828
No problem.

565
00:28:46,342 --> 00:28:47,085
All right.

566
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:48,791
Let's get busy, everyone.

567
00:28:48,914 --> 00:28:49,914
The earlier you get this done,

568
00:28:49,971 --> 00:28:50,600
the longer you can sleep

569
00:28:50,714 --> 00:28:51,571
after going back home.

570
00:28:51,742 --> 00:28:52,540
And if you all slow down,

571
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,044
you might straightly start the next day's work.

572
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,428
Let's get started.

573
00:29:02,085 --> 00:29:04,457
He's so determined and does all the things first.

574
00:29:04,657 --> 00:29:06,600
He's getting more attractive.

575
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:39,485
Staying here is better.

576
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:40,914
I dare not even breathe

577
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,568
with director Lu around.

578
00:29:42,897 --> 00:29:44,604
Director Lu is handsome.

579
00:29:44,995 --> 00:29:46,862
Moreover, wearing a suit,

580
00:29:48,428 --> 00:29:50,028
he is extremely charming.

581
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,400
Working overtime with him

582
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,937
heals my eyes.

583
00:29:57,368 --> 00:29:58,906
But Lu Yiyao is too scary.

584
00:29:59,013 --> 00:30:00,524
People don't dare to speak with him around.

585
00:30:01,182 --> 00:30:02,568
What woman could stand him?

586
00:30:02,755 --> 00:30:03,600
You can.

587
00:30:03,617 --> 00:30:04,140
Come on, you can.

588
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,413
-You can.
-You.

589
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I think you might be more efficient

590
00:30:07,114 --> 00:30:08,771
if you just shut up.

591
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:17,546
Mi.

592
00:30:18,057 --> 00:30:19,257
What's going on with

593
00:30:19,288 --> 00:30:20,140
the labels on these bottles?

594
00:30:20,702 --> 00:30:21,742
Anything wrong with that?

595
00:30:22,088 --> 00:30:23,084
Don't you see?

596
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,844
The words are all blurry.

597
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:25,800
Look at this.

598
00:30:25,973 --> 00:30:26,510
This is the last

599
00:30:26,571 --> 00:30:27,685
batch of scrap labels, right?

600
00:30:28,044 --> 00:30:29,253
It's supposed to be new.

601
00:30:32,485 --> 00:30:33,742
As long as the information is right.

602
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,182
We'll put new ones on later.

603
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,120
I mean, we've done with all these.

604
00:30:37,457 --> 00:30:38,170
We can't just

605
00:30:38,342 --> 00:30:39,800
do it all over again.

606
00:30:40,485 --> 00:30:42,057
Besides, it's too late.

607
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,400
No one will notice.

608
00:30:43,714 --> 00:30:45,314
But if these...

609
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:47,480
I have a stomachache suddenly...

610
00:30:49,795 --> 00:30:50,728
I'll go with her to the toilet.

611
00:30:50,755 --> 00:30:52,250
-It hurts so much.
-What do you want to drink, Siyu?

612
00:30:52,342 --> 00:30:53,571
I'll get you one.

613
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:54,542
You guys are going to the toilet

614
00:30:54,577 --> 00:30:55,850
or to buy drinks?

615
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:33,942
Who is it?

616
00:31:35,171 --> 00:31:36,028
Must be him.

617
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:37,514
At times like this,

618
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,911
the leading character would definitely come to help.

619
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,435
Why are you doing all alone?

620
00:32:03,314 --> 00:32:04,200
I...

621
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,915
This is the division of labor chart.

622
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,346
All personnel must follow it.

623
00:32:18,497 --> 00:32:19,991
Do not leave your position, understand?

624
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,453
Also?

625
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:23,982
Also,

626
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,573
don't ignore the details

627
00:32:25,626 --> 00:32:26,560
just because the time is running up.

628
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:27,884
Do everything perfectly.

629
00:32:28,293 --> 00:32:29,306
Did you guys all hear me?

630
00:32:30,693 --> 00:32:31,733
Cai Siyu, why you did that?

631
00:32:31,771 --> 00:32:32,828
We didn't say we weren't gonna do it.

632
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,808
Exactly, what's the point of snitching?

633
00:32:35,228 --> 00:32:36,428
I didn't.

634
00:32:36,586 --> 00:32:37,191
Assistant He.

635
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,110
Do check in the way

636
00:32:40,514 --> 00:32:41,742
like putting the price tags on

637
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,771
every time when a job is done.

638
00:32:43,004 --> 00:32:44,020
If we have a similar problem,

639
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,844
keep me posted.

640
00:32:46,342 --> 00:32:46,828
OK.

641
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,582
What did you check?

642
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:52,835
All right, go ahead.

643
00:32:52,853 --> 00:32:53,740
What did I check?

644
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:56,685
Let's go.

645
00:32:58,942 --> 00:33:00,371
He not only helped me,

646
00:33:00,514 --> 00:33:02,200
but also avenged for me,

647
00:33:02,342 --> 00:33:03,914
and tried to keep me out of trouble.

648
00:33:05,457 --> 00:33:07,085
What kind of perfect leading character is this?

649
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:08,444
I screwed you the first three times.

650
00:33:08,497 --> 00:33:09,770
I am so sorry.

651
00:33:10,311 --> 00:33:11,740
But without those three accidents,

652
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,582
how could we get to where we are today?

653
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,133
Come and get something to eat.

654
00:33:16,657 --> 00:33:17,885
Here, take that away for a second.

655
00:33:18,114 --> 00:33:19,028
Come on, come on.

656
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:22,000
The red ones are beef burgers

657
00:33:22,114 --> 00:33:23,285
with beef and onions.

658
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,514
And this one is chicken burger

659
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:26,914
with fried chicken and tomatoes.

660
00:33:27,528 --> 00:33:28,408
Siyu, which one do you want?

661
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:29,537
Can I have both?

662
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:30,342
I know I can't.

663
00:33:30,382 --> 00:33:31,244
Then I'll have the chicken burger.

664
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,311
-Here you are.
-Thanks.

665
00:33:33,714 --> 00:33:34,371
Director.

666
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,564
We have beef burger and chicken burger,

667
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:36,506
which one do you want?

668
00:33:37,813 --> 00:33:38,604
Beef burger.

669
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,714
Alright.

670
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:42,115
Hi, this one, no onions, thanks.

671
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:43,050
OK.

672
00:33:44,057 --> 00:33:45,114
What?

673
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,800
I finally got a chance?

674
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,515
That's enough.

675
00:33:48,755 --> 00:33:49,540
Give them more.

676
00:33:49,786 --> 00:33:50,820
I thought you didn't eat beef.

677
00:33:51,804 --> 00:33:52,631
Here, chicken burger.

678
00:33:58,885 --> 00:33:59,657
No?

679
00:34:03,146 --> 00:34:04,540
Have a little more.

680
00:34:10,428 --> 00:34:11,285
A little more.

681
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:15,999
Director Lu.

682
00:34:18,027 --> 00:34:18,684
What's the matter?

683
00:34:19,685 --> 00:34:20,314
Thank you.

684
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,400
For what?

685
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:24,345
You know, because of the price tag matter,

686
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,964
you've reassigned jobs.

687
00:34:29,485 --> 00:34:30,342
I was trying to improve

688
00:34:30,428 --> 00:34:30,971
work efficiency.

689
00:34:32,123 --> 00:34:32,599
What's up?

690
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,657
You thought it had something to do with you?

691
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,599
Is it on?

692
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:37,083
Are we getting into the

693
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,141
enemy scene again?

694
00:34:38,456 --> 00:34:39,856
So unimaginative.

695
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,456
Enjoy your meal here.

696
00:34:46,371 --> 00:34:47,400
Cai Siyu.

697
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,028
I didn't know

698
00:34:49,047 --> 00:34:49,625
how you convinced Ms. Lu

699
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,244
to let you get into Deer Sing.

700
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,128
But I hope

701
00:34:53,572 --> 00:34:54,692
that you're capable enough

702
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,649
to do your job,

703
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,360
or I'm going to ask you to leave.

704
00:34:57,771 --> 00:34:58,914
See?

705
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,568
That's usually how it goes.

706
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,800
You won't be willing to let me go later.

707
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Save me in time of danger.

708
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,084
What an old plot.

709
00:35:23,635 --> 00:35:25,440
Bu it's so good.

710
00:35:25,742 --> 00:35:26,457
Are you OK?

711
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,142
This is for you, director Lu.

712
00:35:30,285 --> 00:35:31,085
No onions.

713
00:35:53,771 --> 00:35:54,057
Ms. Lu.

714
00:35:54,142 --> 00:35:55,485
What are you doing?

715
00:35:55,714 --> 00:35:57,485
Why do you call me here to check on

716
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,497
the exhibition at such late hour?

717
00:35:58,542 --> 00:35:59,114
Director Lu.

718
00:36:01,485 --> 00:36:02,171
Fangning.

719
00:36:04,257 --> 00:36:04,828
Look.

720
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,000
All the arrangements

721
00:36:06,085 --> 00:36:06,600
are done already.

722
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,485
We can open in two days on time.

723
00:36:10,771 --> 00:36:12,142
Let's take a look over here.

724
00:36:12,285 --> 00:36:13,857
Let's go. Mr. Li, come to have a look.

725
00:36:19,028 --> 00:36:20,400
This couch was designed by

726
00:36:20,457 --> 00:36:21,857
Infinity's designer Gavin.

727
00:36:22,285 --> 00:36:23,342
It's also the main presentation

728
00:36:23,457 --> 00:36:24,457
of our exhibition then.

729
00:36:25,257 --> 00:36:26,200
In the interview part,

730
00:36:26,457 --> 00:36:27,171
we'll have the designer up here

731
00:36:27,257 --> 00:36:28,028
and take the interview.

732
00:36:29,644 --> 00:36:31,140
I think it's all good here.

733
00:36:31,306 --> 00:36:32,337
Why don't we look at somewhere else?

734
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:33,028
Wait a minute.

735
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,906
I think there's something wrong with

736
00:36:34,924 --> 00:36:35,795
the couch's position.

737
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,820
What do you think, Simon?

738
00:36:40,857 --> 00:36:42,171
Maybe it's the light.

739
00:36:42,342 --> 00:36:43,171
I'll tell you what.

740
00:36:43,257 --> 00:36:43,771
Mr. Li.

741
00:36:44,808 --> 00:36:46,364
Why don't you go up there and try?

742
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:47,685
It's more intuitive.

743
00:36:48,914 --> 00:36:50,057
It's all good.

744
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,000
Don't make a big deal out of it.

745
00:36:51,171 --> 00:36:52,114
Making furniture

746
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:54,488
is all about precision in details.

747
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,408
Besides, this couch really matches

748
00:36:56,453 --> 00:36:58,008
a successful man like Mr. Li more.

749
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,031
Have a try.

750
00:36:59,828 --> 00:37:00,485
Please.

751
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,982
Mr. Li, don't be so nervous.

752
00:37:12,533 --> 00:37:14,420
You've seen everything.

753
00:37:14,628 --> 00:37:15,600
This couch really matches

754
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,057
you perfectly.

755
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:19,370
Turn a little bit to the left.

756
00:37:23,514 --> 00:37:24,800
Simon, do you think it's better

757
00:37:24,914 --> 00:37:25,857
to turn right?

758
00:37:29,228 --> 00:37:30,200
Let's turn right.

759
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,400
Maybe it's the light.

760
00:37:32,514 --> 00:37:33,914
Look how pale

761
00:37:33,971 --> 00:37:34,628
Mr. Li's face is.

762
00:37:35,285 --> 00:37:37,142
Mr. Li, sit down, don't worry.

763
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,800
Director Lu,

764
00:37:41,314 --> 00:37:42,942
even though we don't have much time left,

765
00:37:43,102 --> 00:37:44,000
but we still have to do our best

766
00:37:44,114 --> 00:37:45,085
to make it perfect.

767
00:37:45,942 --> 00:37:47,485
Yeah, time is limited.

768
00:37:48,942 --> 00:37:49,685
Otherwise,

769
00:37:50,285 --> 00:37:51,457
we can do better than this.

770
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,920
The plan was made in advance.

771
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:55,457
Why did the exhibition hall

772
00:37:55,466 --> 00:37:56,204
suddenly change their mind?

773
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,164
What do you think

774
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,600
about this, director Lu?

775
00:37:59,971 --> 00:38:00,657
People

776
00:38:01,085 --> 00:38:02,714
are easy to be manipulated.

777
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,485
Ms. Lu, are we done here?

778
00:38:07,628 --> 00:38:09,028
With this light,

779
00:38:09,057 --> 00:38:10,028
my eyes are turnining blurry.

780
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,371
That's all right, Mr. Li, thank you.

781
00:38:24,628 --> 00:38:26,314
What's wrong with this, Lu Fangning?

782
00:38:26,485 --> 00:38:27,257
Right.

783
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,031
What's wrong with this, Simon?

784
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,035
Sorry, Mr. Li.

785
00:38:32,506 --> 00:38:33,413
I forgot to tell you that

786
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:35,280
this light right here

787
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,742
almost hit

788
00:38:37,828 --> 00:38:38,600
our own staff.

789
00:38:39,085 --> 00:38:39,800
I've checked on it.

790
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:41,542
Someone did this on purpose.

791
00:38:41,914 --> 00:38:43,400
On purpose?

792
00:38:43,542 --> 00:38:45,114
Thank God Mr. Li sat here in advance,

793
00:38:45,285 --> 00:38:46,600
or it might hit somebody else.

794
00:38:46,714 --> 00:38:48,200
And that's gonna be bad.

795
00:38:48,885 --> 00:38:49,600
Lu Fangning.

796
00:38:49,644 --> 00:38:51,395
Would you like me to call an ambulance?

797
00:38:51,571 --> 00:38:52,885
No need.

798
00:38:53,085 --> 00:38:54,314
Call it when I'm dead.

799
00:38:54,914 --> 00:38:55,457
Let's go.

800
00:38:56,371 --> 00:38:57,485
How absurd.

801
00:38:59,714 --> 00:39:01,371
Ms. Lu, I'll go check over there.

802
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:02,085
Go ahead.

803
00:39:07,342 --> 00:39:08,657
When this light is fixed,

804
00:39:09,028 --> 00:39:10,200
we're almost done here.

805
00:39:11,428 --> 00:39:12,942
The rest of the place has been checked.

806
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,457
No signs of tampering.

807
00:39:14,995 --> 00:39:15,724
Don't worry

808
00:39:16,275 --> 00:39:17,377
about the exhibition.

809
00:39:18,506 --> 00:39:19,946
You've done a lot, Simon.

810
00:39:21,142 --> 00:39:22,085
It's alright.

811
00:39:25,885 --> 00:39:27,400
What? In a bad mood?

812
00:39:28,771 --> 00:39:30,228
Why do you say that suddenly?

813
00:39:31,942 --> 00:39:33,257
I saw you come here

814
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,257
with a long face.

815
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,533
You didn't even argue with him and just directly went to the point.

816
00:39:38,524 --> 00:39:40,355
Had a fight with Ling Rui?

817
00:39:42,204 --> 00:39:44,257
No, we're fine.

818
00:39:44,373 --> 00:39:44,970
Fangning.

819
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,075
If you have anything bothering you,

820
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:50,168
remember that you still have me.

821
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,688
If anyone bullies you,

822
00:39:51,715 --> 00:39:52,960
I can beat him up for you.

823
00:39:55,048 --> 00:39:55,822
If you just want to

824
00:39:55,848 --> 00:39:56,940
let it all out,

825
00:39:57,235 --> 00:39:58,328
I could do boxing with you.

826
00:39:59,685 --> 00:40:00,342
In short,

827
00:40:00,808 --> 00:40:02,370
don't keep it all to yourself.

828
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:07,080
It always takes

829
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,164
some experience to grow up.

830
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,631
You told me this.

831
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,080
If I tell you,

832
00:40:14,115 --> 00:40:14,850
you might just

833
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,195
beat the crap out of me.

834
00:40:21,171 --> 00:40:22,771
Hold on, I'm gonna borrow someone from you.

835
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,000
Simon, bye.

836
00:40:27,114 --> 00:40:27,657
Let's go.

837
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:47,428
What does she want from me?

838
00:40:47,657 --> 00:40:48,714
And with this vibe...

839
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:50,302
Is it too early for

840
00:40:50,337 --> 00:40:51,502
the break up scene?

841
00:40:52,755 --> 00:40:54,115
How's your work recently?

842
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,360
It goes well.

843
00:40:55,493 --> 00:40:56,728
What can I do for you, Ms. Lu?

844
00:41:13,057 --> 00:41:13,828
Have you

845
00:41:14,314 --> 00:41:15,457
ever been in love?

846
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,542
I...

847
00:41:19,971 --> 00:41:21,171
Yes, I think.

848
00:41:23,371 --> 00:41:24,000
That's good.
