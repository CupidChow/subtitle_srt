1
00:01:45,043 --> 00:01:45,781
As for that drug

2
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:47,164
Did you put it in your night table?

3
00:01:47,392 --> 00:01:48,076
Listen to me

4
00:01:48,292 --> 00:01:49,296
I made an appointment with Lu Fangning today

5
00:01:49,916 --> 00:01:50,812
On the top suite

6
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,247
Bring some liquor after a moment

7
00:01:56,694 --> 00:01:58,051
Let her have a taste

8
00:02:28,325 --> 00:02:29,095
Miss Lu

9
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,884
Miss Lu

10
00:02:33,712 --> 00:02:34,327
Are you OK?

11
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,410
What are you doing here?

12
00:02:37,394 --> 00:02:40,271
It hurts! It hurts!

13
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:48,601
The person who dares to tease me

14
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:49,672
was not born yet!

15
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:52,101
You are a bit too confident!

16
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:54,141
Even though you can solve it this time

17
00:02:54,768 --> 00:02:55,749
Are you sure

18
00:02:55,794 --> 00:02:57,026
you can protect yourself every time?

19
00:02:58,382 --> 00:02:59,169
I have always been

20
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,172
protecting myself

21
00:03:00,936 --> 00:03:02,395
What did the bastard say just now?

22
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:03,729
I recorded it by my cellphone

23
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:05,416
Whatever he dares to do,

24
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:07,161
I will accuse him until he losses all the property

25
00:03:07,161 --> 00:03:08,050
and stay in prison for the rest of his life

26
00:03:12,621 --> 00:03:15,049
Why are you coming back?

27
00:03:16,025 --> 00:03:17,113
I will go if you have nothing else

28
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:17,923
You worry about me?

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:32,766
What's wrong with you?

30
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:37,691
Well, I have a stomachache

31
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:39,412
Look, you are so poor now

32
00:03:39,823 --> 00:03:40,530
You must go to a hospital

33
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:41,020
I will go there together with you

34
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:42,035
No, thanks

35
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,098
I need to work in a moment

36
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,010
I will be OK soon

37
00:03:45,249 --> 00:03:46,321
You're in pain like this

38
00:03:46,321 --> 00:03:47,188
How can you work?

39
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:47,860
Let's go

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,958
Get away!

41
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:50,368
OK

42
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:51,725
You let me go

43
00:03:51,987 --> 00:03:53,549
I will call 120

44
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,795
I am not your patient

45
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,858
You don't need to make decisions

46
00:04:04,858 --> 00:04:05,668
for me

47
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,463
Sorry

48
00:04:18,463 --> 00:04:19,702
I am sorry for what I said just

49
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,587
If you really want to help me,

50
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:28,981
could you please

51
00:04:29,346 --> 00:04:30,532
take me to some place?

52
00:04:33,644 --> 00:04:35,320
This is

53
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,007
very important to me

54
00:04:50,072 --> 00:04:50,756
Thank you!

55
00:04:54,325 --> 00:04:55,590
Don't eat cold food

56
00:04:57,346 --> 00:04:58,041
I know

57
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,482
Thanks!

58
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:10,332
Miss Lu

59
00:06:10,514 --> 00:06:11,913
The food tastes good here

60
00:06:12,144 --> 00:06:13,102
That's good you like it

61
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,393
When you come here next time,

62
00:06:15,473 --> 00:06:16,488
you can go to Manager Wang

63
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:17,730
Tell him my name

64
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,726
OK, thank you!

65
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:21,025
You're welcome

66
00:06:24,445 --> 00:06:25,380
Has the car arrived?

67
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:27,330
Yes. The driver is over there

68
00:06:30,818 --> 00:06:31,411
Miss Lu

69
00:06:31,753 --> 00:06:32,676
I am terribly sorry this time

70
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:33,588
I really cannot help you

71
00:06:34,056 --> 00:06:34,603
That's okay

72
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:36,620
See you

73
00:06:36,678 --> 00:06:38,331
See you, Manager Sun. See you

74
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:52,091
He has left

75
00:06:56,492 --> 00:06:57,700
Why is it so painful?

76
00:07:06,274 --> 00:07:06,844
Miss Lu

77
00:07:53,475 --> 00:07:54,452
Are you OK?

78
00:07:59,924 --> 00:08:02,044
Watch your diet and seek medical treatment timely

79
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,165
Thank you!

80
00:08:05,123 --> 00:08:05,898
You're welcome

81
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:08,064
Miss Lu

82
00:08:08,816 --> 00:08:09,740
It is so hard for me to find you here

83
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:10,606
Thank you for your

84
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:11,416
long-term support for my restaurant

85
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,499
We have prepared

86
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:13,331
A special gift for you

87
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:14,175
A wind chime

88
00:08:14,437 --> 00:08:15,691
Wish your love

89
00:08:15,691 --> 00:08:16,227
last forever

90
00:08:19,852 --> 00:08:21,003
Thank you!

91
00:08:21,152 --> 00:08:21,904
You're welcome

92
00:08:29,257 --> 00:08:29,919
Ling Rui

93
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:33,772
Could you please send me home?

94
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:10,253
Thank you!

95
00:09:24,322 --> 00:09:25,587
I'll get something for you to eat

96
00:09:28,562 --> 00:09:29,349
Don't go out

97
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:30,968
Come on

98
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:34,605
Would you mind staying with me

99
00:09:34,913 --> 00:09:36,030
tonight?

100
00:09:40,533 --> 00:09:41,103
What's the matter?

101
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:46,860
What's the matter?

102
00:09:58,876 --> 00:09:59,936
Drink with an empty stomach

103
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,544
You have taken some drugs

104
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:02,931
It may have

105
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:03,562
some side effect

106
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:06,321
You will be OK after vomiting

107
00:10:07,563 --> 00:10:08,783
I'll get something for you to eat

108
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:12,581
I will give all my money to you

109
00:12:13,105 --> 00:12:14,508
No. I don't need it

110
00:14:07,018 --> 00:14:07,873
No

111
00:14:10,313 --> 00:14:10,997
I'm not

112
00:14:15,147 --> 00:14:16,173
No

113
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,445
Lu Fangning

114
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:26,809
Are you OK?

115
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,676
Why are you still here?

116
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,158
I cooked some porridge

117
00:14:37,024 --> 00:14:37,959
Your stomach is empty now

118
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,646
Do you wanna have some?

119
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:41,413
It's good for your health

120
00:15:12,844 --> 00:15:13,985
You cleaned it?

121
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:17,826
Sorry

122
00:15:18,932 --> 00:15:20,107
Sorry to move your things

123
00:15:20,939 --> 00:15:21,999
But it's really so...

124
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:26,776
Porridge

125
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,953
I also have a pot

126
00:15:29,478 --> 00:15:31,119
It was cooked just now. Have a taste?

127
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:36,250
You can do everything!

128
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,567
Yummy!

129
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,034
Why don't you go back?

130
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,349
Do you think

131
00:15:49,873 --> 00:15:51,321
I look cute when I am eating

132
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:52,598
So you want to look at me for more times?

133
00:15:53,054 --> 00:15:54,125
Just enjoy your porridge

134
00:16:01,969 --> 00:16:03,063
I've taken your advice

135
00:16:03,246 --> 00:16:04,363
I didn't eat anything cold

136
00:16:05,252 --> 00:16:06,746
So you just drank alcohol?

137
00:16:20,985 --> 00:16:22,478
Lu Fangning, what do you really want?

138
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,635
You sent this to me

139
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:25,306
What do you mean?

140
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,153
What have I done to you?

141
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,201
No. Please say it clearly

142
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:29,877
Listen

143
00:16:30,368 --> 00:16:31,154
If you dare to threaten me again

144
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:32,146
I will send the record to him

145
00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:32,853
Then, on the Board meeting,

146
00:16:32,921 --> 00:16:33,765
you will never get it

147
00:16:33,765 --> 00:16:34,380
the vote

148
00:16:34,392 --> 00:16:35,213
from

149
00:16:35,213 --> 00:16:36,262
our

150
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:36,809
Yang's family

151
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:38,029
Your choices

152
00:16:38,154 --> 00:16:39,328
will never come true

153
00:16:40,685 --> 00:16:41,722
Don't look at me like that

154
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,771
For me

155
00:16:42,771 --> 00:16:43,774
Although I want to promote

156
00:16:43,774 --> 00:16:44,766
my brand,

157
00:16:44,926 --> 00:16:45,952
I will never

158
00:16:45,952 --> 00:16:47,024
work with such a man

159
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:47,753
Bastard

160
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:52,861
Just as what you see now

161
00:16:52,963 --> 00:16:54,810
I am now

162
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:55,847
doing something

163
00:16:56,463 --> 00:16:57,455
very, very,

164
00:16:57,455 --> 00:16:58,618
very important for me

165
00:16:59,176 --> 00:17:00,271
Not only my job

166
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:03,702
It's so ridiculous

167
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,229
If

168
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:06,791
I cannot marry immediately,

169
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,455
all what I have done

170
00:17:08,455 --> 00:17:09,447
will be in vain

171
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:13,473
I believe

172
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:16,574
you never give up easily

173
00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:18,511
But I am

174
00:17:18,522 --> 00:17:19,708
not omnipotent

175
00:17:20,494 --> 00:17:21,178
Ling Rui

176
00:17:21,852 --> 00:17:23,425
You are an excellent doctor

177
00:17:23,813 --> 00:17:24,919
But you must have

178
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:25,534
a patient

179
00:17:25,534 --> 00:17:27,187
that you are unable to save

180
00:17:27,791 --> 00:17:28,635
and something

181
00:17:29,046 --> 00:17:29,741
that you are unable

182
00:17:29,741 --> 00:17:30,892
to do

183
00:17:35,111 --> 00:17:38,177
Everybody has his pursuit

184
00:17:38,964 --> 00:17:39,796
So do I

185
00:17:40,355 --> 00:17:41,518
I have something

186
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,658
that I want to pursue and guard

187
00:17:43,975 --> 00:17:46,044
It doesn't matter what you sacrifice

188
00:17:46,203 --> 00:17:47,617
It doesn't matter what other people think of me

189
00:17:48,176 --> 00:17:49,270
We know

190
00:17:49,441 --> 00:17:50,855
what we are doing

191
00:17:50,855 --> 00:17:51,721
That's enough

192
00:17:57,478 --> 00:17:58,174
I am going to

193
00:17:58,174 --> 00:17:59,154
attend a video conference

194
00:18:02,301 --> 00:18:03,144
Thank you for your porridge

195
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,561
You're welcome

196
00:18:28,921 --> 00:18:30,357
You are still the same as you were

197
00:18:55,415 --> 00:18:55,963
Morning

198
00:19:04,068 --> 00:19:05,163
One year is a limit

199
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:26,675
Han, Meng

200
00:19:26,675 --> 00:19:27,735
You look fat!

201
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:28,297
Brother Ling Rui

202
00:19:31,646 --> 00:19:32,672
Morning, uncle

203
00:19:33,094 --> 00:19:33,892
Playing chess?

204
00:19:36,537 --> 00:19:37,266
Hello

205
00:19:42,818 --> 00:19:43,525
What are you doing here?

206
00:19:44,654 --> 00:19:45,612
What are you going to do?

207
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:47,367
Buy the breakfast

208
00:19:48,006 --> 00:19:49,191
What about the card?

209
00:19:51,506 --> 00:19:53,621
Isn't it clear?

210
00:19:53,621 --> 00:19:55,256
No. It is not clear enough

211
00:19:55,576 --> 00:19:57,092
As a business person,

212
00:19:57,103 --> 00:19:58,562
we hope everything is clear

213
00:19:58,722 --> 00:20:00,147
These words are illegible

214
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:01,284
I don't know

215
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:02,105
what you really mean

216
00:20:02,256 --> 00:20:02,689
OK

217
00:20:03,043 --> 00:20:04,206
Now, look at my eyes

218
00:20:04,206 --> 00:20:04,901
Say it clearly

219
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:06,212
Say!

220
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:11,844
If you feel embarrassed

221
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:16,758
I will not look at you. Just say

222
00:20:18,673 --> 00:20:19,334
Wait

223
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:21,420
I will take a video

224
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:22,622
I can watch your express

225
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:23,404
after going back home

226
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:24,818
Ling, you are buying vegetables?

227
00:20:24,977 --> 00:20:26,266
Morning, Grandma

228
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:27,440
Morning, Grandma. Say it

229
00:20:27,531 --> 00:20:27,907
Say!

230
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,171
Say it

231
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:33,790
There are so many people here

232
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:34,839
Say! Morning, Ling Rui

233
00:20:34,839 --> 00:20:35,728
Hello, Uncle Li

234
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:37,028
Do not say hello, OK?

235
00:20:37,244 --> 00:20:38,874
Say, just a few words

236
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,288
Is it so difficult? Say it

237
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:41,223
How can I know if you don't say it!

238
00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:42,500
What do you really think?

239
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:42,842
Say it

240
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:44,483
Say

241
00:20:46,114 --> 00:20:46,798
Do you

242
00:20:46,832 --> 00:20:47,641
wanna marry me?

243
00:20:56,739 --> 00:20:57,514
Follow me

244
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:18,537
Mom, elder aunt, younger aunt

245
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,258
This is my...

246
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:21,352
Please let

247
00:21:21,352 --> 00:21:22,846
Ling Rui sign the contract

248
00:21:25,605 --> 00:21:26,825
Sign the contract, sign the contract

249
00:21:27,532 --> 00:21:29,846
What she means is

250
00:21:29,869 --> 00:21:30,507
to sign

251
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:32,799
a life contract for accompanying each other

252
00:21:34,338 --> 00:21:35,831
Are you going to marry?

253
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:37,610
Exactly

254
00:21:39,126 --> 00:21:39,878
Marry

255
00:21:39,947 --> 00:21:40,528
Marry

256
00:21:42,899 --> 00:21:44,758
Sorry, we need to discuss about it

257
00:21:48,634 --> 00:21:49,876
Believe me. Ling Rui is right

258
00:21:50,002 --> 00:21:50,857
He is so calm

259
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:52,441
Well

260
00:21:52,453 --> 00:21:53,399
I never heard of it before

261
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,316
What do you mean?

262
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:00,718
I think this girl is very good

263
00:22:05,438 --> 00:22:05,769
Sit down

264
00:22:11,902 --> 00:22:13,122
Just get married

265
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,900
Why

266
00:22:15,037 --> 00:22:16,360
make it so strange?

267
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:18,434
Yes

268
00:22:19,176 --> 00:22:20,794
Ling Rui is such a good boy

269
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:22,356
You suddenly say

270
00:22:22,972 --> 00:22:24,648
Ling Rui is such a good boy

271
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:26,609
You three, don't worry

272
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:28,866
I will take good care of him

273
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,006
Make him white and fat

274
00:22:30,006 --> 00:22:32,389
Keep energetic, have tender skin

275
00:22:35,581 --> 00:22:36,652
You can image

276
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:38,625
Ling Rui is such a good boy

277
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,050
There must be many girls who love him

278
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,498
and want to marry him

279
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:41,942
Be married

280
00:22:42,923 --> 00:22:43,618
Married to him

281
00:22:44,713 --> 00:22:45,910
It is dangerous to

282
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,936
leave such a husband outside

283
00:22:47,141 --> 00:22:48,623
So I am

284
00:22:48,657 --> 00:22:49,398
the very girl who is suitable for him

285
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,561
Because I will depend on him for everything except money

286
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:51,769
I am the one that suits him best

287
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:01,232
Why did you say so much?

288
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:01,904
Don't worry

289
00:23:04,412 --> 00:23:05,473
I mean she has a lot of money

290
00:23:05,473 --> 00:23:06,624
Only one problem, she is so thin

291
00:23:06,841 --> 00:23:08,163
Just like me when I was young

292
00:23:08,163 --> 00:23:09,121
Don't worry

293
00:23:09,121 --> 00:23:10,250
Don't be a fuddy-duddy

294
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,036
Well

295
00:23:11,663 --> 00:23:12,632
Well

296
00:23:12,632 --> 00:23:14,034
Let me ask them more

297
00:23:15,266 --> 00:23:15,916
Calm down

298
00:23:22,573 --> 00:23:24,101
As you said

299
00:23:24,682 --> 00:23:25,800
You also think our Ling Rui

300
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,370
is very good

301
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,065
Of course

302
00:23:27,213 --> 00:23:28,878
He is treasure in the mortal world

303
00:23:29,664 --> 00:23:30,497
Little girl

304
00:23:30,873 --> 00:23:32,333
How long have you known each other?

305
00:23:32,936 --> 00:23:34,555
Do you know each other deeply?

306
00:23:36,664 --> 00:23:37,348
Five days

307
00:23:38,637 --> 00:23:39,822
Five days!

308
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,690
So quick!

309
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:50,362
Why did you say five days?

310
00:23:52,123 --> 00:23:53,092
Calm down

311
00:23:53,149 --> 00:23:53,932
Why does she...？

312
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:54,636
Fine

313
00:23:54,859 --> 00:23:55,349
OK

314
00:23:55,657 --> 00:23:56,604
I think you should

315
00:23:56,627 --> 00:23:57,459
ask this question

316
00:23:57,482 --> 00:23:58,040
Keep calm

317
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,270
Actually, listen to me

318
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:11,983
It is really...

319
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:13,431
Five days

320
00:24:14,046 --> 00:24:15,813
You can have a commemoration day

321
00:24:18,356 --> 00:24:19,655
What's your name, little girl?

322
00:24:19,678 --> 00:24:20,590
I forgot to ask you

323
00:24:21,525 --> 00:24:22,426
I am so sorry

324
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:24,375
I forgot to make a self-introduction

325
00:24:25,983 --> 00:24:27,009
My name is Lu Fangning

326
00:24:27,168 --> 00:24:28,080
Lu Fangning

327
00:24:28,297 --> 00:24:28,890
What's wrong?

328
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,292
How can you be Lu Fangning?

329
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,150
Yes. I am the woman

330
00:24:32,173 --> 00:24:33,963
who grows up in a rich family

331
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:35,491
Now

332
00:24:35,513 --> 00:24:37,223
I serve as the General Manager of Deersing Group

333
00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:38,820
I take charge of everything in my company

334
00:24:38,888 --> 00:24:40,279
Of course, shortly after today,

335
00:24:40,324 --> 00:24:41,909
the whole group will be owned by me

336
00:24:45,705 --> 00:24:47,701
What a coincidence! The cabinet in your house

337
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:48,886
is a product manufactured by our Deersing Group

338
00:24:48,886 --> 00:24:50,038
our Deersing Group

339
00:24:53,389 --> 00:24:55,179
You can go there now

340
00:25:01,928 --> 00:25:02,738
We will not go

341
00:25:04,756 --> 00:25:05,827
Do you have a lot of money?

342
00:25:08,016 --> 00:25:08,666
Then

343
00:25:10,228 --> 00:25:12,075
Do you have 4 million yuan? Of course

344
00:25:19,508 --> 00:25:20,249
Ling Rui

345
00:25:20,363 --> 00:25:21,218
Come here with me

346
00:25:22,073 --> 00:25:22,631
OK

347
00:25:34,568 --> 00:25:35,024
Mom!

348
00:25:36,358 --> 00:25:37,235
Mom!

349
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:37,714
Stop!

350
00:25:37,714 --> 00:25:38,888
Don't speak to me now

351
00:25:39,664 --> 00:25:40,348
Let me look for it

352
00:25:40,735 --> 00:25:41,807
Let me read it for you

353
00:25:42,126 --> 00:25:44,523
You sell yourself for money

354
00:25:44,523 --> 00:25:45,101
Let me read it for you

355
00:25:45,101 --> 00:25:46,224
What the end is

356
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:47,883
Mom!

357
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,657
It's against the law to sell myself

358
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,202
So

359
00:25:56,217 --> 00:25:57,027
why do you go for her?

360
00:25:57,551 --> 00:25:58,281
Mom!

361
00:25:58,714 --> 00:26:00,344
I know what marriage is

362
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,849
You tease me

363
00:26:01,849 --> 00:26:03,297
because I do not know what marriage is?

364
00:26:04,608 --> 00:26:06,215
You have known each other for only a few days

365
00:26:06,421 --> 00:26:07,663
You talk about marriage now

366
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,100
Make a film?

367
00:26:09,647 --> 00:26:10,422
Mom!

368
00:26:10,513 --> 00:26:11,802
Come on!

369
00:26:11,802 --> 00:26:13,021
Stop talking nonsense!

370
00:26:14,355 --> 00:26:15,245
Dare you say

371
00:26:16,214 --> 00:26:17,798
you love Miss Lu?

372
00:26:17,912 --> 00:26:19,645
Are you willing to live with her for your whole life?

373
00:26:20,204 --> 00:26:20,740
You say

374
00:26:24,502 --> 00:26:24,935
I...

375
00:26:39,904 --> 00:26:40,371
I will

376
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,933
mortgage the house right now

377
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:42,708
Mom!

378
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:44,509
Listen to me

379
00:26:45,342 --> 00:26:46,379
Maybe our marriage

380
00:26:46,858 --> 00:26:47,736
seems hasty

381
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:48,921
for you

382
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:51,031
But it is the best opportunity

383
00:26:51,373 --> 00:26:52,421
for us

384
00:26:52,991 --> 00:26:55,009
You have known each other for only a few days

385
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,583
A few days does not

386
00:26:56,788 --> 00:26:58,806
mean our marriage will be short

387
00:26:59,205 --> 00:26:59,683
Right?

388
00:27:00,276 --> 00:27:00,972
Five days

389
00:27:01,394 --> 00:27:02,636
A few days is enough for me to know her

390
00:27:03,503 --> 00:27:04,358
In fact,

391
00:27:04,871 --> 00:27:06,125
we have known each other for a long time

392
00:27:07,618 --> 00:27:08,553
A long time?

393
00:27:09,237 --> 00:27:10,605
A long time?

394
00:27:11,175 --> 00:27:12,520
She does not know it

395
00:27:13,318 --> 00:27:14,584
If we calculate the time from the day

396
00:27:14,584 --> 00:27:15,872
we met,

397
00:27:16,727 --> 00:27:17,240
Mom!

398
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,361
your grandson would go to primary school now

399
00:27:19,999 --> 00:27:20,626
Come on

400
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:21,846
Don't make such a joke

401
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:27,592
I am not making a joke

402
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:31,890
Please listen to me

403
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:36,473
Say it

404
00:27:36,746 --> 00:27:38,593
I am not a child now

405
00:27:39,631 --> 00:27:40,315
I know

406
00:27:40,782 --> 00:27:41,933
We can

407
00:27:42,047 --> 00:27:43,746
exchange many things with money

408
00:27:44,476 --> 00:27:45,342
But I think

409
00:27:45,342 --> 00:27:46,437
it is not right for feelings

410
00:27:46,904 --> 00:27:47,828
between people

411
00:27:50,142 --> 00:27:51,065
At present, she is strange

412
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,901
for me

413
00:27:54,713 --> 00:27:56,093
But I want to spend some time

414
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:57,917
knowing more about her

415
00:27:58,726 --> 00:28:00,516
You want to know more about her

416
00:28:03,526 --> 00:28:05,612
Silly child

417
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:08,075
That's love!

418
00:28:08,565 --> 00:28:09,249
Why do you

419
00:28:09,249 --> 00:28:10,685
feel embarrassed to speak it out?

420
00:28:11,164 --> 00:28:12,156
You should speak it out as early as possible

421
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:13,159
Am I

422
00:28:13,456 --> 00:28:14,972
an insensible mum?

423
00:28:18,347 --> 00:28:18,791
Mom!

424
00:28:19,692 --> 00:28:20,820
Yes, you are right

425
00:28:24,423 --> 00:28:25,882
I know you feel reluctant to part with me

426
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,504
But please believe me

427
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:30,602
I am voluntary to

428
00:28:30,613 --> 00:28:31,799
say with her

429
00:28:33,395 --> 00:28:34,398
I am voluntary

430
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,986
I swear

431
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:38,959
I am really voluntary

432
00:28:38,981 --> 00:28:40,213
say with her

433
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:43,895
You dare to swear!

434
00:28:43,895 --> 00:28:45,024
Do you want to

435
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:46,369
marry to her family

436
00:28:46,506 --> 00:28:48,010
and change your surname to her surname

437
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,447
Then, next time when I meet you,

438
00:28:49,447 --> 00:28:50,986
I should call you Mr. Lu

439
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,913
Yes or no? Yes or no?

440
00:28:52,913 --> 00:28:54,167
You are ungrateful. I hurts, mom

441
00:28:54,589 --> 00:28:55,888
You are ungrateful

442
00:28:57,963 --> 00:28:58,693
Mom!

443
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,261
Silly son

444
00:29:10,971 --> 00:29:11,632
I'm full

445
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:13,604
Yes

446
00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:15,292
I haven't had such a feeling for a long time

447
00:29:16,158 --> 00:29:18,073
Don't you eat breakfast?

448
00:29:18,564 --> 00:29:19,441
A cup of coffee

449
00:29:21,174 --> 00:29:23,386
Since you have a stomach disease, you should eat breakfast

450
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:24,731
Not only a cup of coffee

451
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,316
OK

452
00:29:27,513 --> 00:29:28,699
Our cooperation is

453
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:29,565
very smooth

454
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:30,500
I feel very satisfied

455
00:29:33,247 --> 00:29:34,205
What about your family members?

456
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:35,813
I will tell them

457
00:29:35,892 --> 00:29:37,226
Before official signing,

458
00:29:37,249 --> 00:29:38,431
I still have something to do

459
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:39,882
I will inform you at that time

460
00:29:41,011 --> 00:29:42,995
In a word, after this experience,

461
00:29:43,018 --> 00:29:44,522
I feel confident in

462
00:29:44,545 --> 00:29:45,389
meeting parents

463
00:29:50,245 --> 00:29:50,873
Well

464
00:29:51,078 --> 00:29:52,115
Let me send you to the hospital

465
00:29:52,252 --> 00:29:53,666
You change your clothes now

466
00:29:53,677 --> 00:29:54,475
I will wait for you here

467
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:55,946
No, thanks

468
00:29:56,698 --> 00:29:58,374
Your car is so high-profile

469
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:00,027
It is improper to drive this car and go to the hospital

470
00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:02,227
I have to go back now

471
00:30:03,367 --> 00:30:04,154
Wait

472
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:09,147
What do you want?

473
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:10,778
We need to get used to

474
00:30:10,778 --> 00:30:11,656
Such intimate behavior

475
00:30:11,781 --> 00:30:12,716
Just keep it for three seconds

476
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:14,437
One

477
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:17,356
Two

478
00:30:19,807 --> 00:30:20,799
Two

479
00:30:28,186 --> 00:30:28,574
Three

480
00:30:29,018 --> 00:30:29,531
All right

481
00:30:31,971 --> 00:30:33,043
I will go back. OK

482
00:30:45,424 --> 00:30:46,917
Morning, boss

483
00:30:48,057 --> 00:30:49,334
If bastard Yang comes

484
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:50,181
for me,

485
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:50,884
I won't see them

486
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:52,241
no matter old or young

487
00:30:52,925 --> 00:30:53,370
OK

488
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,327
By the way

489
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,467
Tell Lu Fangning

490
00:30:56,642 --> 00:30:58,117
I agree to open the card for her

491
00:30:58,933 --> 00:30:59,800
Thank you, boss

492
00:31:02,137 --> 00:31:03,414
Why do you thank me?

493
00:31:04,075 --> 00:31:04,508
Yes

494
00:31:04,554 --> 00:31:05,682
Why do I thank you?

495
00:31:13,526 --> 00:31:15,293
I like the odor of

496
00:31:15,304 --> 00:31:15,863
the hair spray

497
00:31:16,969 --> 00:31:18,553
There is a love heart here

498
00:31:19,066 --> 00:31:20,446
That's good. Keep working hard

499
00:31:21,745 --> 00:31:22,475
Thank you, boss

500
00:31:23,228 --> 00:31:24,630
So, my boss, what about my

501
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:25,200
quarterly bonus?

502
00:31:25,211 --> 00:31:25,690
Get out

503
00:31:26,648 --> 00:31:27,115
OK

504
00:31:36,532 --> 00:31:37,312
Is Fangning here?

505
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:37,786
Mr. Yang

506
00:31:37,797 --> 00:31:38,139
Please wait for a moment

507
00:31:38,185 --> 00:31:39,063
Fangning. Mr. Yang

508
00:31:39,656 --> 00:31:40,841
Fangning. Mr. Yang

509
00:31:40,989 --> 00:31:41,582
Fangning

510
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,851
Miss Lu, what about this?

511
00:31:45,276 --> 00:31:46,655
What's going on?

512
00:31:47,203 --> 00:31:48,400
Mr. Yang comes here

513
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,802
Why didn't you serve him?

514
00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:50,304
I...

515
00:31:51,204 --> 00:31:52,549
Did you give him a cup of coffee?

516
00:31:52,686 --> 00:31:53,496
You forgot it?

517
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:54,887
Look

518
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:56,745
You will lose your bonus this month

519
00:31:56,893 --> 00:31:57,383
Go out

520
00:31:58,706 --> 00:31:59,128
Yes

521
00:32:02,548 --> 00:32:02,935
Sit down

522
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:05,968
I do not know

523
00:32:05,968 --> 00:32:06,800
why Mr. Yang comes here today?

524
00:32:08,613 --> 00:32:09,320
Let off Yang Ming

525
00:32:09,787 --> 00:32:11,223
On the next Board meeting,

526
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,059
I will agree you on establishing Infinity

527
00:32:14,575 --> 00:32:16,096
Mr. Yang never

528
00:32:16,126 --> 00:32:16,821
bring me a little surprise

529
00:32:17,482 --> 00:32:18,577
Since you

530
00:32:18,577 --> 00:32:19,728
speak so frankly,

531
00:32:20,161 --> 00:32:21,222
You let

532
00:32:22,327 --> 00:32:23,160
your son

533
00:32:23,502 --> 00:32:25,533
make an apology to me on the newspaper

534
00:32:25,645 --> 00:32:26,819
And he should swear that

535
00:32:27,036 --> 00:32:28,643
he will never

536
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,011
stretch his vicious hands to any innocent woman

537
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:32,371
Then, he should go to the public security bureau and confess his crime

538
00:32:32,371 --> 00:32:34,398
You! You want to destroy him

539
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:35,962
You will also destroy your fame

540
00:32:38,026 --> 00:32:39,405
I never did anything wrong

541
00:32:39,838 --> 00:32:41,093
How could he destroy my fame?

542
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:42,164
Besides,

543
00:32:42,586 --> 00:32:43,281
since he did something wrong,

544
00:32:43,281 --> 00:32:44,672
he should face the music

545
00:32:44,763 --> 00:32:47,180
What? Dare to do, but dare not to take the responsibility?

546
00:32:51,661 --> 00:32:53,143
You are too young!

547
00:32:53,508 --> 00:32:54,613
You do not know

548
00:32:54,613 --> 00:32:55,708
such things will have a negative impact on a girl

549
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:57,464
I just want to

550
00:32:57,464 --> 00:32:58,104
deal with this matter in private

551
00:32:58,104 --> 00:32:59,377
Just for your sake

552
00:32:59,652 --> 00:33:00,222
Where is your father?

553
00:33:00,758 --> 00:33:02,092
I have known Mr. Lu for such a long time

554
00:33:02,478 --> 00:33:03,688
I can talk with him about it

555
00:33:08,592 --> 00:33:10,027
Hey, Lu

556
00:33:11,007 --> 00:33:12,170
The matters about Yang Ming

557
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,587
I will accuse him

558
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:16,730
until he stays in prison for the rest of his life

559
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:20,686
Mr. Yang

560
00:33:21,781 --> 00:33:23,707
Why are you here? Mr. Yang

561
00:33:24,426 --> 00:33:25,531
Mr. Lu

562
00:33:25,896 --> 00:33:27,663
It is just an accident

563
00:33:27,663 --> 00:33:28,325
An accident

564
00:33:28,689 --> 00:33:29,524
Could you please

565
00:33:29,524 --> 00:33:30,183
forgive him

566
00:33:30,194 --> 00:33:31,197
for my sake?

567
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,224
In future,

568
00:33:32,269 --> 00:33:33,250
I will criticize this bastard

569
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:33,763
strictly!

570
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:35,131
You teach him a lesson?

571
00:33:35,404 --> 00:33:36,636
I think no need for you to teach him a lesson!

572
00:33:36,955 --> 00:33:38,414
We've got someone else

573
00:33:38,881 --> 00:33:40,044
What's wrong with Yang Ming?

574
00:33:40,056 --> 00:33:40,762
Don't you know?

575
00:33:41,047 --> 00:33:43,282
He repeatedly molested women

576
00:33:43,715 --> 00:33:44,958
This is not the first time

577
00:33:45,767 --> 00:33:46,873
He dare to put his hands on

578
00:33:46,873 --> 00:33:47,420
Fangning

579
00:33:48,127 --> 00:33:49,397
Is he tired of living?

580
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:50,692
He doesn't want to live, does he?

581
00:33:51,011 --> 00:33:52,197
He even blamed Fangning for his hands laying heavy

582
00:33:52,357 --> 00:33:53,884
Why she didn't broke his leg?

583
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,287
Mr. Lu, let me tell you

584
00:33:55,777 --> 00:33:56,506
This time,

585
00:33:57,042 --> 00:33:59,790
you have to pay for the legal cost and attorney fees

586
00:34:09,811 --> 00:34:11,099
He is unhappy?!

587
00:34:12,353 --> 00:34:13,311
Listen

588
00:34:13,311 --> 00:34:14,964
This is so called fish begins to stink at the head

589
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:16,833
Not all like this

590
00:34:16,844 --> 00:34:18,372
I think I am a good fish

591
00:34:20,344 --> 00:34:21,153
About this,

592
00:34:21,154 --> 00:34:22,496
you need to do self-criticism

593
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:23,218
Yourself,

594
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,540
you have responsibilities

595
00:34:25,737 --> 00:34:26,512
I will leave if it's OK

596
00:34:26,638 --> 00:34:28,211
One more thing, Mr. Lu

597
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,353
To inform you officially,

598
00:34:30,353 --> 00:34:31,425
I am getting married

599
00:34:31,597 --> 00:34:32,099
Go ahead

600
00:34:37,138 --> 00:34:38,061
Who is getting married?

601
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:39,954
Me

602
00:34:40,717 --> 00:34:41,219
You?

603
00:34:41,356 --> 00:34:41,935
I...

604
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:42,940
Marry

605
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,032
How come you are getting married?

606
00:34:47,739 --> 00:34:48,777
Who approved that?

607
00:34:48,777 --> 00:34:49,837
You let me to get married

608
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:55,199
No. All right then

609
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,688
I will not ask more

610
00:34:56,701 --> 00:34:58,422
Right, one more question,

611
00:34:58,491 --> 00:34:59,768
who is the guy?

612
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,500
What is the name, what's his job?

613
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,207
What degree did he earn?

614
00:35:02,207 --> 00:35:02,847
Where does he work?

615
00:35:02,847 --> 00:35:03,678
Don't worry

616
00:35:03,689 --> 00:35:05,354
He is very handsome. His parents...

617
00:35:05,388 --> 00:35:06,052
What do his parents do?

618
00:35:06,052 --> 00:35:06,564
Tall and strong

619
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:07,383
Family condition, the most important thing

620
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:08,500
He is really strong of his body

621
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,176
Strong and muscular

622
00:35:11,373 --> 00:35:12,069
Why don't you go to

623
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:13,334
find a weight lifter?

624
00:35:14,634 --> 00:35:15,648
Strong and muscular

625
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:18,339
It is decided

626
00:35:22,911 --> 00:35:23,526
How about this,

627
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:25,738
you ask him and his parents

628
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,699
to come to our home

629
00:35:28,531 --> 00:35:29,352
Marriage is a big event

630
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:30,382
I have to meet

631
00:35:30,412 --> 00:35:31,028
his parents

632
00:35:31,997 --> 00:35:32,658
OK?

633
00:35:35,337 --> 00:35:35,930
As soon as possible

634
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,054
As soon as possible

635
00:35:41,755 --> 00:35:43,260
Bed number 36,

636
00:35:43,395 --> 00:35:44,742
although the focus has been cut,

637
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,395
he still needs follow-up treatments

638
00:35:47,387 --> 00:35:48,772
I will make a plan with internal medicine department

639
00:35:48,801 --> 00:35:49,907
I will show you later

640
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,452
Doctor Ling,

641
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,242
Appointment for the meal has not been made,

642
00:35:55,242 --> 00:35:56,268
you showed up directly

643
00:35:59,894 --> 00:36:01,364
I have two tickets

644
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,766
for the comic dialogue show

645
00:36:03,496 --> 00:36:04,841
You said you like it last time

646
00:36:05,628 --> 00:36:06,506
I don't know

647
00:36:07,007 --> 00:36:08,546
if you are free tonight?

648
00:36:08,615 --> 00:36:09,299
Sorry

649
00:36:09,652 --> 00:36:10,872
I have had plans tonight

650
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:14,520
That's okay

651
00:36:15,136 --> 00:36:16,071
I'd like to

652
00:36:16,094 --> 00:36:16,880
I will go with you

653
00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:22,877
Previously,

654
00:36:23,253 --> 00:36:25,225
you know to find an excuse when you refuse

655
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:26,502
Now you act so neatly

656
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:26,958
quarterly bonus?

657
00:36:28,178 --> 00:36:29,615
Times changed

658
00:36:31,383 --> 00:36:31,872
Li,

659
00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:33,823
can you please give the medical history of bed number 36

660
00:36:33,823 --> 00:36:34,380
to me to have a look?

661
00:36:35,691 --> 00:36:36,512
Thank you. Why this is different?

662
00:36:37,082 --> 00:36:38,609
Something out of reach!

663
00:36:52,495 --> 00:36:53,622
Wait, what's this?

664
00:36:53,647 --> 00:36:54,661
Who asked to take so many exams?

665
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:55,482
Pre-marital physical check-ups

666
00:36:56,668 --> 00:36:57,420
I am getting married

667
00:37:01,604 --> 00:37:02,300
Thanks, Li

668
00:37:05,229 --> 00:37:05,971
Get married?

669
00:37:08,114 --> 00:37:09,379
The president, Ling Rui

670
00:37:09,391 --> 00:37:10,211
Is that president?

671
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:18,602
You have got a new car

672
00:37:18,796 --> 00:37:20,215
You said the previous was

673
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:21,316
a high-profile one

674
00:37:23,379 --> 00:37:25,625
Come one, I will drive you personally today

675
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,205
Let's go

676
00:37:40,753 --> 00:37:41,152
Go ahead

677
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,626
How come this one is included?

678
00:37:44,265 --> 00:37:46,089
A requirement in the pre-marital physical check-ups

679
00:37:46,967 --> 00:37:48,278
Many items on this checklist

680
00:37:48,585 --> 00:37:49,680
are not pre-marital physical check-ups

681
00:37:50,216 --> 00:37:51,168
These are for us

682
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:51,937
future happiness.

683
00:37:55,049 --> 00:37:56,490
I do all kinds of business all day,

684
00:37:56,543 --> 00:37:57,934
I do not have spare time to go over this

685
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,051
Besides,

686
00:37:59,085 --> 00:38:00,316
Have a little compassion for me

687
00:38:00,328 --> 00:38:01,821
I have mysophobia,

688
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,657
very severe mental mysophobia

689
00:38:04,443 --> 00:38:05,971
So I have to make sure

690
00:38:06,028 --> 00:38:07,009
the man that

691
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,183
living with me all days and nights,

692
00:38:08,206 --> 00:38:09,859
is healthy and clean

693
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:11,192
That's good for you and me

694
00:38:11,591 --> 00:38:13,222
Not to mention that you are a doctor,

695
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,886
is a doctor afraid of exams?

696
00:38:14,886 --> 00:38:15,673
I will not look at that?

697
00:38:22,148 --> 00:38:24,098
Did you stay up late last two nights?

698
00:38:24,554 --> 00:38:25,466
Let me tell you,

699
00:38:25,466 --> 00:38:26,469
if you are going to take these exams,

700
00:38:26,469 --> 00:38:27,655
for about three to five days,

701
00:38:27,712 --> 00:38:30,254
do not stay up late. The results will be effected

702
00:39:11,945 --> 00:39:13,963
Lady, this lady,

703
00:39:17,292 --> 00:39:18,820
my husband is taking exams inside

704
00:39:19,185 --> 00:39:20,929
Rest assured, such exams

705
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:21,909
are not difficult for

706
00:39:22,001 --> 00:39:22,890
those men,

707
00:39:23,597 --> 00:39:25,090
You look very professional

708
00:39:25,808 --> 00:39:26,846
I have seen a lot here

709
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,077
You must be worrying about your husband's

710
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,921
life abilities, right?

711
00:39:30,198 --> 00:39:31,224
Does he usually stay up?

712
00:39:31,224 --> 00:39:31,988
Does he smoke or drink?

713
00:39:32,158 --> 00:39:33,447
These will all have influences

714
00:39:33,948 --> 00:39:35,328
So what should we do?

715
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,289
Keep up with good life behaviors

716
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,010
You should take exercises with him together

717
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:39,761
Have more foods containing vitamins

718
00:39:39,761 --> 00:39:41,204
Foods containing vitamins?

719
00:39:41,564 --> 00:39:42,293
Yes vitamins,

720
00:39:42,293 --> 00:39:43,399
are very important for men

721
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:44,688
Thank you. Anything else? What's more?

722
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:47,002
You are good to go. Next

723
00:39:47,241 --> 00:39:48,655
Your husband looks very healthy

724
00:39:48,814 --> 00:39:49,977
Relax, he will be OK

725
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,821
Thank you

726
00:39:54,857 --> 00:39:55,584
If you are too busy,

727
00:39:55,584 --> 00:39:56,305
you can leave me alone

728
00:39:56,875 --> 00:39:58,243
No, I am not busy

729
00:39:58,938 --> 00:39:59,542
Well

730
00:40:00,557 --> 00:40:01,492
It's done?

731
00:40:02,518 --> 00:40:03,521
It's really done?

732
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:06,839
How come so quick?

733
00:40:07,328 --> 00:40:08,571
Are you sure the exams are done?

734
00:40:10,669 --> 00:40:11,843
I am a doctor too

735
00:40:12,026 --> 00:40:13,177
If in the future, you

736
00:40:13,177 --> 00:40:13,731
have questions,

737
00:40:13,861 --> 00:40:14,921
you can just ask me

738
00:40:21,636 --> 00:40:22,571
For tomorrow's meeting,

739
00:40:23,609 --> 00:40:24,794
what do I need to pay attention to?

740
00:40:25,535 --> 00:40:26,311
Nothing special

741
00:40:26,539 --> 00:40:27,736
My marriage is none of their business

742
00:40:32,284 --> 00:40:33,139
He is nervous

743
00:40:35,636 --> 00:40:36,480
Tomorrow, only three

744
00:40:36,503 --> 00:40:37,415
will present

745
00:40:38,087 --> 00:40:39,592
You don't need to know Lu Wenbin

746
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,607
Even if you know,

747
00:40:40,686 --> 00:40:41,576
that won't make a difference

748
00:40:41,724 --> 00:40:42,625
What he's going to say

749
00:40:42,636 --> 00:40:43,810
will not make you comfortable

750
00:40:44,745 --> 00:40:45,486
Yang Yi,

751
00:40:45,725 --> 00:40:46,888
Lu Wenbin's second wife

752
00:40:47,287 --> 00:40:48,348
All she wants

753
00:40:48,427 --> 00:40:50,012
is to put on a show of a battle for family properties with me

754
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,437
After all those years,

755
00:40:51,722 --> 00:40:52,874
this show played by her

756
00:40:52,874 --> 00:40:53,808
is not yet on stage

757
00:40:54,766 --> 00:40:55,575
Lu Fangyu,

758
00:40:55,678 --> 00:40:56,522
Yang Yi's son,

759
00:40:57,263 --> 00:40:58,312
is so much afraid of me

760
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,386
I guess he only will eat tomorrow

761
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,541
That's it?

762
00:41:04,377 --> 00:41:05,517
My aunt has not yet

763
00:41:05,517 --> 00:41:06,258
told anyone else

764
00:41:06,702 --> 00:41:07,842
So you are totally of the creditor's business

765
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:09,347
What about your brother?

766
00:41:09,837 --> 00:41:11,832
He dares not

767
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,397
Relax, I got you back

768
00:41:21,888 --> 00:41:22,811
Drive carefully
