1
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,564
Begin Again

2
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,960
Episode 13

3
00:01:41,874 --> 00:01:42,925
The proposal that you just gave me

4
00:01:43,142 --> 00:01:44,137
is not like what you said.

5
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:44,914
Have a look at it.

6
00:01:45,577 --> 00:01:47,165
Okay, I'll check it.

7
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:48,937
I'll give it to you in a while.

8
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:49,874
Okay, give it to me later.

9
00:01:53,542 --> 00:01:54,228
I'm sorry.

10
00:02:03,897 --> 00:02:04,685
These flowers...

11
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:08,582
Director Lu threw

12
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,581
these flowers away last time.

13
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,217
I bumped into you accidentally last time.

14
00:02:16,754 --> 00:02:17,302
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:19,485 --> 00:02:20,457
It doesn't matter.

16
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,257
Director, we have good news.

17
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,131
We've found a replacement factory.

18
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:28,365
The equipment specifications of the production line,

19
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:29,268
quality data,

20
00:02:29,337 --> 00:02:30,491
price, and location are all very suitable.

21
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:33,085
Who negotiated this factory?

22
00:02:33,337 --> 00:02:34,788
Manager Wang from the production dept.

23
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,035
Is there a problem?

24
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,115
Let's talk about it in my office.

25
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,365
He's so cute.

26
00:02:45,302 --> 00:02:46,240
My heart, oh my.

27
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:54,994
A boy crazy.

28
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:06,285
I like the feeling of

29
00:03:06,342 --> 00:03:07,371
dining with my family.

30
00:03:08,137 --> 00:03:09,371
I'm willing to cook for them.

31
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:15,760
This is the President of Shanghai Cuisine

32
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:16,754
Professional Association,

33
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:17,920
Expert of Jiangnan Food Culture

34
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:18,971
Communication Centre,

35
00:03:19,142 --> 00:03:20,811
Honorary President of the
Yangtze River Delta Famous Chefs Association,

36
00:03:21,222 --> 00:03:22,811
Chairman of the World Chinese Cuisine Association,

37
00:03:23,062 --> 00:03:25,245
Master Guo, known as the King of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Cuisine.

38
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:29,897
May I ask Ms. Lu,

39
00:03:30,102 --> 00:03:31,314
what kind of dishes would you like to learn today?

40
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,188
As long as you can say it,

41
00:03:33,497 --> 00:03:34,617
there is nothing I can't cook.

42
00:03:37,245 --> 00:03:38,148
Stir-fried vegetables.

43
00:03:58,662 --> 00:04:00,285
Isn't it a bit too perfect?

44
00:04:12,022 --> 00:04:12,765
Add more.

45
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:23,211
Smart.

46
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,075
Sadfishing is not my style.

47
00:05:06,434 --> 00:05:06,914
You're back.

48
00:05:06,971 --> 00:05:07,474
I'm back.

49
00:05:08,937 --> 00:05:09,954
Change your shoes, here.

50
00:05:10,445 --> 00:05:11,348
I'll do it by myself.

51
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:11,942
It's okay. It's okay.

52
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:12,685
I'll help you.

53
00:05:13,577 --> 00:05:14,034
Thank you.

54
00:05:15,508 --> 00:05:17,040
How was everything going in the hospital today?

55
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:18,171
How was your work going?

56
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,291
Were you busy? Tired?

57
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,315
Quite well.

58
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,493
That's good then.

59
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,948
I'll go wash my hands first.

60
00:05:36,274 --> 00:05:38,240
Well, the vegetables you like,

61
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:38,948
fish,

62
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,194
Mapo tofu,

63
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:41,828
this is the soup I made.

64
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:45,028
I cooked all these in person.

65
00:05:47,851 --> 00:05:48,422
These...

66
00:05:49,222 --> 00:05:50,422
Did you really cook all these?

67
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,422
Of course,

68
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:53,622
I've learned from the chef

69
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,800
for several hours.

70
00:05:55,645 --> 00:05:56,445
The chef also praised me,

71
00:05:56,925 --> 00:05:57,920
as expected, a smart person

72
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,108
can do everything well.

73
00:05:59,154 --> 00:06:00,457
He said that I had

74
00:06:00,514 --> 00:06:01,771
a little talent in cooking.

75
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:03,177
Have a try.

76
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:04,811
If you think they're good,

77
00:06:04,994 --> 00:06:06,125
I'll cook for you frequently in the future.

78
00:06:06,731 --> 00:06:07,531
Let me get you some soup.

79
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:09,600
Thank you.

80
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:14,604
Try it.

81
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,631
Taste it.

82
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,635
Is it good?

83
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:35,577
Is it a little salty?

84
00:06:37,325 --> 00:06:39,508
You know it's my first time.

85
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,240
And,

86
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:41,497
the chef wasn't with me either.

87
00:06:41,748 --> 00:06:43,497
Maybe I'm not quite sure about

88
00:06:43,554 --> 00:06:44,662
the salt.

89
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:45,600
But I will

90
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,791
work hard to improve.

91
00:06:47,577 --> 00:06:48,811
If you have time,

92
00:06:48,914 --> 00:06:50,022
you can also teach me.

93
00:06:53,142 --> 00:06:53,702
Fangning,

94
00:06:54,788 --> 00:06:55,428
I said,

95
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:57,577
I don't want you to act like this.

96
00:06:59,611 --> 00:07:00,834
What do you mean?

97
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:03,280
Didn't you say before

98
00:07:03,371 --> 00:07:05,325
what you like most is the feeling

99
00:07:05,394 --> 00:07:06,742
of dining with families?

100
00:07:07,222 --> 00:07:08,262
That's why I tried hard

101
00:07:08,308 --> 00:07:09,417
to cook so many dishes.

102
00:07:09,474 --> 00:07:11,405
I want you to feel at home.

103
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,422
You

104
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:16,662
don't like it?

105
00:07:19,588 --> 00:07:20,080
Like it?

106
00:07:22,388 --> 00:07:22,868
Lu Fangning,

107
00:07:23,405 --> 00:07:24,411
although we

108
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:26,708
started this lie together,

109
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,085
I really don't like to lie.

110
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:30,331
I more dislike your lies

111
00:07:30,388 --> 00:07:31,931
one after another.

112
00:07:32,457 --> 00:07:33,931
I'm not lying.

113
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:35,691
I'm showing you

114
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:36,868
my sincerity.

115
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:37,508
Really!

116
00:07:37,794 --> 00:07:38,411
Because I love…

117
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:41,462
Okay.

118
00:07:41,737 --> 00:07:43,097
If you don't like it,

119
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:43,748
I won't say anything.

120
00:07:43,817 --> 00:07:44,274
Okay?

121
00:07:44,845 --> 00:07:46,537
But I want you to know that,

122
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:47,291
Ling Rui,

123
00:07:47,897 --> 00:07:49,291
no matter how you try to avoid,

124
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,502
you can't

125
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,828
resist my heart.

126
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:54,617
Why do you want to escape?

127
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:56,754
Are you sure you're sincere?

128
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,245
I saw the takeaway packages for

129
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:07,234
these dishes

130
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:07,965
in the trash can outside.

131
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,542
Don't tell me

132
00:08:14,057 --> 00:08:14,960
someone else has ordered

133
00:08:15,165 --> 00:08:15,965
the exactly same dishes

134
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:17,165
as these on the table.

135
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,914
But how can takeaway food

136
00:08:22,982 --> 00:08:24,205
taste so salty?

137
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:27,028
In order to pretend that you've cooked all these by yourself,

138
00:08:27,702 --> 00:08:29,280
you, as a very smart person,

139
00:08:29,794 --> 00:08:31,417
deliberately sprinkled so much salt on them.

140
00:08:36,765 --> 00:08:37,497
Lu Fangning,

141
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,514
like,

142
00:08:39,508 --> 00:08:39,862
love,

143
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,428
sincerity,

144
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:43,542
can never be

145
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,051
said out loud in a casual way.

146
00:08:46,822 --> 00:08:47,554
You can keep saying

147
00:08:47,611 --> 00:08:49,108
them over and over again in a casual way,

148
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:49,760
because

149
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,588
for you,

150
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:52,754
lies can be easily done.

151
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:54,708
Whether cooking a meal this time,

152
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:56,708
or the auction last time,

153
00:08:57,222 --> 00:08:57,942
you always think that

154
00:08:58,011 --> 00:08:59,714
money can solve all problems.

155
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,337
But you never consider

156
00:09:01,394 --> 00:09:02,217
other people's feelings.

157
00:09:02,937 --> 00:09:04,022
You just want to achieve

158
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:05,085
your own purposes.

159
00:09:07,554 --> 00:09:08,274
This may be your

160
00:09:08,331 --> 00:09:09,360
way of doing things.

161
00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:10,971
But please don't do it in

162
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,600
such a way

163
00:09:11,657 --> 00:09:12,765
to disturb my heart,

164
00:09:15,177 --> 00:09:16,297
my life.

165
00:09:19,546 --> 00:09:20,680
Let's calm down.

166
00:09:21,405 --> 00:09:22,365
I don't want to eat.

167
00:09:27,188 --> 00:09:28,468
I don't consider your feelings?

168
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,091
You know what?

169
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:33,874
It is you who

170
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,554
don't consider other people's feelings,

171
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,662
trample on other people's heart casually.

172
00:09:36,765 --> 00:09:37,245
Not me.

173
00:09:39,554 --> 00:09:40,114
Ling Rui,

174
00:09:41,302 --> 00:09:42,434
do you think

175
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,622
I lied about everything I said?

176
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:45,085
Then what should I do?

177
00:09:45,714 --> 00:09:47,142
Like stories in the romance novels

178
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:47,771
and idol dramas,

179
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:49,028
there is truth in wine, right?

180
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,440
As if no matter what the person says,

181
00:09:51,497 --> 00:09:52,445
as long as he is drunk,

182
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,011
people will believe what he has said.

183
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,645
It's okay.

184
00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:57,714
You don't believe me, do you?

185
00:09:58,937 --> 00:09:59,714
I'll show you today

186
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,302
when wine is in, truth is out.

187
00:10:05,702 --> 00:10:07,257
Drinking will not solve the problem.

188
00:10:07,371 --> 00:10:08,034
Lu Fangning,

189
00:10:08,297 --> 00:10:08,697
give it to me.

190
00:10:08,994 --> 00:10:09,451
Give me the wine.

191
00:10:09,897 --> 00:10:10,640
Don't drink it!

192
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,548
Give it to me. Give it to me!

193
00:10:15,634 --> 00:10:16,708
What are you doing?

194
00:10:20,811 --> 00:10:21,897
Don't worry.

195
00:10:22,011 --> 00:10:22,640
I can't get drunk.

196
00:10:23,337 --> 00:10:24,068
Why?

197
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,417
Because, for social activities,

198
00:10:25,565 --> 00:10:26,937
I drink some wine at home every day.

199
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:28,160
Hence, I can't get drunk.

200
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:29,954
If I can't get drunk

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,845
in my life,

202
00:10:30,902 --> 00:10:31,702
will you never trust me

203
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,028
in your life?

204
00:10:34,765 --> 00:10:35,725
I, Lu Fangning,

205
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:36,537
was not like this before.

206
00:10:36,788 --> 00:10:38,022
If I did

207
00:10:38,057 --> 00:10:38,765
something good in the past,

208
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:39,691
I would broadcast it

209
00:10:39,748 --> 00:10:41,565
and let the whole world know that

210
00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:42,582
I had done this thing.

211
00:10:43,028 --> 00:10:43,988
If I cut

212
00:10:44,045 --> 00:10:44,994
one of my fingers,

213
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,434
I would bandage

214
00:10:46,502 --> 00:10:47,474
all the rest fingers

215
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,800
and show them to you.

216
00:10:50,365 --> 00:10:51,131
But, what about now?

217
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:54,148
I worry about personal gains and losses every day.

218
00:10:54,194 --> 00:10:55,165
I'm cautious.

219
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,297
All I can think about is

220
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:57,691
whether you will be happy or not,

221
00:10:57,771 --> 00:10:58,994
whether you will be delighted.

222
00:10:59,337 --> 00:11:00,251
What I have done is wrong?

223
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:02,250
What I have done is wrong?

224
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:08,297
You think that I

225
00:11:08,582 --> 00:11:09,965
have disturbed your life.

226
00:11:12,182 --> 00:11:12,868
Haven't you

227
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:14,662
disturbed mine?

228
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:17,771
Ling Rui,

229
00:11:18,902 --> 00:11:20,171
if you don't like me,

230
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,994
you can reject me.

231
00:11:24,171 --> 00:11:25,394
Reject me!

232
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,097
Why do you

233
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:28,240
repeatedly

234
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:29,714
deny my heart for you?

235
00:11:29,805 --> 00:11:30,937
Deny my love for you?

236
00:11:32,548 --> 00:11:34,011
Is it because it makes you look

237
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,011
particularly holy and great?

238
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,746
Lu Fangning.

239
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:40,977
Stop talking. Stop!

240
00:11:41,165 --> 00:11:42,788
I hate you!

241
00:11:50,411 --> 00:11:51,085
Ling Rui,

242
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,691
from now on,

243
00:11:57,954 --> 00:11:59,520
I hate you.

244
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,245
Fangning.

245
00:12:42,982 --> 00:12:44,388
Ms. Lu's parcel.

246
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:47,497
Okay, thank you.

247
00:12:48,308 --> 00:12:50,228
I suggest you checking it in my presence.

248
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,588
Okay.

249
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,051
Then, please help me open the package.

250
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,485
Okay.

251
00:13:02,537 --> 00:13:02,971
Thank you.

252
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:03,748
You're welcome.

253
00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:34,651
I worry about personal gains and losses every day.

254
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:35,634
I'm cautious.

255
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:36,800
All I can think about is

256
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,171
whether you will be happy or not,

257
00:13:38,262 --> 00:13:39,280
whether you will be delighted.

258
00:13:39,805 --> 00:13:40,994
What I have done is wrong?

259
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,994
What I have done is wrong?

260
00:13:45,954 --> 00:13:47,097
If I cut

261
00:13:47,165 --> 00:13:48,022
one of my fingers,

262
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:49,611
I would bandage

263
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:50,582
all the rest fingers

264
00:13:50,674 --> 00:13:51,931
and show them to you.

265
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,253
Let me help you?

266
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:15,973
No, no, no.

267
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:17,142
I'll do it. Leave me.

268
00:14:17,805 --> 00:14:18,628
I'll do it by myself.

269
00:14:23,954 --> 00:14:25,131
Stir-fry it.

270
00:14:27,028 --> 00:14:28,331
It's burnt.

271
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,114
Let's try it again.

272
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,160
If Tang Ping hadn't showed up suddenly,

273
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:51,851
things wouldn't turn into this result.

274
00:14:52,822 --> 00:14:54,617
Your wife has expended much care and thought on it.

275
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:56,754
She had three plans, ABC,

276
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,444
for she didn't wanna cause you any trouble.

277
00:15:13,474 --> 00:15:14,914
See, I have some money.

278
00:15:15,862 --> 00:15:16,914
I'm going to give you all my money.

279
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:19,737
I... I don't want it.

280
00:15:40,811 --> 00:15:41,451
Fangning.

281
00:16:40,742 --> 00:16:42,400
You really don't like me at all?

282
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,320
Okay, it's done.

283
00:19:22,857 --> 00:19:23,862
Oh my, I'm hungry.

284
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:24,342
How about you?

285
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,622
Me too.

286
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:26,617
Come on,

287
00:19:27,062 --> 00:19:28,102
Dr. Ling, Dr. Liu,

288
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:28,731
Dr. Peng,

289
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,600
Nurse Wang,

290
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:30,080
come here.

291
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:31,257
Thank you for your hard work.

292
00:19:32,034 --> 00:19:32,880
Have some water.

293
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,451
Thank you.

294
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,548
Thank you for your

295
00:19:34,617 --> 00:19:35,462
service to our plant.

296
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:36,651
Come on, drink some water.

297
00:19:36,937 --> 00:19:37,508
Thank you.

298
00:19:37,954 --> 00:19:38,857
Thank you for your hard work.

299
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,525
Take a break first.

300
00:19:40,811 --> 00:19:41,840
We'll continue at 1:30 in the afternoon.

301
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,097
Okay. Please have lunch

302
00:19:43,142 --> 00:19:43,668
in our cafeteria now.

303
00:19:44,194 --> 00:19:44,697
Don't underestimate

304
00:19:44,742 --> 00:19:45,565
our cafeteria.

305
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,685
The chef

306
00:19:47,017 --> 00:19:48,491
was specially invited by

307
00:19:48,537 --> 00:19:49,302
the Jiang Cheng Group.

308
00:19:49,577 --> 00:19:50,914
He's very good at Sichuan cuisine.

309
00:19:51,577 --> 00:19:52,914
The factory of Jiang Cheng Group

310
00:19:53,154 --> 00:19:53,737
is also here?

311
00:19:54,011 --> 00:19:54,377
Yes.

312
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,124
The whole area belongs to Jiang Cheng Group.

313
00:20:08,182 --> 00:20:09,440
Amend these again.

314
00:20:09,862 --> 00:20:10,228
Okay.

315
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,062
You guys go back first.

316
00:20:13,394 --> 00:20:13,851
Okay. Okay.

317
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:14,800
Dr. Ling,

318
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,805
what a coincidence.

319
00:20:16,502 --> 00:20:17,280
Hello, Ms. Qin.

320
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:20,182
I happened to do volunteer medical consultation nearby.

321
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,457
It's not exactly a coincidence.

322
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:22,906
I want to talk to you.

323
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,044
Talk to me?

324
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,291
Is Dr. Ling here

325
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,800
to speak for Fangning this time?

326
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,306
I don't know the commercial intercourse between you two.

327
00:20:31,702 --> 00:20:33,702
I'm not trying to persuade you.

328
00:20:34,445 --> 00:20:35,497
But I want to do

329
00:20:35,554 --> 00:20:36,285
something for her indeed.

330
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:37,588
And I happened

331
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:39,097
to meet you here.

332
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:40,480
Sometimes, I do

333
00:20:40,537 --> 00:20:41,542
envy Lu Fangning.

334
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,302
She speaks the bold truth.

335
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,297
She lives freely.

336
00:20:44,628 --> 00:20:45,222
Now,

337
00:20:45,382 --> 00:20:46,628
she has a good husband like you.

338
00:20:46,948 --> 00:20:48,091
No one can really understand

339
00:20:48,171 --> 00:20:48,971
other people's lives.

340
00:20:49,554 --> 00:20:50,377
Maybe,

341
00:20:50,948 --> 00:20:52,377
she envies you, Ms. Qin.

342
00:20:52,788 --> 00:20:53,588
She told you this?

343
00:20:54,548 --> 00:20:55,131
I don't believe it

344
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:56,000
Maybe,

345
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:58,000
she likes you.

346
00:20:59,462 --> 00:21:00,502
She likes me?

347
00:21:01,108 --> 00:21:02,022
What does she like about me?

348
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:03,108
There are many

349
00:21:03,634 --> 00:21:04,880
similarities between you.

350
00:21:05,428 --> 00:21:06,125
During this period,

351
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,142
I don't know

352
00:21:07,188 --> 00:21:07,908
myself very well.

353
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,120
What do I look like?

354
00:21:09,531 --> 00:21:10,468
What do I really want?

355
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,257
Perhaps, it's not that you don't know yourself.

356
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,568
You just don't dare to face yourself.

357
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,450
Ms. Qin, do you know

358
00:21:17,257 --> 00:21:17,840
fever

359
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,645
is actually a way for the body to

360
00:21:19,782 --> 00:21:21,268
protect and repair itself.

361
00:21:22,171 --> 00:21:23,062
It's the white blood cells that

362
00:21:23,131 --> 00:21:25,062
fighting against viruses and bacteria.

363
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:26,502
When they win,

364
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,171
the symptoms will naturally be cured.

365
00:21:28,742 --> 00:21:30,342
The immune system will also be strengthened.

366
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:33,234
So, instead of forcing the fever down,

367
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,468
leaving it alone

368
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,274
may be better.

369
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,788
No need to worry about it.

370
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,182
No need to be afraid of it either.

371
00:21:40,594 --> 00:21:41,817
Human beings are very strong.

372
00:21:42,765 --> 00:21:43,451
When you heal,

373
00:21:44,331 --> 00:21:46,091
you will naturally become a better yourself.

374
00:21:46,194 --> 00:21:47,337
What are you trying to say?

375
00:21:47,817 --> 00:21:48,560
I want to say that

376
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:50,845
I hope Ms. Qin can

377
00:21:50,914 --> 00:21:51,817
recover soon.

378
00:21:52,868 --> 00:21:53,817
Consider it as heartfelt thanks.

379
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,662
For you don't make Fangning bear the

380
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,205
harm that caused to you in the past.

381
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,822
These are the factory's production line data that

382
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,702
you have submitted

383
00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:05,211
and the results of our recheck.

384
00:22:06,102 --> 00:22:06,560
Are they?

385
00:22:07,462 --> 00:22:08,297
Is there any difference?

386
00:22:19,177 --> 00:22:20,788
This number is different by 0.01.

387
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:22,662
The factory was definitely very careless.

388
00:22:22,765 --> 00:22:24,217
They are too irresponsible.

389
00:22:24,285 --> 00:22:25,645
I'll get even with them later.

390
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:31,245
Director,

391
00:22:31,714 --> 00:22:32,182
in my opinion,

392
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,911
Manager Wang is still reluctant to tell the truth.

393
00:22:35,085 --> 00:22:35,794
However,

394
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:37,028
I've recorded

395
00:22:37,348 --> 00:22:38,217
what he just said.

396
00:22:39,097 --> 00:22:40,811
As an evidence, it should be enough.

397
00:22:41,142 --> 00:22:42,411
Bring the recording and these materials

398
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,268
to the lawyer.

399
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:44,182
Ask him to look into it.

400
00:22:44,891 --> 00:22:45,782
Director Lu, Director Lu,

401
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:46,937
I'm wrong. I'm wrong.

402
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,068
Please forgive me this time,

403
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,948
just this time.

404
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,320
I'll go find a new factory right away.

405
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,234
About what you said,

406
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:52,720
you should have realized them

407
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,851
before you did these things.

408
00:22:55,748 --> 00:22:57,177
Director, I don't want it happen either.

409
00:22:57,954 --> 00:22:59,314
This tiny difference

410
00:23:00,148 --> 00:23:01,748
can be negligible.

411
00:23:07,371 --> 00:23:07,851
Otherwise,

412
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:09,851
I'll return all the money that

413
00:23:10,525 --> 00:23:11,268
I've received before.

414
00:23:11,965 --> 00:23:13,142
I can even return the money to the company.

415
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,205
Really, director Lu,

416
00:23:14,765 --> 00:23:16,000
I did know I'm wrong.

417
00:23:16,182 --> 00:23:16,811
I promise,

418
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,773
I promise to be loyal to the company,

419
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,982
to work like a horse from now on.

420
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,480
It seems that your problem

421
00:23:26,537 --> 00:23:28,354
is more serious than I thought.

422
00:23:30,822 --> 00:23:31,520
What?

423
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,731
Although we

424
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:33,931
found out that data was wrong,

425
00:23:34,342 --> 00:23:35,371
we don't have any direct evidence

426
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:36,377
to prove that you took bribes.

427
00:23:36,434 --> 00:23:38,377
Now, since you've admitted it by yourself,

428
00:23:38,468 --> 00:23:39,314
we can only leave the rest

429
00:23:39,554 --> 00:23:41,314
to the lawyer and the police.

430
00:23:42,205 --> 00:23:42,765
Lu Yiyao,

431
00:23:43,325 --> 00:23:43,988
you played tricks with me.

432
00:23:45,554 --> 00:23:46,537
We didn't expect that

433
00:23:46,754 --> 00:23:48,011
you would show your hand so easily.

434
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:51,188
Take him out.

435
00:23:52,822 --> 00:23:53,462
Lu Yiyao.

436
00:23:53,508 --> 00:23:53,760
Go.

437
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,868
Lu Yiyao, you're away too far!

438
00:23:54,914 --> 00:23:55,565
Lu Yiyao,

439
00:23:55,782 --> 00:23:56,731
Lu Yiyao, you'll be sorry!

440
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,871
The terms of cooperation are better than before.

441
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:17,828
After all,

442
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,466
it's my problem this time.

443
00:24:22,308 --> 00:24:23,005
I refuse.

444
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,320
With such preferential prices,

445
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,471
it's very difficult for you to find other suppliers.

446
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,634
I will find one.

447
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,244
How about the quality assurance?

448
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,868
You have to think it carefully.

449
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,524
In such a short period of time,

450
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:36,444
it's hard for you to find this kind of manufacturing technology,

451
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,204
and a partner with inexpensive prices.

452
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,786
There is always a solution.

453
00:24:40,251 --> 00:24:41,542
I certainly believe in Jiang Cheng.

454
00:24:41,805 --> 00:24:42,651
But, sis Yujiang,

455
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,400
you're the one who broke the rules of the game.

456
00:24:44,708 --> 00:24:46,400
You broke the contract an re-signed it at will.

457
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:47,360
Deer Sing Group

458
00:24:47,405 --> 00:24:48,994
doesn't need such an emotional partner, who

459
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,497
can't make a clear distinction between public and private interests.

460
00:24:51,897 --> 00:24:52,937
Ten years ago,

461
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,165
Simon made a mistake.

462
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,720
But ten years later,

463
00:24:57,097 --> 00:24:58,720
it was you that used the wrong method.

464
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,491
I've adjusted the product design

465
00:25:02,537 --> 00:25:04,011
of the main series of Infinity.

466
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,714
I don't need Jiang Cheng anymore.

467
00:25:06,617 --> 00:25:07,931
And I won't be threatened by anyone.

468
00:25:11,497 --> 00:25:12,000
I'm sorry.

469
00:25:12,537 --> 00:25:14,000
It's really my problem this time.

470
00:25:14,788 --> 00:25:15,382
I hope that

471
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,005
we can still have the opportunity to work with Deer Sing again.

472
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,933
This is a new manufacturer.

473
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:23,942
I know the owner.

474
00:25:24,008 --> 00:25:24,657
He's not bad.

475
00:25:24,994 --> 00:25:25,931
This information should be useful to you.

476
00:25:28,674 --> 00:25:29,337
This

477
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:30,205
accords with your

478
00:25:30,251 --> 00:25:31,142
game rules, right?

479
00:25:32,651 --> 00:25:33,142
Okay.

480
00:25:34,445 --> 00:25:35,142
I accept it.

481
00:25:36,857 --> 00:25:37,611
However,

482
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,942
please don't tell Lu Yiyao that

483
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:41,520
I provide this line.

484
00:25:47,074 --> 00:25:47,817
You

485
00:25:48,388 --> 00:25:50,091
really do not want to give it a try?

486
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,262
My uncle is single.

487
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,360
You're single too.

488
00:25:53,405 --> 00:25:53,840
No.

489
00:25:54,582 --> 00:25:55,702
He has a place in his heart where

490
00:25:56,011 --> 00:25:57,702
I neither sit in nor ignore.

491
00:25:58,171 --> 00:25:59,428
So, for the health and harmony of

492
00:25:59,497 --> 00:26:00,457
the rest of my life,

493
00:26:01,057 --> 00:26:01,780
forget it.

494
00:26:02,731 --> 00:26:03,977
Does he have a girlfriend abroad?

495
00:26:06,182 --> 00:26:07,005
In this world,

496
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,502
there is only one person who

497
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,045
can make him cry,

498
00:26:10,274 --> 00:26:11,222
make him laugh.

499
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,862
But, this is his secret.

500
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,354
I'm not qualified to tell anyone.

501
00:26:19,234 --> 00:26:19,874
Well,

502
00:26:22,434 --> 00:26:23,451
it's pity.

503
00:26:23,645 --> 00:26:24,274
I'm quite satisfied

504
00:26:24,331 --> 00:26:25,028
with you, as my aunt.

505
00:26:25,508 --> 00:26:26,548
You can help me make money.

506
00:26:27,188 --> 00:26:27,817
I'm leaving.

507
00:26:32,868 --> 00:26:33,885
You should say thanks to Ling Rui.

508
00:26:35,474 --> 00:26:36,091
Ling Rui?

509
00:26:37,085 --> 00:26:38,491
He did the volunteer medical consultation in our factory area.

510
00:26:38,651 --> 00:26:39,725
He specifically came to see me.

511
00:26:39,817 --> 00:26:41,817
He wanted to do something for you.

512
00:26:42,948 --> 00:26:43,851
You must have had a miserable life

513
00:26:43,908 --> 00:26:45,257
in your previous existence.

514
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,240
God compensates you

515
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:47,485
a Ling Rui in this life.

516
00:26:47,937 --> 00:26:48,490
I'm leaving.

517
00:27:15,394 --> 00:27:16,571
Don't you want to talk with me?

518
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,022
It's a nice day today.

519
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:18,891
Let's go.

520
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:22,502
Okay.

521
00:27:34,137 --> 00:27:35,485
When I passed by here,

522
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,485
I thought of our dates before.

523
00:27:38,582 --> 00:27:40,182
Besides having dinners, watching movies,

524
00:27:40,331 --> 00:27:41,051
and listening to the music concerts,

525
00:27:41,771 --> 00:27:42,445
we didn't seem to do

526
00:27:42,502 --> 00:27:43,817
anything else.

527
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:45,645
Can you remember

528
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,697
what else we did before?

529
00:27:51,782 --> 00:27:52,617
It seems nothing else.

530
00:27:53,977 --> 00:27:54,537
Right?

531
00:27:55,645 --> 00:27:57,040
That's why I'm very unreconciled.

532
00:27:57,668 --> 00:27:58,468
I can't

533
00:27:58,525 --> 00:27:59,428
get rid of it.

534
00:28:02,274 --> 00:28:03,588
Lu Yiyao, you

535
00:28:04,045 --> 00:28:04,902
didn't even know that

536
00:28:05,005 --> 00:28:06,205
I like you so much?

537
00:28:11,102 --> 00:28:12,040
I want to hear the truth.

538
00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:19,040
In the past,

539
00:28:20,811 --> 00:28:21,748
in my opinion, you just thought

540
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,613
we were perfect for each other.

541
00:28:23,862 --> 00:28:24,777
But now...

542
00:28:28,674 --> 00:28:30,194
Probably, you just hate me.

543
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,771
As expected.

544
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,280
I'm sorry.

545
00:28:49,805 --> 00:28:50,982
Actually, you know what?

546
00:28:52,937 --> 00:28:53,977
As long as you say something,

547
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,531
do something,

548
00:28:56,285 --> 00:28:57,280
I'll be fine.

549
00:28:57,417 --> 00:28:58,628
I'll forgive you.

550
00:29:05,691 --> 00:29:06,297
Forget it.

551
00:29:06,971 --> 00:29:07,600
I hate myself 

552
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,502
to be like this.

553
00:29:09,805 --> 00:29:11,234
I've come to this point.

554
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:13,004
But, I still can't

555
00:29:13,048 --> 00:29:14,257
express my feelings frankly.

556
00:29:15,244 --> 00:29:16,702
I can only pretend to blame you, which

557
00:29:17,977 --> 00:29:19,657
is easier for me to blame myself.

558
00:29:21,611 --> 00:29:22,582
It's okay.

559
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:24,582
You can continue to blame me.

560
00:29:25,702 --> 00:29:26,354
Forget it.

561
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,084
I'll forget you.

562
00:29:37,337 --> 00:29:37,840
Yujiang.

563
00:29:47,337 --> 00:29:47,931
Lu Yiyao,

564
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,931
just stand here,

565
00:29:50,617 --> 00:29:51,348
I'm leaving.

566
00:31:11,508 --> 00:31:11,977
Simon.

567
00:31:28,182 --> 00:31:30,022
There is only one person in this world who

568
00:31:30,217 --> 00:31:31,028
can make him cry,

569
00:31:31,462 --> 00:31:31,965
make him laugh.

570
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,582
Since her sister died,

571
00:31:40,788 --> 00:31:42,388
Fangning has locked herself inside

572
00:31:42,445 --> 00:31:43,348
for several days.

573
00:31:44,182 --> 00:31:45,234
She didn't eat.

574
00:31:45,497 --> 00:31:46,548
She didn't cry or make a scene.

575
00:31:47,108 --> 00:31:48,548
She's going to have problems.

576
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:09,965
My sister gave me this candy.

577
00:32:11,668 --> 00:32:13,040
She wanted my future life

578
00:32:15,005 --> 00:32:18,125
to be sweet.

579
00:32:22,011 --> 00:32:25,611
But, I can't see her anymore.

580
00:33:12,982 --> 00:33:13,748
Aunt Gao,

581
00:33:13,851 --> 00:33:14,777
what are you doing?

582
00:33:14,834 --> 00:33:15,542
Where's uncle?

583
00:33:16,605 --> 00:33:17,542
I don't know what happened.

584
00:33:17,822 --> 00:33:18,920
He suddenly said he was leaving.

585
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,502
He packed his baggage simply,

586
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,177
and left.

587
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:22,742
He also said that he would call off the engagement.

588
00:33:23,097 --> 00:33:23,634
Fangning.

589
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:27,382
You're back.

590
00:33:28,057 --> 00:33:29,474
I put the contact information of a new manufacturer

591
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:30,400
on your desk.

592
00:33:32,788 --> 00:33:34,937
This manufacturer was recommended by someone else?

593
00:33:35,017 --> 00:33:35,988
An acquaintance recommended it.

594
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:36,742
You can contact them.

595
00:33:36,788 --> 00:33:37,817
And carry the work forward as soon as possible.

596
00:33:37,874 --> 00:33:38,845
I have something to do. I'm leaving.

597
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,697
Wait a minute.

598
00:33:40,411 --> 00:33:41,417
Are you okay?

599
00:33:42,217 --> 00:33:42,902
I'm fine.

600
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,805
I'm fine. I'm leaving now.

601
00:34:10,754 --> 00:34:12,114
Look, he's calling now.

602
00:34:14,914 --> 00:34:16,114
Why did you invite Fangning?

603
00:34:20,456 --> 00:34:21,610
In my memory, the three of us

604
00:34:21,657 --> 00:34:22,308
gathered together last time.

605
00:34:22,536 --> 00:34:23,290
It should be at the time when I

606
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,537
had a blind date.

607
00:34:25,074 --> 00:34:25,920
If Fangning hadn't

608
00:34:25,987 --> 00:34:26,981
let me off the hook at that time,

609
00:34:27,245 --> 00:34:28,377
I'm afraid I wouldn't have had the chance

610
00:34:28,581 --> 00:34:29,827
to be Yiyao's girlfriend.

611
00:34:32,353 --> 00:34:32,947
Yiyao,

612
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:34,662
as her uncle,

613
00:34:34,811 --> 00:34:36,011
you should make a self-criticism.

614
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,331
Do you have other wine?

615
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,267
Open another bottle.

616
00:34:47,141 --> 00:34:47,713
Fangning,

617
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,902
since the production line's problems

618
00:34:48,947 --> 00:34:49,610
have been solved,

619
00:34:50,034 --> 00:34:51,222
should we find time to celebrate it?

620
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,141
No.

621
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,924
I'm quite busy these days.

622
00:34:56,123 --> 00:34:56,969
How about next week?

623
00:34:57,862 --> 00:34:58,742
Let's talk about it next week.

624
00:35:10,411 --> 00:35:11,005
Cai Siyu.

625
00:35:12,262 --> 00:35:13,142
Director Lu.

626
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,075
Let's dine together after work.

627
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,280
Cai Siyu.

628
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,131
Ms. Lu,

629
00:35:37,805 --> 00:35:38,834
when did you and Simon

630
00:35:38,862 --> 00:35:39,530
become so familiar that

631
00:35:39,577 --> 00:35:40,708
you can dine together?

632
00:35:41,828 --> 00:35:42,342
That's right.

633
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:43,688
When?

634
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,364
Hasn't the story already ended?

635
00:35:47,268 --> 00:35:49,634
I hope I've overthought everything.

636
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,480
Could it be that as long as I have a secret crush on someone,

637
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,114
a director will be sent to me?

638
00:35:55,211 --> 00:35:56,742
I don't have to do anything.

639
00:35:56,994 --> 00:35:58,742
And director Lu just came to me?

640
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:01,710
What are you thinking about?

641
00:36:01,897 --> 00:36:02,617
What did you say?

642
00:36:03,531 --> 00:36:04,617
Came to you?

643
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,493
Do you buy a lottery ticket?

644
00:36:06,434 --> 00:36:07,131
I…

645
00:36:08,788 --> 00:36:10,068
Do nothing.

646
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,702
Someone can come to me?

647
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,457
You really want to do this?

648
00:36:36,388 --> 00:36:36,948
We're here now.

649
00:36:37,005 --> 00:36:38,011
No more crap.

650
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,484
He cut off your factory's leeway.

651
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,862
He got us into trouble with the lawsuit.

652
00:36:41,142 --> 00:36:41,908
He, Lu Yiyao,

653
00:36:42,354 --> 00:36:43,360
didn't give us any leeway.

654
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:45,017
What are we afraid of?

655
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,751
Here comes him.

656
00:36:49,893 --> 00:36:50,510
Get ready to go!

657
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,302
What are you doing?

658
00:37:02,685 --> 00:37:03,085
Beat him!

659
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,634
Beat him hard!

660
00:37:21,511 --> 00:37:22,417
Security!

661
00:37:22,817 --> 00:37:23,368
Security!

662
00:37:23,405 --> 00:37:24,925
They're here! Come here!

663
00:37:25,211 --> 00:37:25,611
Let's go.

664
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,093
Director Lu, are you okay?

665
00:37:31,474 --> 00:37:32,845
I'm sorry. I'm late.

666
00:37:34,194 --> 00:37:35,291
You were shouting loudly.

667
00:37:35,611 --> 00:37:36,788
It was an emergency.

668
00:37:37,691 --> 00:37:38,228
You...

669
00:37:40,502 --> 00:37:41,782
Next time, you run first

670
00:37:42,251 --> 00:37:43,428
and then call someone, understand?

671
00:37:43,577 --> 00:37:44,742
There's no next time.

672
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,115
How about you?

673
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,786
Shall we call the police or go to the hospital first?

674
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,571
No need to call the police.

675
00:37:51,245 --> 00:37:52,194
I'll handle it by myself.

676
00:37:52,891 --> 00:37:53,862
Then, how about your wound?

677
00:38:06,902 --> 00:38:07,531
Thank you.

678
00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:10,114
I'll do it.

679
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,493
No need. Let me help you.

680
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:23,714
Another classic scene,

681
00:38:23,988 --> 00:38:25,280
I've made it.

682
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,640
I'm sorry. It hurts?

683
00:38:54,685 --> 00:38:55,942
I'll do it gently.

684
00:38:57,611 --> 00:38:58,605
It seems that you are laughing?

685
00:39:00,662 --> 00:39:01,577
No, I'm not.

686
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,188
You're my boss.

687
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,471
You're injured.

688
00:39:04,497 --> 00:39:05,560
I'm worried about you a lot.

689
00:39:39,234 --> 00:39:40,251
Of course,

690
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:43,428
I still have some other thoughts.

691
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,453
Director Lu,

692
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:49,928
I want to know

693
00:39:49,964 --> 00:39:51,475
what you think of me?

694
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:52,730
Why?

695
00:39:54,675 --> 00:39:56,500
Why did you suddenly invite me to dinner?

696
00:40:03,771 --> 00:40:04,251
Nothing.

697
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,920
I think you are too tired because you work overtime.

698
00:40:08,204 --> 00:40:09,484
I'd like to express my sincere solicitude.

699
00:40:11,337 --> 00:40:13,017
It's okay. I'll do it by myself.

700
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,520
What's wrong?

701
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:39,805
Okay, it's late.

702
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:40,986
You should hurry back home.

703
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,537
Director Lu,

704
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:46,524
do you really have nothing to tell me?

705
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:49,188
I don't want to talk it to you today.

706
00:40:49,794 --> 00:40:50,365
Maybe another day.

707
00:40:50,777 --> 00:40:52,194
You have the chance now.

708
00:40:53,291 --> 00:40:53,760
I'm leaving.

709
00:40:54,091 --> 00:40:54,742
Director Lu,

710
00:40:57,588 --> 00:40:58,891
it's okay if you don't say anything.

711
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:00,891
I'll do it.

712
00:41:01,554 --> 00:41:02,331
I knew it.

713
00:41:02,982 --> 00:41:04,331
A relationship without effort

714
00:41:04,377 --> 00:41:05,725
will not be so easy to succeed.

715
00:41:06,605 --> 00:41:07,828
It is written in the novels.

716
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,548
Director Lu,

717
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,662
I like you.

718
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,395
Can you be my boyfriend?

719
00:41:19,325 --> 00:41:21,051
You don't have to answer me now.

720
00:41:21,862 --> 00:41:23,051
I'll go back first.

721
00:41:32,582 --> 00:41:34,194
Shouldn't he stop me?

722
00:41:35,657 --> 00:41:37,200
Why doesn't he stop me?

723
00:41:39,234 --> 00:41:40,525
Come on!

724
00:41:42,194 --> 00:41:42,525
Okay!
