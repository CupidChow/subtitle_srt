1
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,564
Begin Again

2
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,960
Episode 07

3
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,800
-I'm sorry.
-Director Lu.

4
00:01:58,017 --> 00:01:59,457
I'm now doing a rookie training.

5
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:02,200
This rookie really wants to know about you.

6
00:02:02,568 --> 00:02:04,480
It's not me. I don't want to.

7
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,710
Bring me the planning case by Gavin

8
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:06,680
who is the major designer

9
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,600
of this year's design exhibition

10
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,820
by Friday.

11
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,140
Okay.

12
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,340
Twice already.

13
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,020
No.

14
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,110
Three times.

15
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,140
Bad luck.

16
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,540
Twice.

17
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,280
No.

18
00:02:50,062 --> 00:02:50,970
Three times.

19
00:02:53,475 --> 00:02:55,250
What the hell?

20
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,820
Alas.

21
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,970
I'd like to ask that where

22
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,280
can I check up the list?

23
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,250
Turn a corner ahead, go to the last room.

24
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,510
Okay, thank you.

25
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,140
The fever is brought down.

26
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,220
Other indicators are normal as well.

27
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,120
Surgery may

28
00:03:29,137 --> 00:03:29,982
be arranged first.

29
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,220
You go inform it.

30
00:03:31,422 --> 00:03:31,688
Okay.

31
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,106
And,

32
00:03:32,586 --> 00:03:33,570
bring me the report

33
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,346
of the patient at bed 36

34
00:03:34,435 --> 00:03:35,253
as soon as possible.

35
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,020
It's you.

36
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,450
Wait, you...

37
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,140
I... I don't think it's appropriate.

38
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,370
What? What did I do?

39
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,880
Yes.

40
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,170
I know Ling Rui is a good person.

41
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:50,450
But it's not proper that you follow him

42
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,540
all day long.

43
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,880
When did I follow him?

44
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,000
You have to mind your behavior.

45
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,110
You're a young girl.

46
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:58,770
Um.

47
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,200
How can you be so cheeky,

48
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:00,800
right?

49
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,200
Ling Rui is busy rushing from one place

50
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,020
to another everyday.

51
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,026
He doesn't have the time to talk to you.

52
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:06,044
What the hell did I do to him?

53
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:07,173
Why you all treat me

54
00:04:07,217 --> 00:04:08,110
like this?

55
00:04:08,391 --> 00:04:09,173
Am I such a fool

56
00:04:09,226 --> 00:04:09,970
without conscience

57
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,650
in your mind?

58
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,510
I'm still harassing a man

59
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,450
while my father is sick,

60
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:13,050
right?

61
00:04:14,657 --> 00:04:16,026
Well.. Who knows?

62
00:04:16,817 --> 00:04:17,413
You...

63
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:20,186
I meant to ask

64
00:04:20,408 --> 00:04:21,940
how to get there?

65
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,280
Thank you.

66
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,680
You say,

67
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,537
what should the honeymoon period be like

68
00:04:36,506 --> 00:04:37,591
for the newlyweds?

69
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:39,484
I don't know, director.

70
00:04:39,608 --> 00:04:40,710
I'm not married.

71
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:41,710
But,

72
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,420
the couple must be attachment to each other,

73
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,340
very much in love.

74
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,170
And they can no longer see other people,

75
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:47,710
like...

76
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,110
connected infants.

77
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:50,450
You can shut your mouth.

78
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,620
Attached, not attachment!

79
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:53,386
You can't even say it correctly.

80
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:54,910
Don't look at me.

81
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:55,620
I'm not married either.

82
00:04:56,408 --> 00:04:57,431
I think,

83
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,493
at least you can't hide people

84
00:04:59,537 --> 00:05:00,520
from knowing you're married.

85
00:05:03,182 --> 00:05:04,200
Stop nodding.

86
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:22,417
Let the Design Dept

87
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:22,977
do a few more sketches for you.

88
00:05:23,128 --> 00:05:24,177
Mr. Ling, then I'll go first.

89
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,871
Thank you.

90
00:05:24,968 --> 00:05:25,650
We're going to redo

91
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,666
the waterproofing test on the goods we saw just now.

92
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,250
-Write that down.
-Okay, I will.

93
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,275
Where is the data sheet for this batch of materials?

94
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,480
I'm sorry, Ms. Lu.

95
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,742
I'll go fetch it right now.

96
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,000
Let's check

97
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,970
over there later.

98
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,817
You can take a look over there.

99
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:47,970
Okay, let's go.

100
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,740
Why are you here?

101
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,370
I want to see what you

102
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,880
look like at work.

103
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:56,862
The work in hospital must be heavy.

104
00:05:56,897 --> 00:05:57,857
Don't you have to be on duty?

105
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,170
Anything important?

106
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,740
If no, I'll go to work then.

107
00:06:03,475 --> 00:06:05,004
No, I'm off today.

108
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:06,124
Wait me till I'm off work.

109
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,970
Ask Ma to send the data sheet

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,008
directly to the B217.

111
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:09,360
-Let's go over there and check.
-Okay.

112
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,510
Why are you still here?

113
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,140
It's so late.

114
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,910
You're done?

115
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:37,620
I just finished.

116
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,080
Right,

117
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,340
was there something

118
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,820
you want to tell me?

119
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,710
Nothing.

120
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,970
I'm waiting for you to pick you up after work.

121
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,570
Stop smiling.

122
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,280
Don't you think I would

123
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,480
forgive you because of your smile.

124
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:51,820
Fangning,

125
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,620
I've thought about it seriously.

126
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:00,906
Why is the light off?

127
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,577
Sis, the light is off and the door is locked.

128
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:14,764
That's all I can do for you.

129
00:08:18,488 --> 00:08:19,235
What does he mean?

130
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,200
Lu Fangyu

131
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,420
must want to give

132
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:22,850
the two of us

133
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,250
a chance to be together.

134
00:08:25,324 --> 00:08:27,235
Then weâ€¦

135
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,850
Only in the morning

136
00:08:28,897 --> 00:08:30,250
does someone come to open the door.

137
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,020
Then we can only stay the night here.

138
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:34,800
Maybe.

139
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,110
Then I'll take you to

140
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:36,910
a comfortable place.

141
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,510
Let's go.

142
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:42,909
Slow down.

143
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,220
There it is.

144
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,480
What?

145
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,000
Nothing.

146
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,020
You're familiar with the place.

147
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,740
Of course.

148
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:01,650
I've seen the place

149
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,200
being constructed little by little.

150
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:06,062
when I just entered LM Deer Sing Group,

151
00:09:06,177 --> 00:09:08,257
I was once a storer and a salesperson

152
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,444
I had to run up and down many times.

153
00:09:10,595 --> 00:09:11,280
Of course,

154
00:09:11,386 --> 00:09:12,782
now I also come here once a week.

155
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,340
So even with my eyes closed, 

156
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,080
I can find the place I want to get to

157
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:19,850
I told them last time

158
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,420
not to put the flowerpot here.

159
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,880
Why is it still here?

160
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,200
Lu Fangning.

161
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,020
Wait for me.

162
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,320
Why are you running so fast?

163
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:43,377
I'm scared to death.

164
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,200
You scared me first.

165
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,620
I'm not frightened at all.

166
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,820
Me too.

167
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,250
Then why do you

168
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:51,502
grab me if you're not?

169
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,740
I'm worried you'll be scared.

170
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,250
Didn't you say it's ahead?

171
00:09:59,546 --> 00:10:00,666
Why does it take us so long?

172
00:10:00,702 --> 00:10:02,720
We're almost there, just a minute.

173
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,370
Don't be sacred. I'm with you.

174
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,710
I'm not afraid.

175
00:10:07,644 --> 00:10:08,977
Almost there.

176
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,680
Slow down.

177
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,370
Slow down.

178
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,062
We set this place

179
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,360
as a

180
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,493
Living Room Exploration Hall,

181
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:23,680
simulating a sense of being at home,

182
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,850
to make customers feel like they are home.

183
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,000
Sit down.

184
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,000
Our employees

185
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:28,970
usually rest here, too.

186
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:31,800
The sofa over there

187
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:32,650
is an exhibition.

188
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,680
But it was already ordered

189
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:34,280
by our customer.

190
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,620
So we can't sit there.

191
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,680
Just make do with it.

192
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,250
Sit here.

193
00:10:38,497 --> 00:10:38,942
Never mind.

194
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's quite comfortable here.

195
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:41,770
Here you are.

196
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,280
Thank you.

197
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,088
We only have chips here.

198
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,450
Next time I'll ask my staff

199
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,400
to order

200
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,650
something more delicious.

201
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,570
It's okay.

202
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,480
It's good enough.

203
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:54,480
However,

204
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,813
you won't have the next chance.

205
00:10:57,128 --> 00:10:58,170
Nothing. Enjoy it.

206
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,220
I'm so tired.

207
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:25,340
Shall we

208
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,680
find something interesting

209
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,770
to do?

210
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:33,910
Do...

211
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,540
Do what?

212
00:11:41,066 --> 00:11:41,617
Come here.

213
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,600
Let's play this.

214
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,910
Winner can ask

215
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,622
the other person a question.

216
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:50,770
The other one has to answer

217
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,310
and can't hide anything,

218
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,970
so we can

219
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,510
know more about each other.

220
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,093
I'm not in.

221
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,146
I don't wanna know more about you.

222
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,280
Come on.

223
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,280
So childish. I'm not in.

224
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,600
Me first.

225
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,280
Your turn.

226
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,110
Pick one.

227
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,080
Have you decided?

228
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,250
Don't rush me.

229
00:12:30,702 --> 00:12:32,657
Strategy matters.

230
00:12:34,168 --> 00:12:35,582
Okay, take your time.

231
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,973
Be quieter when you eat chips.

232
00:12:38,142 --> 00:12:39,688
I got distracted.

233
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,800
You lost. I win.

234
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,110
Ask me.

235
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,620
I am not

236
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,800
curious about you.

237
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,450
I don't know what to ask.

238
00:13:08,062 --> 00:13:09,080
Okay, I got one.

239
00:13:10,328 --> 00:13:11,866
What do you think of Tang Ping?

240
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:12,680
Tang Ping?

241
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,506
Not interested.

242
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,000
Then in hospital, you and her...

243
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,960
Her father had

244
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,951
an unknown shadow in his lungs.

245
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,862
She took the X-ray there,

246
00:13:23,244 --> 00:13:25,310
which is exactly my specialty.

247
00:13:25,484 --> 00:13:26,382
So I took him in.

248
00:13:27,457 --> 00:13:28,097
No more?

249
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:28,820
-Yep.
-That's all?

250
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,000
Go on.

251
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,620
I win again.

252
00:13:53,057 --> 00:13:54,110
Awesome people indeed

253
00:13:54,195 --> 00:13:55,650
do well in everything.

254
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,310
Go ahead.

255
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,310
Why did you suddenly

256
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,820
decide to marry me?

257
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,170
Because I wanted to help you.

258
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,280
And?

259
00:14:06,204 --> 00:14:06,680
Nothing.

260
00:14:07,226 --> 00:14:08,124
Nothing again?

261
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,570
You...

262
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,680
You're acting shamelessly.

263
00:14:12,097 --> 00:14:12,960
I'm not lying.

264
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,400
I'm not ducking it.

265
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,048
Go on.

266
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:23,710
You lose.

267
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,740
It's my turn to ask you.

268
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,600
Why did you want to

269
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,420
marry me so badly?

270
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,680
Was there any other reason

271
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,000
other than work?

272
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:38,910
Of course I wanted to

273
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,250
have a baby with you.

274
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,680
But I can't let him know.

275
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,480
And I can neither lie nor duck it.

276
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,880
What should I say?

277
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,620
Because I want to

278
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,650
have a deeper...

279
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,493
A deeper connection with you.

280
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,770
Another round?

281
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,250
I...

282
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,170
I feel sleepy.

283
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,370
Okay then.

284
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:16,770
Let's stop it.

285
00:15:19,555 --> 00:15:20,488
Would you like to watch a film?

286
00:19:17,662 --> 00:19:18,311
Ms. Lu.

287
00:19:19,413 --> 00:19:20,302
Ms. Lu.

288
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,770
Ms. Lu.

289
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:41,910
Darling.

290
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,450
They're here for work.

291
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,340
Let's go.

292
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:04,050
Did you sleep well last night?

293
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:05,970
Pretty good.

294
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:08,080
I had a nice dream.

295
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,200
And you?

296
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,620
Me too.

297
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,280
I thought you were

298
00:20:15,368 --> 00:20:16,450
already awake, right?

299
00:20:16,702 --> 00:20:18,577
You pretended to be asleep.

300
00:20:21,582 --> 00:20:23,297
It was so awkward.

301
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,820
This is your place.

302
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:27,880
You're more suitable

303
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,844
to deal with the situation.

304
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,510
Wait for me here.

305
00:20:33,946 --> 00:20:35,450
-Ma.
-Ms. Lu.

306
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,462
Before closing the door,

307
00:20:36,497 --> 00:20:37,342
you must check

308
00:20:37,395 --> 00:20:38,370
if there is anyone inside

309
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,110
to make sure

310
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:40,000
the safety of people and goods.

311
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,540
-Got it?
-Yes.

312
00:20:45,351 --> 00:20:45,893
Done?

313
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,866
Do you have something to do later?

314
00:20:48,088 --> 00:20:50,382
Why don't you drive me to the hospital?

315
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,151
I drive you to the hospital?

316
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,764
I mean...

317
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:00,280
How about we have our breakfast there?

318
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,620
What do you want?

319
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,570
Anything is okay, you decide.

320
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,680
You can taste

321
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:28,820
the grain porridge here.

322
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,142
And some desserts.

323
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:31,250
Okay.

324
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:34,257
You go take a seat. I'll go get the food.

325
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,435
Let's go together.

326
00:21:42,088 --> 00:21:42,675
Okay.

327
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,970
-Thank you.
-Thanks, sis Li.

328
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,050
What else you want?

329
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:54,540
Okay.

330
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:55,970
I can't.

331
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,620
Thank you.

332
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,100
-Do you know?
-You go.

333
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,680
Go, you go ask.

334
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,220
Director Ling.

335
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,140
-You're here for breakfast?
-Yeah, hello.

336
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,540
This is?

337
00:22:11,226 --> 00:22:12,133
This is my wife.

338
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,177
You're married, Dr. Ling?

339
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,280
Let's go.

340
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,770
Thank you, sis Li.

341
00:22:21,235 --> 00:22:21,848
You're welcome.

342
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,970
That's his wife.

343
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,800
Where do you want to sit?

344
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:31,850
Thanks.

345
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:33,370
You're welcome.

346
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,050
Is the girl her sister?

347
00:22:37,271 --> 00:22:38,710
Look, she is pretty.

348
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,850
I heard that Dr. Ling has been married for a long time.

349
00:22:43,137 --> 00:22:43,786
Really?

350
00:22:45,591 --> 00:22:47,048
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

351
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,600
You're married, Ling Rui?

352
00:22:50,008 --> 00:22:50,791
This is your wife?

353
00:22:51,591 --> 00:22:51,946
Yes.

354
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,620
Congratulations.

355
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,280
Thank you.

356
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,480
Tastes good.

357
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,340
Taste the dessert.

358
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,340
-Morning, director Ling.
-Morning.

359
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,420
Good morning, Mrs. Ling.

360
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,570
Mrs. Ling is so beautiful.

361
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:08,880
Thank you.

362
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,710
Here.

363
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,620
No one knows who I am.

364
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,820
I should

365
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:19,850
introduce you to them.

366
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,940
No, no. I was kidding.

367
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,650
You are better than me in the hospital.

368
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,450
No one will say

369
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,170
you're my husband.

370
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:31,680
People say

371
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:33,360
I'm Dr. Ling's wife.

372
00:23:34,711 --> 00:23:35,555
Mrs. Ling.

373
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,200
I like this.

374
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,370
I do matter more

375
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,310
than you as for the hospital.

376
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,510
Fangning.

377
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:53,200
I don't quite like being noticed 

378
00:23:53,244 --> 00:23:54,293
by many people.

379
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,510
So,

380
00:23:56,586 --> 00:23:58,053
I didn't tell my colleagues

381
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:58,910
we're married.

382
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,840
I didn't know you would...

383
00:24:03,688 --> 00:24:04,400
I'm sorry.

384
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:06,650
It's okay.

385
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,650
I don't care.

386
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,140
And,

387
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,510
theoretically, the surgeon

388
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:18,770
must not wear any ornaments,

389
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,340
because we may do surgery

390
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,310
at any time.

391
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
But I don't have any today.

392
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:26,710
I'll wear it

393
00:24:27,146 --> 00:24:28,497
as often as possible from now on.

394
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,510
I'm not pushing you

395
00:24:38,728 --> 00:24:40,195
to wear it all the time.

396
00:24:40,293 --> 00:24:41,000
Of course, you can

397
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:41,940
take it off in the hospital.

398
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,850
When you come back home,

399
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,080
just put it on.

400
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:47,820
Okay.

401
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,080
After breakfast,

402
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,710
I don't have anything else to do.

403
00:24:56,275 --> 00:24:57,688
You can walk me around the hospital.

404
00:24:58,266 --> 00:24:58,791
Okay.

405
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,880
-Go head.
-Go ahead.

406
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,880
Will I

407
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,400
delay your work?

408
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,080
Just a while, it's okay.

409
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,600
Um,

410
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,770
how about this?

411
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:19,970
It's fine.

412
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:30,910
This must be Mrs. Ling.

413
00:25:31,288 --> 00:25:32,140
So you're going to

414
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:32,940
make your marriage known?

415
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,850
Now you're exactly enjoying your honeymoon.

416
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,200
I got tied up in my wedding,

417
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,370
I didn't have time to ask you.

418
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,310
How should I call you?

419
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,140
Curly.

420
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,310
Look, how curly his hair is.

421
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,370
Call him Curly.

422
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:43,970
Easy to remember.

423
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,220
You can call me Curly, sounds better.

424
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,680
We all call him that.

425
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:47,650
I'm Yang Jin, Mrs. Ling.

426
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:48,740
Just call me Yang.

427
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,420
I'm Mengmeng.

428
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,800
Call me Xun, Mrs. Ling.

429
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,740
You're so cute. Wait a second.

430
00:25:55,422 --> 00:25:56,151
What are you finding?

431
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:57,520
I think I should give them

432
00:25:57,564 --> 00:25:58,906
some red pockets.

433
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,510
You're so generous, Mrs. Ling.

434
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,450
So generous of you.

435
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,770
"Mrs. Ling", I can call that few more times.

436
00:26:04,471 --> 00:26:05,280
You know what

437
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,231
I can call that, too.

438
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,057
Sister-in-law, right?

439
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:07,662
Wait.

440
00:26:07,724 --> 00:26:08,924
I didn't bring red packets today,

441
00:26:08,977 --> 00:26:10,124
I'll bring to you next time.

442
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,000
All right, thank you in advance.

443
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:13,200
We're not in a rush.

444
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,110
You don't have work to do?

445
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,595
All right, we've greeted her.

446
00:26:18,622 --> 00:26:19,680
We didn't get the red packets.

447
00:26:19,742 --> 00:26:21,431
We saw how sweet they are. Let's go.

448
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,910
-Bye, Mrs. Ling.
-Bye.

449
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,140
All right, back to your work.

450
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,280
Our task today

451
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,420
is fully achieved.

452
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:31,850
What about you?

453
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:33,570
I have something

454
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,480
to deal with later.

455
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,450
Okay, I'll go to work.

456
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:38,200
Go.

457
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:54,660
So you should

458
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,620
do regularly check-up.

459
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,050
Dad, look...

460
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:01,733
Why are you here?

461
00:27:01,795 --> 00:27:02,170
Pingping.

462
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,450
I'm sick,

463
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,800
so Fangning came to visit me.

464
00:27:05,137 --> 00:27:06,480
How considerate she is, you see?

465
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,248
Uncle Tang, you can rest assured.

466
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:08,986
Ling Rui

467
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,570
is the chief surgeon here.

468
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,880
You can tell him if you are in need.

469
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:13,680
Um.

470
00:27:14,568 --> 00:27:15,111
Fangning,

471
00:27:15,582 --> 00:27:16,613
about Dr. Ling,

472
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:17,940
do you mind that?

473
00:27:19,644 --> 00:27:21,310
Of course I don't.

474
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,680
Ling Rui and I

475
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,600
are already married.

476
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:27,310
If you want something,

477
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:29,250
you can ask Tang Ping to contact Ling Rui.

478
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,170
But if you think Tang Ping

479
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,770
is unreliable and

480
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,710
badly-behaved,

481
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,110
I can help you.

482
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:37,400
All right, thank you.

483
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,450
I'm leaving.

484
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,570
You can take a good rest.

485
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,250
Bye, uncle Tang.

486
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,310
I came to visit uncle Tang.

487
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,480
Mind you behavior.

488
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,280
As his daughter,

489
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:51,940
shouldn't you

490
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,800
express your gratitude?

491
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,800
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

492
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,540
Didn't you see that

493
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,340
uncle Tang felt so assured

494
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,650
after I came?

495
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,097
Tang Pingping,

496
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,000
could you please

497
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:04,222
grow up

498
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,020
and be considerate?

499
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,600
You father is sick now.

500
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,910
Yet you let him worry about you.

501
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:08,800
How could you be a...

502
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,928
Don't say that word!

503
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,688
The grudge is between the two of us.

504
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:14,820
Don't get others involved.

505
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,370
Okay?

506
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,020
Grudge?

507
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,170
I don't think there is bad blood between us.

508
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:20,970
If there is, it's about winning or losing.

509
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:21,680
Will you win?

510
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:28,250
If other people ask who you are,

511
00:28:28,622 --> 00:28:29,546
you can just say

512
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,970
you're a friend of Mrs. Ling.

513
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,110
That'll be good.

514
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,850
I feel so pleased.

515
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:35,982
You!

516
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,710
Does the apple taste good, Mr. Lu?

517
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,820
Sis, good afternoon.

518
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:57,910
Okay.

519
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,800
Sis, how was it going?

520
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,448
Anything happened?

521
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,080
-Let me help you.
-Went well.

522
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,650
Went well?

523
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:09,740
Sis.

524
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,110
About what I did last night,

525
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
did I do a good job?

526
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,850
You should say thanks, right?

527
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,080
I'm going to show my thanks.

528
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,417
I've told Gao Erfan about that.

529
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,370
You'll be transferred to

530
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,040
LM Deer Sing Group HQ as from today.

531
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,170
What?

532
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,310
Sis, I don't want that.

533
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,711
Working in the mall,

534
00:29:28,862 --> 00:29:29,710
I'm surefooted

535
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,080
and I can learn a lot.

536
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:33,170
It's like wasting your talent

537
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,910
on a petty job if you stay there.

538
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:36,910
-Are you done?
-In a minute.

539
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:39,591
Here is my plan.

540
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,400
You can work at the front desk

541
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,510
after you come back.

542
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,982
It's not a hard work.

543
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,191
The front desk?

544
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,940
Are you kidding me?

545
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,577
Sis, do I have to

546
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:49,480
stand there

547
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,850
all day long? And

548
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,480
I cannot learn anything.

549
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,020
How can you say that?

550
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:54,770
Why can't you

551
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,020
learn something there?

552
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:56,650
Besides,

553
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:57,928
to some extent,

554
00:29:57,982 --> 00:29:59,200
I got you promoted.

555
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,110
Sis.

556
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,710
Good luck.

557
00:30:03,831 --> 00:30:04,850
As from today,

558
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,400
I can see

559
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,280
your cute face

560
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,680
all day long.

561
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,155
My dear brother.

562
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,600
Sis.

563
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,450
Keep going.

564
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,050
The front desk?

565
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,370
How can I possibly

566
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,140
go dancing then?

567
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,650
Leader, is this color scheme okay?

568
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,970
I think it's good.

569
00:30:35,244 --> 00:30:37,315
It suits Gavin's design style very well, right?

570
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,020
How attractive it is.

571
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,310
Your proposal

572
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,880
comes with a voice-over system?

573
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,020
I was afraid you can't appreciate it.

574
00:30:45,582 --> 00:30:46,133
It's passed.

575
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,250
Such a sudden and surprise.

576
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,902
Because you're going to line up

577
00:30:51,946 --> 00:30:53,080
at the western restaurant downstairs

578
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,791
on behalf of our team.

579
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,740
-Now go.
-Okay.

580
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,000
Or there won't be any seats left.

581
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,710
Water!

582
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:30,880
Director Lu, watch out!

583
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,740
There is much water here.

584
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,740
You must watch out.

585
00:31:54,693 --> 00:31:57,420
Please enjoy your time.

586
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,250
Hello.

587
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,480
I'm done ordering.

588
00:32:36,124 --> 00:32:37,066
No onions with this.

589
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,310
Okay.

590
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,220
Hello, director Lu.

591
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,420
Hello.

592
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,370
Are you used to it?

593
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,370
Let's order first.

594
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:58,720
Okay, you go ahead.

595
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,140
Cheers.

596
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,140
Let's welcome Ms. Cai Siyu.

597
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,940
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

598
00:33:10,915 --> 00:33:12,835
Please take care of me in the future.

599
00:33:12,986 --> 00:33:14,140
-Sure.
-Rest assured.

600
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:15,770
Okay, let's eat this.

601
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:16,910
Okay, come on.

602
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:36,910
Complicated and mysterious.

603
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,710
Handsome and rich.

604
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,420
Cool and lonely.

605
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,370
He is just a perfect leading role.

606
00:33:42,951 --> 00:33:44,755
Gets bad luck meeting me.

607
00:33:45,911 --> 00:33:47,057
The familiar plot.

608
00:33:47,271 --> 00:33:48,080
Will I be his

609
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,400
destined female leading role?

610
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,020
Don't just eat this.

611
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,020
Have some meat.

612
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,000
Here.

613
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,480
I know.

614
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,650
You're too slim.

615
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,880
Eat more.

616
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,510
Dr. Ling.

617
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,510
-Hello.
-Ms. Tang, didn't you finish

618
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,650
the discharge procedures?

619
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:25,570
Why are you back?

620
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,820
We don't

621
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,373
welcome returning customers here.

622
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,146
What returning customer?

623
00:35:29,848 --> 00:35:30,400
Go away.

624
00:35:32,151 --> 00:35:34,140
Dr. Ling.

625
00:35:35,662 --> 00:35:36,710
I'm here to

626
00:35:36,906 --> 00:35:38,910
say goodbye to you.

627
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,740
I'm so sad.

628
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,910
I owe you an apology

629
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,880
for the wedding.

630
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,970
I'm sorry.

631
00:35:55,226 --> 00:35:56,737
And about my father's illness,

632
00:35:56,853 --> 00:35:58,151
I wanna thank you sincerely.

633
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,850
So I want to...

634
00:36:04,444 --> 00:36:05,822
I told you

635
00:36:06,213 --> 00:36:07,510
we can't accept red envelopes.

636
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:09,511
What red envelopes? Go away.

637
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,635
I want to send you a banner.

638
00:36:15,111 --> 00:36:16,311
That's okay.

639
00:36:16,622 --> 00:36:18,257
He's received a lot.

640
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:19,620
Then.

641
00:36:20,746 --> 00:36:22,124
can I take a picture with you?

642
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,570
Don't take a selfie.

643
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,288
Let me shoot for you.

644
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:26,570
Isn't it good?

645
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,170
Okay.

646
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,250
-The font...
-What's wrong?

647
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:39,710
It suits you.

648
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,000
Hold it.

649
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,370
Come on!

650
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,140
Ready.

651
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,620
-How do I look?
-Perfect.

652
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,450
Well,

653
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:06,340
what are you doing here?

654
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,820
Isn't there's a patient waiting for you?

655
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,570
Now go.

656
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,250
Yeah.

657
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:11,710
Ms. Tang, I'm sorry.

658
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,540
I got some patients.

659
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,340
I gotta go.

660
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,110
Bye.

661
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,220
Dr. Ling.

662
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,340
Your phone, here you are.

663
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,906
Let me see.

664
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,910
Why only me?

665
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:26,850
You told me to take pictures of you.

666
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:27,733
You didn't say I had to

667
00:37:27,768 --> 00:37:28,728
take Ling Rui inside too.

668
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,000
Come on!

669
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,022
You should take pictures of us.

670
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,800
-Who told you to shoot only me?
-Well...

671
00:37:33,102 --> 00:37:34,340
You didn't make it clear.

672
00:37:34,408 --> 00:37:35,800
-How can you blame me?
-You!

673
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,280
Trash!

674
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,340
The red banner

675
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,000
suits her anyway.

676
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,510
To Dr. Ling Rui,

677
00:37:56,737 --> 00:37:57,715
you're

678
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,960
the star that never falls by day or night,

679
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,426
the light scattered in the world.

680
00:38:05,644 --> 00:38:08,657
You're benevolent, caring about everything.

681
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,995
You treat patients as families.

682
00:38:11,315 --> 00:38:13,537
You bring patients back to life,

683
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:15,620
and bring comfort to everyone.

684
00:38:15,928 --> 00:38:19,093
The most beautiful patient's family, Tang Ping.

685
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:20,940
Dear me.

686
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,600
What an unusual content.

687
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,510
Unexpectedly good.

688
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,310
The fifth guideline of a happy marriage,

689
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,970
cooking skill makes up for charm.

690
00:38:57,582 --> 00:38:58,266
Didn't you want to

691
00:38:58,311 --> 00:38:59,280
keep a distance with me?

692
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,582
Drinking my soup doesn't count

693
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,480
as breaking the contract, right?

694
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,970
I am so virtuous and generous.

695
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,110
How can you not fall for me

696
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,280
seeing me?

697
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:17,880
I'm back.

698
00:39:19,511 --> 00:39:20,382
What are you laughing at?

699
00:39:20,853 --> 00:39:21,653
Nothing.

700
00:39:22,204 --> 00:39:23,050
I just thought of

701
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,200
something funny.

702
00:39:25,866 --> 00:39:26,420
Right.

703
00:39:26,711 --> 00:39:27,370
Last time,

704
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:29,200
I sent you the night snack,

705
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,280
but you didn't eat.

706
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,431
Try the soup.

707
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:33,582
You cooked it?

708
00:39:35,191 --> 00:39:35,724
Have a try.

709
00:39:37,146 --> 00:39:37,920
I'll go have a bath.

710
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,420
Thank you.

711
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,110
Smells good.

712
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,400
It's pretty good.

713
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,110
Darling.

714
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,340
What?

715
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,050
I'm so careless.

716
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,050
Um...

717
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,710
I forgot to bring the bath towel in.

718
00:40:27,057 --> 00:40:28,450
Can you get it for me?

719
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,200
Darling.

720
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,000
Be quick.

721
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:56,940
Darling

722
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,050
-I can't reach it.
-Then I'm leaving.

723
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,820
Ling Rui, Ling Rui!

724
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,510
Then I'm coming out.

725
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,080
I'm coming out.

726
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,480
Why is my heart beating so fast?

727
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,570
What's wrong?

728
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:05,600
Why did you drink so much water?

729
00:43:10,910 --> 00:43:12,280
I don't know why.

730
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,850
I just feel thirsty.

731
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,340
Are you wearing too much?

732
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:17,310
Take off your clothes.

733
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,340
It's okay.

734
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,020
I might have caught a cold.

735
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:25,220
A cold?

736
00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:28,250
I changed my

737
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,200
shampoo today.

738
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:29,880
Have a try,

739
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,170
see if you can smell it.

740
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,740
I'm sorry.

741
00:43:36,115 --> 00:43:37,420
I've been in the bath for too long.

742
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,420
I feel dizzy.

743
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,020
No, no.

744
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:47,800
Ling Rui.

745
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,800
What?

746
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,020
What are you doing?

747
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,110
I don't know why

748
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,800
I feel so hot too.

749
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:16,020
You're sweating a lot.

750
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,480
Darling.

751
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,680
Colds

752
00:44:48,248 --> 00:44:49,928
are contagious.
