1
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,564
Begin Again

2
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,960
Episode 09

3
00:01:41,514 --> 00:01:42,514
Have you

4
00:01:43,057 --> 00:01:44,000
ever been in love?

5
00:01:46,057 --> 00:01:47,085
I...

6
00:01:48,714 --> 00:01:49,885
Yes, I think.

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,742
That's good.

8
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,120
A girl with experience like you

9
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:04,020
should carefully listen to

10
00:02:04,228 --> 00:02:05,314
every word I say,

11
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,728
and analyze it

12
00:02:06,862 --> 00:02:07,946
for me seriously.

13
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,435
I have a friend

14
00:02:12,551 --> 00:02:13,893
who really needs a child.

15
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:14,740
So she found a guy

16
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,942
who she likes very much,

17
00:02:16,028 --> 00:02:16,485
and got married.

18
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:17,742
But after they got married,

19
00:02:17,786 --> 00:02:19,244
they have never slept on the same bed.

20
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,302
My friend has tried

21
00:02:20,337 --> 00:02:20,770
many times,

22
00:02:20,791 --> 00:02:22,080
but all failed.

23
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:23,657
Do you think the problem is 

24
00:02:24,457 --> 00:02:25,771
with my friend or the man?

25
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,250
Oh, so that's

26
00:02:33,315 --> 00:02:34,960
why you married Dr. Ling.

27
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:36,428
So you...

28
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,685
I told you it's my friend.

29
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:44,571
Yes, it's your friend.

30
00:02:44,828 --> 00:02:45,685
Yeah.

31
00:02:48,428 --> 00:02:49,028
Never mind.

32
00:02:49,514 --> 00:02:51,342
I don't think you know it. Go back.

33
00:02:59,942 --> 00:03:01,285
Ms. Lu.

34
00:03:02,257 --> 00:03:03,571
This is actually very simple.

35
00:03:04,257 --> 00:03:05,228
Just let your friend show

36
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:06,914
all of her charm.

37
00:03:07,946 --> 00:03:09,537
She's your friend,

38
00:03:09,635 --> 00:03:11,048
so she must be like you.

39
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:13,314
No one could resist

40
00:03:13,982 --> 00:03:14,924
a girl like you.

41
00:03:16,266 --> 00:03:17,280
I know that.

42
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:18,080
But I...

43
00:03:19,795 --> 00:03:20,906
I mean, my friend has tried that.

44
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:21,866
Didn't work.

45
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,133
Has tried?

46
00:03:27,428 --> 00:03:28,828
Really?

47
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:32,885
Why didn't it work if she really tried?

48
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:36,714
It didn't work even you...

49
00:03:49,714 --> 00:03:51,142
It's clear that this man

50
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,142
has a noble personality.

51
00:03:52,228 --> 00:03:53,457
He's not an ordinary man

52
00:03:53,493 --> 00:03:54,693
who could be attracted by simple beauty.

53
00:03:55,428 --> 00:03:56,400
Ms. Lu,

54
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,457
your friend really has a nice taste.

55
00:03:59,057 --> 00:03:59,885
About this situation,

56
00:04:00,028 --> 00:04:00,771
my idol has said that

57
00:04:00,968 --> 00:04:01,946
temptation for adult

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,564
starts with stopping consider yourself as a human.

59
00:04:03,857 --> 00:04:05,450
It comes with three modes.

60
00:04:06,577 --> 00:04:07,964
You could be a cat,

61
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:11,485
or a tiger,

62
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,720
or a dog who got wet by rain.

63
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:16,942
I didn't say that.

64
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,071
It's not you.

65
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,355
It's my idol in the drama industry.

66
00:04:21,724 --> 00:04:23,110
Your idols all have good tastes.

67
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,057
But,

68
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:29,657
how exactly should be applied?

69
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,771
It's a bit difficult

70
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:36,171
to actually do that.

71
00:04:38,457 --> 00:04:39,114
But my another idol

72
00:04:39,142 --> 00:04:40,028
in another industry

73
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,371
might suit you more...

74
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,857
-Suit your friend better.
-Very good friend.

75
00:04:54,657 --> 00:04:55,914
The CEO's Personal Treasure.

76
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:57,685
The CEO's Dear Wife.

77
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,971
Rich Family's Contract, the CEO Falls For Me.

78
00:05:02,771 --> 00:05:04,457
Because their identities

79
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,485
fits your friend.

80
00:05:06,685 --> 00:05:08,371
Your friend could be

81
00:05:08,457 --> 00:05:09,657
inspired from these books.

82
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:10,857
For example,

83
00:05:10,971 --> 00:05:13,285
how to show her charm.

84
00:05:13,742 --> 00:05:14,457
As long as she could let

85
00:05:14,542 --> 00:05:16,028
the noble man feel

86
00:05:16,114 --> 00:05:18,200
0.01% of her charm.

87
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:20,200
It won't be a problem for her to take him down.

88
00:05:24,542 --> 00:05:26,971
You can think of someone close to you,

89
00:05:27,057 --> 00:05:27,857
like,

90
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:30,000
director Lu.

91
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,628
How did a handsome man like him

92
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:32,400
get attracted by

93
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:33,800
his fiancee?

94
00:05:35,885 --> 00:05:37,314
Are you asking me about

95
00:05:37,371 --> 00:05:38,771
Simon and his fiancee?

96
00:05:39,377 --> 00:05:41,620
No, I'm just curious.

97
00:05:43,285 --> 00:05:45,000
Why do you care about this?

98
00:05:45,685 --> 00:05:46,885
Qin Yujiang,

99
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:48,685
the heiress of Jiang Cheng Group.

100
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:51,742
Smart, independent, and elegant.

101
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,285
She is different from me.

102
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:55,057
Different from you either.

103
00:05:56,028 --> 00:05:58,657
Impressive ex-girlfriend.

104
00:05:58,714 --> 00:06:00,228
You guys are so boring.

105
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,186
They broke up so many years ago.

106
00:06:02,514 --> 00:06:04,200
You guys are still curious about this.

107
00:06:06,571 --> 00:06:08,114
Don't show up, god bless.

108
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:15,028
Thank you for all this.

109
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:17,114
You're off work now.

110
00:06:17,171 --> 00:06:17,800
Great.

111
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:24,285
Good luck, Ms. Lu.

112
00:06:27,314 --> 00:06:28,571
I'll triple your overtime pay.

113
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:31,628
Thank you, Ms. Lu!

114
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:06,742
This is

115
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:07,800
so easy.

116
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,657
It's a woman.

117
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,257
She is much cooler than you.

118
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,542
Let's go.

119
00:07:36,835 --> 00:07:37,840
Wait a second.

120
00:07:43,142 --> 00:07:43,885
It was all good.

121
00:07:43,914 --> 00:07:45,057
How did it become like this?

122
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:47,314
Dear me.

123
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,657
It's so loud.

124
00:07:49,171 --> 00:07:51,114
What kind of hospital is this?

125
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:52,542
-A healthy man...
-Yeah.

126
00:07:52,657 --> 00:07:53,314
He is dead after being treated by you.

127
00:07:53,351 --> 00:07:54,050
The operation

128
00:07:54,114 --> 00:07:55,200
took Dr. Ling six hours.

129
00:07:55,395 --> 00:07:56,195
It was successful.

130
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,114
But no one expects complications.

131
00:07:58,604 --> 00:07:59,262
Stop it.

132
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,420
What should I do?

133
00:08:02,995 --> 00:08:03,850
Are you...

134
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,840
Are you all unqualified doctors?

135
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,514
Are you?

136
00:08:07,628 --> 00:08:09,285
How did you become doctors?

137
00:08:09,653 --> 00:08:11,340
Give back my brother.

138
00:08:13,428 --> 00:08:14,857
They're swearing at Ling Rui.

139
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,048
Give back my husband!

140
00:08:17,111 --> 00:08:18,488
You don't know.

141
00:08:18,924 --> 00:08:20,140
This is part of our

142
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,715
surgeons' job.

143
00:08:22,828 --> 00:08:24,142
You can't go in now.

144
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,031
You'll only make it worse

145
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:26,020
if you go inside now.

146
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,968
I don't care.

147
00:08:27,485 --> 00:08:28,685
Ling Rui didn't do anything wrong.

148
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,777
How could I just watch my husband

149
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:30,770
being scolded by them?

150
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,170
Yeah, I understand.

151
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:33,199
I'm more worried than you.

152
00:08:33,253 --> 00:08:34,000
I wanted to go inside a long time ago.

153
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:34,950
Then why are you still standing here?

154
00:08:35,022 --> 00:08:35,368
Let's go.

155
00:08:35,422 --> 00:08:35,940
No, wait.

156
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,285
Listen to me, please.

157
00:08:38,097 --> 00:08:39,697
If we go inside now,

158
00:08:39,741 --> 00:08:41,172
this matter could not be solved either.

159
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42,539
How about this?

160
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:43,608
Wait here for a while.

161
00:08:43,822 --> 00:08:44,746
When Ling Rui walks out,

162
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,008
you can talk to him.

163
00:08:46,257 --> 00:08:47,114
He still needs to

164
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,648
check on the patients later.

165
00:08:50,428 --> 00:08:52,142
He is in trouble right now.

166
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,635
And he still has to check on the patients and keeps working?

167
00:08:57,114 --> 00:08:58,742
What kind of operation did you do?

168
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,510
Tell me. Say it.

169
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,742
How did the complications happen?

170
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:04,435
Tell me.

171
00:09:04,488 --> 00:09:05,431
Ma'am,

172
00:09:06,514 --> 00:09:08,114
the operation was successful.

173
00:09:08,228 --> 00:09:09,600
Your husband died of complications,

174
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,228
which has nothing to do with Dr. Ling.

175
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:15,542
Nothing to do with him?

176
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,964
He was talking to me

177
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:19,875
before he went into the operating room.

178
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:22,008
How could you say this?

179
00:09:23,164 --> 00:09:24,420
Give my husband

180
00:09:24,771 --> 00:09:26,000
back to me.

181
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,573
Give him back to us.

182
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:32,628
I want my husband back.

183
00:09:34,328 --> 00:09:35,493
My husband.

184
00:09:57,542 --> 00:09:58,400
Get some rest

185
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:00,171
later.

186
00:10:01,085 --> 00:10:02,028
I'll change your shift

187
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:03,828
this afternoon.

188
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:28,628
Ling Rui.

189
00:10:35,085 --> 00:10:35,885
Why are you here?

190
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:39,628
Are you available this afternoon?

191
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,771
If you are free,

192
00:10:41,828 --> 00:10:42,942
come to a place with me.

193
00:10:58,571 --> 00:10:59,857
Your client is here?

194
00:11:01,342 --> 00:11:02,085
Yeah.

195
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:04,342
We're busy in the hospital.

196
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:05,171
I don't have time to

197
00:11:05,285 --> 00:11:06,142
play with you here.

198
00:11:07,885 --> 00:11:08,971
Where are you going?

199
00:11:09,314 --> 00:11:10,485
You can't go anywhere.

200
00:11:10,857 --> 00:11:12,000
You're mine today.

201
00:11:12,142 --> 00:11:13,171
So you have to come with me.

202
00:11:16,857 --> 00:11:17,742
Just tell me

203
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:19,342
what do you want to play?

204
00:11:20,028 --> 00:11:21,828
Ghost house, pirate ship, and bumper cars.

205
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:23,485
I allow you to play each one of them once.

206
00:11:26,742 --> 00:11:27,171
Let's go.

207
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,171
Let's take a ride on the merry-go-round.

208
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:29,828
Why?

209
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,400
Because you looked at it

210
00:11:31,485 --> 00:11:33,171
for three more seconds.

211
00:11:33,314 --> 00:11:34,742
Although it's a bit surprising.

212
00:11:34,942 --> 00:11:35,971
But I'm okay with that.

213
00:11:36,857 --> 00:11:38,142
-I don't want to go.
-Let's go.

214
00:11:43,657 --> 00:11:44,714
Hello, how many of you, please?

215
00:11:44,857 --> 00:11:46,742
How many seats do you have?

216
00:11:46,828 --> 00:11:47,571
Twenty.

217
00:11:55,857 --> 00:11:58,057
I'll take all the seats.

218
00:11:58,971 --> 00:11:59,485
Are you

219
00:11:59,571 --> 00:12:01,342
paying for the 20 guests behind you?

220
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,057
No, just him.

221
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,742
How is this? I booked all the seats for you.

222
00:12:06,914 --> 00:12:07,571
Are you happy?

223
00:12:08,114 --> 00:12:09,457
Choose any one you like.

224
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:10,428
Ride on it if you like it.

225
00:12:11,571 --> 00:12:12,428
Mom,

226
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:15,028
I want to ride too.

227
00:12:16,657 --> 00:12:17,628
Let them come too.

228
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,828
Or I won't go either.

229
00:12:22,417 --> 00:12:23,520
Why didn't you say that earlier?

230
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,564
Alright, as long as you're happy.

231
00:12:26,711 --> 00:12:27,920
-This way.
-Let them all in.

232
00:12:28,171 --> 00:12:29,114
-This way.
-Come on.

233
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:30,428
I'm not going.

234
00:12:30,742 --> 00:12:32,114
-Why?
-I have horsesick.

235
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:33,142
You go ahead.

236
00:12:33,571 --> 00:12:34,142
Go ahead.

237
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:35,714
Come, this way.

238
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:40,457
One, two, three, four.

239
00:12:41,057 --> 00:12:42,600
Take this one, this white horse.

240
00:12:42,742 --> 00:12:43,800
This one is big. Ride on it.

241
00:12:44,171 --> 00:12:44,628
Seven.

242
00:12:44,714 --> 00:12:45,428
I want white horse.

243
00:12:45,485 --> 00:12:46,171
Eight.

244
00:12:46,314 --> 00:12:47,485
This way.

245
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:48,200
White.

246
00:12:49,457 --> 00:12:50,371
Don't fall.

247
00:12:52,342 --> 00:12:53,628
Hold tight.

248
00:13:07,114 --> 00:13:08,885
Ling Rui. Look over here.

249
00:13:13,314 --> 00:13:14,085
Hey, there.

250
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:15,257
Girl, lower your head.

251
00:13:18,571 --> 00:13:19,971
Ling Rui.

252
00:13:22,506 --> 00:13:23,822
My "husband charming"

253
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:25,050
is so cute.

254
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:48,228
You come here often?

255
00:14:48,571 --> 00:14:49,600
How shall I put it?

256
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,942
I used to come here often when I was young,

257
00:14:50,971 --> 00:14:53,114
but seldom these years.

258
00:14:53,857 --> 00:14:54,628
How about you?

259
00:14:57,514 --> 00:14:59,400
Every kid may have a special feeling

260
00:15:00,542 --> 00:15:02,428
about amusement parks.

261
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:04,657
No matter how old we are,

262
00:15:04,857 --> 00:15:05,800
amusement park could always

263
00:15:05,914 --> 00:15:07,571
stimulate our adrenaline

264
00:15:07,685 --> 00:15:09,085
to make us feel happy,

265
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,485
and bring us comfort.

266
00:15:14,764 --> 00:15:15,928
You want to comfort me?

267
00:15:22,028 --> 00:15:23,171
How about I buy you a cotton candy?

268
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:26,514
Granny, I want two cotton candies.

269
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,910
Take it by yourself.

270
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:30,971
Thank you.

271
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,373
-Thank you.
-How much for this?

272
00:15:32,551 --> 00:15:33,368
Five yuan for each.

273
00:15:34,285 --> 00:15:34,714
Here.

274
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,920
I don't have enough change.

275
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,540
No need for change, granny.

276
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,257
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

277
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:47,971
Ling Rui.

278
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,942
What are you doing?

279
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:00,057
Silly.

280
00:16:00,657 --> 00:16:01,714
Can't you see

281
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:03,457
what I'm doing?

282
00:16:03,771 --> 00:16:04,371
Sister,

283
00:16:04,457 --> 00:16:06,142
what are those two people doing?

284
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,771
It's so embarrassing. Let's go.

285
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,628
What do you know, kids?

286
00:16:14,885 --> 00:16:16,457
I really can't tell.

287
00:16:16,857 --> 00:16:17,685
What did you say?

288
00:16:23,285 --> 00:16:24,171
My hand even gets red,

289
00:16:24,257 --> 00:16:25,171
failed again?

290
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,914
We went around all day,

291
00:16:37,057 --> 00:16:38,228
and just brought back this.

292
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,257
Next time we come here,

293
00:16:40,314 --> 00:16:41,771
we have to bring all the toys

294
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:42,942
on that wall back home.

295
00:16:44,764 --> 00:16:45,706
What's wrong with you today?

296
00:16:46,364 --> 00:16:47,342
You're a bit weird.

297
00:16:49,991 --> 00:16:50,755
Weird?

298
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:53,170
Actually,

299
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:55,140
I saw

300
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:56,560
what you were like in the hospital.

301
00:16:57,857 --> 00:16:59,000
I want to tell you that,

302
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:00,764
don't take it too personally.

303
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,426
This is not your fault.

304
00:17:02,826 --> 00:17:03,244
Really.

305
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,968
You're already a very good doctor.

306
00:17:05,413 --> 00:17:06,915
But no matter how good the doctor is,

307
00:17:07,114 --> 00:17:07,914
he cannot bring back

308
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:09,865
all of his patients' lives.

309
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:12,800
Thank you.

310
00:17:15,173 --> 00:17:16,080
I'm fine.

311
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,257
Medical science is

312
00:17:19,314 --> 00:17:20,714
always a proportion,

313
00:17:21,513 --> 00:17:22,770
not a promise.

314
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:25,679
As a surgeon,

315
00:17:26,373 --> 00:17:27,080
I might face

316
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:28,170
this kind of thing everyday.

317
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,866
I've been used to it.

318
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,804
It's not that easy.

319
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:36,622
If you can get used to it,

320
00:17:36,888 --> 00:17:37,970
you're not the Ling Rui

321
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,028
that I know anymore.

322
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,080
Are you comforting me?

323
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,560
Or what?

324
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:47,217
You know, I had Gao Erfan

325
00:17:47,253 --> 00:17:48,400
spend a lot of time

326
00:17:48,453 --> 00:17:49,706
to book this whole place today.

327
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:51,970
Is it splendid?

328
00:17:52,428 --> 00:17:53,428
When I was young,

329
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:54,428
I liked to come here

330
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,271
every time I felt down.

331
00:17:55,546 --> 00:17:57,182
I would feel cozy this way.

332
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,026
A lot of time?

333
00:18:01,048 --> 00:18:02,417
You prepared for this so early?

334
00:18:03,514 --> 00:18:04,714
Never mind all that.

335
00:18:04,971 --> 00:18:05,742
Time is precious.

336
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:07,217
Where do you want to go next?

337
00:18:07,371 --> 00:18:08,200
I've tried so hard to

338
00:18:08,231 --> 00:18:08,970
get you half a day off.

339
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,885
Half a day off?

340
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,800
Director Luo told me

341
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:17,771
to take a rest.

342
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:19,485
That's because of you?

343
00:18:21,155 --> 00:18:22,986
I apologize. I'm sorry.

344
00:18:23,428 --> 00:18:23,857
But,

345
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:25,170
I saw you were

346
00:18:25,228 --> 00:18:26,114
not feeling good today.

347
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:27,485
So I want you to have some rest.

348
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:28,285
I've already asked them.

349
00:18:28,371 --> 00:18:28,971
You don't have any

350
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,485
important jobs today.

351
00:18:30,828 --> 00:18:32,371
-So I thought...
-First of all,

352
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,542
it's my call

353
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,828
whether I have

354
00:18:34,857 --> 00:18:36,200
important jobs.

355
00:18:37,342 --> 00:18:38,050
Secondly,

356
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,355
it's a waste of medical resources

357
00:18:40,373 --> 00:18:41,970
to change a doctor's schedule.

358
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:44,284
Last,

359
00:18:45,371 --> 00:18:46,171
I would like you not to

360
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,297
intervene in my job and my life

361
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:48,600
too much in the future.

362
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:53,742
Am I not included in your life?

363
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:56,742
You are included.

364
00:18:57,171 --> 00:18:57,828
But...

365
00:18:57,885 --> 00:18:58,885
But what?

366
00:19:03,057 --> 00:19:03,771
But we...

367
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,226
We're just bonded by a contract.

368
00:19:05,342 --> 00:19:06,340
Contract?

369
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:09,155
It's just a contract?

370
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:14,071
You think I like

371
00:19:14,097 --> 00:19:15,022
to watch you riding on

372
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,826
some merry-go-round here and

373
00:19:16,914 --> 00:19:18,314
play bumper cars with you like an idiot?

374
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,395
I even acted like

375
00:19:19,404 --> 00:19:20,124
the CEOs in the novels,

376
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,620
called you silly,

377
00:19:21,742 --> 00:19:22,600
and put my hand on a tree,

378
00:19:22,742 --> 00:19:23,885
clapping like that.

379
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,546
Even the kids were laughing at me.

380
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,310
I did all these just

381
00:19:26,371 --> 00:19:27,571
to make you happy.

382
00:19:27,657 --> 00:19:28,971
You're doing this just  

383
00:19:29,057 --> 00:19:30,200
to achieve your own goal.

384
00:19:31,285 --> 00:19:32,200
What goal?

385
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,828
I don't want to talk about it.

386
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,360
I want to have a baby, right?

387
00:19:36,435 --> 00:19:36,906
What's up?

388
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,604
Why are you embarrassed to say that out loud?

389
00:19:38,782 --> 00:19:40,000
I just want a baby.

390
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,368
Say something.

391
00:19:42,114 --> 00:19:42,657
All right.

392
00:19:45,714 --> 00:19:47,085
Let me ask you a question.

393
00:19:49,885 --> 00:19:50,828
Do you love me?

394
00:19:53,114 --> 00:19:53,485
Does it

395
00:19:54,857 --> 00:19:55,685
matter whether I love you

396
00:19:56,657 --> 00:19:57,571
or not?

397
00:19:57,828 --> 00:19:58,914
I think it's something that

398
00:19:59,028 --> 00:20:00,314
related to love.

399
00:20:01,257 --> 00:20:02,400
I hope you can understand

400
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:03,571
and respect me.

401
00:20:05,885 --> 00:20:07,771
Aren't we married?

402
00:20:09,257 --> 00:20:10,228
Lu Fangning, you really want

403
00:20:10,257 --> 00:20:11,028
a baby that much, huh?

404
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:12,628
Yes, I do.

405
00:20:13,228 --> 00:20:13,571
OK.

406
00:20:14,571 --> 00:20:15,457
I'll give you what you want.

407
00:20:16,342 --> 00:20:17,542
Let's give it a shot.

408
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,571
But you must not

409
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:19,600
run away this time.

410
00:20:20,342 --> 00:20:20,942
Deal.

411
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,857
I won't run away.

412
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:29,828
Didn't you do everything

413
00:20:31,742 --> 00:20:32,885
to get this?

414
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:35,800
I think

415
00:20:36,742 --> 00:20:37,542
we can do it

416
00:20:37,657 --> 00:20:39,142
step by step.

417
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:57,400
What's up?

418
00:20:58,885 --> 00:20:59,228
Scared?

419
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:01,428
Scared?

420
00:21:03,085 --> 00:21:04,657
Your arm was on my hair.

421
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:20,800
Just give me a second.

422
00:21:20,857 --> 00:21:22,085
One second, OK?

423
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:48,057
Lu Fangning, haven't you been waiting 

424
00:21:48,142 --> 00:21:48,942
a long time for this day?

425
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,114
What are you waiting for? Get inside.

426
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,028
It's the first time.

427
00:21:52,371 --> 00:21:54,885
It's normal to be a bit nervous.

428
00:21:54,914 --> 00:21:55,457
About what?

429
00:21:55,542 --> 00:21:57,314
Just close your eyes and you'll have a baby.

430
00:21:58,228 --> 00:21:59,714
But I was so frivolous

431
00:21:59,742 --> 00:22:00,628
in front of him.

432
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,742
If he finds out

433
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,885
I have no experience.

434
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:04,800
Isn't that embarrassing?

435
00:22:04,942 --> 00:22:07,171
You don't need to care about that.

436
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,417
When this story got out,

437
00:22:08,462 --> 00:22:09,440
how would Cai Siyu think of you?

438
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:10,220
Once Tang Ping knows,

439
00:22:10,285 --> 00:22:11,285
she is gonna jump to the sky.

440
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:12,085
You were just bragging

441
00:22:12,171 --> 00:22:12,885
with that girl at the front desk.

442
00:22:12,942 --> 00:22:13,542
Have you forgot?

443
00:22:13,628 --> 00:22:14,285
If you went out alone,

444
00:22:14,342 --> 00:22:15,457
what would she think of you?

445
00:22:15,571 --> 00:22:16,371
If you go out alone now,

446
00:22:16,391 --> 00:22:17,057
it'll be more embarrassing.

447
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,542
Lu Fangning, don't you want a baby?

448
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,514
Don't be scared, go inside.

449
00:22:20,685 --> 00:22:21,514
You're right.

450
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,800
Wait, wait.

451
00:23:02,057 --> 00:23:03,857
Hold on, hold on,.

452
00:23:05,571 --> 00:23:06,457
Why do you need to wait?

453
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,200
We've waited long enough.

454
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:11,685
You just want a baby, don't you?

455
00:23:23,742 --> 00:23:24,800
I knew you are afraid.

456
00:23:49,485 --> 00:23:50,314
Honey,

457
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:51,542
I'll be up in a minute.

458
00:23:59,093 --> 00:23:59,760
Ms. Lu,

459
00:24:00,364 --> 00:24:02,231
How's your charm working?

460
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:24,228
Ling Rui,

461
00:24:25,428 --> 00:24:26,857
you're a beast.

462
00:24:33,971 --> 00:24:35,085
This will not do.

463
00:24:36,828 --> 00:24:38,257
Is there anything more exciting?

464
00:24:38,314 --> 00:24:40,057
It's not exciting enough?

465
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:42,371
It doesn't make any sense.

466
00:24:44,171 --> 00:24:45,714
Dr. Ling doesn't want to?

467
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,457
It's not that he doesn't want.

468
00:24:52,028 --> 00:24:53,200
The problem is with me.

469
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,228
How is the problem

470
00:24:55,628 --> 00:24:57,028
with you, Ms. Lu?

471
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:58,114
Can you?

472
00:25:00,028 --> 00:25:01,657
Of course,

473
00:25:02,228 --> 00:25:03,200
I can't.

474
00:25:04,885 --> 00:25:05,714
Ms. Lu,

475
00:25:06,142 --> 00:25:08,028
you have a serious problem

476
00:25:08,457 --> 00:25:09,400
which could not be solved

477
00:25:09,457 --> 00:25:10,200
by the books.

478
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,600
So what am I supposed to do?

479
00:25:15,285 --> 00:25:16,228
How about

480
00:25:16,885 --> 00:25:18,000
asking someone else?

481
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:19,742
If I could find someone else,

482
00:25:19,828 --> 00:25:20,942
why do I ask you?

483
00:25:21,142 --> 00:25:22,542
If you don't ask anyone else,

484
00:25:22,571 --> 00:25:24,142
how do you know for sure

485
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,085
it's your problem?

486
00:25:27,742 --> 00:25:28,685
Well, who am I gonna talk to?

487
00:25:29,285 --> 00:25:29,942
Ms. Lu.

488
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,114
I didn't know you had important business.

489
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,114
Well, I'll come back later.

490
00:25:44,228 --> 00:25:45,400
What are you doing here?

491
00:25:46,485 --> 00:25:47,857
Ms. Qin of Jiang Cheng Group

492
00:25:47,914 --> 00:25:48,428
will be here soon.

493
00:26:08,571 --> 00:26:09,257
Sis Yujiang.

494
00:26:18,771 --> 00:26:21,142
Ms. Qin of Jiang Cheng Group.

495
00:26:22,285 --> 00:26:22,942
Who is that?

496
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:47,714
This is Ms. Qin of Jiang Cheng Group?

497
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,114
Director Lu's ex...

498
00:26:51,314 --> 00:26:52,542
fiancee?

499
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:56,142
She's so tall, yet wears high heels.

500
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,342
That must be expensive.

501
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,057
Perfect figure, pretty face.

502
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:01,600
And her presence

503
00:27:01,714 --> 00:27:02,942
is almost like that of Ms. Lu.

504
00:27:04,257 --> 00:27:07,342
Qin Yujiang, and Cai Siyu.

505
00:27:09,057 --> 00:27:10,457
Only our names are similar.

506
00:27:12,171 --> 00:27:13,885
It's god's will.

507
00:27:30,971 --> 00:27:33,657
I heard you just got back today,

508
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:35,542
and you directly came here.

509
00:27:35,685 --> 00:27:36,742
You're so hard-working.

510
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:38,714
Not as good as you.

511
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,514
You're running Deer Sing alone.

512
00:27:40,714 --> 00:27:42,114
Even used your marriage as a promo.

513
00:27:42,514 --> 00:27:43,571
I hadn't come back in time,

514
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,262
or I would have witnessed it.

515
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,485
This time you've come to us

516
00:27:47,571 --> 00:27:48,742
for the production lines.

517
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,771
It must be

518
00:27:49,828 --> 00:27:50,742
for Infinity, I presume.

519
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:53,475
Sis Yujiang,

520
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,631
you really know a lot about

521
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,937
about our Deer Sing.

522
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,840
You're an important client of Jiang Cheng.

523
00:27:58,311 --> 00:27:59,084
Knowing about the Deer Sing

524
00:27:59,137 --> 00:28:00,426
means we're taking you seriously.

525
00:28:00,915 --> 00:28:01,964
I will be responsible

526
00:28:02,017 --> 00:28:02,888
and follow up on

527
00:28:03,075 --> 00:28:03,813
this production line in person.

528
00:28:05,257 --> 00:28:05,885
Isn't that a little

529
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:07,114
unnecessary?

530
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:08,514
You're so busy.

531
00:28:08,685 --> 00:28:10,285
Why do you have to do everything yourself?

532
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,628
If I don't do this,

533
00:28:11,714 --> 00:28:12,657
how could we

534
00:28:12,714 --> 00:28:14,000
show we value Deer Sing?

535
00:28:18,828 --> 00:28:20,028
I know that Lu Yiyao is back.

536
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,485
Now he is chiefly in charge of

537
00:28:22,571 --> 00:28:23,685
your product development.

538
00:28:24,488 --> 00:28:25,377
I'll talk to him.

539
00:28:26,942 --> 00:28:28,648
I know Infinity the best.

540
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,142
Talk to me. It's more direct.

541
00:28:31,537 --> 00:28:32,248
Lu Fangning.

542
00:28:32,924 --> 00:28:33,688
I won't talk to you.

543
00:28:34,017 --> 00:28:35,137
I only talk to Lu Yiyao.

544
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:54,114
Never mind.

545
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:55,644
If you don't want to see her,

546
00:28:55,724 --> 00:28:56,284
just forget it.

547
00:28:58,968 --> 00:28:59,644
No problem.

548
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,160
She won't make trouble out of nothing.

549
00:29:02,693 --> 00:29:03,155
I'll do it.

550
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,173
Uncle.

551
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,248
Why did you break up

552
00:29:12,302 --> 00:29:13,333
with her back then?

553
00:29:13,771 --> 00:29:14,485
Why did you suddenly

554
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:15,600
decided to go abroad?

555
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,697
All these years, Qin Yujiang didn't mention it.

556
00:29:17,751 --> 00:29:18,880
And you didn't say anything.

557
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,271
I'm not gossiping.

558
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,533
I just care about you.

559
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,195
If you really don't want to talk about it,

560
00:29:24,586 --> 00:29:25,493
I can understand.

561
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:29,324
We...

562
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:31,777
We just found that

563
00:29:31,866 --> 00:29:32,808
we weren't match.

564
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,693
You had been together for two years,

565
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,697
and right when you were about to get married,

566
00:29:35,742 --> 00:29:36,764
you found that you were not match?

567
00:29:41,555 --> 00:29:42,755
Sometimes,

568
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:45,173
it only takes one moment to realize that.

569
00:29:48,862 --> 00:29:50,826
Okay, I give up.

570
00:29:51,288 --> 00:29:52,933
Relationships are so confusing.

571
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,444
Let alone someone else's.

572
00:29:56,771 --> 00:29:58,028
But if it's truely

573
00:29:58,085 --> 00:29:59,114
like you said,

574
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,106
Qin Yujiang is not sentimental,

575
00:30:00,151 --> 00:30:01,475
that will be good.

576
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,546
The main product of Infinity this time is

577
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,488
so special.

578
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,773
If we can't get Jiang Cheng's support,

579
00:30:07,617 --> 00:30:08,595
I'm gonna have a headache.

580
00:30:08,914 --> 00:30:10,285
I won't let that happen.

581
00:30:11,431 --> 00:30:12,620
I'll take care of everything for you.

582
00:30:14,514 --> 00:30:15,971
All right, don't worry.

583
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:17,940
I've made a plan B.

584
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,685
I just

585
00:30:19,914 --> 00:30:20,714
don't want things

586
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,000
to come to that.

587
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,080
I've already contacted Ms. Qin's office

588
00:30:34,228 --> 00:30:35,000
for many times.

589
00:30:35,182 --> 00:30:36,020
She's either in a meeting,

590
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,031
or out of the office.

591
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,511
I suspect they don't even want to work with us.

592
00:30:42,914 --> 00:30:43,657
Give me the card.

593
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:03,028
Hi, I'm the director of Business Development Dept from Deer Sing Group, Lu Yiyao,

594
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,314
May I speak to Ms. Qin, please?

595
00:31:05,628 --> 00:31:07,000
Hi. I'm so sorry.

596
00:31:07,142 --> 00:31:08,371
Ms. Qin is out of the office currently.

597
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,657
Can I help you with anything?

598
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,000
May I take your message?

599
00:31:11,085 --> 00:31:12,685
I'll let her know when she gets back.

600
00:31:14,342 --> 00:31:16,171
No, thanks.

601
00:31:18,228 --> 00:31:19,085
Can't reach her, right?

602
00:31:19,314 --> 00:31:20,457
I'll keep trying.

603
00:31:20,857 --> 00:31:22,028
Gotta reach her someday.

604
00:31:22,285 --> 00:31:23,514
I don't believe Ms. Qin

605
00:31:23,571 --> 00:31:24,800
could just disappear.

606
00:31:25,028 --> 00:31:26,685
If you approve, director,

607
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,000
I'm gonna go to her company

608
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:28,714
and wait for her.

609
00:31:29,257 --> 00:31:30,000
Director,

610
00:31:30,342 --> 00:31:31,857
you and Ms. Qin have known each other for years.

611
00:31:31,885 --> 00:31:33,457
Don't you have her cellphone number?

612
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,542
She didn't pick up the calls in office.

613
00:31:35,714 --> 00:31:36,885
Perhaps she'll answer her cellphone calls.

614
00:31:37,342 --> 00:31:38,314
This is company business.

615
00:31:38,571 --> 00:31:39,657
She didn't answer business calls.

616
00:31:39,848 --> 00:31:41,191
Then she definitely wouldn't answer private calls.

617
00:31:41,644 --> 00:31:42,400
Stupid.

618
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,171
Hello.

619
00:31:57,111 --> 00:31:57,804
It's me.

620
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:00,400
Lu Yiyao.

621
00:32:01,564 --> 00:32:02,328
Director Lu.

622
00:32:03,262 --> 00:32:04,942
I've been waiting for your call.

623
00:32:05,742 --> 00:32:06,828
I'd like to see you sometime.

624
00:32:07,466 --> 00:32:08,220
And we could talk about

625
00:32:08,285 --> 00:32:09,800
the cooperation of Deer Sing and Jiang Cheng.

626
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,040
Okay.

627
00:32:11,485 --> 00:32:12,714
Let's dine together.

628
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:15,680
By the way,

629
00:32:15,771 --> 00:32:16,485
I have one request.

630
00:32:17,857 --> 00:32:18,428
Name it.

631
00:32:24,657 --> 00:32:25,714
How romantic.

632
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:28,057
Isn't this director Lu?

633
00:32:28,314 --> 00:32:29,800
I never thought he'd do something like this.

634
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:32,835
Look, so handsome.

635
00:32:32,857 --> 00:32:35,514
Who's so lucky? He's so handsome.

636
00:32:35,685 --> 00:32:37,057
Who's so lucky?

637
00:32:41,514 --> 00:32:42,742
I'm so jealous.

638
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,400
Learn from him, okay?

639
00:32:54,457 --> 00:32:55,685
Flowers?

640
00:32:56,885 --> 00:32:57,742
We're about to get into

641
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,600
the main story line?

642
00:33:02,657 --> 00:33:03,742
But,

643
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:05,314
why is he standing in the lobby

644
00:33:05,342 --> 00:33:06,371
with two bouquets of flowers?

645
00:33:07,457 --> 00:33:08,571
That's lovely.

646
00:33:09,742 --> 00:33:11,057
I'm embarrassed.

647
00:33:17,828 --> 00:33:18,342
How do you feel?

648
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,400
Standing in the lobby alone

649
00:33:20,457 --> 00:33:21,485
with two bouquets of flowers,

650
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,600
isn't it good?

651
00:33:27,028 --> 00:33:27,971
As long as you are happy.

652
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,028
However,

653
00:33:30,771 --> 00:33:31,457
I don't like this

654
00:33:31,514 --> 00:33:32,171
kind of flowers anymore.

655
00:33:32,657 --> 00:33:33,771
The colors are so bland.

656
00:33:34,085 --> 00:33:35,771
It doesn't really go with me now.

657
00:33:38,171 --> 00:33:38,914
Well, then,

658
00:33:39,457 --> 00:33:40,971
what kind of flowers does Ms. Qin like?

659
00:33:41,114 --> 00:33:42,171
I'll give it to you another day.

660
00:33:42,485 --> 00:33:43,200
Of course you will.

661
00:33:48,971 --> 00:33:50,428
Siyu, why you are still here?

662
00:33:51,057 --> 00:33:52,942
Don't look at me. Just go.

663
00:33:54,057 --> 00:33:55,285
Now, may I take Ms. Qin

664
00:33:55,342 --> 00:33:56,628
to dine now?

665
00:33:57,742 --> 00:33:58,542
Of course.

666
00:34:01,114 --> 00:34:01,628
Please.

667
00:34:07,085 --> 00:34:07,742
Throw it away.

668
00:34:21,313 --> 00:34:22,884
It's all right. Go eat.

669
00:34:23,056 --> 00:34:24,084
Okay, bye.

670
00:34:35,771 --> 00:34:36,914
What a waste.

671
00:34:37,284 --> 00:34:39,484
Threw away such perfect flowers.

672
00:34:40,284 --> 00:34:41,684
And the trash can downstairs

673
00:34:41,771 --> 00:34:43,400
could only take dry refuse.

674
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,800
I've done my bit

675
00:34:46,857 --> 00:34:47,685
to keep our company clean.

676
00:34:54,248 --> 00:34:55,370
That's basically the same as

677
00:34:55,946 --> 00:34:57,280
you bought me flowers.

678
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:07,800
Cai Siyu,

679
00:35:11,285 --> 00:35:12,428
who bought you flowers?

680
00:35:16,577 --> 00:35:17,740
Come on.

681
00:35:18,177 --> 00:35:19,413
Didn't you go downstairs for meal?

682
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,714
What? Went to buy flowers?

683
00:35:22,971 --> 00:35:24,000
I just picked it up.

684
00:35:25,075 --> 00:35:25,911
I see.

685
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,885
Who is so rich

686
00:35:28,914 --> 00:35:30,228
to put such a bunch of flowers there

687
00:35:30,342 --> 00:35:32,714
waiting you to pick it up.

688
00:35:32,915 --> 00:35:34,250
How was I supposed to know that?

689
00:35:34,428 --> 00:35:35,514
Director Lu bought it.

690
00:35:37,537 --> 00:35:38,650
Well, he's certainly rich.

691
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,240
You wouldn't admire director Lu, would you?

692
00:35:43,795 --> 00:35:44,675
I...

693
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,275
Really?

694
00:35:48,906 --> 00:35:49,928
-You...
-Alright, I admire him.

695
00:35:49,964 --> 00:35:50,826
I admit that.

696
00:35:50,885 --> 00:35:52,000
What? Can't I?

697
00:35:52,428 --> 00:35:54,028
Of course you can.

698
00:35:54,228 --> 00:35:55,514
You're not the first

699
00:35:55,628 --> 00:35:56,571
and you won't be the last.

700
00:35:56,897 --> 00:35:57,706
Don't take

701
00:35:57,770 --> 00:35:59,973
hopeless things so seriously, OK?

702
00:36:00,071 --> 00:36:01,066
Bye.

703
00:36:04,542 --> 00:36:06,371
I'm just gonna be the last one.

704
00:36:29,386 --> 00:36:30,106
For dessert,

705
00:36:30,124 --> 00:36:30,910
we have mango pudding,

706
00:36:31,028 --> 00:36:31,885
and chocolate mousse.

707
00:36:31,914 --> 00:36:32,885
Which one do you prefer?

708
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:38,770
Mango pudding for two.

709
00:36:38,942 --> 00:36:39,971
Alright, please wait a little bit.

710
00:36:43,257 --> 00:36:43,914
I know you like

711
00:36:43,971 --> 00:36:44,800
mango pudding.

712
00:36:48,826 --> 00:36:49,510
Yujiang,

713
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,510
Deer Sing needs Jiang Cheng's production line.

714
00:36:51,942 --> 00:36:52,742
These two companies

715
00:36:52,857 --> 00:36:53,771
have been doing well together.

716
00:36:54,285 --> 00:36:55,628
But lately you haven't signed

717
00:36:55,685 --> 00:36:57,114
the contract for a long time.

718
00:36:57,857 --> 00:36:58,742
I want to know

719
00:36:59,085 --> 00:37:00,428
what else do you want?

720
00:37:01,066 --> 00:37:02,506
I'll move forward with the partnership.

721
00:37:05,885 --> 00:37:07,000
-Okay.
-But,

722
00:37:07,828 --> 00:37:09,114
things that are too easy to get

723
00:37:09,608 --> 00:37:11,253
are not right for you.

724
00:37:11,893 --> 00:37:13,140
Besides this meal,

725
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,262
shouldn't you have something else to offer?

726
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:18,995
The prices we set couldn't be changed.

727
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,035
Deer Sing can make certain compromises to Jiang Cheng.

728
00:37:22,942 --> 00:37:24,000
As soon as you come up with a plan,

729
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,600
we'll consider taking it.

730
00:37:27,555 --> 00:37:29,164
We do need some new plans.

731
00:37:32,008 --> 00:37:34,080
I understand that Jiang Cheng

732
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,171
hasn't got big projects

733
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,114
these years.

734
00:37:36,628 --> 00:37:37,800
Deer Sing can ensure

735
00:37:37,857 --> 00:37:38,485
in the next few years,

736
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,582
you'll have a steady start-up rate.

737
00:37:40,142 --> 00:37:41,170
A partner like this

738
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,208
is rare for you.

739
00:37:47,314 --> 00:37:48,428
-Please enjoy it.
-Thank you.

740
00:37:50,314 --> 00:37:51,514
For you,

741
00:37:52,942 --> 00:37:54,568
I'm just a business partner?

742
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:01,822
I think

743
00:38:02,773 --> 00:38:03,800
we're still friends.

744
00:38:05,111 --> 00:38:05,650
You think?

745
00:38:20,314 --> 00:38:21,285
Lu Yiyao, you've always been

746
00:38:21,371 --> 00:38:22,657
thinking that you know me.

747
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:24,085
There's so much

748
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:26,240
that you don't know about me.

749
00:38:27,573 --> 00:38:28,620
You don't know that I've never

750
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:30,228
liked mango pudding.

751
00:38:30,551 --> 00:38:31,937
You don't know I like flowers,

752
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,751
but I don't like your attitude about sending me flowers.

753
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,480
You don't know where I am,

754
00:38:36,755 --> 00:38:38,510
whether I'm busy or hungry.

755
00:38:39,457 --> 00:38:40,942
Because you never cared.

756
00:38:41,828 --> 00:38:42,600
You're just following

757
00:38:42,657 --> 00:38:43,657
your standards

758
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,571
and playing the perfect fiance.

759
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,314
Weren't you?

760
00:38:55,028 --> 00:38:56,257
Excuse me, director Lu.

761
00:38:56,742 --> 00:38:57,571
I have an appointment today

762
00:38:57,628 --> 00:38:58,857
with the Golden Horse Furniture.

763
00:38:59,057 --> 00:39:00,885
Mr. Zhang's called me many times.

764
00:39:01,484 --> 00:39:02,986
If I don't go, he'll feel offended.

765
00:39:03,371 --> 00:39:05,800
You don't want to offend anyone in business.

766
00:39:11,914 --> 00:39:12,600
Yujiang.

767
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,285
I'll give it to you

768
00:39:17,342 --> 00:39:18,171
whatever you want.

769
00:39:18,914 --> 00:39:20,171
I don't want our relationship

770
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:22,337
to affect the cooperation
between Deer Sing and Jiang Cheng.

771
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:23,971
Infinity

772
00:39:24,542 --> 00:39:25,571
is important to Fangning.

773
00:39:33,885 --> 00:39:34,657
After all these years,

774
00:39:35,657 --> 00:39:37,314
you still care about her so much.

775
00:40:09,714 --> 00:40:10,542
I'm sorry.

776
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,371
Let's call off the engagement.

777
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:13,685
As long as you wish,

778
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,714
you could use any excuse to tell the public.

779
00:40:19,771 --> 00:40:20,314
I'm sorry.

780
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:23,271
The number you dialed is busy now.

781
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:25,220
Sorry.

782
00:40:25,688 --> 00:40:28,177
The number you dialed is busy now.

783
00:40:29,457 --> 00:40:30,371
Sorry.

784
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,128
The number you dialed is busy now.

785
00:40:33,228 --> 00:40:34,800
Please try again later.

786
00:40:51,457 --> 00:40:52,571
Clean up the room.

787
00:40:52,914 --> 00:40:53,914
Call off the engagement

788
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,514
of me and Lu Yiyao.

789
00:41:01,342 --> 00:41:02,085
Lu Yiyao.

790
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,085
Why do you think

791
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:05,400
I can handle all of this?

792
00:41:06,371 --> 00:41:07,285
Why should I have to

793
00:41:07,371 --> 00:41:08,485
be decent and sensible?

794
00:41:10,057 --> 00:41:11,285
It's unfair.

795
00:41:12,314 --> 00:41:13,742
You're the only one who's calm.

796
00:41:29,857 --> 00:41:30,514
Fangning.

797
00:41:31,485 --> 00:41:33,057
Let's have dinner tonight.

798
00:41:33,371 --> 00:41:35,142
Have your husband with you.

799
00:41:35,742 --> 00:41:36,457
I didn't make it

800
00:41:36,514 --> 00:41:37,714
to your wedding.

801
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:39,671
Think of it as a celebration.

802
00:41:40,828 --> 00:41:42,285
Okay, see you tonight.
