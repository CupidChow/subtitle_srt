00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,564
Begin Again

2
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,960
Episode 12

3
00:02:01,431 --> 00:02:02,177
Ms. Lu,

4
00:02:02,382 --> 00:02:04,480
do we just eat bread for dinner?

5
00:02:05,324 --> 00:02:05,884
Yes.

6
00:02:08,142 --> 00:02:09,128
Hurry up,

7
00:02:10,062 --> 00:02:11,170
don't choke on  it.

8
00:02:12,737 --> 00:02:13,422
Thank you.

9
00:02:22,888 --> 00:02:23,991
Ms. Lu,

10
00:02:24,222 --> 00:02:25,733
would you like to eat something else?

11
00:02:31,644 --> 00:02:32,568
Ms. Lu, you...

12
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,053
What's wrong with you?

13
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:36,150
This bread is so delicious

14
00:02:36,337 --> 00:02:37,830
that moved you to tears?

15
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,004
Very common.

16
00:02:43,244 --> 00:02:44,610
Even this bread tastes so bad

17
00:02:44,657 --> 00:02:45,528
when you eat too much of it.

18
00:02:45,955 --> 00:02:46,515
How bad Ling Rui felt

19
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:47,813
when he ate those breads before?

20
00:02:53,057 --> 00:02:53,600
Come on.

21
00:02:54,328 --> 00:02:55,608
Don't sit idle, just eat.

22
00:02:57,742 --> 00:02:58,924
We have to choose

23
00:02:58,933 --> 00:02:59,940
the king of bread.

24
00:02:59,982 --> 00:03:00,560
I'll buy it for Ling Rui

25
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,595
when he comes back from his business trip.

26
00:03:02,737 --> 00:03:03,900
You're trying to force Dr. Ling to

27
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,924
contrast past misery with present happiness?

28
00:03:05,013 --> 00:03:06,417
How can it be that?

29
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,884
I want to let the good taste

30
00:03:08,026 --> 00:03:08,915
replace his

31
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:09,860
previous bad memories.

32
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,342
No, no, no, Ms. Lu.

33
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,382
In our life,

34
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:14,115
there are millions of good tastes.

35
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:15,084
Eating bread

36
00:03:17,333 --> 00:03:18,690
is definitely not Dr. Ling's

37
00:03:18,933 --> 00:03:19,770
dream.

38
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:39,680
You become smarter.

39
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,928
How can eating bread be

40
00:03:41,946 --> 00:03:43,226
a person's life dream?

41
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,035
I'm going to write

42
00:03:44,071 --> 00:03:45,591
a plan of "a million a year" right now.

43
00:03:45,813 --> 00:03:46,542
Ms. Lu,

44
00:03:46,648 --> 00:03:48,151
can you write one for me first?

45
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,280
Too slow.

46
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,351
Shall I give him some shares?

47
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,355
Properties?

48
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:53,937
I'll let Gao Erfan check these.

49
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,226
No, no.

50
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:56,435
If you do that to Dr. Ling,

51
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:57,333
he'll be scared.

52
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,204
Girl, you're naive.

53
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:02,337
I'm trying to give him

54
00:04:02,337 --> 00:04:03,084
a strong sense of security.

55
00:04:07,653 --> 00:04:08,515
Previously,

56
00:04:08,995 --> 00:04:09,697
I always thought that

57
00:04:09,724 --> 00:04:11,164
Ling Rui was a warm person.

58
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:12,666
It turns out that

59
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:14,595
he had such days before.

60
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:17,320
Ms. Lu,

61
00:04:17,803 --> 00:04:19,419
are you sick?

62
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,746
What are you doing?

63
00:04:21,884 --> 00:04:22,542
No, no.

64
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,804
I mean,

65
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,560
you love Dr. Ling so much,

66
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:27,342
Love?

67
00:04:28,444 --> 00:04:29,226
Don't tell me that

68
00:04:29,262 --> 00:04:30,568
you don't feel anything.

69
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:31,330
Ms. Lu,

70
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,075
do you know what you're doing?

71
00:04:36,177 --> 00:04:36,711
I...

72
00:04:38,382 --> 00:04:38,960
I just...

73
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,102
Take care of

74
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,328
the father of my future baby.

75
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,773
Only my baby's father is in a good mood,

76
00:04:44,924 --> 00:04:45,813
can the baby

77
00:04:45,813 --> 00:04:46,622
be in a good mood.

78
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,373
I'm considering it from a genetic point of view.

79
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,084
Let me put it this way.

80
00:04:51,857 --> 00:04:53,315
Even if you're lying to Dr. Ling that

81
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,328
you don't want a baby.

82
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,528
But what about then?

83
00:04:55,848 --> 00:04:57,235
Having a baby with you is

84
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:58,568
what Dr. Ling doesn't want.

85
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:00,168
Will you force him?

86
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,408
Ms. Lu,

87
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:10,090
have you ever been in love?

88
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,977
Are you single since born?

89
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,453
What?

90
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,328
Single since born? What do you mean?

91
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,235
It means

92
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:26,462
ever since you were born,

93
00:05:26,462 --> 00:05:27,671
you've never been in love.

94
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:30,640
How is it possible?

95
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:33,333
Tell me about it.

96
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,648
How many times have you been in love?

97
00:05:34,862 --> 00:05:35,795
Or I wouldn't believe you.

98
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,288
So many?

99
00:05:47,324 --> 00:05:48,020
One.

100
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,515
Strictly speaking, it's one point five.

101
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:51,777
Why is there half a point left?

102
00:05:52,017 --> 00:05:52,968
The kind that

103
00:05:53,502 --> 00:05:54,773
he thought he's in love with me.

104
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,400
But I was actually taking him as a subject.

105
00:05:57,404 --> 00:05:58,400
His family sells soy sauce.

106
00:05:58,435 --> 00:06:00,275
Okay, okay, this doesn't count.

107
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,582
What's the one left?

108
00:06:02,124 --> 00:06:03,271
That's a serious one.

109
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:04,008
We're in love.

110
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,217
Later,

111
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,151
because of some reason,

112
00:06:06,177 --> 00:06:07,280
we broke up,

113
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,657
I was even a little sad.

114
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,831
At that time,

115
00:06:12,453 --> 00:06:13,466
he confessed his love to me.

116
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,688
and gave me a box of chocolates.

117
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,262
I gave him a gift back.

118
00:06:17,457 --> 00:06:18,791
What did you send back?

119
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:21,420
I don't know if you've bought one.

120
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:22,430
Those stickers,

121
00:06:22,506 --> 00:06:23,226
the puffy ones.

122
00:06:23,262 --> 00:06:24,090
Not the normal kinds.

123
00:06:24,373 --> 00:06:25,875
I remembered it was quite expensive.

124
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:26,568
Five yuan for a piece.

125
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:28,684
Did you buy one?

126
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:29,520
I bought one.

127
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,888
How old were you?

128
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:35,710
Seven or eight.

129
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,306
I can't remember it, around the third grade of primary school.

130
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,093
How can this be counted?

131
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,586
It doesn't count?

132
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,093
What is love then?

133
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:49,146
Love is that I...

134
00:06:50,355 --> 00:06:51,333
He...

135
00:07:20,053 --> 00:07:20,568
You're back.

136
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,217
I'm cooking.

137
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:47,457
What's the matter?

138
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,711
You're really back?

139
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,142
How did you come back?

140
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,706
Air traffic control today.

141
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,666
The flight was canceled.

142
00:07:52,986 --> 00:07:53,640
We had conference calls

143
00:07:53,662 --> 00:07:54,435
the whole day.

144
00:07:55,715 --> 00:07:56,640
You are cooking.

145
00:07:58,275 --> 00:07:59,084
On the way back,

146
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,480
I bought some vegetables by the way.

147
00:08:01,475 --> 00:08:03,128
How's your day today?

148
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,133
How was your work going?

149
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,937
Pretty good.

150
00:08:06,648 --> 00:08:08,471
With specialists in pancreatic diseases,

151
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:10,195
we exchanged many new technologies.

152
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
I heard that in Germany,

153
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:13,057
they have some new adjuvant therapies.

154
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,631
There have been successful cases of healing.

155
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:15,582
I'm so happy.

156
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,315
I'm talking about these,

157
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:20,222
will you feel bored?

158
00:08:20,257 --> 00:08:21,670
No, no, no.

159
00:08:21,706 --> 00:08:22,480
I like it.

160
00:08:22,622 --> 00:08:23,490
What else did you do?

161
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,884
I had lunch with colleagues.

162
00:08:26,853 --> 00:08:27,555
In the afternoon,

163
00:08:27,573 --> 00:08:28,800
we had a brief exchange.

164
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:29,724
Nothing else.

165
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,275
How about you?

166
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,355
I...

167
00:08:33,155 --> 00:08:34,551
I was busy making money.

168
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:35,555
Nothing to say.

169
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:38,844
Having had a long day,

170
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:40,781
you must be very tired.

171
00:08:41,261 --> 00:08:42,452
Why don't stop cooking?

172
00:08:42,524 --> 00:08:43,422
Let's dine out.

173
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,390
My treat.

174
00:08:44,444 --> 00:08:45,920
Do you want Japanese or French food?

175
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:50,826
Well...

176
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,560
If you don't like it,

177
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,973
you can treat me, too.

178
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,457
I can eat whatever you like.

179
00:08:56,506 --> 00:08:57,493
I like the feeling of

180
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,808
eating with my family.

181
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,586
I'd like to cook for them.

182
00:09:01,022 --> 00:09:01,937
I won't get tired of that.

183
00:09:04,017 --> 00:09:04,951
I like it, then.

184
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,960
What's wrong with you today?

185
00:09:26,675 --> 00:09:27,680
Why you keep looking at me?

186
00:09:31,493 --> 00:09:32,302
You cried?

187
00:09:36,044 --> 00:09:36,648
No.

188
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,453
Probably because that

189
00:09:39,644 --> 00:09:41,128
I haven't rested well these two days.

190
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,102
I suppose so.

191
00:09:43,804 --> 00:09:44,933
No one dares to bully you.

192
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,168
Only you dare to bully me.

193
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,813
Nothing.

194
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,080
Ling Rui.

195
00:10:02,497 --> 00:10:03,660
Today, I

196
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,920
really, really,

197
00:10:05,964 --> 00:10:07,377
really want to hug you.

198
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,831
Can I hug you?

199
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:13,093
Sure.

200
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,977
I'll get some food.

201
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,500
Okay,

202
00:10:46,977 --> 00:10:47,650
Fangning,

203
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,835
why are you like

204
00:10:50,853 --> 00:10:51,724
a child today?

205
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,622
Don't do that,

206
00:10:53,377 --> 00:10:54,711
I can't cook.

207
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:55,893
It doesn't matter.

208
00:10:55,973 --> 00:10:56,622
Go ahead.

209
00:11:02,977 --> 00:11:04,053
Fangning, come on.

210
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:04,871
Come.

211
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:09,111
Here.

212
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,404
Stand still.

213
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,631
Against the wall.

214
00:11:13,591 --> 00:11:14,044
Don't move.

215
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,933
What's wrong?

216
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,386
What are you doing?

217
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,057
What's wrong?

218
00:11:24,773 --> 00:11:25,244
Against it.

219
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:27,306
Don't let it fall off.

220
00:11:30,604 --> 00:11:31,164
Hold it.

221
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:33,137
Hold it still.

222
00:11:37,182 --> 00:11:37,751
Don't move.

223
00:11:38,248 --> 00:11:39,164
Dinner will be ready soon.

224
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,453
Wait a second.

225
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:41,964
Be good.

226
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,640
You, you made me like this...

227
00:11:45,102 --> 00:11:46,160
I can't even move.

228
00:11:46,702 --> 00:11:48,293
That's the reason.

229
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:49,760
Or I can't cook.

230
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,280
Then...

231
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,324
What can be called as

232
00:12:08,088 --> 00:12:08,782
love?

233
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,275
Love is you will care

234
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,288
whether he's happy or not.

235
00:12:30,408 --> 00:12:31,635
All your emotions

236
00:12:31,982 --> 00:12:33,368
are influenced by him.

237
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,831
Is the person really not a fool?

238
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:40,373
Don't want to force him to

239
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:42,177
do what he doesn't want to do.

240
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:45,324
You want to help him achieve everything he wants.

241
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,551
You want to give him your most important things.

242
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,328
All to him.

243
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,280
Ling Rui,

244
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,337
I want to officially inform you

245
00:12:58,515 --> 00:12:59,626
I wanna be with you,

246
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,493
from marriage...

247
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:05,964
I'll open the door.

248
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:07,120
That's fine.

249
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,017
I'll go.

250
00:13:13,724 --> 00:13:14,533
Who's that?

251
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,577
Who?

252
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,844
Lu Fangning,

253
00:13:21,564 --> 00:13:22,930
you are just forcing him!

254
00:13:23,173 --> 00:13:23,875
Tang Pingping,

255
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,653
why are you making a scene here at my house?

256
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,160
I didn't expect that

257
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,937
you used their family debt

258
00:13:29,991 --> 00:13:31,297
to force him to marry you.

259
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:32,604
I'm warning you

260
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,240
slander is also a crime.

261
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,306
I did not slander.

262
00:13:36,195 --> 00:13:37,102
I knew all about it.

263
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:40,417
The marriage between you two

264
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,955
was fake from the beginning.

265
00:13:49,235 --> 00:13:50,026
You don't talk?

266
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,031
You admit it?

267
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:51,848
Shut up.

268
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,128
You forced him with money.

269
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,048
You don't love him at all.

270
00:13:55,128 --> 00:13:56,062
Who gives you the right

271
00:13:56,088 --> 00:13:57,040
to speculate on

272
00:13:57,075 --> 00:13:57,920
my feelings?

273
00:13:59,128 --> 00:13:59,902
Tang Pingping,

274
00:14:01,111 --> 00:14:02,133
listen carefully.

275
00:14:02,613 --> 00:14:03,955
How did Ling Rui and I meet.

276
00:14:03,955 --> 00:14:05,013
It's none of your business.

277
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,266
Besides, I'm telling you.

278
00:14:06,906 --> 00:14:08,222
I really love him.

279
00:14:08,906 --> 00:14:10,010
As long as he's happy,

280
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:10,960
I'll be happy.

281
00:14:11,102 --> 00:14:12,186
If he is not happy,

282
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,795
I'll try to make him happy.

283
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,066
I won't let him do anything

284
00:14:15,102 --> 00:14:16,000
he doesn't like to do.

285
00:14:16,035 --> 00:14:16,693
On the contrary,

286
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,180
I will give him my most precious things,

287
00:14:18,204 --> 00:14:18,960
all to him.

288
00:14:19,466 --> 00:14:20,897
For the first time

289
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:21,884
since I was a child, I understand

290
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,937
what it is to truly love a person.

291
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:24,880
Right.

292
00:14:25,306 --> 00:14:25,742
Yes,

293
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,191
I love him.

294
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,373
Finally I say it out.

295
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,217
Feels good.

296
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,173
Dr. Ling. Dr. Ling.

297
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:48,826
Ms. tang,

298
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:51,368
Fangning and I have a happy marriage.

299
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:53,004
Thank you for your concern.

300
00:14:54,053 --> 00:14:55,130
You witnessed it.

301
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,097
Are you satisfied?

302
00:14:56,737 --> 00:14:57,475
Now,

303
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:58,764
please,

304
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:00,880
get out.

305
00:15:01,955 --> 00:15:02,675
Your hand.

306
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:08,755
I hate you!

307
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:15,422
Close the door.

308
00:15:28,088 --> 00:15:28,426
Damn it.

309
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,142
Lu Fangning,

310
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:31,466
wait and see.

311
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:32,380
I'm sure I'll get Ling Rui

312
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:33,342
back to me.

313
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,253
I won't lose to you.

314
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,311
So cold.

315
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,697
You drove me out.

316
00:15:44,231 --> 00:15:44,817
One day,

317
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:46,080
you'll try this, Lu Fangning!

318
00:15:47,164 --> 00:15:47,742
Hum!

319
00:15:48,302 --> 00:15:48,853
Hum.

320
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,666
You

321
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:12,462
don't hate vegetables anymore?

322
00:16:13,777 --> 00:16:15,342
I'll buy more tomorrow.

323
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,382
No.

324
00:16:20,071 --> 00:16:20,720
Whatever.

325
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,786
All is fine.

326
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,408
Ling Rui,

327
00:16:38,195 --> 00:16:39,120
you...

328
00:16:39,271 --> 00:16:41,173
don't you have anything to say?

329
00:16:45,111 --> 00:16:45,724
What?

330
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:49,466
About my confession

331
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,542
to you tonight,

332
00:16:50,773 --> 00:16:52,382
don't you have anything to say?

333
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:57,146
I knew it's

334
00:16:57,146 --> 00:16:58,400
an excuse

335
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,235
to make Tang Ping give up.

336
00:16:59,448 --> 00:17:00,568
To let her give up,

337
00:17:00,622 --> 00:17:01,680
I have thousands of reasons.

338
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,555
Did I have to say that?

339
00:17:05,075 --> 00:17:05,653
Perhaps,

340
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:09,350
this is the most convenient one.

341
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,336
Ling Rui, look at me.

342
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:19,643
Look at me.

343
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:22,053
Now I solemnly

344
00:17:22,097 --> 00:17:23,297
tell you once again,

345
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,440
I love you.

346
00:17:28,204 --> 00:17:30,124
You've said that many times.

347
00:17:31,271 --> 00:17:32,008
This time...

348
00:17:32,328 --> 00:17:33,564
I really love you.

349
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:35,617
I mean it. That's true.

350
00:17:36,675 --> 00:17:36,986
No,

351
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,088
you were just impulsive,

352
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,617
trying to upset Tang Ping.

353
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,120
I didn't know what happened to you today.

354
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,853
But love

355
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,280
is not something so casual.

356
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,035
I'm full, I'll go back to my room.

357
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,320
Tell me when you're done.

358
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:55,884
I'll take care of it.

359
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,053
You are so stupid.

360
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,355
Who wants to have a baby with you?

361
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,182
Get what you deserve.

362
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:30,631
This time,

363
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,248
I really love you.

364
00:18:32,284 --> 00:18:33,093
I mean it.

365
00:18:33,093 --> 00:18:34,684
That's true.

366
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,124
I've tried all.

367
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,951
What the hell do you want me to do?

368
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,617
Ling Rui,

369
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,746
I love you.

370
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:20,568
Ling Rui,

371
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,884
I love you.

372
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,528
Ling Rui works in the hospital every day.

373
00:19:44,177 --> 00:19:45,250
I think he has

374
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,435
got fed up with white coat.

375
00:19:46,586 --> 00:19:47,120
No.

376
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,386
This is good.

377
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:53,500
I'm not wearing anything under this.

378
00:19:54,275 --> 00:19:55,377
It looks sexy.

379
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:02,817
Ling Rui.

380
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:08,702
No.

381
00:20:09,564 --> 00:20:10,300
It will let him recall

382
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,368
the bad memories.

383
00:20:19,822 --> 00:20:20,542
Why?

384
00:20:21,591 --> 00:20:23,128
Why do I have to dress up like this?

385
00:20:33,688 --> 00:20:35,280
Even if she said she was serious,

386
00:20:35,662 --> 00:20:36,693
and she didn't mean to lose to Tang Ping,

387
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,382
it's because I just give her

388
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,182
a sense of freshness.

389
00:20:43,084 --> 00:20:44,204
It will fade away soon.

390
00:21:05,404 --> 00:21:06,897
The plan of "a million a year".

391
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,093
Half your fortune.

392
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,568
All properties.

393
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,764
Didn't you bring it up, Ms. Lu?

394
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:40,053
Why it worked before?

395
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,511
But now it can't.

396
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,004
Yeah.

397
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,146
Why worked before?

398
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:47,013
But now it can't...

399
00:21:48,453 --> 00:21:49,400
Because you got refused

400
00:21:49,431 --> 00:21:50,177
by Dr. Ling once?

401
00:21:52,168 --> 00:21:53,831
I mean...

402
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:56,737
Ms. Lu, your love for Dr. Ling

403
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:58,053
is much deeper.

404
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,751
The more you care about,

405
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,573
the more you'll consider gain and loss.

406
00:22:05,786 --> 00:22:07,111
Gain and loss...

407
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:11,050
I never thought that one day,

408
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,177
those three words

409
00:22:12,213 --> 00:22:13,146
will be related to me.

410
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,835
You know what?

411
00:22:15,564 --> 00:22:16,595
Even if I give Ling Rui

412
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:18,506
the plan of "a million a year"

413
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:19,751
and all my properties,

414
00:22:19,804 --> 00:22:20,693
Ling Rui won't accept it.

415
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:21,173
Why?

416
00:22:21,288 --> 00:22:22,595
Because he's so great.

417
00:22:22,888 --> 00:22:24,480
His job is to heal the wounded and rescue the dying.

418
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:25,546
After he gets off work,

419
00:22:25,546 --> 00:22:26,782
he continues to do that.

420
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:28,230
Save and help

421
00:22:28,248 --> 00:22:29,146
more people,

422
00:22:29,226 --> 00:22:30,151
more importantly, for free.

423
00:22:30,862 --> 00:22:31,395
So,

424
00:22:32,444 --> 00:22:33,466
compared with Ling Rui,

425
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,328
I'm nothing.

426
00:22:37,724 --> 00:22:39,102
From now on,

427
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,613
I want to be like him,

428
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,560
be a warm person,

429
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,857
a noble person,

430
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,360
a perfect match for him.

431
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,191
A woman who really matches him.

432
00:22:47,377 --> 00:22:48,960
I want to be

433
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:50,311
an angel.

434
00:22:51,422 --> 00:22:52,400
Ms. Lu,

435
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:54,586
you are an angel.

436
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:58,471
Do you lack of money?

437
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,795
Do you want the watch?

438
00:23:02,266 --> 00:23:03,084
I see you haven't

439
00:23:03,093 --> 00:23:03,680
had a watch.

440
00:23:03,742 --> 00:23:04,968
-This watch is expensive.
-No, Ms. Lu.

441
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:16,800
Dad.

442
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,040
Come on.

443
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,577
Daddy.

444
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,075
How much do you want?

445
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:31,813
Eighty thousand?

446
00:23:32,951 --> 00:23:34,106
No.

447
00:23:41,075 --> 00:23:42,400
Eight thousand? No problem.

448
00:23:42,817 --> 00:23:44,186
No.

449
00:23:56,008 --> 00:23:56,462
IOU.

450
00:23:56,497 --> 00:23:57,800
Tang Ping borrows four million

451
00:23:57,804 --> 00:23:58,542
from Dad, Tang Dawei.

452
00:23:58,577 --> 00:23:59,440
Definitely will pay back later.

453
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:00,577
Borrower, Tang Ping.

454
00:24:01,377 --> 00:24:01,870
Right.

455
00:24:07,528 --> 00:24:08,142
Pingping.

456
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,368
Tell me honestly.

457
00:24:11,422 --> 00:24:12,568
Did you do something

458
00:24:12,595 --> 00:24:13,608
very bad?

459
00:24:14,106 --> 00:24:15,537
I didn't break the law.

460
00:24:15,884 --> 00:24:16,568
That's right.

461
00:24:17,662 --> 00:24:18,684
You don't have the ability.

462
00:24:19,573 --> 00:24:20,008
But,

463
00:24:21,031 --> 00:24:22,177
you're not that capable,

464
00:24:22,231 --> 00:24:22,942
others can be.

465
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,608
Tell me the truth.

466
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,880
Did someone cheat you?

467
00:24:27,164 --> 00:24:28,408
Did they brainwash you?

468
00:24:29,155 --> 00:24:30,497
No.

469
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,595
What are you talking about?

470
00:24:33,386 --> 00:24:34,266
Lend it or not?

471
00:24:36,337 --> 00:24:37,537
If you don't lend it to me, I'll go to uncle Lu.

472
00:24:40,871 --> 00:24:42,115
You didn't break the law?

473
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:42,817
No.

474
00:24:43,342 --> 00:24:44,666
You must have been cheated then.

475
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:45,928
I told you earlier.

476
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:46,977
You're not clever.

477
00:24:47,004 --> 00:24:47,822
You don't believe me.

478
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,511
Is there some love rat who

479
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,675
asked you for four million?

480
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,440
Is it?

481
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:53,102
Love rat?

482
00:24:54,106 --> 00:24:54,622
Yes.

483
00:24:55,173 --> 00:24:56,746
Tell me, what kind of man

484
00:24:56,817 --> 00:24:57,850
can casually

485
00:24:57,893 --> 00:24:59,137
ask four million from a girl?

486
00:24:59,324 --> 00:25:00,826
Isn't him a love rat?

487
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,880
Lu Fangning gave Dr. Ling four million.

488
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,097
Dr. Ling becomes a love rat?

489
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,573
If I tell uncle Lu

490
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,835
ad tell everyone the truth.

491
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:07,706
They will feel that

492
00:25:07,777 --> 00:25:08,820
Dr. Ling is a bad man.

493
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,853
I can't say anything.

494
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:13,226
Will you lend me or not?

495
00:25:15,084 --> 00:25:15,640
No.

496
00:25:16,275 --> 00:25:17,591
Lend it or not?

497
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,351
No!

498
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,777
Yes or no!

499
00:25:22,613 --> 00:25:23,697
Where is the bad man?

500
00:25:23,715 --> 00:25:24,382
Let him come.

501
00:25:24,631 --> 00:25:25,244
I'll give him.

502
00:25:25,804 --> 00:25:27,324
I'll give him four hundred slaps!

503
00:25:28,666 --> 00:25:30,080
There's no bad man, no.

504
00:25:30,142 --> 00:25:31,368
Not like that!

505
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,302
What is that then?

506
00:25:33,893 --> 00:25:34,980
I want to get cosmetic surgery!

507
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,168
To look like Lu Fangning.

508
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,164
Okay?

509
00:25:37,866 --> 00:25:38,311
Cosmetic surgery?

510
00:25:39,466 --> 00:25:40,720
To look like Lu Fangning?

511
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,551
Any amount of money will do.

512
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,671
Can you give the goods to me now?

513
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:51,466
Can I resell it?

514
00:25:51,528 --> 00:25:53,217
I'm really anxious, you know.

515
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,773
I just want to resell the goods.

516
00:25:59,110 --> 00:25:59,706
Okay?

517
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:01,840
Let's stop here now.

518
00:26:03,448 --> 00:26:04,320
Dr. Ling.

519
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:07,955
Ms. Tang.

520
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:10,080
About what happened last night,

521
00:26:10,373 --> 00:26:11,004
I hope...

522
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:11,893
Don't worry.

523
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,720
I won't say it out.

524
00:26:13,013 --> 00:26:13,893
For your reputation.

525
00:26:14,053 --> 00:26:14,737
For your fame

526
00:26:15,048 --> 00:26:16,017
and your future.

527
00:26:16,417 --> 00:26:17,688
I won't say anything.

528
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:20,951
Thank you, Ms. Tang for

529
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,791
leaving me and Fangning to

530
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,844
take care of our own person affairs.

531
00:26:28,364 --> 00:26:29,840
From now on,

532
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,386
let's get down to business.

533
00:26:32,471 --> 00:26:33,066
Dr. Ling,

534
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,826
I know your present situation.

535
00:26:35,111 --> 00:26:36,417
You can't be with me.

536
00:26:36,568 --> 00:26:37,191
Even...

537
00:26:37,404 --> 00:26:38,320
You can't even show

538
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,582
your true feelings.

539
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,777
But a year later, you can do it.

540
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,111
A year later,

541
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,728
you'll divorce Lu Fangning.

542
00:26:45,413 --> 00:26:46,311
By that time,

543
00:26:46,613 --> 00:26:47,440
I'm the first candidate

544
00:26:47,484 --> 00:26:48,640
of your girlfriend.

545
00:26:48,995 --> 00:26:49,671
Ms. Tang.

546
00:26:49,928 --> 00:26:50,737
Okay, I know.

547
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,862
You don't have to promise me anything now.

548
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,577
I'll wait for you forever.

549
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,600
Because...

550
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,155
I

551
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,346
love

552
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,093
you.

553
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,497
I

554
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:01,413
love

555
00:27:01,715 --> 00:27:02,293
you.

556
00:27:04,168 --> 00:27:04,720
Ms. Tang,

557
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,355
you don't have to wait for me.

558
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,920
Neither will we, in the future,

559
00:27:07,973 --> 00:27:09,004
have any relationship.

560
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,671
Of course, you also want your father to be healthy.

561
00:27:12,106 --> 00:27:12,497
So,

562
00:27:13,155 --> 00:27:14,142
we don't even have to maintain

563
00:27:14,142 --> 00:27:14,960
doctor-patient relationship.

564
00:27:16,577 --> 00:27:17,324
I said that

565
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,377
I didn't need you to promise anything to me.

566
00:27:21,644 --> 00:27:22,755
I just want

567
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,320
what you wore at the hospital,

568
00:27:24,444 --> 00:27:25,146
your own

569
00:27:25,306 --> 00:27:26,133
number plate.

570
00:27:27,475 --> 00:27:28,195
I'm leaving.

571
00:27:29,057 --> 00:27:29,733
Dr. Ling.

572
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,373
Okay, okay.

573
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,680
I don't talk about love.

574
00:27:33,946 --> 00:27:34,580
I'll make money to

575
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:35,706
set you free from Lu Fangning.

576
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,180
Dr. Ling.

577
00:27:38,231 --> 00:27:38,940
You can not

578
00:27:38,968 --> 00:27:40,017
be cheated by Lu Fangning.

579
00:27:40,151 --> 00:27:40,830
Since she was small,

580
00:27:40,853 --> 00:27:41,680
she has always grabbed what I like.

581
00:27:41,982 --> 00:27:43,235
Pingping. Fanfan.

582
00:27:43,235 --> 00:27:44,240
Liangliang. Dingding.

583
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,111
Whatever I liked,

584
00:27:45,111 --> 00:27:46,177
she all grabbed away.

585
00:27:46,586 --> 00:27:47,226
So,

586
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,080
please do,

587
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,220
promise me,

588
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,008
control yourself.

589
00:27:54,266 --> 00:27:54,960
Dr. Ling.

590
00:27:55,262 --> 00:27:56,186
I love you.

591
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:03,848
Done.

592
00:28:15,715 --> 00:28:16,533
Whatever I liked,

593
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:17,475
she all grabbed away.

594
00:28:17,893 --> 00:28:18,622
Dr. Ling,

595
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,000
you can't be cheated by Lu Fangning.

596
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,466
Dr Ling,

597
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:27,520
the operation is all ready.

598
00:28:28,711 --> 00:28:29,128
I know.

599
00:28:34,533 --> 00:28:35,662
Dr. Ling?

600
00:29:01,626 --> 00:29:02,951
You can draw a little bit more on this side,

601
00:29:02,995 --> 00:29:03,555
right?

602
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,302
Yes.

603
00:29:08,088 --> 00:29:08,631
Exactly.

604
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:10,871
Xinbao, you're drawing.

605
00:29:11,235 --> 00:29:11,857
Dr. Ling.

606
00:29:12,986 --> 00:29:14,106
Xinbao is drawing you.

607
00:29:14,168 --> 00:29:15,413
He said this afternoon, he will attend

608
00:29:15,431 --> 00:29:16,275
the charity auction with it.

609
00:29:16,577 --> 00:29:17,306
Really?

610
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,631
It's me?

611
00:29:18,888 --> 00:29:19,733
Can you show me?

612
00:29:19,786 --> 00:29:21,306
That's not how the game works.

613
00:29:21,528 --> 00:29:23,244
Sis said who gave the most money

614
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,364
can see it.

615
00:29:25,635 --> 00:29:26,035
Okay.

616
00:29:26,622 --> 00:29:28,000
I'll come to the auction this afternoon.

617
00:29:28,444 --> 00:29:28,960
At that time,

618
00:29:29,377 --> 00:29:30,177
I'll see your painting.

619
00:29:30,506 --> 00:29:31,120
Really?

620
00:29:31,235 --> 00:29:31,546
Yes.

621
00:29:31,964 --> 00:29:32,711
Dr. Ling,

622
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:33,848
I love you.

623
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:37,271
All right, Xinbao.

624
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,577
Dr. Ling has other things to do.

625
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,546
Let's leave him alone,

626
00:29:39,564 --> 00:29:39,831
okay?

627
00:29:39,857 --> 00:29:40,337
Okay.

628
00:29:41,733 --> 00:29:42,693
Come on, let's go on.

629
00:29:52,355 --> 00:29:52,773
Hello?

630
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,417
Ms. Lu,

631
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:56,968
the charity auction is in the afternoon.

632
00:29:57,093 --> 00:29:57,991
I'll talk to him in a minute

633
00:29:58,053 --> 00:29:59,200
and I'll remind him.

634
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:00,311
No problem.

635
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,231
Let's play it by ear.

636
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,862
I told you

637
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:05,760
you got the wrong number.

638
00:30:10,293 --> 00:30:11,546
Someone dialed the wrong number.

639
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,271
The charity auction in the afternoon,

640
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:22,782
don't forget to attend.

641
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,800
I know, I'll be there.

642
00:30:31,217 --> 00:30:32,631
It can help sick children

643
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,364
and I can get close to Ling Rui.

644
00:30:34,853 --> 00:30:35,902
I, Lu Fangning,

645
00:30:35,937 --> 00:30:37,831
am definitely an angel.

646
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,586
An angel.

647
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,986
Let's welcome our great charitarian,

648
00:30:44,986 --> 00:30:46,080
Ms. Lu Fangning.

649
00:30:49,351 --> 00:30:50,915
All right, welcome with applause.

650
00:30:51,173 --> 00:30:51,786
Hi.

651
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:56,960
Hello, everyone.

652
00:30:57,386 --> 00:30:58,488
I do all this

653
00:30:58,586 --> 00:30:59,760
is to help

654
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,062
the children who are struggling with their illness.

655
00:31:02,106 --> 00:31:02,800
Of course,

656
00:31:03,422 --> 00:31:04,560
it's for one person.

657
00:31:05,146 --> 00:31:06,106
He is...

658
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,448
No.

659
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,840
Ling Rui doesn't like that.

660
00:31:30,204 --> 00:31:30,853
Am I

661
00:31:30,897 --> 00:31:32,070
cutting a splash?

662
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,751
Anonymous?

663
00:31:34,666 --> 00:31:35,991
Do good and leave no mark.

664
00:31:35,991 --> 00:31:36,888
It's not my style.

665
00:31:37,404 --> 00:31:38,000
Forget it.

666
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,982
Nice drawing.

667
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,484
Fangning, you keep a low profile today.

668
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,284
Not like your style.

669
00:32:02,408 --> 00:32:03,333
Adjust the plan.

670
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,284
Do as plan B.

671
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,760
You go and help me call the price.

672
00:32:06,026 --> 00:32:07,502
And then unwittingly,

673
00:32:07,502 --> 00:32:08,640
do as natural as you can,

674
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,342
disclose it to Ling Rui.

675
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:10,290
Tell him that

676
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:11,208
I did it all.

677
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:15,271
You're so considerate to Ling Rui.

678
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:17,300
I feel very relieved.

679
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:21,820
You think he'd appreciate me more

680
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,546
if I did like this, right?

681
00:32:26,755 --> 00:32:28,044
Okay, dear friends.

682
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:29,120
Our little painters

683
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,026

684
00:32:30,026 --> 00:32:31,022
is about to begin.

685
00:32:31,413 --> 00:32:32,115

Please don't walk around.

689
00:32:44,924 --> 00:32:45,786

Raise your hand.

Well...1,050.

716
00:33:18,977 --> 00:33:20,097

Okay, 2,050.

00:33:33,022 --> 00:33:33,733
Let it be.

Anyone offers higher?

00:33:35,582 --> 00:33:36,515
Okay, 6,000 yuan, the first time.

You get the painting.

736
00:33:44,462 --> 00:33:45,217
Adjust the plan.

737
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:45,768
Plan C.

738
00:33:45,804 --> 00:33:46,693
Thank you, young lady.

739
00:33:47,128 --> 00:33:48,960
Okay, let's move to the next painting.

740
00:33:49,031 --> 00:33:50,800
What does plan C mean?

741
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:53,848
Plan C is like

742
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:55,920
we just keep raising the price.

743
00:33:56,355 --> 00:33:57,386
When it's pretty high,

744
00:33:57,422 --> 00:33:58,035
let her get it.

745
00:33:58,090 --> 00:33:59,688
Tang Ping is pushy.

746
00:33:59,768 --> 00:34:01,155
Let her enjoy this.

747
00:34:01,297 --> 00:34:01,991
Just remember to

748
00:34:01,991 --> 00:34:02,986
tell Ling Rui at last that

749
00:34:03,048 --> 00:34:04,480
I did these all on purpose.

750
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,120
The purpose is

751
00:34:05,164 --> 00:34:06,530
to raise more money

752
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:07,760
for the kids in this hospital.

753
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:10,008
She wants to battle with me.

754
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,431
Just give it to her.

755
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:12,900
Congratulations, this sir.

756
00:34:13,146 --> 00:34:14,177

drawn by our Beibei.

760
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,346
For this painting,

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,604
the starting price is still 100 yuan.

00:34:26,933 --> 00:34:27,715
-5,000 yuan.
-Give it to her.

767
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:29,590

00:34:33,848 --> 00:34:34,755
Okay, deal.

771
00:34:35,635 --> 00:34:36,470
Congratulations again to this

772
00:34:36,487 --> 00:34:37,367
beautiful young lady.

773
00:34:38,062 --> 00:34:38,640
Okay.

774
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:40,443
So the third one is...

775
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,102
Is that what you mean?

776
00:34:41,155 --> 00:34:41,950
Right.

777
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,421
...right this one.

778
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:44,871
This one was

779
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,666
created by an eight-year-old kid.

780
00:34:46,862 --> 00:34:47,875
2,050.

781
00:34:48,034 --> 00:34:48,674
5,000.

782
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:50,310
Congratulations to this beautiful young lady.

783
00:34:50,346 --> 00:34:51,600
About the next painting.

784
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,369
It's interesting.

785
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,025
Van Gogh's sunflowers.

786
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,560
4,000.

787
00:34:54,621 --> 00:34:55,225
6,000.

788
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:55,946
Deal!

789
00:34:55,991 --> 00:34:57,146
Okay, the following one.

790
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:58,400
This one, Underwater World,

791
00:34:58,524 --> 00:35:01,271
was created by a six-year-old kid.

792
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:01,848
4,000.

793
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,515
8,000.

794
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,208
Deal!

795
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:05,013
Congratulations again to this beautiful young lady.

796
00:35:05,093 --> 00:35:06,290
She got another painting.

797
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,008
Beautiful young lady...

798
00:35:12,755 --> 00:35:14,142
Okay, the next one.

799
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,782
Here comes the last painting of this auction.

800
00:35:16,986 --> 00:35:18,213
The author of this painting

801
00:35:18,213 --> 00:35:19,200
is our cute Xinbao.

802
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,133
He's also here with us.

803
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:21,546
Let's give him a round of applause, okay?

804
00:35:22,906 --> 00:35:23,786
Good!

805
00:35:23,884 --> 00:35:24,835
Okay, Xinbao.

806
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:26,240
About this painting,

807
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,084
I'd like to ask

808
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:28,942
what's the name of it?

809
00:35:30,142 --> 00:35:31,084
It's

810
00:35:31,457 --> 00:35:31,946
My

811
00:35:32,355 --> 00:35:33,253
Dear

812
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,746
Dr. Ling.

813
00:35:39,351 --> 00:35:40,035
An angel.

814
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:42,675
Holy light.

815
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:45,297
Ling Rui.

816
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,795
Do get this one for me.

817
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:50,720
Xinbao.

818
00:35:50,826 --> 00:35:51,955
How much are you going to

819
00:35:51,973 --> 00:35:52,897
start for this painting?

820
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,524
100 yuan.

821
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,453
Okay, start from 100 yuan.

822
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:57,333
5,000.

823
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:58,657
5,000 yuan.

824
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:59,431
6,000.

825
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,720
8,000.

826
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,813
8,000 yuan.

827
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,351
-The young lady offered 8,000 yuan.
-Double it.

828
00:36:03,466 --> 00:36:04,400
16,000.

829
00:36:04,577 --> 00:36:05,280
16,000.

830
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:07,235
Are you happy now, Xinbao?

831
00:36:07,386 --> 00:36:08,053
20,000.

832
00:36:10,062 --> 00:36:10,604
You stop.

833
00:36:10,631 --> 00:36:11,320
Fangning, what shall I do?

834
00:36:11,324 --> 00:36:11,813
50,000.

835
00:36:11,857 --> 00:36:12,373
I...

836
00:36:22,106 --> 00:36:23,626
I said, 50,000.

837
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:25,884
60,000.

838
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,808
80,000.

839
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,337
100,000.

840
00:36:28,373 --> 00:36:28,871
200,000.

841
00:36:29,431 --> 00:36:30,071
500,000!

842
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,004
Stop Stop!

843
00:36:31,386 --> 00:36:32,844
Can you both give it a rest?

844
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,115
I can draw one for you, sister-in-law.

845
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,960
Let me draw one for you.

846
00:36:35,155 --> 00:36:36,115
I'll draw one for you, too.

847
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:36,630
How's that?

848
00:36:38,426 --> 00:36:39,973
The love of the two young ladies,

849
00:36:39,973 --> 00:36:41,191
I'm sure you can all feel it.

850
00:36:41,271 --> 00:36:42,284
Xinbao, do you feel it?

851
00:36:43,253 --> 00:36:44,035
Yes.

852
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,226
Okay, of course.

853
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:46,853
The way we show love

854
00:36:46,906 --> 00:36:48,115
is not just through

855
00:36:48,151 --> 00:36:49,244
this auction.

856
00:36:49,244 --> 00:36:50,977
I'm sure there will be more

857
00:36:50,977 --> 00:36:51,884
other ways

858
00:36:51,884 --> 00:36:52,755
and opportunities

859
00:36:52,755 --> 00:36:53,733
waiting for you two.

860
00:36:53,733 --> 00:36:54,524
You're right.

861
00:36:54,995 --> 00:36:55,928
So here, I

862
00:36:55,928 --> 00:36:56,862
announce to you all.

863
00:36:57,111 --> 00:36:59,084
I decided to fund one-year medical expenses

864
00:36:59,084 --> 00:36:59,964
for ten poor children

865
00:36:59,964 --> 00:37:01,680
in this hospital

866
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,155
free of charge.

867
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,386
I fund twenty kinds.

868
00:37:07,777 --> 00:37:08,453
Me, thirty.

869
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,173
Dr. Ling.

870
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:18,657
Xinbao.

871
00:37:19,244 --> 00:37:20,577
Dr. Ling wants it as well.

872
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,355
But I

873
00:37:23,297 --> 00:37:24,293
only have 2,000.

874
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,351
Can I?

875
00:37:25,768 --> 00:37:26,290
Xinbao,

876
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,297
how do you decide?

877
00:37:30,151 --> 00:37:30,720
Okay,

878
00:37:31,022 --> 00:37:32,960
because I drew Dr. Ling.

879
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,800
So I'll sell it to Dr. Ling.

880
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:37,955
2,000, deal. Congratulations.

881
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,071
So let's welcome

882
00:37:46,071 --> 00:37:47,404
all the successful bidders here

883
00:37:47,404 --> 00:37:48,817
to take a photo on the stage.

884
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:53,448
Why do we have this procedure?

885
00:37:54,364 --> 00:37:55,740
What's wrong with this procedure?

886
00:37:56,373 --> 00:37:58,088
Don't be anxious, sister-in-law.

887
00:37:58,142 --> 00:37:58,551
Don't worry.

888
00:37:58,595 --> 00:38:00,020
I'm sure I'll tell everything

889
00:38:00,062 --> 00:38:00,770
to Ling Rui.

890
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,804
Okay, let's give them a big hand.

891
00:38:10,444 --> 00:38:11,440
Don't you think about it?

892
00:38:11,493 --> 00:38:13,146
I can paint. I sell it for 500.

893
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:14,737
I'll give you 1,000, shut up.

894
00:38:25,235 --> 00:38:26,410
Bye, Dr. Ling.

895
00:38:28,275 --> 00:38:29,386
Fangning.

896
00:38:29,937 --> 00:38:30,871
Bye.

897
00:38:38,151 --> 00:38:38,897
It's okay.

898
00:38:51,973 --> 00:38:52,604
I'll back to work.

899
00:38:52,942 --> 00:38:53,644
You go back as well.

900
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:56,204
Ling Rui, actually I...

901
00:38:56,204 --> 00:38:56,960
I'm very busy.

902
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,444
Talk about it when we're at home.

903
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:00,995
-No.
-That's it.

904
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,351
The thing is over.

905
00:39:03,555 --> 00:39:04,257
I'll go back to the ward.

906
00:39:04,568 --> 00:39:05,662
What's going on?

907
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,306
Don't mention it, okay?

908
00:39:07,493 --> 00:39:08,097
Why?

909
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:12,080
Because I don't like.

910
00:39:12,471 --> 00:39:13,955
I don't like you casually

911
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,200
say those three words.

912
00:39:15,493 --> 00:39:16,640
I don't like it when you compete with others

913
00:39:16,675 --> 00:39:17,910
on this kind of thing.

914
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,768
So don't talk about it, okay?

915
00:39:19,831 --> 00:39:21,270
Why would you think so?

916
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,017
Who told you that?

917
00:39:22,053 --> 00:39:23,090
Who told you I casually did that?

918
00:39:23,111 --> 00:39:23,720
Tang Ping?

919
00:39:24,088 --> 00:39:25,200
Why you can believe her,

920
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:25,884
yet you can't believe me?

921
00:39:25,928 --> 00:39:27,048
I don't believe her.

922
00:39:27,608 --> 00:39:29,066
I believe what I know about you.

923
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:29,902
Why do you

924
00:39:29,946 --> 00:39:31,217
judge me casually?

925
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:32,844
I've never done that

926
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,124
to anyone else.

927
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,551
I was not competing with anyone.

928
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:37,866
What shall I do

929
00:39:37,884 --> 00:39:39,075
to make you believe me?

930
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,617
I can fund more people for you, okay?

931
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,831
So... Sorry.

932
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:48,302
Did I put my foot in my mouth again?

933
00:39:51,315 --> 00:39:51,946
Ling Rui,

934
00:39:53,164 --> 00:39:54,071
doing all these things,

935
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,404
I just wish I can

936
00:39:55,431 --> 00:39:56,835
get closer to you.

937
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,626
I hope you can truly fall in love with me.

938
00:39:59,644 --> 00:40:00,950
I admit what I did to you before

939
00:40:01,244 --> 00:40:02,675
was on the spur of the moment.

940
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,591
But since that has happened for many times,

941
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,515
it then becomes an indisputable fact that

942
00:40:10,462 --> 00:40:11,173
I love...

943
00:40:13,004 --> 00:40:13,822
Believe me.

944
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,817
When you're no longer impulsive and competitive,

945
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,000
you won't think so.

946
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,097
Don't say out anything you're not sure about.

947
00:40:22,373 --> 00:40:23,208
Anyway, I'm done.

948
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,693
I'm leaving.

949
00:40:43,475 --> 00:40:44,284
Our brand is

950
00:40:44,311 --> 00:40:45,870
a leading brand in the home furnishing industry.

951
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:46,880
We have the ability to

952
00:40:46,933 --> 00:40:48,702
lead the mainstream of the market.

953
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,808
Compared to our brand,

954
00:40:50,942 --> 00:40:52,604
our competitors have crude materials,

955
00:40:52,604 --> 00:40:53,511
and irrational structure.

956
00:40:53,644 --> 00:40:54,462
By contrast,

957
00:40:54,462 --> 00:40:55,235
we Infinity

958
00:40:55,235 --> 00:40:56,426
is the lightest and strongest.

959
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:00,080
Adjourn.

960
00:41:13,697 --> 00:41:15,991
Is my love so short?

961
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:19,591
It wilted before it even started.

962
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,351
Where's my next episode?

963
00:41:25,466 --> 00:41:27,128
Where is the next episode?

964
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:44,702
The next episode is coming.

965
00:41:45,653 --> 00:41:46,586
Director Lu.

966
00:41:49,271 --> 00:41:49,866
Lin Qi.

967
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:51,448
Director Lu.

968
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:57,591
Siyu.

969
00:42:01,306 --> 00:42:01,715
Siyu.

970
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,471
You got something to say?

971
00:42:08,764 --> 00:42:10,284
Go ahead with your work then.

972
00:42:11,610 --> 00:42:12,204
Go.

973
00:42:16,773 --> 00:42:17,870
The plan you just gave me

974
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,066
is not like what you said.

975
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,680
Check it again.

976
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,893
Okay, let me check.

977
00:42:22,888 --> 00:42:23,920
I'll give it to you later.

978
00:42:23,991 --> 00:42:24,853
Okay, give it to me later.

979
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:29,173
I'm sorry.
