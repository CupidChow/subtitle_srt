1
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,564
Begin Again

2
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,960
Episode 14

3
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:52,205
Shouldn't he call me now?

4
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:55,222
Why doesn't he stop me?

5
00:01:57,108 --> 00:01:58,331
Come on.

6
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,605
OK.

7
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:08,942
Really?

8
00:02:12,754 --> 00:02:14,182
This is really happening.

9
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:15,840
Oh, my god.

10
00:02:47,737 --> 00:02:49,005
Don't forget to apply the ointment.

11
00:02:58,617 --> 00:02:59,120
Sorry.

12
00:03:00,411 --> 00:03:01,782
You're the perfect choice for now.

13
00:03:37,897 --> 00:03:38,525
You're back.

14
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:51,565
I've thought about it,

15
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:53,291
and I think I need to

16
00:03:53,337 --> 00:03:54,342
express my gratitude to you.

17
00:03:54,914 --> 00:03:55,360
Thank you.

18
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:57,588
Thank me?

19
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,314
The issue about the material

20
00:04:01,394 --> 00:04:02,297
has been resolved.

21
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,777
Qin Yujiang helped me on this.

22
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,240
And I also know that

23
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:07,497
you met her

24
00:04:07,565 --> 00:04:08,708
at the factory.

25
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:10,411
Actually,

26
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,102
I didn't help much.

27
00:04:12,537 --> 00:04:14,514
Ms. Qin figured it out on her own.

28
00:04:15,508 --> 00:04:16,514
I figured it out too.

29
00:04:17,165 --> 00:04:18,845
I criticized her

30
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:21,141
and said that she

31
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:23,142
lost her principles for love.

32
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,506
But it turned out that

33
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:25,850
I did the same.

34
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:29,988
Ling Rui.

35
00:04:30,994 --> 00:04:31,691
Before,

36
00:04:32,331 --> 00:04:33,885
I've been so bossy and selfish.

37
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,373
You were right.

38
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,413
When a person lies too many times,

39
00:04:39,748 --> 00:04:40,891
she would probably just believe it.

40
00:04:43,234 --> 00:04:44,080
That gave you

41
00:04:44,148 --> 00:04:45,360
a lot of burden, right?

42
00:04:45,977 --> 00:04:46,662
I'm tired.

43
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:48,764
I won't do this anymore.

44
00:04:49,702 --> 00:04:50,697
I'm gonna sort

45
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:51,805
everything out.

46
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,577
And I'm not gonna let you

47
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,328
feel uncomfortable ever again.

48
00:04:57,795 --> 00:04:58,746
I hope that

49
00:04:59,306 --> 00:05:01,130
you won't think of me as

50
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:03,130
a terrible person.

51
00:05:03,564 --> 00:05:04,270
That's it.

52
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:06,400
Good night.

53
00:05:38,742 --> 00:05:39,897
You're all I've got

54
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:42,605
from now on.

55
00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:12,262
Is she coming out for breakfast?

56
00:06:30,982 --> 00:06:31,965
Good morning.

57
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:32,857
Morning.

58
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,680
I made breakfast.

59
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:36,400
Would you like some?

60
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:39,691
I'll just have coffee in the morning.

61
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,435
You made for two?

62
00:06:43,714 --> 00:06:44,594
Then I'll eat it.

63
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,560
OK.

64
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:00,857
It tastes good.

65
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:02,857
Thank you.

66
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:04,514
You are welcome.

67
00:07:10,822 --> 00:07:11,291
By the way,

68
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:13,630
I'll transfer living expenses

69
00:07:13,805 --> 00:07:14,880
to you on time.

70
00:07:15,462 --> 00:07:16,194
Living expenses?

71
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,800
Didn't you say that

72
00:07:18,902 --> 00:07:19,988
we should share

73
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:21,262
the cost of living?

74
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,805
I've thought about it.
I'm not good at

75
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:24,777
casting accounts.

76
00:07:25,302 --> 00:07:26,571
You're better at it.

77
00:07:29,554 --> 00:07:30,605
It's better for both of us

78
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,091
to divide the costs.

79
00:07:37,817 --> 00:07:39,085
I don't have a good appetite in the morning.

80
00:07:39,245 --> 00:07:39,760
I'm done.

81
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:40,817
I'll go to work now.

82
00:07:44,354 --> 00:07:45,040
Where are you going?

83
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:49,840
Well, I mean

84
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,550
it's not even time

85
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,434
for work, isn't it?

86
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,337
I have an early meeting. Bye.

87
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,124
Bye.

88
00:08:01,325 --> 00:08:02,045
Thank you?

89
00:08:03,257 --> 00:08:04,045
Bye?

90
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:08,948
It's a mess.

91
00:08:09,257 --> 00:08:10,068
I'll clean it up then.

92
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:34,536
Preparation and production lines

93
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,502
are all set up.

94
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,073
It's all going well as we planned.

95
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,942
And these are the candidates

96
00:08:40,068 --> 00:08:41,942
for the face of Infinity's first season.

97
00:08:42,205 --> 00:08:43,554
Once we have a decision on that,

98
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,324
it's gonna be announced at the release conference.

99
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,480
You can take a look.

100
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,395
See if there's anyone you like.

101
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:48,937
This is the first choice

102
00:08:48,982 --> 00:08:49,771
from the marketing dept.

103
00:08:50,994 --> 00:08:51,702
High-profile,

104
00:08:52,102 --> 00:08:53,382
and got good numbers in every way.

105
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,622
Just probably a little expensive.

106
00:08:56,342 --> 00:08:57,165
This man has got

107
00:08:57,897 --> 00:08:59,668
17 or 18 endorsements.

108
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:00,514
Seeing this face

109
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,988
reminds me of shampoo,

110
00:09:02,057 --> 00:09:03,268
skin cream, burgers, fried chicken,

111
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,080
and refrigerators.

112
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,795
Well, this one got fewer endorsements,

113
00:09:08,194 --> 00:09:10,022
but his last endorsement was

114
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,844
golden thermal underwear.

115
00:09:13,211 --> 00:09:14,308
It doesn't fit

116
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:15,314
the style of Infinity.

117
00:09:16,754 --> 00:09:17,314
Then,

118
00:09:17,577 --> 00:09:18,285
do you have

119
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,422
someone in mind?

120
00:09:24,902 --> 00:09:25,531
What's wrong?

121
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,146
Got an accident yesterday.

122
00:09:33,714 --> 00:09:34,822
Why didn't you go to the hospital?

123
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,697
It looks red.

124
00:09:36,148 --> 00:09:36,765
Don't worry.

125
00:09:37,245 --> 00:09:38,228
It's a minor injury.

126
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,506
Go to the hospital...

127
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,468
Doctor.

128
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,000
Doctor, CEO and me.

129
00:09:48,011 --> 00:09:48,685
It's nothing.

130
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,880
Just an idol drama.

131
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:51,928
The male lead's name is Bai Jing.

132
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:53,885
He just debuted.

133
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,768
Good film and television resources for the next two years.

134
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,288
And he got no endorsements currently.

135
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,497
You read the entertainment news?

136
00:10:04,777 --> 00:10:06,548
Gathering information to find

137
00:10:06,628 --> 00:10:08,388
the face of Infinity is important.

138
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:13,268
All right.

139
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:16,205
I'll talk to marketing dept

140
00:10:16,285 --> 00:10:17,200
to get in touch with him.

141
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,200
Actually, I think that

142
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:20,651
for these new stars in development,

143
00:10:20,731 --> 00:10:21,291
their prices

144
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,040
and their development directions

145
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:24,160
are basically the same.

146
00:10:24,251 --> 00:10:25,554
It's not enough to just look at the numbers.

147
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:27,108
We have to meet him in person.

148
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:29,253
So you want to go talk to him?

149
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,937
All right, see you later.

150
00:10:40,571 --> 00:10:42,971
Bai Jing is shooting nearby.

151
00:10:43,668 --> 00:10:44,800
Do you want to go to the scene

152
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:45,662
and meet him?

153
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:47,314
Okay.

154
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,080
Go to see how he works

155
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:51,230
might be more real.

156
00:10:51,474 --> 00:10:51,897
Let's go.

157
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,485
Hold on, I have to answer this.

158
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,194
Hello.

159
00:10:58,434 --> 00:10:58,754
Lu...

160
00:11:00,308 --> 00:11:01,120
Director Lu.

161
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:03,302
Let's meet after work.

162
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,537
Alright.

163
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:07,840
Then I'll see you later.

164
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,222
You got something else to do?

165
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:14,388
Nothing.

166
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,631
It's Cai Siyu.

167
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:21,794
We started to

168
00:11:22,617 --> 00:11:23,794
officially date yesterday.

169
00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:29,188
Simon.

170
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,594
Do you really like Siyu?

171
00:11:33,142 --> 00:11:33,977
Do you care?

172
00:11:38,182 --> 00:11:39,988
I know you two are close.

173
00:11:41,154 --> 00:11:41,497
I...

174
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:45,017
I just thought...

175
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,257
I just didn't expect that

176
00:11:49,302 --> 00:11:50,720
you guys are moving on so fast.

177
00:11:54,937 --> 00:11:56,617
What happened with Yujiang

178
00:11:56,662 --> 00:11:57,600
is finally over.

179
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:00,445
I'm starting my new relationship.

180
00:12:04,331 --> 00:12:04,925
Oh, I see.

181
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:07,611
That's awesome.

182
00:12:08,297 --> 00:12:08,742
Really.

183
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,155
Don't worry.

184
00:12:12,008 --> 00:12:13,653
I know what I should do.

185
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:16,834
I've grown up.

186
00:12:17,451 --> 00:12:18,697
I won't intervene with your

187
00:12:18,754 --> 00:12:19,965
relationship again like before.

188
00:12:20,628 --> 00:12:21,817
It's just that

189
00:12:22,228 --> 00:12:23,360
you're my uncle

190
00:12:23,771 --> 00:12:25,085
and Siyu is my friend.

191
00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:27,085
I want you both to be happy.

192
00:12:29,497 --> 00:12:29,942
All right.

193
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:31,348
I'm gonna go see Bai Jing.

194
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:33,885
Gao Erfan is not here. Let me drive you there.

195
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:35,475
I thought you were going to meet Siyu.

196
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:37,348
That's OK. I'll catch up. Let's go.

197
00:13:07,302 --> 00:13:07,725
Of course.

198
00:13:08,251 --> 00:13:09,074
It's better to really fight.

199
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,240
The more real, the better.

200
00:13:10,982 --> 00:13:11,782
It's all for the show.

201
00:13:11,908 --> 00:13:12,914
A little more over here.

202
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:14,434
Try your best.

203
00:13:16,151 --> 00:13:17,420
Director Lu.

204
00:13:18,994 --> 00:13:19,931
Director Lu looks

205
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,382
even more handsome today.

206
00:13:23,188 --> 00:13:24,480
This is Bai Jing's agent,

207
00:13:24,948 --> 00:13:25,405
Ziwen.

208
00:13:25,714 --> 00:13:26,594
-Hello.
-Hello.

209
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,645
And this is...

210
00:13:28,342 --> 00:13:29,074
This is

211
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,617
the general manager of Deer Sing Group,

212
00:13:30,937 --> 00:13:31,737
Ms. Lu Fangning.

213
00:13:32,017 --> 00:13:33,230
Hello, darling.

214
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:35,234
Nice earrings.

215
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:37,691
Oh my god, Gucci.

216
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:38,914
I love it.

217
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,474
Where's Bai Jing?

218
00:13:40,471 --> 00:13:41,066
Oh.

219
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,275
Bai Jing is there, practicing.

220
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:46,275
The one in white coat?

221
00:13:46,605 --> 00:13:47,382
Yes, yes.

222
00:13:47,511 --> 00:13:48,560
The director is instructing him.

223
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,102
It's his big scene later.

224
00:13:51,142 --> 00:13:52,068
Our Bai Jing is handsome, right?

225
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:54,605
Ziwen.

226
00:13:55,508 --> 00:13:57,062
That's a rough setting you've got here.

227
00:13:58,026 --> 00:13:59,170
Director Lu.

228
00:13:59,337 --> 00:14:01,005
You really know how to make a joke.

229
00:14:01,085 --> 00:14:02,514
All the crews are like this now.

230
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:03,668
A lot of dramas are

231
00:14:03,725 --> 00:14:05,005
shot on the streets.

232
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:06,880
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

233
00:14:06,948 --> 00:14:08,011
The script is what matters.

234
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,554
Yeah, exactly.

235
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,331
Is this the script?

236
00:14:10,582 --> 00:14:12,194
Yeah, that's our script.

237
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,942
Doctor, CEO and Me.

238
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:15,337
Bai Jing plays

239
00:14:15,405 --> 00:14:16,617
the doctor.

240
00:14:17,497 --> 00:14:19,005
So there's an ending now?

241
00:14:19,131 --> 00:14:20,308
Of course there's an ending.

242
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:21,634
TV shows have to get endings,

243
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:22,560
darling.

244
00:14:22,662 --> 00:14:23,428
You know.

245
00:14:23,954 --> 00:14:25,222
Don't pass out then.

246
00:14:25,325 --> 00:14:26,400
Slap him right back in the face.

247
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:27,542
Well, slap him like this.

248
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:27,866
Okay.

249
00:14:29,908 --> 00:14:31,234
Just slap him once.

250
00:14:32,765 --> 00:14:33,760
Please stay here for a while.

251
00:14:33,817 --> 00:14:34,605
I'm gonna go take a look.

252
00:14:39,737 --> 00:14:40,525
This one's in the scene.

253
00:14:40,617 --> 00:14:41,600
When did you become interested

254
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,571
in all these?

255
00:14:44,537 --> 00:14:46,148
This novel hasn't ended yet.

256
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:47,188
The guy in the black suit

257
00:14:47,222 --> 00:14:48,514
should be the big brother,

258
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:49,840
he got close to the bastard child,

259
00:14:49,954 --> 00:14:51,131
the doctor

260
00:14:51,211 --> 00:14:51,840
that Bai Jing is playing,

261
00:14:52,262 --> 00:14:53,302
to fight for his family's legacy.

262
00:14:53,485 --> 00:14:54,994
And now the novel is just talking about

263
00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:55,920
the younger brother means

264
00:14:55,954 --> 00:14:56,685
to accept the older brother.

265
00:15:01,771 --> 00:15:03,177
I really did some research

266
00:15:03,325 --> 00:15:04,251
about our endorser of the product.

267
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:06,285
Director, we're good to go.

268
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,337
Alright, everybody. Get ready to shoot.

269
00:15:08,685 --> 00:15:09,394
Quiet, please.

270
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:10,960
All staff get out of the scene.

271
00:15:11,337 --> 00:15:12,240
Alright. Get ready.

272
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:16,342
Why don't you take a seat in the back?

273
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:19,405
Three, two, one, action.

274
00:15:19,645 --> 00:15:20,651
Scene 94, Roll 70.

275
00:15:20,731 --> 00:15:21,382
Shot 2, Take 1.

276
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,577
Why don't you trust me?

277
00:15:24,114 --> 00:15:25,222
Why are you doing this to me?

278
00:15:27,862 --> 00:15:28,571
This is the confrontation

279
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,954
after the doctor knew the truth.

280
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:31,531
It's not even out on the internet yet.

281
00:15:33,268 --> 00:15:34,034
Everything you said to me

282
00:15:34,091 --> 00:15:34,708
was lie.

283
00:15:37,588 --> 00:15:38,445
How could you hit me?

284
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:41,828
Why?

285
00:15:42,053 --> 00:15:43,390
Why are they doing this?

286
00:15:43,462 --> 00:15:44,217
It shouldn't be.

287
00:15:44,537 --> 00:15:45,497
Younger brother,

288
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,697
the CEO was so nice to you.

289
00:15:46,754 --> 00:15:48,262
How could you misunderstand him?

290
00:15:48,331 --> 00:15:49,051
What are you doing?

291
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:09,782
Go.

292
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:21,440
Done.

293
00:16:22,091 --> 00:16:23,142
Get ready for the next one.

294
00:16:24,868 --> 00:16:25,588
Alright, this one is done.

295
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:27,291
There you go.

296
00:16:27,451 --> 00:16:28,960
What kind of drama is this?

297
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,840
What does that mean?

298
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,400
You don't even understand this.

299
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:36,571
Why are you still here?

300
00:16:39,382 --> 00:16:40,822
I'll leave when you're done talking with him.

301
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,280
You don't think I like

302
00:16:43,348 --> 00:16:44,331
that little idol, do you?

303
00:16:48,194 --> 00:16:49,405
I'll be honest with you.

304
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:50,948
I just love this novel.

305
00:16:51,222 --> 00:16:53,131
Doctor, CEO and Me.

306
00:16:53,828 --> 00:16:55,131
I need things like this

307
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:56,000
which are easy to understand

308
00:16:56,034 --> 00:16:57,634
in my serious life.

309
00:16:58,274 --> 00:16:58,788
Besides,

310
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:00,217
Cai Siyu recommended

311
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:00,925
this to me.

312
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:05,908
All right, you gotta go.

313
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:07,530
Or you're gonna be late for the date.

314
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:11,347
Don't be overprotective of me.

315
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:12,581
You're not young anymore.

316
00:17:12,651 --> 00:17:13,897
Finally see someone.

317
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,768
Take care of the people that you should care about.

318
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:16,308
Now go.

319
00:17:17,473 --> 00:17:18,307
Hurry up, go.

320
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:19,732
Off you go.

321
00:17:22,204 --> 00:17:22,924
Next scene.

322
00:17:23,428 --> 00:17:24,422
Are you done with this scene?

323
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,297
Bai Jing, come here for a minute.

324
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:27,771
It's not like

325
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:28,960
I would love

326
00:17:29,017 --> 00:17:29,874
anyone in white coat.

327
00:17:30,354 --> 00:17:31,188
Ms. Lu.

328
00:17:31,325 --> 00:17:32,308
This is Bai Jing.

329
00:17:32,514 --> 00:17:33,188
Handsome, right?

330
00:17:33,371 --> 00:17:34,011
Hello, Ms. Lu.

331
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:34,845
Hello.

332
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,314
Why wearing a ring?

333
00:17:40,217 --> 00:17:41,417
A doctor won't do like this.

334
00:17:42,788 --> 00:17:44,662
No offense.

335
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:46,422
It's just that I think surgeons

336
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,417
have a lot of surgeries,

337
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:49,154
so it's very inconvenient to wear a ring.

338
00:17:49,725 --> 00:17:51,200
And it's not a hospital here,

339
00:17:51,577 --> 00:17:52,868
why should you wear a white coat?

340
00:17:52,982 --> 00:17:53,920
Afraid that anyone could not tell

341
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,982
that you're a doctor?

342
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:57,051
It feels a little intentional.

343
00:17:59,051 --> 00:17:59,794
Excuse me.

344
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:01,751
I just saw your shooting.

345
00:18:02,228 --> 00:18:03,062
You two still look

346
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:03,900
good as a couple.

347
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:05,440
I mean, it was so good that

348
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,835
I almost cried.

349
00:18:07,131 --> 00:18:08,091
You bet, he's very good.

350
00:18:08,148 --> 00:18:09,028
Thanks for the suggestions, Ms. Lu.

351
00:18:09,942 --> 00:18:11,302
Ms. Lu seems to know surgeons

352
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:12,182
very well.

353
00:18:12,617 --> 00:18:14,102
Or you have a certain image

354
00:18:14,171 --> 00:18:14,960
of the character in that novel.

355
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:19,617
Do I?

356
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,508
I guess so.

357
00:18:21,828 --> 00:18:22,662
But for surgeons,

358
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,451
their hands are important.

359
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:23,982
How about this?

360
00:18:24,034 --> 00:18:25,108
Let me take a look at your hand.

361
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:28,160
Ms. Lu, well.

362
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:28,844
You haven't tried

363
00:18:28,862 --> 00:18:30,071
our coffee here, right?

364
00:18:30,285 --> 00:18:30,765
Let's go.

365
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,240
-I'll get you some coffee.
-Let's go.

366
00:18:34,834 --> 00:18:35,702
Actually,

367
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,222
as a fan of that book,

368
00:18:38,382 --> 00:18:39,230
I kind of didn't like it

369
00:18:39,271 --> 00:18:40,290
when I heard that

370
00:18:40,342 --> 00:18:40,662
you

371
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,137
were going to play this role.

372
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,262
But I was just watching you acting,

373
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,737
and I think it's great.

374
00:18:47,988 --> 00:18:49,108
Let me give you a tour of the set

375
00:18:49,451 --> 00:18:50,320
to see which angle

376
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,428
would be better for your live show.

377
00:18:53,085 --> 00:18:53,428
Alright.

378
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,640
The slap just now

379
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:56,090
was a real slap?

380
00:18:56,328 --> 00:18:56,970
Does it hurt?

381
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:57,777
It's a real slap.

382
00:18:58,195 --> 00:18:59,160
Well, not very painful.

383
00:18:59,531 --> 00:19:00,651
Oh, you...

384
00:19:01,622 --> 00:19:02,982
Lu Fangning?

385
00:19:03,191 --> 00:19:04,604
What is she doing with the idol?

386
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:06,628
Just cut a little bit.

387
00:19:07,102 --> 00:19:08,471
You've finally revealed yourself.

388
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:09,040
Ms. Tang.

389
00:19:09,188 --> 00:19:09,702
Shall we

390
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:10,622
go to see

391
00:19:10,675 --> 00:19:11,306
the next location?

392
00:19:11,342 --> 00:19:12,500
No, I want to watch this.

393
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,600
Ms. Tang.

394
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:18,251
The breach of the contract would cost you 100,000.

395
00:19:20,274 --> 00:19:20,834
Alright.

396
00:19:21,382 --> 00:19:21,942
No problem.

397
00:19:22,365 --> 00:19:23,131
However,

398
00:19:23,268 --> 00:19:24,697
why don't you go wait over there?

399
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:25,760
I'll be right there in a minute, okay?

400
00:19:26,195 --> 00:19:27,300
OK, sure.

401
00:19:30,773 --> 00:19:32,060
I think he's really good.

402
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,120
Besides,

403
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,328
I think he's a good working partner.

404
00:19:34,702 --> 00:19:35,560
He's so nice.

405
00:19:36,417 --> 00:19:37,180
And he is

406
00:19:37,235 --> 00:19:37,900
very humorous at the scene.

407
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,960
Always makes us laugh.

408
00:19:42,857 --> 00:19:44,628
So what are you gonna shoot next?

409
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:46,800
The next scene...

410
00:19:47,634 --> 00:19:49,188
I don't think it's OK for me to tell you.

411
00:19:50,308 --> 00:19:51,028
I'll send it to Ling Rui.

412
00:19:51,405 --> 00:19:52,742
Let him see what you are really like.

413
00:20:04,034 --> 00:20:05,062
Is she coming back for dinner?

414
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:06,817
Shall I buy some foods?

415
00:20:10,177 --> 00:20:11,591
What am I hesitating about?

416
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:23,325
I'm gonna sort

417
00:20:23,382 --> 00:20:24,228
everything out.

418
00:20:25,085 --> 00:20:26,171
And I'm not gonna let you

419
00:20:26,274 --> 00:20:27,600
feel uncomfortable.

420
00:20:27,885 --> 00:20:28,971
That's what she said about

421
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,388
sorting out everything

422
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:32,388
and not giving me any trouble?

423
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:39,908
She's so happy?

424
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,285
This is your script?

425
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,133
You're taking your job pretty seriously.

426
00:20:48,308 --> 00:20:48,925
However,

427
00:20:49,142 --> 00:20:50,011
the scene that you just did,

428
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:50,862
what does it mean?

429
00:20:52,925 --> 00:20:55,302
The doctor's trying to piss off his CEO brother,

430
00:20:55,394 --> 00:20:56,525
so he intentionally got close to

431
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,848
the woman that the CEO likes.

432
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,764
What does that mean? What the hell?

433
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,170
But the title of the show is

434
00:21:02,434 --> 00:21:04,525
Doctor, CEO and Me.

435
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,531
The doctor and the CEO

436
00:21:05,577 --> 00:21:07,142
are meant to be together.

437
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:09,440
What exactly have they

438
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:10,700
changed in the script?

439
00:21:11,348 --> 00:21:12,137
Why does it feel so different

440
00:21:12,142 --> 00:21:12,844
from the original novel?

441
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:14,648
You can't read that.

442
00:21:14,986 --> 00:21:15,928
-No.
-Let me have a look.

443
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,428
Ms. Lu, you really can't.

444
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,435
I'm Lu Fangning.

445
00:21:18,551 --> 00:21:19,431
I won't tell anyone.

446
00:21:19,475 --> 00:21:20,490
No one can look at that.

447
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:22,000
Lu Fangning.

448
00:21:22,171 --> 00:21:23,062
Just a glance, okay?

449
00:21:23,131 --> 00:21:23,965
I'm just gonna have a glance.

450
00:21:24,337 --> 00:21:25,040
-Just a glance.
-No.

451
00:21:25,062 --> 00:21:25,817
Lu Fangning.

452
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,994
What are you doing here?

453
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,213
What are you doing here?

454
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,388
I'm here to buy groceries.

455
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:48,720
Here?

456
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:51,245
The vegetables here are fresher.

457
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:55,908
This is...

458
00:21:56,346 --> 00:21:57,253
He's just passing by.

459
00:21:57,306 --> 00:21:58,053
You don't have to worry.

460
00:21:58,115 --> 00:21:59,208
He'll be gone in a minute.

461
00:21:59,422 --> 00:21:59,946
You can leave now.

462
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,346
I still have something important to discuss with him.

463
00:22:02,605 --> 00:22:03,611
Now that I'm here,

464
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:05,360
I'll just wait for you to go home together.

465
00:22:05,431 --> 00:22:06,000
Why?

466
00:22:07,946 --> 00:22:09,333
Did you know how much fuel

467
00:22:09,955 --> 00:22:10,900
you can save by

468
00:22:11,066 --> 00:22:12,328
driving one car instead of two?

469
00:22:13,057 --> 00:22:14,990
And how big the difference that energy conservation

470
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,026
could make to the environment.

471
00:22:16,891 --> 00:22:17,931
It's time for each and every one of us

472
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:18,605
to get involved

473
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:21,074
into this action

474
00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:22,925
to curb global warming,

475
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,102
and to contribute to humanity.

476
00:22:26,506 --> 00:22:27,390
This gentleman here

477
00:22:27,617 --> 00:22:29,022
seems very environmentally conscious.

478
00:22:32,857 --> 00:22:33,611
Please continue.

479
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,360
I won't disturb you.

480
00:22:36,308 --> 00:22:37,040
How are we supposed to talk

481
00:22:37,066 --> 00:22:38,280
with you sitting here?

482
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,035
What do you want to talk about that I can't listen to?

483
00:22:42,091 --> 00:22:43,965
No, no. No such things.

484
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,871
Why is he here?

485
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,168
Watch me?

486
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,520
Control me?

487
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,360
At least you can't talk about

488
00:22:53,386 --> 00:22:55,150
something inappropriate.

489
00:23:03,222 --> 00:23:03,817
If you really

490
00:23:03,885 --> 00:23:04,845
have nothing to do,

491
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:05,860
you can go to the hospital.

492
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:07,280
The patients need your help.

493
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,773
There're doctors on call.

494
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,933
You're a doctor?

495
00:23:11,965 --> 00:23:12,960
I played a doctor.

496
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:14,675
I'm playing a surgeon.

497
00:23:15,497 --> 00:23:16,594
Only the white coat makes

498
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:17,290
you like a surgeon.

499
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:21,771
If I could just act like you,

500
00:23:21,813 --> 00:23:22,400
that would be nice.

501
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,213
That's impossible.

502
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:25,777
By the way,

503
00:23:27,377 --> 00:23:28,200
there are some

504
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:29,310
technical terms here

505
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,004
that I haven't figured out. Please take a look.

506
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,528
It's just saying that...

507
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:36,391
Hello, sir.

508
00:23:36,435 --> 00:23:37,740
I'm the casting director for the show.

509
00:23:37,768 --> 00:23:38,840
Would you be interested in acting

510
00:23:38,862 --> 00:23:39,530
or being a guest star

511
00:23:39,588 --> 00:23:40,217
in our drama?

512
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:40,948
I can give you

513
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,662
the maximum wage.

514
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,980
Please tell me about

515
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:44,995
what this means first.

516
00:23:45,668 --> 00:23:46,982
You guys, that's enough.

517
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,604
This is my husband,

518
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,520
not an actor.

519
00:23:55,691 --> 00:23:56,891
What are you laughing at?

520
00:23:57,555 --> 00:23:59,360
No, I can't be like this.

521
00:23:59,502 --> 00:24:01,150
I need to maintain my cold image.

522
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,150
Calm down and ignore him.

523
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,062
Bai Jing.

524
00:24:14,034 --> 00:24:14,834
Didn't you say

525
00:24:14,925 --> 00:24:16,331
you wanted to play the doctor well?

526
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:20,045
Would you like to come to my house?

527
00:24:20,434 --> 00:24:21,097
What?

528
00:24:32,034 --> 00:24:32,674
Bai Jing.

529
00:24:32,788 --> 00:24:33,782
This is a house

530
00:24:33,851 --> 00:24:34,880
of a surgeon.

531
00:24:35,062 --> 00:24:35,977
Take a look around.

532
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,413
Make yourself at home.

533
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:38,551
Slippers are on the floor.

534
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:40,285
Come here.

535
00:24:41,108 --> 00:24:42,514
Bai Jing, take a look around.

536
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:44,251
What's up?

537
00:24:45,097 --> 00:24:46,160
Why did you bring him home?

538
00:24:46,525 --> 00:24:47,908
Why can't I bring him home?

539
00:24:48,088 --> 00:24:49,860
Just help him play a doctor.

540
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,040
What's wrong with helping people?

541
00:24:51,862 --> 00:24:52,845
Does playing a doctor

542
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,124
have anything to do with you?

543
00:24:55,146 --> 00:24:56,540
Because he might be...

544
00:24:56,674 --> 00:24:58,388
No, he would definitely be

545
00:24:58,457 --> 00:24:59,634
the face of

546
00:24:59,702 --> 00:25:00,365
Infinity.

547
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,120
Him?

548
00:25:03,404 --> 00:25:04,130
Face of your brand?

549
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,137
Alright.

550
00:25:07,191 --> 00:25:08,560
Even if that's true,

551
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,524
you can see him in office,

552
00:25:10,708 --> 00:25:12,342
or in the ads.

553
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,275
Why do you have to bring him home?

554
00:25:16,045 --> 00:25:19,040
Because he's young and handsome.

555
00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:20,651
Don't you think our house

556
00:25:20,711 --> 00:25:21,410
looks much better

557
00:25:21,466 --> 00:25:22,410
with him here?

558
00:25:22,826 --> 00:25:25,450
This house looks glorious because of him.

559
00:25:26,331 --> 00:25:27,120
Excuse me...

560
00:25:27,422 --> 00:25:28,257
-Don't speak.
-Shut up.

561
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,875
I'm sorry.

562
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:34,788
Kid.

563
00:25:35,222 --> 00:25:36,571
What do you want to eat? I'll cook.

564
00:25:37,413 --> 00:25:38,897
No, no, don't bother.

565
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:39,680
Let him do it.

566
00:25:39,725 --> 00:25:41,097
He loves to cook.

567
00:25:41,817 --> 00:25:42,525
Go ahead.

568
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:48,948
Let me guess what you would cook.

569
00:25:49,577 --> 00:25:50,742
Greens again, right?

570
00:25:50,822 --> 00:25:52,240
Well, that's all you can cook.

571
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,240
Why didn't you buy more meat?

572
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,445
Don't make me and Bai Jing just eat greens.

573
00:26:03,154 --> 00:26:03,771
Ms. Lu.

574
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:04,844
Would it be inconvenient

575
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:05,908
for me to be here?

576
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,471
Of course not.

577
00:26:17,817 --> 00:26:18,754
What's wrong with me?

578
00:26:19,897 --> 00:26:21,428
She just brought a business partner home.

579
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,680
What's the big deal?

580
00:26:26,525 --> 00:26:26,902
Yeah.

581
00:26:27,771 --> 00:26:28,948
Just a business partner.

582
00:26:33,028 --> 00:26:33,748
Young?

583
00:26:34,777 --> 00:26:35,531
Handsome?

584
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:37,645
Shiny?

585
00:26:41,502 --> 00:26:42,497
Is what I'm wearing today

586
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:43,710
a little too dark?

587
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,866
So that I look more mature?

588
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:49,245
How about I change into white?

589
00:27:05,782 --> 00:27:06,354
White

590
00:27:07,451 --> 00:27:08,891
is my color.

591
00:27:12,662 --> 00:27:14,685
So, is your shooting hard?

592
00:27:15,405 --> 00:27:15,942
No.

593
00:27:16,274 --> 00:27:17,657
Not as hard as Dr. Ling, I assume.

594
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:18,822
By the way,

595
00:27:19,234 --> 00:27:20,251
does he read

596
00:27:20,445 --> 00:27:21,440
all the books in your house?

597
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:23,324
He likes to read all the time.

598
00:27:26,331 --> 00:27:27,097
Oh,

599
00:27:28,091 --> 00:27:29,794
it's a nice day today.

600
00:27:31,314 --> 00:27:32,000
By the way,

601
00:27:32,491 --> 00:27:33,668
can you tell me

602
00:27:33,771 --> 00:27:34,960
what the ending is like?

603
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,570
I promise I won't tell anyone.

604
00:27:36,594 --> 00:27:37,040
I swear.

605
00:27:37,771 --> 00:27:38,617
I really can't.

606
00:27:38,755 --> 00:27:40,020
A lot of people have asked me about this.

607
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,902
This flower hasn't been

608
00:27:40,937 --> 00:27:41,405
watered recently.

609
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,275
Please tell me.

610
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,324
It's almost dead.

611
00:27:43,474 --> 00:27:44,502
I'm Lu Fangning, after all.

612
00:27:44,533 --> 00:27:45,500
Who am I gonna tell?

613
00:27:45,555 --> 00:27:46,330
Just a little bit.

614
00:27:46,411 --> 00:27:47,988
Ms. Lu, I really can't.

615
00:27:48,097 --> 00:27:49,240
We signed an NDA.

616
00:27:49,508 --> 00:27:50,422
I really can't talk about it.

617
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:51,980
What was his reaction just now?

618
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:52,800
Jealous?

619
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,714
No, no, no.

620
00:27:53,954 --> 00:27:55,005
How could he be jealous?

621
00:27:55,828 --> 00:27:56,788
Then...

622
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,028
If you can't

623
00:27:59,074 --> 00:27:59,897
tell me about it in details,

624
00:28:00,457 --> 00:28:01,462
then why don't you tell me that

625
00:28:02,124 --> 00:28:03,244
in the end,

626
00:28:03,342 --> 00:28:04,500
who are you with?

627
00:28:05,795 --> 00:28:07,235
This table is dirty.

628
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,453
You can certainly tell me that, right?

629
00:28:08,497 --> 00:28:08,990
Let me wipe it.

630
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:10,754
Ms. Lu, you don't know.

631
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,160
No script writer dares to

632
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:12,968
write a bad ending.

633
00:28:13,528 --> 00:28:14,620
Even if the show doesn't make sense,

634
00:28:14,731 --> 00:28:16,331
they have to give it a happy ending.

635
00:28:17,154 --> 00:28:17,668
Oh.

636
00:28:18,462 --> 00:28:19,493
Something fell on the floor.

637
00:28:19,644 --> 00:28:20,960
It's broken. What should I do?

638
00:28:22,594 --> 00:28:23,257
Boring.

639
00:28:28,742 --> 00:28:29,817
I am going to do the cooking.

640
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,342
Go ahead.

641
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,022
Let's go sit inside.

642
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,028
Give me two bottles of water.

643
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:35,737
There's no water.

644
00:28:37,066 --> 00:28:38,320
It's right over there.

645
00:28:41,222 --> 00:28:41,885
Out of date.

646
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:42,662
Childish.

647
00:28:44,994 --> 00:28:45,600
Just ignore him.

648
00:28:46,053 --> 00:28:46,551
Have some water, please.

649
00:28:46,731 --> 00:28:47,314
Thank you.

650
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,308
Ms. Lu.

651
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,588
Maybe I shall leave.

652
00:28:51,634 --> 00:28:52,011
No, sit here.

653
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,194
Dr. Ling is still wearing

654
00:29:04,251 --> 00:29:05,028
white at home.

655
00:29:05,782 --> 00:29:07,005
He looks sparkling.

656
00:29:08,502 --> 00:29:10,217
It's hard to imitate that.

657
00:29:10,822 --> 00:29:11,611
Of course it is.

658
00:29:13,188 --> 00:29:13,942
You have an advantage.

659
00:29:15,188 --> 00:29:15,942
What?

660
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:17,942
You got good taste.

661
00:29:23,337 --> 00:29:24,011
By the way, Bai Jing,

662
00:29:24,217 --> 00:29:25,165
how tall are you?

663
00:29:25,725 --> 00:29:26,971
I'm 180.

664
00:29:27,988 --> 00:29:28,891
180 cm?

665
00:29:29,405 --> 00:29:31,600
I love boys who are 180 cm tall.

666
00:29:31,668 --> 00:29:33,085
I think it's the perfect height.

667
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:34,400
A little more higher

668
00:29:34,491 --> 00:29:36,217
would make someone look a little clumsy.

669
00:29:37,177 --> 00:29:38,217
You like 180,

670
00:29:39,108 --> 00:29:40,217
and don't like 186?

671
00:29:40,868 --> 00:29:41,897
Uncle is even three centimeters

672
00:29:41,965 --> 00:29:42,788
taller than me.

673
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,780
Why don't you call him clumsy?

674
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:48,434
I just recalled that

675
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:49,840
I remember

676
00:29:50,057 --> 00:29:51,337
I had a chip once

677
00:29:51,405 --> 00:29:52,160
which is very good,

678
00:29:52,594 --> 00:29:53,485
it was endorsed by you.

679
00:29:53,531 --> 00:29:54,114
What is it called?

680
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:56,640
If you like it,

681
00:29:56,675 --> 00:29:57,460
I'll ask my broker to

682
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:58,365
send you a box of it.

683
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,173
No need.

684
00:29:59,244 --> 00:30:00,906
I'll buy two boxes.

685
00:30:01,031 --> 00:30:02,533
I'll buy ten boxes, to support you.

686
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,470
No, that's not necessary.

687
00:30:05,257 --> 00:30:07,680
So young, handsome

688
00:30:07,737 --> 00:30:08,902
and knows how to money.

689
00:30:09,085 --> 00:30:10,000
You're really good.

690
00:30:11,382 --> 00:30:12,605
I save lives.

691
00:30:13,155 --> 00:30:14,453
My spirit is nobler.

692
00:30:17,794 --> 00:30:19,062
I'm in a good mood today.

693
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,240
After the meal,

694
00:30:20,275 --> 00:30:21,200
have a drink with me.

695
00:30:22,382 --> 00:30:23,060
Drink wine?

696
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,091
Do you drink?

697
00:30:24,765 --> 00:30:25,531
You don't know,

698
00:30:25,634 --> 00:30:26,742
there's someone in this house

699
00:30:26,822 --> 00:30:28,182
who really can't drink.

700
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,062
If he takes just a little sip,

701
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,788
he would pass out in no time.

702
00:30:33,702 --> 00:30:34,205
That's so weak.

703
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,751
Who says I can't drink?

704
00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:39,474
I am just trying to

705
00:30:39,691 --> 00:30:40,857
keep a regular schedule.

706
00:30:42,285 --> 00:30:43,554
I just go to bed early.

707
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,091
How about video games?

708
00:30:46,651 --> 00:30:48,091
I'm actually really into video games.

709
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:48,891
But as you can see,

710
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,942
there are so many books in this house.

711
00:30:50,022 --> 00:30:50,742
Someone just

712
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,422
reads books all the time.

713
00:30:52,948 --> 00:30:53,840
And when he drinks,

714
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:54,925
he would recite

715
00:30:54,994 --> 00:30:55,965
the terms of medical books.

716
00:30:56,045 --> 00:30:57,622
I don't even know what that means.
It's so boring.

717
00:31:00,594 --> 00:31:01,954
And someone just

718
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,411
likes reading about parenting

719
00:31:04,742 --> 00:31:05,885
secretly.

720
00:31:06,171 --> 00:31:07,348
Well, why don't you give me

721
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:08,297
a baby to practice?

722
00:31:08,788 --> 00:31:09,805
Coward.

723
00:31:11,074 --> 00:31:12,285
You're different, Bai Jing.

724
00:31:12,525 --> 00:31:13,371
You look like

725
00:31:13,428 --> 00:31:14,365
a real man.

726
00:31:14,525 --> 00:31:16,125
You look very brave.

727
00:31:16,411 --> 00:31:17,028
A real man.

728
00:31:17,725 --> 00:31:18,902
Are you saying I'm not a man?

729
00:31:19,028 --> 00:31:19,931
Come here, Bai Jing.

730
00:31:20,034 --> 00:31:20,331
Let's compare.

731
00:31:20,525 --> 00:31:21,725
Let's see who is the real man.

732
00:31:21,805 --> 00:31:22,182
What are you doing?

733
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:22,617
-Let go.
-Come on.

734
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:23,142
Let go.

735
00:31:23,268 --> 00:31:24,514
Don't bully the kid.

736
00:31:24,914 --> 00:31:25,337
I...

737
00:31:25,965 --> 00:31:26,662
I bully him?

738
00:31:27,451 --> 00:31:28,560
You're bullying me.

739
00:31:28,765 --> 00:31:29,851
You're not a kid.

740
00:31:30,011 --> 00:31:30,937
Put the knife down.

741
00:31:33,828 --> 00:31:34,537
I won't.

742
00:31:37,062 --> 00:31:37,828
See?

743
00:31:37,954 --> 00:31:38,834
That's human nature.

744
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,240
No matter how professional a surgeon is,

745
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:41,542
he would also get out of control.

746
00:31:41,645 --> 00:31:42,342
I mean, look at

747
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,417
how annoyed he is right now.

748
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:45,062
I am not out of control?

749
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:45,634
Did you see?

750
00:31:45,748 --> 00:31:46,834
Use it in the show.

751
00:31:49,462 --> 00:31:50,765
Out of control, me?

752
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,564
I'm not out of control.

753
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,773
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

754
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,942
You're not out of control?

755
00:31:56,182 --> 00:31:57,120
I'm not out of control.

756
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,251
You're blushing.

757
00:31:58,411 --> 00:31:59,085
I'm not blushing.

758
00:31:59,188 --> 00:31:59,942
You're annoyed.

759
00:32:00,057 --> 00:32:00,994
And you're blushing.

760
00:32:01,291 --> 00:32:02,342
Your neck even became shorter.

761
00:32:02,468 --> 00:32:03,840
How the hell could my neck...

762
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,862
I got a swan neck.

763
00:32:04,888 --> 00:32:06,190
You look like a little frog to me.

764
00:32:06,354 --> 00:32:07,211
Quack, quack.

765
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,571
You're like a donkey.

766
00:32:08,697 --> 00:32:09,622
Bla bla bla.

767
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,457
Then why did you marry

768
00:32:10,525 --> 00:32:11,165
a donkey?

769
00:32:11,268 --> 00:32:12,548
You're married to a little frog.

770
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,097
Come and get me, brother.

771
00:32:15,611 --> 00:32:16,171
What's up?

772
00:32:16,285 --> 00:32:17,142
I've got work to do here.

773
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:17,908
No.

774
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,634
I need you to come get me.

775
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,051
Just think of it as a way

776
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,582
to gain more life experience.

777
00:32:23,245 --> 00:32:24,342
You can't offend your sponsor.

778
00:32:24,422 --> 00:32:25,931
-Come on. I...
-I gotta hang up.

779
00:32:26,034 --> 00:32:26,651
Bye-bye.

780
00:32:30,057 --> 00:32:31,565
Don't know who

781
00:32:32,137 --> 00:32:33,085
just tried to

782
00:32:33,142 --> 00:32:34,274
get under my covers.

783
00:32:34,342 --> 00:32:34,502
I...

784
00:32:34,617 --> 00:32:36,182
I was delirious.

785
00:32:36,342 --> 00:32:37,302
So you're sane now?

786
00:32:38,731 --> 00:32:39,211
A kid.

787
00:32:39,325 --> 00:32:40,297
I'm just a kid.

788
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,451
I'm gonna go home now.

789
00:32:41,497 --> 00:32:41,885
Stop.

790
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,131
Get out of my way.

791
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,955
We haven't had the meal yet.

792
00:32:50,097 --> 00:32:50,835
Where are you going?

793
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:51,874
Thank you both.

794
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:53,155
I learned a valuable lesson.

795
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:53,760
Lesson?

796
00:32:53,851 --> 00:32:54,525
What lesson?

797
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,262
What have you learned?

798
00:32:55,931 --> 00:32:57,428
Love makes people crazy.

799
00:32:58,022 --> 00:32:58,548
Bye.

800
00:33:00,582 --> 00:33:01,142
You're leaving?

801
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,754
I gotta go now.

802
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:03,555
You don't stay for meal?

803
00:33:03,862 --> 00:33:04,171
No!

804
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:04,845
Alright.

805
00:33:05,508 --> 00:33:06,457
See you later.

806
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,920
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

807
00:33:09,771 --> 00:33:10,742
Jealous(Pronounce like vinegar in Chinese)?

808
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,485
Why would I be jealous?

809
00:33:14,045 --> 00:33:14,800
If you want to taste that,

810
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:16,285
I can make you sour and sweet ribs,

811
00:33:16,388 --> 00:33:17,577
sour fish, and sour cabbage.

812
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,731
Which one do you want?

813
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,737
I don't know how to make either of them.

814
00:33:20,491 --> 00:33:22,068
All I can do is poach green vegetables.

815
00:33:22,274 --> 00:33:22,765
Take your time.

816
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:23,920
Have some more.

817
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:24,982
Get your knife.

818
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,325
No.

819
00:33:35,657 --> 00:33:36,560
I'm just going to cook.

820
00:33:36,685 --> 00:33:38,560
I didn't hear that.

821
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:40,057
By the way,

822
00:33:40,205 --> 00:33:41,268
donkeys don't bark like that.

823
00:33:41,893 --> 00:33:42,604
Exactly.

824
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,471
That's more like it.

825
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:46,525
Immature.

826
00:33:51,128 --> 00:33:51,911
That really pissed me off.

827
00:34:38,674 --> 00:34:40,308
A loving girlfriend like me

828
00:34:40,697 --> 00:34:42,308
is the rarest thing in the world.

829
00:34:46,754 --> 00:34:48,605
What's taking him so long?

830
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:54,937
Did he run into the bad guys again?

831
00:35:06,628 --> 00:35:07,108
Siyu.

832
00:35:12,537 --> 00:35:13,062
Sorry.

833
00:35:13,268 --> 00:35:14,662
I'm getting a little too excited.

834
00:35:16,445 --> 00:35:17,440
How's your wound?

835
00:35:17,508 --> 00:35:18,274
Are you alright?

836
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:19,333
I'm fine.

837
00:35:21,862 --> 00:35:22,937
Sorry that I'm late.

838
00:35:23,474 --> 00:35:24,514
It's all right.

839
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,760
I'm just glad you're safe.

840
00:35:27,268 --> 00:35:27,760
Here.

841
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,108
This is for you.

842
00:35:30,137 --> 00:35:30,662
For me?

843
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,291
I specifically looked into it.

844
00:35:33,474 --> 00:35:34,697
This is Eustoma grandiflorum.

845
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,697
It represents "true and unchanging love."

846
00:35:36,857 --> 00:35:38,537
It's a perfect souvenir for

847
00:35:38,948 --> 00:35:40,720
our first official date.

848
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,171
Siyu.

849
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,548
You called me Siyu.

850
00:35:59,097 --> 00:36:00,731
Give me your hand.

851
00:36:02,982 --> 00:36:03,817
Your hand.

852
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:09,760
Let's go.

853
00:36:09,965 --> 00:36:10,628
I'll take you to eat

854
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:11,691
my favorite food.

855
00:36:41,337 --> 00:36:42,342
This tastes so good.

856
00:36:42,914 --> 00:36:43,874
Would you like to try?

857
00:37:24,697 --> 00:37:25,314
Let me.

858
00:37:39,028 --> 00:37:41,085
It is called

859
00:37:41,771 --> 00:37:43,131
"Let's date".

860
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,274
I feel like I'm dreaming right now.

861
00:37:49,554 --> 00:37:50,571
Someone who was

862
00:37:50,628 --> 00:37:51,794
so far away from me

863
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:53,440
is actually sitting across from me

864
00:37:53,508 --> 00:37:54,720
and eating with me right now.

865
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:00,022
Are you thinking

866
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:01,291
too badly of yourself?

867
00:38:04,045 --> 00:38:05,805
Director Lu, you have such a good taste

868
00:38:06,011 --> 00:38:07,200
and such high standards,

869
00:38:07,405 --> 00:38:09,200
I can't degrade you.

870
00:38:10,182 --> 00:38:10,914
You won't.

871
00:38:12,764 --> 00:38:13,564
Don't think like that.

872
00:38:14,377 --> 00:38:16,445
You're actually very cute.

873
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,005
Well, I'm just cute.

874
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:25,005
I know that

875
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:27,280
you invited me to dinner out of the blue

876
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:28,457
and accepted my confession,

877
00:38:28,711 --> 00:38:30,250
that's something very incredible,

878
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,645
and there must be a reason.

879
00:38:32,342 --> 00:38:33,097
Besides,

880
00:38:33,977 --> 00:38:34,822
I don't think

881
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,102
it's because of the reason I imagined.

882
00:38:38,834 --> 00:38:40,102
Even though I love reading novels,

883
00:38:40,194 --> 00:38:41,051
and daydreaming,

884
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,034
I'm not stupid.

885
00:38:42,994 --> 00:38:43,805
But that's okay.

886
00:38:44,377 --> 00:38:45,382
I could have a moment

887
00:38:45,565 --> 00:38:47,074
when dreams come true,

888
00:38:47,142 --> 00:38:48,194
I'm already happy.

889
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,085
And

890
00:38:49,542 --> 00:38:50,251
I'm going to

891
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:52,114
try to make you

892
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,142
like me a little more

893
00:38:53,245 --> 00:38:54,411
and love me a little more everyday.

894
00:38:54,754 --> 00:38:56,022
Even if I failed eventually,

895
00:38:56,217 --> 00:38:57,314
I have been the main character

896
00:38:57,342 --> 00:38:58,350
for a short time.

897
00:38:59,626 --> 00:39:01,070
Because for me, Cai Siyu,

898
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,991
you're the male lead in my story.

899
00:40:00,868 --> 00:40:02,502
Take a peek at my "husband" before work.

900
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:05,108
Look at this picture of him,

901
00:40:05,165 --> 00:40:06,057
and his suit.

902
00:40:07,314 --> 00:40:09,211
That's my brother Bai Jing.

903
00:40:10,022 --> 00:40:10,948
Who does he look like?

904
00:40:11,577 --> 00:40:12,788
Does he look like the foreign actor...

905
00:40:14,697 --> 00:40:15,337
Dr. Ling.

906
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:16,240
What are you doing here?

907
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,668
It's not even work hour yet.

908
00:40:19,005 --> 00:40:20,205
You're one of our brother's

909
00:40:20,262 --> 00:40:20,834
fans?

910
00:40:21,005 --> 00:40:21,485
How is this?

911
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,765
Are you amazed at how handsome he is?

912
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:24,826
What's so handsome about him?

913
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,053
What?

914
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,760
He is totally handsome, OK?

915
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,040
I think you're just jealous.

916
00:40:29,348 --> 00:40:30,034
Our brother

917
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,111
has thousands of fans.

918
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:31,874
If a guy like him

919
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,020
could be my husband,

920
00:40:33,257 --> 00:40:34,674
I can do anything.

921
00:40:35,093 --> 00:40:36,088
No, you can't.

922
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:40,194
This guy looks like

923
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,684
someone who can't make a hit.

924
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:46,571
What did he just say?

925
00:40:47,588 --> 00:40:48,274
Can't make a hit?

926
00:40:48,764 --> 00:40:50,270
What did he mean?

927
00:40:50,411 --> 00:40:51,120
I've go to

928
00:40:51,188 --> 00:40:51,737
reason with him.

929
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:52,434
What does he mean?

930
00:40:52,595 --> 00:40:53,930
Our brother's already famous,

931
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:54,302
okay?!

932
00:40:54,328 --> 00:40:55,777
Alright, relax.

933
00:41:03,062 --> 00:41:03,702
Do you want vinegar(Means jealous in Chinese)?

934
00:41:08,011 --> 00:41:08,742
Vinegar?

935
00:41:09,165 --> 00:41:10,102
I'm not jealous.

936
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,234
I'm asking if you want

937
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,228
some vinegar in the noodles.

938
00:41:18,228 --> 00:41:18,582
No.

939
00:41:18,994 --> 00:41:19,394
Thanks.

940
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:22,320
What report are you reading?

941
00:41:22,502 --> 00:41:23,440
You didn't even get what I was asking.

942
00:41:37,702 --> 00:41:38,274
Is he handsome?
