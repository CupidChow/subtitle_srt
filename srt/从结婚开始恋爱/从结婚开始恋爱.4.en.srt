1
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,225
That's amazing 

2
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:14,825
Don't be lazy, practice dancing 

3
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,675
Yu, if it is not for you, 

4
00:02:17,675 --> 00:02:18,450
I can't 

5
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,675
even do this, 

6
00:02:19,675 --> 00:02:20,525
learn these 

7
00:02:20,525 --> 00:02:21,925
And it is at this critical moment, 

8
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:23,225
you borrowed me 4 million yuan. 

9
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,225
I will learn to dance with every effort 

10
00:02:26,475 --> 00:02:28,100
If it is not you who 

11
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,350
took your repeatedly trial and fail, 

12
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,650
and repeatedly fail and trial as an example 

13
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,725
to inspire me, 

14
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:34,100
I would 

15
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,025
have gave up already 

16
00:02:35,025 --> 00:02:35,825
the dream of dancing, 

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,175
Only 4 million yuan. It's worth it 

18
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,425
We two families 

19
00:02:41,425 --> 00:02:42,600
are going to meet 

20
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:43,975
What if in the future. Wait a second, 

21
00:02:44,475 --> 00:02:45,175
Meet? 

22
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,900
If my father knows, 

23
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,825
we met each other here, 

24
00:02:48,425 --> 00:02:50,175
he will absolutely break my legs 

25
00:02:50,175 --> 00:02:51,400
We, do not make ourselves 

26
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,375
scary for now 

27
00:02:52,525 --> 00:02:53,575
By then, 

28
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,300
I don't know who you are 

29
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:57,125
I will be the one, 

30
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,850
a beautiful lady who got divorced 

31
00:03:00,325 --> 00:03:00,950
Then 

32
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,450
Then I don't know you either, 

33
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:03,850
I will be the one, 

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,525
the black swan with broken wings 

35
00:03:06,375 --> 00:03:07,375
This is good 

36
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,675
Leg, continue 

37
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,050
tiptoe, 

38
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:14,800
knees, 

39
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,450
downwards of shoulder blades 

40
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,100
Today, it is presumptuous of me 

41
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:53,600
to invite Mrs. Ling and your family 

42
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,375
to come to our home 

43
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,175
I know this invitation might be 

44
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,300
not appropriate for our 

45
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,775
traditional Chinese etiquette 

46
00:04:00,025 --> 00:04:01,125
The event of marriage, 

47
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:02,600
not child's play 

48
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:04,575
But the two young men, 

49
00:04:04,775 --> 00:04:05,975
they are really busy 

50
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,675
I think good things should not suffer much, 

51
00:04:08,775 --> 00:04:09,775
so, 

52
00:04:09,975 --> 00:04:11,425
if anything I am not being thoughtful, 

53
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,600
please excuse me. 

54
00:04:16,475 --> 00:04:17,625
Yes, 

55
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,925
it is truly of a bit hurry, 

56
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,375
But I think 

57
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,399
but as long as they can 

58
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,725
live together 

59
00:04:22,925 --> 00:04:24,275
happy and satisfied, 

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,200
we 

61
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,550
will be relieved 

62
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:29,575
Mrs. Ling, thank you for saying so, 

63
00:04:29,575 --> 00:04:30,925
I am also relieved 

64
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,375
I have 

65
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,300
heard from Fangning 

66
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,800
about Mr. Ling's status 

67
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,750
in a brief way 

68
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,500
So today, 

69
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,200
in such an occasion, 

70
00:04:40,425 --> 00:04:41,950
I would like to hear from Ling himself 

71
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,050
personally 

72
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:45,625
and officially introduce himself 

73
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,625
to me and Auntie Yang 

74
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,300
Tell us something about yourself 

75
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,925
Mr. Lu, I am... Dad! 

76
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,525
Dad, I don't think this is necessary, 

77
00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:55,825
I have already 

78
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,125
told you several times, 

79
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,575
age, job and native place 

80
00:04:58,575 --> 00:04:59,625
And all his family 

81
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:00,475
is sitting here, isn't it? 

82
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,025
What else do you want to know? 

83
00:05:04,075 --> 00:05:05,050
Mr. Lu, 

84
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,225
actually  

85
00:05:06,225 --> 00:05:07,425
I have been a major in medicine 

86
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,725
I am now in the city public hospital, 

87
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,075
as an surgeon 

88
00:05:10,525 --> 00:05:11,850
Maybe you don't know much about me, 

89
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,950
so 

90
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,400
you worry about that, 

91
00:05:14,675 --> 00:05:15,175
however, 

92
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:16,600
I will assure you and Mrs. Lu, 

93
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,175
and you can be relieved that 

94
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,400
in our marriage 

95
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:22,975
I will do whatever I can 

96
00:05:23,275 --> 00:05:24,275
to be good to her 

97
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,450
Good, good, good, OK, 

98
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:28,050
OK 

99
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,475
Now Ling Rui 

100
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,575
is an associate chief physician 

101
00:05:31,925 --> 00:05:33,025
After so many years, 

102
00:05:33,025 --> 00:05:34,775
we have actively been working hard to 

103
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:37,250
pursue advanced studies in Germany 

104
00:05:37,425 --> 00:05:38,375
In the future, 

105
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,150
when he come back from Germany, 

106
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,050
I think 

107
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,825
he will be really awesome 

108
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:46,175
By the way 

109
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,375
If in the future, you 

110
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,850
do not feel well, 

111
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,600
you can go to Ling Rui in his hospital 

112
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,050
Right, Mrs. Yang 

113
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,300
Aren't you not hearing well? 

114
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,050
You can ask Ling Rui for help 

115
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:57,625
I will have a baby with Ling Rui in the future, 

116
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,150
it will also save a lot of trouble 

117
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,525
Associate chief physicians 

118
00:06:04,175 --> 00:06:05,950
How much is your salary per month? 

119
00:06:07,175 --> 00:06:08,500
Every month with bonus 

120
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,750
approximately 

121
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,925
fifteen thousand yuan 

122
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,850
This is far too less, 

123
00:06:14,325 --> 00:06:15,125
Aunt Gao in my home 

124
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,700
is about the same number 

125
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:18,800
That's not the same, 

126
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,525
the value is not the same 

127
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:21,950
That's true 

128
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,700
Our Ling Rui is also a volunteer 

129
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,475
He is very kind and warmhearted 

130
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:26,000
Social contribution is not the same 

131
00:06:26,325 --> 00:06:27,025
This is cooked by 

132
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,525
Mom! 

133
00:06:28,825 --> 00:06:29,650
Aunt Gao 

134
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,575
Your favorite 

135
00:06:30,575 --> 00:06:32,125
Have some more, the dishes got cold 

136
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,725
Right, right! 

137
00:06:33,725 --> 00:06:35,025
Fangyu is right 

138
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:36,100
Just kept talking, 

139
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,575
you see, the dishes almost got cold 

140
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:38,050
Come on. 

141
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,625
Let us toast 

142
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,125
to welcome Mrs. Ling and her family 

143
00:06:42,325 --> 00:06:43,700
to come to our home 

144
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,700
Welcome. Welcome, come on 

145
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,600
Welcome 

146
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:46,575
Cheers 

147
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,575
This time, it is of hurry, 

148
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:51,600
I am not being a good host 

149
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,500
Next time, shall we 

150
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,825
find a good restaurant? 

151
00:06:53,825 --> 00:06:54,750
Yeah, that's good 

152
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,825
Let's have a tea time 

153
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,975
for the date of wedding 

154
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,800
let's make some plans 

155
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,725
That's great 

156
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:02,350
But you are being so kind 

157
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,875
We have a big family 

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,650
No problem 

159
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,100
We have a lot of rooms 

160
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:07,425
Just come 

161
00:07:07,425 --> 00:07:08,300
Lu Fangning 

162
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,775
Why it is you? 

163
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,850
Or what, you? 

164
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:15,150
Doctor Ling, 

165
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:15,850
Why are you suddenly going to 

166
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,100
marry Lu Fangning? 

167
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,700
Do you owe her money? 

168
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,225
You must owe money to Lu Fangning 

169
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:25,250
Lu Fangning 

170
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:26,525
So despicable of you 

171
00:07:26,525 --> 00:07:27,250
You actually do that for the money 

172
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,350
You forced Doctor Ling go with you 

173
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,225
You see that, 

174
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,300
we love each other for real 

175
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:03,650
Lu Fangning 

176
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:40,475
What are you doing? 

177
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,975
Refining the make-up 

178
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,575
You, what are you doing? Don't move 

179
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:03,500
Help you 

180
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,450
Clean up 

181
00:09:12,425 --> 00:09:13,750
Doctor Ling, 

182
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:15,600
Dr. Ling 

183
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,575
Good job 

184
00:09:17,025 --> 00:09:18,350
You deserve to be the straight A student 

185
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:21,575
It feels so good just now 

186
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,550
You did well 

187
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,125
It feels like that I have already graduated from elementary school, 

188
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,450
and went straight up to the college 

189
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:29,375
Next how about 

190
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,550
keep up further studies? 

191
00:09:33,175 --> 00:09:34,500
What? What do you mean? 

192
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:38,450
I mean 

193
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,950
the pace of the development, 

194
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,525
I am very satisfied. 

195
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:47,500
Drive carefully 

196
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:08,550
First of all, 

197
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,175
based on the principle of equality and mutual beneficial, 

198
00:10:10,175 --> 00:10:11,500
and after friendly negotiation, both sides 

199
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:12,775
agreed to voluntary marriage 

200
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:14,275
Of course in this marriage, 

201
00:10:14,275 --> 00:10:15,600
we shall not intervene each other's freedom 

202
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,350
If irreconcilable contradiction comes up, 

203
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,100
a negotiable divorce can be achieved 

204
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,050
Secondly, if necessary, 

205
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:19,825
you have to fulfil 

206
00:10:19,825 --> 00:10:20,850
all obligations of a husband 

207
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,000
It is because my identity 

208
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,725
is special 

209
00:10:22,975 --> 00:10:24,050
Sometimes you may have to 

210
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,200
be the husband of Lu Fangning, 

211
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:25,950
to cooperate with me 

212
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,000
Just like today 

213
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,750
If we are close to 

214
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,450
get caught by somebody else, 

215
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,475
we will have to make some moves 

216
00:10:29,475 --> 00:10:30,300
Such intimate behavior 

217
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:30,975
Definitely 

218
00:10:30,975 --> 00:10:31,750
If you feel that 

219
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,450
you lose, 

220
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:33,325
we can add one thing, 

221
00:10:33,325 --> 00:10:34,900
I can be your wife 

222
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,775
and cooperate with you to 

223
00:10:35,775 --> 00:10:36,800
finish all your shows 

224
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,850
What about the third rule? 

225
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,000
This is all based on my 

226
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
personal kindness, 

227
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,825
I will protect your 

228
00:10:40,825 --> 00:10:41,800
privacy 

229
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,375
Your personal information, 

230
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,275
your photos 

231
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:45,600
will not be published on any 

232
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,400
social media 

233
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,300
Of course if one day, 

234
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,425
it is necessary to go public 

235
00:10:48,425 --> 00:10:49,550
about or relationship, 

236
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,725
I will cover your photos 

237
00:10:50,725 --> 00:10:51,750
with mosaics 

238
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,600
before posting 

239
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,050
The next rule 

240
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,100
is not that important 

241
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,425
Just have an idea about that 

242
00:10:56,425 --> 00:10:57,450
It is mainly about us, 

243
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,425
the division of our properties after marriage 

244
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:00,600
If one day 

245
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,725
in our marriage, 

246
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:03,575
we generated some common achievements, 

247
00:11:03,575 --> 00:11:05,425
party B have to give up with no conditions, 

248
00:11:05,425 --> 00:11:06,375
that is to say 

249
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,425
yours are yours, 

250
00:11:07,425 --> 00:11:08,275
mines are mine 

251
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:09,825
Those look like ours, 

252
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:11,200
are still mine 

253
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:14,625
What do you mean by look like ours? 

254
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,350
Legal terms 

255
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,550
have a lot of such 

256
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:20,200
plausible expressions 

257
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,425
It is not important. 

258
00:11:21,425 --> 00:11:22,475
You see the rest are some 

259
00:11:22,475 --> 00:11:23,600
standard issues 

260
00:11:23,825 --> 00:11:24,875
Sign please 

261
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:27,975
Plausible words on the contract, 

262
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,200
they are meaningless, 

263
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,050
just delete 

264
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:40,625
By the way 

265
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,150
I'd like to add one thing, 

266
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:42,825
in the contract, 

267
00:11:42,825 --> 00:11:44,550
the mentioned privileges and obligations, 

268
00:11:44,825 --> 00:11:46,900
have to be implemented 

269
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,075
in accordance with the laws 

270
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,100
I am the General Manager of the Deersing Group, 

271
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,900
Lu Fangning 

272
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,800
shall I do illegal things with you? 

273
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,200
It has to be added 

274
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,825
Let me tell you, 

275
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:07,925
bed number 52, 

276
00:12:07,925 --> 00:12:08,475
this patient, 

277
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:10,150
is condition is quite special 

278
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:11,350
You should remember to 

279
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,225
observe him more, 

280
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:12,850
OK 

281
00:12:13,225 --> 00:12:14,900
measure the temperature at any time 

282
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,750
Understand? 

283
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,575
Observe his conditions 

284
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:19,725
Mr. Lu, 

285
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,175
Are you here to see me? Yes 

286
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,900
Doctor Ling, you can stick to your work, 

287
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,825
I will go to my office 

288
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:27,925
OK 

289
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,450
Mr. Lu, 

290
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,600
What are you here for 

291
00:12:43,975 --> 00:12:45,600
today? 

292
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,925
Nothing 

293
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,175
Just check up on you 

294
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:50,700
Did I disturb you? 

295
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:52,650
Of course not 

296
00:12:54,475 --> 00:12:55,900
Are you worrying 

297
00:12:56,325 --> 00:12:57,550
Fangning and me? 

298
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:01,925
Actually, Fangning 

299
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:03,775
is not a 

300
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:05,000
very talented one 

301
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,675
She made the achievements as of today 

302
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:09,450
is totally due to 

303
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,025
her tough mind 

304
00:13:14,575 --> 00:13:16,700
You think she is beautiful, 

305
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:19,850
but not that beautiful, 

306
00:13:22,575 --> 00:13:24,700
a little bit not feeling like a woman 

307
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,350
Actually there are no rules to define 

308
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:31,225
what is a woman like 

309
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,375
or a man like 

310
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:35,375
So what is Fangning like? 

311
00:13:41,575 --> 00:13:43,650
She is the one I admire 

312
00:13:44,475 --> 00:13:45,450
Sometimes, 

313
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,675
she may be a bit 

314
00:13:47,975 --> 00:13:48,850
arbitrary, 

315
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:49,775
self-willed, 

316
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:50,825
unreasonable, 

317
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,425
or kind of 

318
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,275
independent and different 

319
00:13:55,925 --> 00:13:57,325
But if everyone in the world 

320
00:13:57,325 --> 00:13:58,875
can understand her, 

321
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,275
your daughter, 

322
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,875
how mediocre could she be? 

323
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,600
Ling Rui 

324
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:11,650
I know why she 

325
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,675
is fond of you 

326
00:14:17,575 --> 00:14:19,175
About the marriage, 

327
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,450
have you two truly determined? 

328
00:14:23,675 --> 00:14:24,600
Mr. Lu, 

329
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,500
About the marriage, 

330
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,950
I can't promise much, 

331
00:14:30,175 --> 00:14:31,100
but at this moment, 

332
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,775
I am willing to marry Fangning, 

333
00:14:34,475 --> 00:14:36,225
and stick to all the marriage related 

334
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,700
promises 

335
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,725
Ling Rui, tell me, 

336
00:14:43,225 --> 00:14:44,475
did she had 

337
00:14:44,475 --> 00:14:45,600
something on you? 

338
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,375
So you have to marry her? 

339
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,600
It's all right, you can tell me 

340
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,725
I will make it up for you 

341
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:54,900
How about this 

342
00:14:55,175 --> 00:14:56,125
Later 

343
00:14:56,475 --> 00:14:58,925
I will get you some shares 

344
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,525
as some sort of defence 

345
00:15:26,775 --> 00:15:28,525
Getting married is a really troublesome thing 

346
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:29,550
Actually there is supposed to be one more 

347
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,525
step 

348
00:15:31,225 --> 00:15:32,275
Wedding 

349
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Forget it 

350
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,625
Wearing 

351
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,000
a heavy wedding dress 

352
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,550
standing on the stage like a doll 

353
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,600
most of the guests 

354
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,050
unfamiliar 

355
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,400
It's no more than a big party 

356
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,375
It's just so awkward 

357
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,600
I don't like that 

358
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,550
So you don't need a wedding 

359
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:52,425
Of course if you need, 

360
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:53,900
it's not quite impossible 

361
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:55,175
It's up to you 

362
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,400
OK 

363
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:59,050
Then just cancel it. Happy cooperation 

364
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,500
Happy cooperation 

365
00:16:17,175 --> 00:16:18,075
Guys 

366
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,325
Before we begin 

367
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:20,450
the vote 

368
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,750
for Infinity, 

369
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,075
I have something 

370
00:16:23,075 --> 00:16:25,075
to let you know 

371
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:26,900
I have formally invited 

372
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,575
the founder 

373
00:16:27,575 --> 00:16:28,975
of Nowegian brand Kasa 

374
00:16:28,975 --> 00:16:30,450
and their design director Garvin 

375
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,500
as our 

376
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,750
design consultant 

377
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,900
and at the same time 

378
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,375
to provide 

379
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,350
the material support that Infinity needs 

380
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,050
I have concluded the business 

381
00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:39,400
at the best price 

382
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,600
Now 

383
00:16:47,825 --> 00:16:49,050
let's vote for the project 

384
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,800

385
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,250
Deersing Group 

386
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,475
The vote begins 

387
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:17,024
All is here 

388
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:18,475
Hello everyone 

389
00:17:18,675 --> 00:17:19,150
Hello! Mr. Lu 

390
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,400
Long time no see 

391
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,325
Hello! Mr. Lu 

392
00:17:21,325 --> 00:17:22,250
Indeed 

393
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,575
Don't stand up 

394
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,675
Just sit 

395
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:25,500
Just sit 

396
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,600
I will 

397
00:17:28,025 --> 00:17:28,775
I heard from 

398
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:30,225
Fangning yesterday that 

399
00:17:30,225 --> 00:17:31,350
today we 

400
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,975
are going to reach an important decision 

401
00:17:33,275 --> 00:17:34,475
I'm curious about it 

402
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:35,725
So I just came over 

403
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:37,800
Hope that I'm not bothering you 

404
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,125
I'll just listen 

405
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,975
Fangning 

406
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:43,800
Have you told your ideas 

407
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,450
to everyone? 

408
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,400
Yes 

409
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:49,925
OK? 

410
00:17:50,575 --> 00:17:51,750
Has the vote started? 

411
00:17:51,975 --> 00:17:53,075
It just started 

412
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,250
Who voted? 

413
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,000
Tang 

414
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,025
Did you vote yes? 

415
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:05,200
How about Liu 

416
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,050
we... 

417
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:09,000
we... 

418
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,400
Zheng! OK I'll vote immediately 

419
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,725
I'll vote immediately 

420
00:18:15,275 --> 00:18:16,200
Ma 

421
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,675
What's your opinion? 

422
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:19,725
I... 

423
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,375
Why Lu Wenbin came over at this moment 

424
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,225
this vote 

425
00:18:23,225 --> 00:18:24,200
Really annoying 

426
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,875
What does this have to do with him? 

427
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:25,300
It's 

428
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,400
very serious 

429
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,875
It concerns 

430
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,575
the development of the company 

431
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:32,175
so 

432
00:18:32,325 --> 00:18:34,250
All I can say is 

433
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:35,575
just vote 

434
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,425
as you are supposed to 

435
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:38,400
All right? 

436
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,275
Go on 

437
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,000
The vote continues 

438
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:02,175
Director Yang, look 

439
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:03,275
It doesn't matter 

440
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,325
even Lu Webin is here 

441
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,200
Good for nothing 

442
00:19:09,225 --> 00:19:10,400
Ning 

443
00:19:10,725 --> 00:19:12,625
It's not that we don't support you 

444
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,225
You see 

445
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,550
It's a democratic vote 

446
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:18,825
Mr. Lu also joined in 

447
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,750
How about 

448
00:19:21,575 --> 00:19:22,600
we put it off 

449
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:25,525
Director Yang is right 

450
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:26,550
we put it off 

451
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,375
Just put it off 

452
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,625
Right? Put it off 

453
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:31,200
Put it off Okay That's good 

454
00:19:34,075 --> 00:19:35,175
Wait 

455
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:50,100
Sorry guys 

456
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,325
I'm late 

457
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,525
Late for a meeting? 

458
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,050
I vote 

459
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,150
yes for Infinity's 

460
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,425
brand project 

461
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,000
Director Xiao 

462
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,100
You are new here 

463
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,175
You don't know very well about the company 

464
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,100
I've known 

465
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,600
very enough 

466
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:09,700
And I look forward very much to see 

467
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:11,725
how would a household brand 

468
00:20:11,825 --> 00:20:12,925
created by Miss Lu 

469
00:20:12,925 --> 00:20:14,325
would be like 

470
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,575
You will not be disappointed 

471
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,625
What the hell 

472
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,625
Mr. Lu 

473
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,475
Miss Xiao wasn't here just now 

474
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,100
Let's re-vote 

475
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,125
The vote begins 

476
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,000
OK 

477
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:01,600
I announce that 

478
00:21:02,025 --> 00:21:03,450
the Infinity brand project 

479
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,925
Approved 

480
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,000
Thank you! 

481
00:21:35,725 --> 00:21:37,250
I'm still very curious 

482
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,175
Why Miss Xiao 

483
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:39,900
changed his mind all of a sudden 

484
00:21:43,475 --> 00:21:44,175
You are not allowed to run around like that 

485
00:21:44,175 --> 00:21:45,775
anymore 

486
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,625
Dear Xin 

487
00:21:50,825 --> 00:21:52,025
Why are you crying? 

488
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,375
He just fell down while running 

489
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,525
Fell down? 

490
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,550
The knees hurt? 

491
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,475
No 

492
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,125
That's good 

493
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,750
Dear Xin 

494
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,025
You can't run around 

495
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:05,350
in the hospital 

496
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,200
You know that? 

497
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,350
The patients 

498
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,500
need quietness 

499
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:10,900
It's not so good 

500
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,975
to disturb them 

501
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:14,975
You have become a man now 

502
00:22:15,025 --> 00:22:16,075
A man never 

503
00:22:16,075 --> 00:22:17,375
cries because of small matters 

504
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,200
You know that? 

505
00:22:18,425 --> 00:22:19,850
If you want to play outside, 

506
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,750
I'll play with you 

507
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,375
when you get better 

508
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,200
Really? Yes 

509
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:27,225
Doctor Ling, 

510
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,750
You are 

511
00:22:33,975 --> 00:22:35,350
a colleague of Miss Lu's 

512
00:22:35,875 --> 00:22:38,075
It's really surprising that someone like her 

513
00:22:38,075 --> 00:22:39,950
would have you as her friend 

514
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,617
A person like her 

515
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,650
knows nothing about life 

516
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,525
but devoted herself totally to inventing 

517
00:22:46,525 --> 00:22:48,100
living stuff for others 

518
00:22:48,275 --> 00:22:49,600
But you are different 

519
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:51,425
So warm, so optimistic 

520
00:22:51,425 --> 00:22:52,750
You both seems belonging 

521
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,425
to two different world 

522
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:57,375
Maybe we are different from each other 

523
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:58,650
however, 

524
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,125
But everyone has the right 

525
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:01,425
to live his life 

526
00:23:01,425 --> 00:23:02,875
as he wants right? 

527
00:23:03,125 --> 00:23:04,625
I respect her understand her 

528
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,400
And 

529
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,550
we are getting married 

530
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,200
Marry 

531
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:13,825
Congratulations! 

532
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:15,525
It seems that 

533
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,625
I have to prepare 

534
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:17,775
the wedding present 

535
00:23:20,225 --> 00:23:21,250
I never knew that 

536
00:23:21,375 --> 00:23:23,050
he was you fiance 

537
00:23:24,825 --> 00:23:26,675
But he really made some point 

538
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,650
Maybe I shouldn't 

539
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,375
tag you too soon 

540
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:33,250
Congratulations! 

541
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,450
Happy Marriage! 

542
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:36,800
Thank you! 

543
00:23:41,725 --> 00:23:42,850
I don't care whether you are truly getting married 

544
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:44,325
or not 

545
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:46,025
But from now on, 

546
00:23:46,575 --> 00:23:47,975
your life is no longer 

547
00:23:47,975 --> 00:23:49,550
of your own business 

548
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:51,950
Whatever 

549
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,600
Anyway 

550
00:23:56,025 --> 00:23:58,050
Thanks for your support 

551
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,400
Congratulations 

552
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,075
Finally it passed 

553
00:24:06,075 --> 00:24:07,525
The board have decided that 

554
00:24:08,525 --> 00:24:09,800
we should invite Garvin for a visit instantly 

555
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,750
to affirm the designs 

556
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,325
And 

557
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:12,550
Push the contract with 

558
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,250
the material suppliers 

559
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,375
and the production line 

560
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,950
These materials are unusual 

561
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,250
Very few domestic manufacturers 

562
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:18,075
can produce such kind of materials 

563
00:24:18,075 --> 00:24:20,050
Gao Erfan, you...Miss Lu 

564
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,925
I'm afraid that besides this 

565
00:24:21,925 --> 00:24:22,650
there is another 

566
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:23,925
more urgent thing 

567
00:24:23,925 --> 00:24:25,350
to be solved at first 

568
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,925
I heard from 

569
00:24:28,025 --> 00:24:29,850
The wedding this weekend 

570
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,000
Wedding 

571
00:24:31,325 --> 00:24:32,650
Who are robbing my money from my pocket? 

572
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,275
Your... 

573
00:24:33,275 --> 00:24:33,775
My... 

574
00:24:33,775 --> 00:24:34,100
Your... 

575
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,925
My... 

576
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:35,800
Your... What? 

577
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,400
After the meeting, 

578
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,150
all of the directors have received 

579
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,200
from Mr. Lu 

580
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,800
the invitation to 

581
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,850
your wedding 

582
00:24:42,025 --> 00:24:42,975
The wedding invitation cards are well prepared 

583
00:24:42,975 --> 00:24:44,100
This weekend 

584
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,625
Who is going to have a wedding 

585
00:24:45,625 --> 00:24:46,575
I'd like to see him 

586
00:24:46,575 --> 00:24:47,750
Wait for a moment, Miss Lu 

587
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,975
Miss Lu, Just think about it 

588
00:24:49,975 --> 00:24:51,175
on this particular occasion 

589
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:52,300
We'd better follow 

590
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,050
Mr. Lu's mind 

591
00:24:54,475 --> 00:24:56,425
After all it's a hard-won success 

592
00:24:56,425 --> 00:24:57,175
Besides, 

593
00:24:57,175 --> 00:24:58,900
Getting married is a happy thing 

594
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,650
We should tell everybody 

595
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,250
It'll bring good luck 

596
00:25:04,025 --> 00:25:05,325
to every one 

597
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:09,075
Telling everybody? 

598
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,025
to every one 

599
00:25:13,225 --> 00:25:14,225
True 

600
00:25:14,775 --> 00:25:15,850
Such a time-wasting 

601
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:17,375
and vigor-consuming thing 

602
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:18,375
Since we did it, 

603
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,600
it must be worth our while 

604
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,400
OK 

605
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,200
Infinity has just founded 

606
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,825
and the inner conflict is also solved 

607
00:25:23,825 --> 00:25:24,900
It's time 

608
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,850
to invite our business friend 

609
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:27,150
to offer some support 

610
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:27,725
That's it 

611
00:25:27,725 --> 00:25:29,000
Invite all of our business partners 

612
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,275
to the wedding 

613
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:31,100
Turn it 

614
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,400
into a propaganda 

615
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,675
for Infinity 

616
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,250
Well that 

617
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,675
is your call, Miss Lu 

618
00:25:38,675 --> 00:25:39,200
As for the invitation cards, 

619
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,675
our product brochure would be enough 

620
00:25:40,675 --> 00:25:41,750
One for each 

621
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,150
Stress on the procedure of the wedding 

622
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,750
the rest does not matter 

623
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:45,825
however, 

624
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,975
Make sure enough time is left 

625
00:25:48,075 --> 00:25:49,725
for speaking out our slogan 

626
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,225
Infinity 

627
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,450
To give you unlimited love 

628
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,175
in limited time 

629
00:25:57,725 --> 00:25:59,325
Pressed on the first page of the cards 

630
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,700
Awesome! Miss Lu 

631
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,575
It is what they called a century wedding 

632
00:26:33,075 --> 00:26:34,375
My rent my meal 

633
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:35,075
my boyfriend 

634
00:26:35,075 --> 00:26:35,750
and the gossip headlines 

635
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,625
of this month 

636
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:37,625
all count on you 

637
00:26:37,975 --> 00:26:39,600
I want a south-facing room 

638
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,525
It'll be three hundred higher than this one 

639
00:26:41,525 --> 00:26:43,125
I'm not demanding about the food 

640
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:43,800
Take-out is ok 

641
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,025
Sea urchin gunkan-maki 

642
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:46,775
Durian Pizza and Harakomesi 

643
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:48,550
Moreover I wish that I could 

644
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,150
met someone 

645
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,050
maturing mysterious powerful as my boy friend 

646
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:54,325
Was that too much? 

647
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,975
Just let me reach the target 

648
00:26:57,975 --> 00:26:59,100
of this month 

649
00:26:59,375 --> 00:27:00,600
Give me a big news! 

650
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,325
Lu Fangning 

651
00:27:03,325 --> 00:27:04,375
The daughter of Deersing Group, 

652
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:05,675
general manager Lu Fangning 

653
00:27:05,675 --> 00:27:06,750
held a big wedding 

654
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,300
at Coli Hotel 

655
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,950
It'll be the most splendid 

656
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:10,850
wedding in this city this year 

657
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,925
The bride Lu Fangning were wearing 

658
00:27:11,925 --> 00:27:12,575
simple 

659
00:27:12,575 --> 00:27:14,875
white hand-made wedding suit 

660
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:16,100
and lace veil 

661
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,450
plain but decent 

662
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,900
The groom wearing a bow-tie 

663
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,025
was dressed with a black suit 

664
00:27:20,025 --> 00:27:21,175
with logo L 

665
00:27:21,175 --> 00:27:22,825
They walked in the banquet hall side by side 

666
00:27:22,825 --> 00:27:23,975
This press release 

667
00:27:24,075 --> 00:27:24,875
consists of nothing 

668
00:27:24,875 --> 00:27:25,900
besides flattery 

669
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,425
for myself 

670
00:27:27,425 --> 00:27:28,225
There is no mention 

671
00:27:28,225 --> 00:27:29,125
of any Infinity's 

672
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,200
brand features 

673
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,225
let alone 

674
00:27:31,225 --> 00:27:32,825
the listing time 

675
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:34,400
Is that I didn't make the job clear 

676
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,875
or you are not qualified for this 

677
00:27:35,875 --> 00:27:36,850
Miss Lu 

678
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,475
After all it's your wedding, 

679
00:27:38,475 --> 00:27:39,300
the emphasis... 

680
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,250
The emphasis is to make 

681
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:41,650
a stunning stage pose for Infinity 

682
00:27:41,825 --> 00:27:42,725
Do it again 

683
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:44,275
The wedding is beginning in a minute 

684
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:44,925
I will check it 

685
00:27:44,925 --> 00:27:46,375
as soon as you've done 

686
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:47,500
And it must be issued immediately after the wedding 

687
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,750
Any problem? 

688
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,775
No 

689
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,575
Ling Rui 

690
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:05,925
Never heard of this guy 

691
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,700
So lucky 

692
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,600
to marry Lu Fangning 

693
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,900
He must be of some capabilities 

694
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,850
to marry her 

695
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,300
I'm wondering 

696
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,825
what kind of capability that would be 

697
00:28:17,825 --> 00:28:19,475
to overwhelm her 

698
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,900
Yes 

699
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,975
My son-in-law 

700
00:28:24,025 --> 00:28:25,550
should be great 

701
00:28:25,725 --> 00:28:26,750
Think about it 

702
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,725
Only an extraordinary person 

703
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,250
can take fancy to my daughter 

704
00:28:36,775 --> 00:28:38,825
How smart I am 

705
00:28:38,825 --> 00:28:39,325
to choose such 

706
00:28:39,325 --> 00:28:41,075
a suitable dress 

707
00:28:42,475 --> 00:28:44,525
How comfortable it is 

708
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,975
Wen, go get some rest 

709
00:28:51,725 --> 00:28:53,050
Hard work, thank you 

710
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:56,675
Let's go 

711
00:28:56,675 --> 00:28:57,325
OK 

712
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,625
My daughter-in-law Mom 

713
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:26,825
Fangning, elder aunt, 

714
00:29:26,825 --> 00:29:28,025
younger aunt. The bride is so beautiful 

715
00:29:28,025 --> 00:29:28,975
Come on! Have a sit 

716
00:29:30,675 --> 00:29:32,300
You are gorgeous today 

717
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,925
My daughter-in-law 

718
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,575
I know you don't need money 

719
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,375
But mom have prepared a red pocket 

720
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,525
for you 

721
00:29:45,025 --> 00:29:46,500
Wish you happiness 

722
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:48,775
for all the life 

723
00:29:49,225 --> 00:29:50,125
Mom! 

724
00:29:50,475 --> 00:29:51,500
one-three-one-four is 

725
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,075
my favorite number 

726
00:29:53,075 --> 00:29:54,175
We are supposed 

727
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:55,050
to become a family 

728
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:58,000
Fangning. Come here 

729
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:59,900
Congratulations 

730
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:01,975
this looks 

731
00:30:01,975 --> 00:30:03,300
too valuable. Just accept it 

732
00:30:05,325 --> 00:30:06,725
Thanks aunt 

733
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,725
Open it 

734
00:30:13,725 --> 00:30:14,925
Like it? 

735
00:30:16,075 --> 00:30:16,925
This 

736
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:18,300
represents the deepest wishes for you 

737
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,225
from us 

738
00:30:20,525 --> 00:30:21,575
Yes, I felt it 

739
00:30:21,575 --> 00:30:23,200
Ardent 

740
00:30:23,925 --> 00:30:24,925
Then tell me 

741
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:26,775
What do you feel? 

742
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,225
It's getting married 

743
00:30:29,225 --> 00:30:30,725
not a thesis defense 

744
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:32,675
Fangning 

745
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,425
My present 

746
00:30:33,425 --> 00:30:34,800
is sent to your mobile 

747
00:30:34,975 --> 00:30:36,425
Congratulations 

748
00:30:38,675 --> 00:30:41,075
Check it when you get home 

749
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:43,900
Really mysterious 

750
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,775
Don't look at it now 

751
00:30:45,975 --> 00:30:47,050
Ling Rui will know 

752
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:48,500
tonight 

753
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:49,875
Let's go 

754
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:51,350
Don't disturb the bride 

755
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,350
Mom, aunts 

756
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,900
Then I won't be accompanying you 

757
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,350
Go to Gao Erfan if anything is needed 

758
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,400
I've arranged 

759
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,025
Ok, go 

760
00:30:58,025 --> 00:30:59,075
Alright 

761
00:30:59,225 --> 00:31:00,350
Enjoy yourself 

762
00:31:01,425 --> 00:31:02,525
So beautiful. Let's go 

763
00:31:02,525 --> 00:31:04,600
My daughter-in-law 

764
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,800
We gotta go 

765
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,225
Bravo 

766
00:31:07,225 --> 00:31:08,675
I am happy today 

767
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:49,900
I'll go for Miss Lu 

768
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,475
What do you want? 

769
00:31:51,475 --> 00:31:52,100
Get out of my way 

770
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,875
You can't go 

771
00:31:52,875 --> 00:31:54,025
Keep off 

772
00:31:54,025 --> 00:31:55,425
You can't go 

773
00:31:55,425 --> 00:31:56,425
Get out 

774
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,800
Lu Fangning 

775
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:01,375
Tang Pingping 

776
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:04,100
You are really bold 

777
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,375
OK? 

778
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,175
I don't want you 

779
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,125
to marry him 

780
00:32:07,575 --> 00:32:08,825
Don't tried to drag Ling Rui into the water 

781
00:32:08,825 --> 00:32:10,000
I warn you 

782
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:11,725
Don't get crazy here 

783
00:32:11,725 --> 00:32:13,175
Your dad is here 

784
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:14,925
So what? 

785
00:32:17,225 --> 00:32:18,125
Gao Erfan 

786
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,025
Miss Tang, this way 

787
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,150
Sorry 

788
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:28,200
Who are you? Get off me! No 

789
00:32:28,725 --> 00:32:30,575
Get off me! No 

790
00:32:31,275 --> 00:32:32,350
What do you have to do with Lu Fangning? 

791
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,450
It's none of your business 

792
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,900
I don't know her. It doesn't matter 

793
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,825
An evildoer is not entitled to have a wedding 

794
00:32:36,825 --> 00:32:38,550
It's justice to stop it 

795
00:32:38,675 --> 00:32:39,725
Madwoman 

796
00:32:39,775 --> 00:32:40,750
Get off me 

797
00:32:44,975 --> 00:32:46,375
What do you want? 

798
00:32:50,525 --> 00:32:52,275
My dress 

799
00:32:54,725 --> 00:32:55,800
Tang Pingping 

800
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,925
Tang Pingping 

801
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,675
Your dress 

802
00:32:59,675 --> 00:33:00,775
is not of good quality 

803
00:33:00,775 --> 00:33:01,650
You? 

804
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:05,575
It's much better 

805
00:33:05,725 --> 00:33:06,575
It's more like a 

806
00:33:06,575 --> 00:33:07,625
bridesmaid 

807
00:33:07,825 --> 00:33:09,350
Lu Fangning 

808
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,075
I'm here. I'm here 

809
00:33:11,075 --> 00:33:12,350
What's up? 

810
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,325
How about this? 

811
00:33:13,475 --> 00:33:14,150
Later 

812
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,350
you get on the staging wish a best marriage 

813
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,000
for Ling Rui and I 

814
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,700
as a bridemaid 

815
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,300
OK? 

816
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,150
Impossible! 

817
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,000
I'm gonna tell everyone 

818
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,300
that you forced him to marry you 

819
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,175
Shut up! 

820
00:33:25,725 --> 00:33:26,725
Tang Pingping 

821
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,575
Have you lost your mind? 

822
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,625
I... 

823
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,050
Fangning 

824
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:33,075
Sorry 

825
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:34,275
You see a badwoman 

826
00:33:34,275 --> 00:33:35,600
Sorry to bring you the trouble 

827
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,350
That's okay, Uncle Tang 

828
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,450
If she cannot 

829
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:39,900
control herself, 

830
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:40,750
I think it's better 

831
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,975
not to let her out 

832
00:33:41,975 --> 00:33:42,775
What do you think? 

833
00:33:42,775 --> 00:33:43,575
You? 

834
00:33:44,425 --> 00:33:45,125
Don't worry 

835
00:33:45,125 --> 00:33:46,325
I will keep a close eye on her 

836
00:33:47,575 --> 00:33:49,175
Don't disgrace me here 

837
00:33:49,175 --> 00:33:49,875
I'm off 

838
00:33:50,425 --> 00:33:51,600
Sorry 

839
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,250
Dad 

840
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:55,250
Look what you did 

841
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:56,325
Too shameful 

842
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,450
We can't stay here 

843
00:33:58,325 --> 00:33:59,375
Go, Go 

844
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:00,975
Go 

845
00:34:00,975 --> 00:34:01,600
Sorry 

846
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,375
We will just see! 

847
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:03,850
Bye, Be careful! Go! Go! 

848
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,875
What's the matter, dad? 

849
00:34:07,475 --> 00:34:09,075
Come over 

850
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,000
Go. Dad 

851
00:34:13,725 --> 00:34:14,625
Who are you? 

852
00:34:15,675 --> 00:34:16,975
Cai Siyu 

853
00:34:16,975 --> 00:34:18,275
I'm asking about your job 

854
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:20,949
A passer-by 

855
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:21,999
Reporter? 

856
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:25,275
I'm not...Miss Lu! Gao Erfan 

857
00:34:25,275 --> 00:34:26,625
Give her a reporting admission 

858
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,300
We haven't invited 

859
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,100
any press 

860
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,949
There is no reporting admission 

861
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:30,299
Then make one 

862
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,824
Invite Miss Cai 

863
00:34:31,824 --> 00:34:32,574
as our 

864
00:34:32,574 --> 00:34:34,524
only designated reporter 

865
00:34:34,525 --> 00:34:35,200
Yes 

866
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,024
Thanks, Miss Lu 

867
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,525
But all of your interview 

868
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:40,225
must be examined 

869
00:34:40,225 --> 00:34:41,324
by GM Assistant Gao 

870
00:34:41,324 --> 00:34:42,274
Any problem? 

871
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:43,374
No problem 

872
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,625
Thanks 

873
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:45,800
Bye bye 

874
00:34:51,275 --> 00:34:53,675
Your boss is so cool 

875
00:35:24,325 --> 00:35:25,175
Ling Rui 

876
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:27,525
Tonight you are mine 

877
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,175
Miss Lu 

878
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:45,575
Are your legs and feet flexible enough? 

879
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,025
What do you mean? 

880
00:35:47,575 --> 00:35:48,425
I'm afraid that 

881
00:35:48,425 --> 00:35:49,850
you will step on my dress 

882
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,500
we will both fell down 

883
00:35:53,475 --> 00:35:54,500
Don't worry 

884
00:35:55,975 --> 00:35:57,525
I'll not let you fall down 

885
00:37:20,075 --> 00:37:20,950
OK 

886
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,925
I can hear you! Just say 

887
00:38:30,925 --> 00:38:32,300
My face? 

888
00:38:36,025 --> 00:38:37,075
No need for ps 

889
00:38:37,075 --> 00:38:38,750
You thought I were Tang Ping? 

890
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,275
I don't need beauty 

891
00:38:40,275 --> 00:38:41,375
I need Infinity 

892
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:42,850
Focus on Infinity 

893
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:44,825
Ling Rui 

894
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:46,900
Hold it for me 

895
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:48,175
just one minute 

896
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:49,050
It's alright 

897
00:38:50,175 --> 00:38:51,225
All the press release 

898
00:38:51,225 --> 00:38:52,025
must involve 

899
00:38:52,025 --> 00:38:53,100
the logo of Infinity, 

900
00:38:53,225 --> 00:38:54,600
closely printed 

901
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,750
The logos are necessary 

902
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,425
even using watermarks 

903
00:38:56,425 --> 00:38:57,325
Got it? 

904
00:38:57,525 --> 00:38:58,350
OK 

905
00:38:58,675 --> 00:39:00,450
Gao Erfan. Listen to me carefully 

906
00:39:00,525 --> 00:39:01,700
Find someone 

907
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,575
to push these news 

908
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:05,450
to all of the social networks 

909
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,125
Hear that? 

910
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:07,300
Headline 

911
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:09,150
Focus on Infinity 

912
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,225
Got it? 

913
00:39:15,325 --> 00:39:16,425
It really hurts! 

914
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:20,775
What's the matter? 

915
00:39:21,825 --> 00:39:22,800
I sprained my ankle 

916
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,875
while toasting 

917
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:26,925
And 

918
00:39:27,125 --> 00:39:28,300
Do not reveal any information 

919
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:29,425
about the groom 

920
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,950
Cover the faces with masaic 

921
00:39:33,475 --> 00:39:34,850
while toasting 

922
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:39,450
Come on! Let me help you 

923
00:39:39,725 --> 00:39:40,500
Open it 

924
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:42,825
Post-marriage Happiness Direction Article One 

925
00:39:42,825 --> 00:39:44,450
Getting familiar and closer 

926
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,025
What's the matter? 

927
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,450
I can't move 

928
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:52,425
Can you 

929
00:39:53,275 --> 00:39:54,350
carry me there? 

930
00:40:08,775 --> 00:40:09,925
Which foot? 

931
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:11,850
This 

932
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,300
Whatever 

933
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,450
Is such a minor thing 

934
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,775
really worth asking? 

935
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:27,100
I can't see it's swollen 

936
00:40:32,225 --> 00:40:34,075
Here, here 

937
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,275
Sit, I'll get the ice bag 

938
00:40:53,525 --> 00:40:54,800
OK 

939
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,075
That's it 

940
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,425
Here? 

941
00:41:10,925 --> 00:41:12,225
A long day 

942
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
I'm exhausted
