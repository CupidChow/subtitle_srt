1
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,564
Begin Again

2
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,960
Episode 11

3
00:01:45,262 --> 00:01:46,124
Don't catch cold.

4
00:01:52,435 --> 00:01:53,182
To be honest,

5
00:01:53,777 --> 00:01:55,200
it's much better.

6
00:02:16,897 --> 00:02:17,777
Don't you sleep?

7
00:02:19,475 --> 00:02:20,530
I'm in so much pain,

8
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,626
how can I fall asleep?

9
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,520
You're looking at me like this,

10
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,853
how can you be asleep?

11
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:33,422
How about...

12
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,466
You sing to me.

13
00:02:36,302 --> 00:02:36,791
Okay?

14
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,382
You're not a kid.

15
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,840
You need others to sing to you?

16
00:02:42,844 --> 00:02:44,195
You like kids so much,

17
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,000
you're surely good at singing

18
00:02:46,168 --> 00:02:47,084
children's songs,

19
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,355
lullaby, something like that.

20
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:49,404
Just sing a few lines.

21
00:02:50,506 --> 00:02:51,484
I don't sing.

22
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,484
Just a few lines, come on.

23
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,951
I don't sing.

24
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:55,786
Sleep now.

25
00:02:56,897 --> 00:02:57,928
Then you must sing out of tune.

26
00:02:58,577 --> 00:02:58,960
Fine,

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,208
I won't put you on the spot.

28
00:03:02,435 --> 00:03:03,475
Read a book, okay?

29
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,764
Beside you,

30
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,435
the one on the top.

31
00:03:07,128 --> 00:03:08,320
Read it for me,

32
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,982
I'm sure I'll fall asleep soon.

33
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,337
That's where I ended.

34
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,875
The upbringing of a newborn.

35
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,280
Go ahead.

36
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,777
Lu Fangning,

37
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,844
why do you want a kid so much?

38
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,448
Yeah,

39
00:03:53,048 --> 00:03:53,991
why?

40
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,346
Kids are

41
00:03:56,426 --> 00:03:58,444
troublesome and annoying.

42
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,404
But,

43
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,977
I don't know.

44
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,208
Maybe it's because

45
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,502
I've lived alone for a long time.

46
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,426
Sometimes, I think that

47
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,448
when I come back to an empty house,

48
00:04:14,142 --> 00:04:15,128
there's a kid,

49
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,551
with snot and tears on his face,

50
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,257
crying and shouting

51
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:21,679
"Mom, Mom".

52
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:26,622
Thinking like this, life turns quite funny.

53
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,555
If you don't want to read,

54
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:39,084
can I sleep in your arms?

55
00:04:41,422 --> 00:04:42,826
Smelling your sweet smell,

56
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,106
I'll be asleep in a minute.

57
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,657
It hurts suddenly.

58
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:02,000
It also works holding my arm.

59
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,115
Don't do it if you dislike.

60
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,697
I'm not picky.

61
00:05:22,586 --> 00:05:23,546
Just sleep.

62
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,560
Why do you want a kid so much?

63
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:52,835
Maybe it's because

64
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,200
I've lived alone for a long time.

65
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,106
Sometimes, I think that

66
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,164
when I come back to an empty house,

67
00:06:01,786 --> 00:06:03,030
there's a kid,

68
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,142
with snot and tears over his face,

69
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,813
crying and shouting

70
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,235
"Mom, Mom".

71
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,417
Thinking like this, life turns quite funny.

72
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:49,671
Life is difficult.

73
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:51,440
Such a great opportunity,

74
00:06:51,466 --> 00:06:53,173
he even hugged me,

75
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,808
The atmosphere was just right.

76
00:06:55,235 --> 00:06:56,977
At least I could try,

77
00:06:57,342 --> 00:06:59,075
but the period came.

78
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:17,591
Morning.

79
00:07:18,008 --> 00:07:18,435
Morning.

80
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,257
There's breakfast for you.

81
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,520
Eat some.

82
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,080
Thank you.

83
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,502
Well...

84
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,155
You don't have to watch me eat.

85
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,013
You can go to work.

86
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,533
It'll take me a long time to eat.

87
00:07:38,471 --> 00:07:39,600
Wait till you finish your breakfast,

88
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,964
I'd like to talk about something with you.

89
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,355
All right, I won't eat it.

90
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,862
Go ahead, you're gonna say it anyway.

91
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:52,480
By the way,

92
00:07:52,853 --> 00:07:53,822
the thing about divorcing or breaking up,

93
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:54,880
I won't agree.

94
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,786
Last time,

95
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,737
-the thing failed...
-Sorry.

96
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,035
You...

97
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,515
Why do you suddenly apologize to me?

98
00:08:02,897 --> 00:08:03,520
Last time

99
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,071
in the amusement park,

100
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:08,551
actually, I had a good time.

101
00:08:09,564 --> 00:08:10,782
However, because it

102
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,075
came from a wrong thing,

103
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,262
so I got angry with you.

104
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,102
I'm sorry.

105
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,128
If you didn't tell me, I don't even know

106
00:08:21,191 --> 00:08:22,017
you were angry.

107
00:08:23,617 --> 00:08:24,506
You can be angry.

108
00:08:24,506 --> 00:08:25,395
You can curse if you want.

109
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,608
I'm not that vulnerable.

110
00:08:30,497 --> 00:08:31,022
Besides,

111
00:08:32,231 --> 00:08:33,160
I've thought it through.

112
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:36,176
I shouldn't have judged you arbitrarily that

113
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,711
you were not qualified to have a child.

114
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,346
Maybe you're more suitable than anyone else

115
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,684
to have one child

116
00:08:46,106 --> 00:08:47,813
and be a good mother.

117
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,608
But that's not

118
00:08:53,671 --> 00:08:54,880
in my life plan.

119
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,600
Though the shooting stars are brilliant,

120
00:08:57,946 --> 00:08:59,360
they're short after all.

121
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:01,706
If that's what you're really

122
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:02,302
getting married for,

123
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,248
I don't think I am

124
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:07,306
the right person.

125
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:10,302
So,

126
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,706
I think we'd better

127
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,933
break off the engagement.

128
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,431
All the consequences of that,

129
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,008
I'm willing to take it.

130
00:09:26,346 --> 00:09:27,297
I disagree.

131
00:09:27,431 --> 00:09:28,764
What if I insist?

132
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,973
I don't want a baby.

133
00:09:30,328 --> 00:09:31,020
You don't have to do this.

134
00:09:31,048 --> 00:09:32,250
I know what I'm saying now

135
00:09:32,284 --> 00:09:33,404
will make you think I'm lying to you.

136
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:35,804
But to tell you the truth,

137
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,595
I didn't marry you just

138
00:09:36,622 --> 00:09:37,690
because I want a kid.

139
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
I also want to promote

140
00:09:39,173 --> 00:09:39,991
my Infinity.

141
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,653
Now, the brand hasn't been officially launched yet.

142
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:43,190
If we got divorced,

143
00:09:43,235 --> 00:09:44,000
Lu Wenbin would not

144
00:09:44,008 --> 00:09:44,791
let me off,

145
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:45,537
let alone other people.

146
00:09:46,035 --> 00:09:46,951
Keep me from making money,

147
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,186
that's the worst thing.

148
00:09:48,364 --> 00:09:49,253
Besides,

149
00:09:49,431 --> 00:09:50,773
I can have a baby after a year.

150
00:09:54,542 --> 00:09:55,466
My previous behaviors

151
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:56,622
have caused you troubles,

152
00:09:56,675 --> 00:09:57,582
I'm so sorry.

153
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:58,702
Starting from today,

154
00:09:58,773 --> 00:09:59,720
we'll formally continue

155
00:09:59,795 --> 00:10:00,844
our relationship within the contract.

156
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:02,871
By the way,

157
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,328
remember to come back home early tonight.

158
00:10:04,382 --> 00:10:05,333
Don't let others suspect it.

159
00:10:16,017 --> 00:10:17,360
I think I just got him, right?

160
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:19,208
He must have bought my words.

161
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,631
I pretended to be so naive.

162
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:23,146
Right, let him stay first.

163
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,644
Lu Fangning, you did a great job.

164
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,173
You acted well.

165
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,853
As long as he stays,

166
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,737
you'll definitely have a baby.

167
00:10:33,075 --> 00:10:34,568
Money will come as well.

168
00:10:38,728 --> 00:10:39,777
Ling Rui,

169
00:10:41,137 --> 00:10:42,213
you can't get away.

170
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,093
Medically speaking,

171
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,004
dolls can make people feel safe

172
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,284
and ease loneliness.

173
00:11:34,622 --> 00:11:35,310
Let it stay with you.

174
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:36,666
I went to work.

175
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:37,991
See you at home tonight.

176
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,737
To ease loneliness

177
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,337
and to make people feel safe?

178
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,337
What's the point of having a bear doll?

179
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:14,782
I need to order an adult edition.

180
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,724
Let me see.

181
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,528
Pingping,

182
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:40,746
what's wrong?

183
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,057
I was disappointed in love.

184
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,768
You drank it all?

185
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,693
The pool.

186
00:12:57,164 --> 00:12:57,911
You...

187
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,302
This is more like how that feels.

188
00:13:26,862 --> 00:13:28,506
Dad,

189
00:13:29,617 --> 00:13:32,000
I lost my love of him.

190
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:34,560
I feel so terrible.

191
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,488
How about this?

192
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:57,671
Think about it.

193
00:13:57,955 --> 00:13:58,924
What do you have

194
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,417
that's better than Fangning?

195
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,693
Let's turn the feeling of being lovelorn

196
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:04,302
into the motivation for life.

197
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:05,191
How's that?

198
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,195
Better than Lu Fangning?

199
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:08,995
Yes.

200
00:14:09,546 --> 00:14:10,195
For example,

201
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:11,340
work,

202
00:14:11,377 --> 00:14:12,080
study,

203
00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:13,226
hobbies,

204
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,751
and...

205
00:14:15,351 --> 00:14:16,453
It seems like there's nothing that

206
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,768
you can compare with her.

207
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,142
You!

208
00:14:23,902 --> 00:14:24,782
Okay, okay.

209
00:14:24,826 --> 00:14:25,582
I'm wrong. I'm wrong.

210
00:14:25,644 --> 00:14:26,675
I'm wrong, I...

211
00:14:26,755 --> 00:14:27,982
I'm wrong. I'm wrong.

212
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:32,560
Pingping.

213
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:33,920
Pingping.

214
00:14:34,835 --> 00:14:35,448
Dad,

215
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,906
I want to learn dancing.

216
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,093
Good, keep it.

217
00:14:49,386 --> 00:14:50,320
Stay steady.

218
00:14:51,831 --> 00:14:52,551
Yazhi,

219
00:14:53,128 --> 00:14:54,906
I thought you were

220
00:14:54,933 --> 00:14:56,040
doing great ballet with us.

221
00:14:56,515 --> 00:14:57,920
With your own experience,

222
00:14:57,946 --> 00:14:58,986
you can attract students.

223
00:14:59,217 --> 00:15:00,115
So I agreed to

224
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:01,466
let you be a

225
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,746
course consultant there.

226
00:15:03,137 --> 00:15:04,488
But all these days, this...

227
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,413
The dress.

228
00:15:06,924 --> 00:15:08,302
This is genuine.

229
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,564
It's from my nephew's wife.

230
00:15:09,662 --> 00:15:10,675
She's particularly wealthy.

231
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:11,626
Not fake.

232
00:15:11,902 --> 00:15:13,697
That's quite the problem.

233
00:15:14,302 --> 00:15:14,933
Think about this.

234
00:15:15,324 --> 00:15:16,560
People who come to us for advice,

235
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:17,848
see you wearing such

236
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,182
luxury brand.

237
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,711
They may think that our school

238
00:15:20,764 --> 00:15:21,813
gets excessive profit.

239
00:15:23,217 --> 00:15:24,115
See,

240
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:24,915
till now,

241
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,031
you haven't closed a deal yet, right?

242
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:28,631
Headmaster,

243
00:15:28,746 --> 00:15:30,480
I think this is definitely not

244
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:31,457
a matter of my dress.

245
00:15:31,626 --> 00:15:32,106
Hello.

246
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,164
Hello, I'd like to ask about

247
00:15:33,191 --> 00:15:33,955
the dance lessons.

248
00:15:34,426 --> 00:15:34,853
Okay.

249
00:15:34,888 --> 00:15:35,795
-I'll go first.
-Please wait a moment.

250
00:15:36,195 --> 00:15:37,031
Hello, hello.

251
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,746
I'm the course consultant here.

252
00:15:38,853 --> 00:15:39,540
What courses

253
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:40,666
do you want to consult?

254
00:15:43,137 --> 00:15:43,760
Miss,

255
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:45,048
you look very familiar.

256
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,800
Have we met somewhere before?

257
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:48,613
At...

258
00:15:49,635 --> 00:15:51,040
Are you a fan of mine?

259
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,386
I'll sign for you later?

260
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,391
Star?

261
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:57,040
Star.

262
00:15:57,751 --> 00:15:59,048
No, not yet.

263
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,226
Just a little bit famous.

264
00:16:08,097 --> 00:16:09,431
Your dress...

265
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,537
The latest version.

266
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,991
It's genuine.

267
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:21,253
But it... well...

268
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:22,382
It had a discount.

269
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:23,413
I choose here.

270
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,920
You want to register for a card?

271
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:27,955
Even a saleswoman

272
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,262
wears a famous brand.

273
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,457
That means here must be very advanced,

274
00:16:31,484 --> 00:16:32,284
and high-level.

275
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:33,368
Right for me.

276
00:16:39,235 --> 00:16:39,964
Ms. Tang,

277
00:16:40,257 --> 00:16:41,404
we have various

278
00:16:41,448 --> 00:16:42,186
kinds of courses here.

279
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:43,537
Ballroom Dancing.

280
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,373
Samba.

281
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:45,070
Rumba.

282
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:45,960
Latin dance.

283
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,813
Ballet, belly dance.

284
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:50,897
I want the one that

285
00:16:50,942 --> 00:16:51,840
looks particularly noble.

286
00:16:51,893 --> 00:16:52,940
Very graceful.

287
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:54,497
Very difficult.

288
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,813
The kind that few people can learn.

289
00:16:57,570 --> 00:16:58,186
Don't you have?

290
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,413
Ballet?

291
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:01,066
Ballet?

292
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,355
The most expensive one.

293
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:04,648
I know.

294
00:17:05,048 --> 00:17:05,964
You must think that

295
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:07,847
I have long hands and feet.

296
00:17:07,928 --> 00:17:08,640
Long neck as well.

297
00:17:08,763 --> 00:17:10,301
Especially like a noble white swan,

298
00:17:10,346 --> 00:17:10,800
right?

299
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:13,724
That's what my dad always says about me.

300
00:17:14,808 --> 00:17:16,000
Yes, yes, Ms. Tang.

301
00:17:16,933 --> 00:17:18,071
Don't call me Ms. Tang.

302
00:17:18,115 --> 00:17:18,737
Too polite.

303
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,594
Can I call you

304
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:21,803
Tangtang?

305
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,167
Tangtang, not Pingping.

306
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,044
I like you so much.

307
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,644
What's your name?

308
00:17:27,696 --> 00:17:28,559
My surname is Ling.

309
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,786
Ling?

310
00:17:30,044 --> 00:17:31,582
I like you more.

311
00:17:33,315 --> 00:17:34,960
Ms. Tang, no, Tangtang.

312
00:17:35,084 --> 00:17:36,675
You're making me feel shy.

313
00:17:36,871 --> 00:17:37,777
We have times card,

314
00:17:37,911 --> 00:17:39,386
monthly card, quarterly card, and annual card.

315
00:17:39,431 --> 00:17:40,284
VIP cards as well.

316
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,017
Would you like to try

317
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,924
an experience class?

318
00:17:42,968 --> 00:17:44,266
Just get me an annually card.

319
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,991
The VIP card, the most expensive one.

320
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,728
I like you, too.

321
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,293
Me too.

322
00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:57,742
Besides,

323
00:17:58,053 --> 00:17:59,840
I've asked the Design Dept to

324
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,613
try to adjust

325
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,130
the production technology of the main series.

326
00:18:02,222 --> 00:18:03,155
The results should come out

327
00:18:03,217 --> 00:18:03,813
in a few days.

328
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:05,902
Good.

329
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,315
I got an appointment.

330
00:18:07,404 --> 00:18:08,053
You go first.

331
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,893
Don't drink too much.

332
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,226
What are you looking at?

333
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:34,631
Nothing.

334
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,360
How is the partnership

335
00:18:39,813 --> 00:18:41,208
between Ms. Qin and Deer Sing?

336
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:44,213
I'll take care of that.

337
00:18:45,271 --> 00:18:46,631
I have things to do, bye.

338
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,804
What makes you so happy?

339
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,484
The company's financial statements.

340
00:19:16,097 --> 00:19:17,550
At downstairs,

341
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:18,622
I ran into Simon.

342
00:19:20,097 --> 00:19:21,315
He came back with me.

343
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:22,666
And he goes out for something.

344
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:26,835
Well,

345
00:19:28,551 --> 00:19:29,928
Ms. Qin said last time that

346
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,453
she and Lu Yiyao had a blind date.

347
00:19:32,515 --> 00:19:33,200
You were there as well.

348
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,848
Why you suddenly asked that?

349
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:40,986
Nothing, I'm curious.

350
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,386
How should I say that.

351
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,706
It's not like I was there when they

352
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:48,346
went on a blind date,

353
00:19:48,426 --> 00:19:49,340
To be precise,

354
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,102
at all his blind dates,

355
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:51,902
I was present.

356
00:19:52,488 --> 00:19:53,742
I was young at that time.

357
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,470
My dad was busy with his business.

358
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:56,675
He let my uncle take care of me.

359
00:19:56,746 --> 00:19:57,582
But my uncle was

360
00:19:57,608 --> 00:19:58,328
young as well.

361
00:19:58,675 --> 00:20:00,000
He was busy with the company stuff

362
00:20:00,053 --> 00:20:00,940
and he had to take care of me.

363
00:20:00,977 --> 00:20:02,300
He had no time to start a relationship.

364
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,582
So he had to have blind date.

365
00:20:05,297 --> 00:20:06,640
If I hadn't helped him

366
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,888
deal with those girls in his blind dates,

367
00:20:09,013 --> 00:20:09,742
Simon would have

368
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,951
suffered a lot.

369
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,133
He really listens to you.

370
00:20:17,297 --> 00:20:18,380
How to put it.

371
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,128
Sometimes, only a woman

372
00:20:19,164 --> 00:20:20,417
can see through

373
00:20:20,471 --> 00:20:21,570
another woman more clearly.

374
00:20:21,608 --> 00:20:22,560
As long as I don't like her,

375
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:23,573
Simon won't like her.

376
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,857
How about you?

377
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:28,986
Do you like him?

378
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,737
Of course.

379
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:33,306
I prefer the way Simon disciplines me than that of my dad.

380
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,000
Back then,

381
00:20:34,044 --> 00:20:35,160
he even took me to have a drink.

382
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,346
I think...

383
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,568
What's the matter?

384
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,617
I think we've lived here long enough.

385
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,760
Let's move back to the apartment tomorrow.

386
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,235
It's kind of

387
00:20:53,697 --> 00:20:54,497
the restart of the contract.

388
00:20:54,684 --> 00:20:55,413
A new start.

389
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,355
Really?

390
00:20:59,333 --> 00:20:59,893
You don't want to?

391
00:21:02,382 --> 00:21:02,977
Move...

392
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:04,524
Whether to move or not,

393
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:05,475
I'm fine with both.

394
00:21:06,328 --> 00:21:07,422
Well...

395
00:21:07,555 --> 00:21:08,426
Let's move.

396
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,017
I'm gonna go pack my stuff.

397
00:21:10,071 --> 00:21:10,915
Tell my dad.

398
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,711
Newlyweds.

399
00:21:20,844 --> 00:21:22,177
Only us two.

400
00:21:33,617 --> 00:21:34,160
Go see them off?

401
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,057
No?

402
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,235
Go.

403
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,657
Why can't stay here?

404
00:21:41,128 --> 00:21:43,111
You live here, I offer you meals.

405
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,533
Don't have to pay the rent.

406
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,657
Do we bother you two?

407
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,302
No.

408
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,017
Yes.

409
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,208
No.

410
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:54,995
It's good for you to go back.

411
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,906
It's more convenient for you two.

412
00:21:57,137 --> 00:21:57,768
Hurry up.

413
00:21:58,230 --> 00:21:59,502
I'm waiting for your good news.

414
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:01,617
Aunt Yang, thank you for your lucky words.

415
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:04,453
Well...

416
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:05,475
Where's Mr. Lu?

417
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:07,271
Where's your dad?

418
00:22:07,697 --> 00:22:08,782
How do I know?

419
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,480
I go to see him.

420
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,888
Take care.

421
00:22:13,155 --> 00:22:13,466
Okay.

422
00:22:13,484 --> 00:22:14,684
Come back for meal sometime.

423
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,880
Sis,

424
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,515
remember to come home often.

425
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:21,057
Fangning,

426
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,560
take care of yourself.

427
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,053
Don't worry.

428
00:22:24,248 --> 00:22:25,217
Over these years,

429
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,791
I just lived alone.

430
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,573
And now she has me.

431
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,271
I'll take good care of Fangning.

432
00:23:00,391 --> 00:23:01,253
Where's she?

433
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,075
-What?
-Where's she?

434
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:04,764
Fangning?

435
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,204
She has left for a while.

436
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,360
They've left?

437
00:23:09,404 --> 00:23:10,257
Wonderful sunshine.

438
00:23:10,328 --> 00:23:10,888
Gao,

439
00:23:10,915 --> 00:23:12,300
just air the quilts.

440
00:23:12,577 --> 00:23:13,306
Wait, wait.

441
00:23:13,315 --> 00:23:13,946
Wait.

442
00:23:15,146 --> 00:23:16,702
Am I that unreasonable?

443
00:23:18,746 --> 00:23:20,293
No, no.

444
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,595
The old saying is right.

445
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,431
A grown girl can't be kept at home.

446
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:31,333
If you insist on keeping her,

447
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,420
she'll hate you.

448
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,520
That's right.

449
00:23:54,222 --> 00:23:55,893
Go inside. What are you thinking about?

450
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,688
The CEO and Her Doctor.

451
00:23:58,035 --> 00:23:59,351
Sweet holiday.

452
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,537
It's just a title.

453
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:07,884
My recent leisure hobby.

454
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,400
The untidiness you saw

455
00:24:28,462 --> 00:24:29,724
when you came to my house before

456
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,460
was exceptional.

457
00:24:30,657 --> 00:24:31,570
My house is usually

458
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,420
so clean like this.

459
00:24:33,404 --> 00:24:35,013
I cleaned it the day before yesterday.

460
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,133
Really?

461
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,591
When you came the day before yesterday,

462
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,933
did you find that

463
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,826
there was nothing to be cleaned?

464
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,417
Pretty much the same as now, right?

465
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:46,400
I'll put the luggage away.

466
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:53,360
What are you doing?

467
00:24:54,231 --> 00:24:56,053
Are you really staying in the guest room?

468
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,088
Or what?

469
00:24:59,404 --> 00:24:59,786
No.

470
00:25:00,302 --> 00:25:01,530
If other guests

471
00:25:01,555 --> 00:25:02,453
come to our home,

472
00:25:02,622 --> 00:25:03,804
they'll find out.

473
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,644
Do you have many guests?

474
00:25:07,217 --> 00:25:08,817
Not that many.

475
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,444
If they really come,

476
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,737
just tidy up a little.

477
00:25:13,448 --> 00:25:14,417
My work schedule

478
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,186
is different from your schedule.

479
00:25:16,435 --> 00:25:17,511
Don't disturb each other.

480
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,635
Your sleep can be improved then.

481
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:21,626
I'd like to be disturbed by you.

482
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,120
What are you doing?

483
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,711
I'm putting my luggage.

484
00:25:29,573 --> 00:25:30,035
You...

485
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,346
Put it somewhere else.

486
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:35,244
Why?

487
00:25:37,555 --> 00:25:38,391
No reason.

488
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,808
Is there anything in here?

489
00:25:48,195 --> 00:25:49,164
Nothing.

490
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:50,480
Why can't I put it in?

491
00:25:54,257 --> 00:25:55,804
You can't keep stopping me.

492
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,386
Where else can I put it?

493
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,808
You...

494
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,257
You really want to open it?

495
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,888
Or what?

496
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,000
Are you sure?

497
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:04,240
Okay.

498
00:26:04,577 --> 00:26:05,902
Open it if you want.

499
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,457
I've warned you anyway.

500
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:21,973
You insisted on it.

501
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,373
He looks so good even when folding clothes.

502
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,417
Living in two rooms, never mind.

503
00:26:42,995 --> 00:26:44,000
We're married.

504
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,102
It's just a matter of time.

505
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,355
Done?

506
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,057
Let's go buy something in the supermarket later.

507
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,720
This...

508
00:26:55,893 --> 00:26:56,746
This place,

509
00:26:57,004 --> 00:26:58,426
I've lived here alone for long.

510
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,013
So I only prepared the daily necessities for myself.

511
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:04,080
This is kinda like our new home.

512
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,822
How about replacing all with new ones?

513
00:27:07,635 --> 00:27:08,062
Fangning,

514
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,773
I have one thing to tell you.

515
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:13,520
What's the matter?

516
00:27:14,328 --> 00:27:16,044
Living here, all the living expenses,

517
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,031
property management fee,

518
00:27:17,315 --> 00:27:18,124
utility bills,

519
00:27:18,506 --> 00:27:19,680
and the cost of hiring a helper...

520
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:22,480
This house is mine.

521
00:27:22,524 --> 00:27:24,000
You don't have to worry about that.

522
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,786
Didn't you say it's our new home?

523
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,231
Although our marriage is a contract,

524
00:27:30,942 --> 00:27:32,248
the marriage license is real.

525
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,355
And we're living together.

526
00:27:35,866 --> 00:27:37,324
Even if ordinary people live together,

527
00:27:37,777 --> 00:27:38,960
they'll share the expenses as well.

528
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,924
Let alone that

529
00:27:41,271 --> 00:27:42,142
I need to take the responsibility

530
00:27:42,257 --> 00:27:43,484
of a good husband.

531
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,008
So in the future, these fees,

532
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,515
I'll give it to you on time every month.

533
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,924
I even got someone

534
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,471
to keep me.

535
00:27:57,226 --> 00:27:57,937
Thank you.

536
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,973
Although I know that it sounds like

537
00:28:08,764 --> 00:28:09,982
I'm overreaching myself,

538
00:28:10,328 --> 00:28:11,235
you don't lack of money.

539
00:28:11,537 --> 00:28:12,560
What's wrong with that?

540
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,115
Someone wants to support me.

541
00:28:14,168 --> 00:28:15,084
That's great.

542
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,755
Besides, you're my husband.

543
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:17,973
Enough,

544
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:19,020
let's go

545
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,222
Let's go out.

546
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:21,724
There's one more thing.

547
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,608
I'll go on business tomorrow.

548
00:28:25,928 --> 00:28:26,648
Go on business?

549
00:28:31,608 --> 00:28:32,391
Where are you going?

550
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:32,844
I mean...

551
00:28:32,986 --> 00:28:34,140
You just got married.

552
00:28:34,168 --> 00:28:35,377
Why you're asked to go on business?

553
00:28:39,502 --> 00:28:39,866
Okay...

554
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,217
A business trip.

555
00:28:42,195 --> 00:28:43,315
For the job.

556
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:44,720
I can understand that.

557
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,462
I can take care of myself.

558
00:28:47,164 --> 00:28:47,804
How long?

559
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:48,515
Pretty fast.

560
00:28:49,057 --> 00:28:49,644
Just three days.

561
00:28:49,822 --> 00:28:50,506
Three days?

562
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:53,608
Three days is good.

563
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,342
Just three days.

564
00:28:57,004 --> 00:28:57,680
Go for it.

565
00:28:59,351 --> 00:29:00,711
After three days,

566
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,542
you'll be mine finally.

567
00:29:15,191 --> 00:29:16,684
You can leave.

568
00:29:17,493 --> 00:29:18,080
Why do these

569
00:29:18,106 --> 00:29:19,680
useless things?

570
00:29:56,675 --> 00:29:57,875
When you're in a bad mood,

571
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,111
drink some milk.

572
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,497
Tyrosine can help ease your mood.

573
00:30:04,008 --> 00:30:06,302
Didn't you go to the airport?

574
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,311
When I got to the airport just now,

575
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:10,880
I found I had forgot to ask you to drink milk

576
00:30:11,653 --> 00:30:13,120
and I was worried you wouldn't have breakfast.

577
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,977
So I brought it to you.

578
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,377
Lu Fangning.

579
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,737
How can you imagine such a shameful scene?

580
00:30:39,511 --> 00:30:40,311
Be calm.

581
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:42,568
Ms. Lu.

582
00:30:42,613 --> 00:30:43,813
Tomorrow's meeting with Mr. Zhang.

583
00:30:43,928 --> 00:30:44,560
I'll cancel it.

584
00:30:44,924 --> 00:30:45,760
Cancel it first.

585
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:46,266
Okay.

586
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,977
It's getting worse.

587
00:30:57,368 --> 00:30:58,808
Why is he in the office

588
00:30:58,808 --> 00:31:00,000
folding the clothes?

589
00:31:07,013 --> 00:31:08,088
It turns out that I also like

590
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,511
it happens in the office.

591
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:15,528
This...

592
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:18,897
Ms. Lu.

593
00:31:23,022 --> 00:31:23,484
Ms. Lu.

594
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,146
Ms. Lu.

595
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,800
I can't think of him anymore.

596
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,382
I gotta be absorbed in work.

597
00:31:33,297 --> 00:31:33,795
Let's go

598
00:31:35,564 --> 00:31:36,088
to the mall.

599
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,271
Now?

600
00:31:41,964 --> 00:31:44,231
Slow down. I'm off today.

601
00:31:44,266 --> 00:31:45,893
I know you're off today.

602
00:31:46,088 --> 00:31:47,466
So I asked you to come here.

603
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,075
I'll buy a lot of furniture soon.

604
00:31:49,111 --> 00:31:49,991
Who can help me?

605
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,084
Remember this.

606
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,968
Respect the teacher,

607
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,533
don't just say it.

608
00:31:54,835 --> 00:31:55,546
Okay, okay.

609
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,170
Put it into action.

610
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,026
Mr. Yu,

611
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:01,075
there are so many furniture markets in the city.

612
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,622
Why you choose this one?

613
00:32:02,835 --> 00:32:03,804
In our city,

614
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:05,840
this is the largest, and the most upscale one

615
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:06,595
with a wide range.

616
00:32:06,711 --> 00:32:07,893
Why can't I come?

617
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,893
Do you want to

618
00:32:11,937 --> 00:32:13,244
take advantage of Ling Rui?

619
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,377
What are you talking about?

620
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,760
Even if his wife runs a furniture company,

621
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,617
such a big furniture mall,

622
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,093
can it all be hers?

623
00:32:21,884 --> 00:32:22,897
What else do you think?

624
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,115
It really belongs to her.

625
00:32:26,728 --> 00:32:28,440
I've already seen through

626
00:32:28,497 --> 00:32:29,653
what you're thinking.

627
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,013
Aren't I smart?

628
00:32:35,191 --> 00:32:36,800
No wonder she was so overwhelming

629
00:32:36,862 --> 00:32:38,142
at the reunion that day.

630
00:32:38,515 --> 00:32:39,617
So she is really wealthy.

631
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:42,435
She didn't act in front of us?

632
00:32:42,862 --> 00:32:44,257
Of course.

633
00:32:47,057 --> 00:32:47,884
She's so rich,

634
00:32:48,364 --> 00:32:49,235
how she treats Ling Rui?

635
00:32:49,697 --> 00:32:51,804
Will she bully him?

636
00:32:52,515 --> 00:32:53,866
I heard about it on the news...

637
00:32:53,964 --> 00:32:54,444
Mr. Yu, wait.

638
00:32:54,471 --> 00:32:55,210
Rich people are all...

639
00:32:55,262 --> 00:32:56,400
You love gossip so much.

640
00:32:56,595 --> 00:32:57,608
Just ask her.

641
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,097
Fangning.

642
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,920
Well... This is Mr. Yu,

643
00:33:02,168 --> 00:33:03,170
Ling Rui's head teacher.

644
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,506
-Hello, Mr. Yu.
-Hello.

645
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,608
Well, you and Ling Rui...

646
00:33:05,644 --> 00:33:06,310
Don't mention him.

647
00:33:09,706 --> 00:33:11,324
No, I... I mean

648
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:12,613
it's working time.

649
00:33:12,684 --> 00:33:14,030
My relationship with him is private.

650
00:33:14,053 --> 00:33:15,120
Work makes me happy.

651
00:33:15,528 --> 00:33:16,577
Enjoy yourselves here.

652
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:18,088
See you, Mr. Yu.

653
00:33:22,657 --> 00:33:23,528
Why I mentioned Ling Rui,

654
00:33:23,555 --> 00:33:24,648
she changed like that?

655
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,533
Ling Rui is on a business trip.

656
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,346
They argued?

657
00:33:31,324 --> 00:33:32,170
Fangning! Fangning.

658
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:33,866
Lu.

659
00:33:39,591 --> 00:33:41,306
Mr. Yu, Peng Bo.

660
00:33:41,733 --> 00:33:42,995
I don't know

661
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,648
what do you want to talk to me?

662
00:33:49,662 --> 00:33:51,484
Here is the thing...

663
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,737
Today,

664
00:33:52,871 --> 00:33:55,146
I came here to shop around.

665
00:33:55,688 --> 00:33:56,488
By the way,

666
00:33:56,746 --> 00:33:57,804
I also want to know

667
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,395
the situation of my students.

668
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,400
Ling...

669
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,324
After the reunion that day,

670
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:06,800
was he angry?

671
00:34:08,364 --> 00:34:09,120
Mr. Yu.

672
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,471
Aren't you Ling Rui's

673
00:34:10,505 --> 00:34:11,732
most valued teacher?

674
00:34:11,795 --> 00:34:13,057
You should know him well.

675
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,576
How would he be angry?

676
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,937
He said that

677
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:18,791
"these

678
00:34:18,995 --> 00:34:20,791
are all part of my life,

679
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,791
I don't need to avoid."

680
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:26,647
Didn't he say anything else?

681
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,524
Lu.

682
00:34:33,324 --> 00:34:36,053
Ling Rui is good in every way,

683
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:37,982
expect one thing.

684
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:39,528
He is softhearted,

685
00:34:40,132 --> 00:34:40,799
not talkative.

686
00:34:41,306 --> 00:34:42,275
And too sensible.

687
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,497
He won't say anything.

688
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,013
Don't get angry.

689
00:34:47,475 --> 00:34:48,408
Be tolerant of him,

690
00:34:49,536 --> 00:34:49,972
okay?

691
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:54,639
Ling Rui has been

692
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,283
suffering since he was a kid.

693
00:34:57,377 --> 00:34:58,088
He...

694
00:34:58,951 --> 00:35:00,302
Since elementary school,

695
00:35:00,737 --> 00:35:01,920
every day after school,

696
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,568
he needed to go to the hospital to see his father.

697
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,346
His father was ill in hospital.

698
00:35:07,128 --> 00:35:09,173
And his family was disadvantaged.

699
00:35:09,831 --> 00:35:11,946
He couldn't pay additional fees for meals.

700
00:35:13,057 --> 00:35:13,653
So I

701
00:35:14,248 --> 00:35:15,573
took extra breads left

702
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,146
by other students to him.

703
00:35:18,337 --> 00:35:19,191
I didn't expect that

704
00:35:19,368 --> 00:35:22,222
he only ate that every day.

705
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:27,120
He was so sensible.

706
00:35:28,106 --> 00:35:29,315
Get her sympathy?

707
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,640
Nice trick.

708
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,355
That's not all.

709
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,755
There are more?

710
00:35:35,155 --> 00:35:36,008
In high school,

711
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,262
Ling Rui spent only a year and a half

712
00:35:37,315 --> 00:35:38,240
with his classmates.

713
00:35:38,435 --> 00:35:39,280
Do you know why?

714
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:40,791
Why?

715
00:35:42,444 --> 00:35:43,270
Well.

716
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:44,817
When he was a child,

717
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,044
his dad passed away

718
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,457
because of pancreatic cancer.

719
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,084
So from then on,

720
00:35:49,884 --> 00:35:51,048
his mother got hit.

721
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,062
She got ill then.

722
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,222
When he was of grade two in high school,

723
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,040
his mother's illness

724
00:35:55,075 --> 00:35:56,106
was getting worse and worse.

725
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,760
Ling Rui didn't tell anyone

726
00:35:57,786 --> 00:35:58,760
and took his mother

727
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,751
back to his hometown

728
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,613
to convalesce.

729
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,880
When the college entrance exam came,

730
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:04,942
he just got admitted to

731
00:36:05,066 --> 00:36:06,355
the national key medical college.

732
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:07,688
So I think that

733
00:36:08,631 --> 00:36:09,493
Ling Rui

734
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,120
is really awesome.

735
00:36:14,053 --> 00:36:14,942
Extraordinary.

736
00:36:19,706 --> 00:36:20,880
Why did you

737
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,008
suddenly tell me this?

738
00:36:22,551 --> 00:36:24,142
Well... We think...

739
00:36:24,195 --> 00:36:24,910
We don't want you to

740
00:36:24,951 --> 00:36:25,875
-quarrel with Ling Rui.
-Yes, yes.

741
00:36:25,928 --> 00:36:26,497
Exactly.

742
00:36:26,542 --> 00:36:27,680
How would I quarrel with Ling Rui?

743
00:36:27,848 --> 00:36:28,960
Ling Rui is so good.

744
00:36:29,244 --> 00:36:31,128
Well, I'll go to work.

745
00:36:32,515 --> 00:36:33,262
Mr. Yu,

746
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:35,253
are you here to buy furniture?

747
00:36:35,342 --> 00:36:35,822
Yes.

748
00:36:36,506 --> 00:36:38,453
Don't pay. Remember, don't pay.

749
00:36:38,702 --> 00:36:39,182
But...

750
00:36:40,168 --> 00:36:40,604
Fangning,

751
00:36:40,684 --> 00:36:41,946
if there's something between you two,

752
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:42,780
you can always tell me,

753
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,210
right?

754
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:44,257
I stand on your side.

755
00:36:44,675 --> 00:36:45,973
Can you send me a set of furniture?

756
00:36:59,262 --> 00:36:59,813
Hello,

757
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,013
what can I do for you?

758
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,080
Are you all right, miss?

759
00:37:25,084 --> 00:37:25,720
Pack me all your

760
00:37:25,751 --> 00:37:26,780
best kinds of breads

761
00:37:26,835 --> 00:37:27,690
in your shop.

762
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:28,330
No.

763
00:37:29,031 --> 00:37:29,973
All kinds of bread.

764
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,848
One for each kind, all of them.

765
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,604
Are you sure?

766
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:35,848
Yes.

767
00:37:53,528 --> 00:37:54,160
Teacher,

768
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,773
I think there's something wrong with these moves.

769
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,431
Look,

770
00:37:57,928 --> 00:37:59,946
I have long hands, feet and neck.

771
00:38:00,435 --> 00:38:01,288
Those basic exercises

772
00:38:01,333 --> 00:38:02,000
will block me from

773
00:38:02,044 --> 00:38:02,933
doing elegant moves.

774
00:38:03,226 --> 00:38:04,320
Only the most graceful moves

775
00:38:04,364 --> 00:38:05,093
are suitable for me.

776
00:38:05,475 --> 00:38:06,604
I want the graceful moves.

777
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,706
Then...

778
00:38:08,524 --> 00:38:09,520
Let me think.

779
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,120
Yes, yes, think about it.

780
00:38:11,182 --> 00:38:11,697
Think about it.

781
00:38:12,506 --> 00:38:13,706
I'll take a break.

782
00:38:14,142 --> 00:38:15,050
Okay, okay.

783
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,408
I'll go out for a minute.

784
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,151
Bye.

785
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:33,626
Lu Fangning,

786
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,888
wait for me.

787
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,453
In this area,

788
00:38:36,595 --> 00:38:37,528
I will definitely defeat you.

789
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,248
Lu Fangyu?

790
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,297
What's he doing here?

791
00:38:52,355 --> 00:38:52,871
Okay,

792
00:38:53,128 --> 00:38:54,062
our break is over.

793
00:38:54,106 --> 00:38:54,897
Let's get started.

794
00:38:55,457 --> 00:38:56,160
Feet position,

795
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,888
your hand, ready.

796
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:00,631
Keep your eyes straight ahead.

797
00:39:00,631 --> 00:39:02,275
Look at yourself in the mirror.

798
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,302
Good. Five, six, seven, eight.

799
00:39:06,826 --> 00:39:09,084
One, two, three, four.

800
00:39:09,377 --> 00:39:11,964
Five, six, seven, eight.

801
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,386
Good, keep it.

802
00:39:13,475 --> 00:39:14,435
What are you doing?

803
00:39:15,155 --> 00:39:16,124
You scared me to death.

804
00:39:16,497 --> 00:39:17,297
How's that?

805
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,791
How's teacher Liu doing?

806
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,013
Come here, come.

807
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,670
Come here, let me...

808
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,897
Let me tell you something.

809
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,408
It's okay. Let's talk here.

810
00:39:33,742 --> 00:39:34,808
That...

811
00:39:36,533 --> 00:39:37,431
Tangtang.

812
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,426
Actually, our faculty here are...

813
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,946
Actually...

814
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,275
Very strong.

815
00:39:45,164 --> 00:39:46,410
Are you trying to change a teacher for me?

816
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,533
You know it?

817
00:39:49,866 --> 00:39:51,570
That teacher is too weak in her profession.

818
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:52,888
I'll change her anyway.

819
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:55,022
I can recommend one for you.

820
00:39:55,057 --> 00:39:55,570
How's that?

821
00:39:55,822 --> 00:39:57,057
Although he's a man,

822
00:39:57,315 --> 00:39:59,457
teacher Lu teaches very well.

823
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:00,746
A man?

824
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:01,831
Teacher Lu?

825
00:40:02,755 --> 00:40:04,764
Tangtang, to be frank with you.

826
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,680
Although he is

827
00:40:05,733 --> 00:40:07,182
my nephew's wife's brother.

828
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:08,880
But that's not why

829
00:40:08,924 --> 00:40:10,000
I recommended him.

830
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,693
He's one of the best teachers here.

831
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,648
And he is a nice person.

832
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:15,875
When I had trouble,

833
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,697
he lent me money without hesitation.

834
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,564
Where can we find such a good man?

835
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:24,800
Is your nephew surnamed Ling?

836
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:27,848
Called Ling Rui?

837
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,995
You know him?

838
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,720
Lower your voice.

839
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:33,822
What's wrong?

840
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:51,324
Wow.

841
00:40:51,706 --> 00:40:53,920
I was wondering what smells go good?

842
00:40:55,084 --> 00:40:56,488
It turns out our Ms. Cai

843
00:40:56,524 --> 00:40:58,210
is eating fancy food.

844
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,604
It's not even the end of the month.

845
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,502
You can tell me if you run out of money.

846
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:06,711
You'll lend me some?

847
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:10,017
No.

848
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:16,053
Hum.

849
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,671
It tastes so bad.

850
00:41:20,524 --> 00:41:22,968
Why is life so hard?

851
00:41:26,604 --> 00:41:28,453
Hello, Cai Siyu, Planning Dept.

852
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,346
I knew you're working overtime.

853
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,537
Come to my office.

854
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,595
I'll treat you to dinner.

855
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,266
Okay, coming.
