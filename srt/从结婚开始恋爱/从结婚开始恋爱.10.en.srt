1
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,564
Begin Again

2
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,960
Episode 10

3
00:01:54,275 --> 00:01:55,760
What a "perfect" timing.

4
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,866
She chose today to have dinner with us.

5
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:00,720
How am I supposed to face Ling Rui?

6
00:02:22,328 --> 00:02:23,413
Today is just...

7
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,191
Just having a dinner.

8
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,422
It's kind of a job.

9
00:02:30,444 --> 00:02:31,564
Qin Yujiang,

10
00:02:31,884 --> 00:02:33,662
the ex-fiancee of Simon,

11
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,564
is a very important partner

12
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:36,328
for Deer Sing.

13
00:02:36,728 --> 00:02:38,355
So today's dinner

14
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,982
is kind of important to me.

15
00:02:41,102 --> 00:02:41,964
OK.

16
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:44,568
Sorry to bother you

17
00:02:44,773 --> 00:02:46,951
to come have this dinner with me.

18
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:48,195
It's alright.

19
00:02:49,822 --> 00:02:50,746
-Um...
-Um...

20
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:52,346
You go first.

21
00:02:55,102 --> 00:02:56,471
Shall we go inside?

22
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:58,755
That's what I was gonna say.

23
00:02:58,755 --> 00:02:59,297
Let's go.

24
00:02:59,635 --> 00:03:00,220
OK.

25
00:03:01,884 --> 00:03:02,880
Sis Yujiang.

26
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,066
I've waited for you.

27
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:06,142
Sorry to keep you waiting.

28
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:08,088
Thanks.

29
00:03:10,551 --> 00:03:12,560
This is my husband, Ling Rui.

30
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,106
Hello, sis Yujiang.

31
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:16,106
You are indeed a good match.

32
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:18,008
Fangning, it's been a while since the last time

33
00:03:18,062 --> 00:03:18,790
we took picture together.

34
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,555
Let's take a picture.

35
00:03:20,035 --> 00:03:20,620
Sure.

36
00:03:21,573 --> 00:03:22,062
OK.

37
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:34,151
-Come on in. This way.
-Alright.

38
00:03:43,768 --> 00:03:44,977
Ling Rui looks good.

39
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,577
Fangning surely has a good taste.

40
00:03:47,946 --> 00:03:49,324
Come on. Just take a seat.

41
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,380
Nice arrangement.

42
00:03:51,386 --> 00:03:51,804
Here.

43
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,000
Sis Yujiang.

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,186
What's taking Simon so long?

45
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,720
Do I have to invite him?

46
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:04,764
Just kidding.

47
00:04:04,764 --> 00:04:05,635
He'll be here in a minute.

48
00:04:06,408 --> 00:04:07,404
How's it going?

49
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:09,840
Quite good.

50
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:12,080
Look, he just called.

51
00:04:14,746 --> 00:04:15,208
Yujiang.

52
00:04:15,386 --> 00:04:16,026
What do you want?

53
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:17,555
Why do you invite Fangning?

54
00:04:18,986 --> 00:04:19,751
Simon,

55
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:21,300
we're all here.

56
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,622
We're waiting for you now. Hurry up.

57
00:04:22,622 --> 00:04:23,733
Don't keep us waiting here.

58
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:26,862
Although I didn't give you a heads up,

59
00:04:26,888 --> 00:04:28,320
you don't have to be so anxious.

60
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:30,017
Fangning and Ling Rui have arrived.

61
00:04:30,017 --> 00:04:31,217
You're the last one. Hurry up.

62
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:38,400
He has become

63
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,697
more and more impatient now.

64
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:45,564
Sis Yujiang, I'm sorry,

65
00:04:46,151 --> 00:04:47,244
but I have to ask

66
00:04:47,795 --> 00:04:50,666
you and Simon are really fine?

67
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,471
Because I think that

68
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,311
it'll be more appropriate for us two to discuss about

69
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,662
the cooperation between
Deer Sing and Jiang Cheng.

70
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,128
I had a good talk with Yiyao.

71
00:04:57,173 --> 00:04:58,684
Why would you think so?

72
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,697
Don't worry.

73
00:04:59,848 --> 00:05:00,906
Our partnership will work.

74
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,377
You can sit here. I'll open the wine

75
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,000
and get it prepared.

76
00:05:04,275 --> 00:05:05,093
Thanks.

77
00:05:12,017 --> 00:05:13,315
What did she mean by that?

78
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:16,560
It's appropriate? It will work?

79
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:18,097
That sounds so weird.

80
00:05:19,404 --> 00:05:21,582
It's not like they're back together.

81
00:05:22,142 --> 00:05:23,111
Could it be

82
00:05:24,195 --> 00:05:25,964
settling the old matters?

83
00:05:36,053 --> 00:05:37,377
How is this? Do you guys like it?

84
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:41,742
Your helper has great cooking skills.

85
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:43,413
Come here anytime if you like.

86
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,466
You are late.

87
00:05:49,795 --> 00:05:50,604
Uncle.

88
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:52,337
You need to drink for punishment.

89
00:05:54,373 --> 00:05:55,235
Come sit down.

90
00:05:58,213 --> 00:05:59,306
I'll tell you what.

91
00:05:59,457 --> 00:06:00,648
Fangning is really fortunate

92
00:06:01,022 --> 00:06:02,355
to meet someone like Ling Rui.

93
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,111
What took you so long?

94
00:06:12,977 --> 00:06:14,782
Come on. Welcome you all,

95
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:16,364
especially Dr. Ling.

96
00:06:18,515 --> 00:06:19,253
Uncle?

97
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:25,457
Fangning, you need to drive.

98
00:06:25,573 --> 00:06:26,030
You can't drink.

99
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,617
-I'll drink for you.
-You can drive too.

100
00:06:28,462 --> 00:06:29,217
I have night blindness.

101
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:30,542
You're night blind?

102
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,373
Yeah, exactly.

103
00:06:33,404 --> 00:06:34,106
He's night blind.

104
00:06:35,457 --> 00:06:35,920
Cheers.

105
00:06:36,844 --> 00:06:37,351
Uncle.

106
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,204
Thank you for your hospitality.

107
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:43,390
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

108
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:47,466
I remember the last time

109
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:48,542
the three of us got together

110
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,657
was when I was on a blind date.

111
00:06:51,884 --> 00:06:52,660
If Fangning hadn't

112
00:06:52,693 --> 00:06:53,564
cut me some slack that time,

113
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,351
I'm afraid I couldn't have got a chance

114
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:56,506
to be Yiyao's girlfriend.

115
00:07:00,008 --> 00:07:00,640
Dr. Ling,

116
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,124
how did you two meet?

117
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:02,835
Fate.

118
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:07,697
When it's the right time,

119
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:09,466
you'll naturally meet the right person.

120
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,764
We have friends in common.

121
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:14,213
So what do you love about Fangning?

122
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:17,493
He likes me because I'm pretty, gorgeous,

123
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,430
noble, independent,

124
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,737
smart, and very rich.

125
00:07:20,817 --> 00:07:21,368
Of course,

126
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:22,942
it'll take more than a meal time

127
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,666
to talk about all my good points.

128
00:07:24,702 --> 00:07:25,140
Right?

129
00:07:27,262 --> 00:07:28,140
I like her because

130
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,053
sometimes be reckless,

131
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,697
fearless,

132
00:07:32,471 --> 00:07:33,377
unreasonable,

133
00:07:34,097 --> 00:07:34,720
and occasionally

134
00:07:36,071 --> 00:07:37,164
doesn't care about the consequences.

135
00:07:48,746 --> 00:07:49,857
She is like a shooting star

136
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:53,902
who came into my unexceptional life.

137
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:00,880
After hearing your description of me 

138
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,991
why do I feel like 

139
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:03,911
I'm a giant octopus?

140
00:08:05,724 --> 00:08:07,342
How lucky Fangning is.

141
00:08:08,035 --> 00:08:09,306
Well, he's lucky, too.

142
00:08:20,062 --> 00:08:20,960
Didn't you say you liked me

143
00:08:21,004 --> 00:08:22,000
being reckless and unreasonable?

144
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,048
Why are you avoiding me?

145
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,906
I thought you said you're like an octopus.

146
00:08:25,057 --> 00:08:26,700
I don't like octopus.

147
00:08:31,226 --> 00:08:32,008
Fangning.

148
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:34,053
It's healthy to eat more greens.

149
00:08:35,136 --> 00:08:35,936
Thank you.

150
00:08:36,062 --> 00:08:36,702
You're welcome.

151
00:08:40,683 --> 00:08:41,767
I remember that Fangning

152
00:08:41,768 --> 00:08:42,586
never liked to eat

153
00:08:42,586 --> 00:08:43,964
all these vegetables.

154
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,617
She apparently changed her taste

155
00:08:45,671 --> 00:08:46,568
after getting married.

156
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,377
Yiyao.

157
00:08:49,866 --> 00:08:51,155
As her uncle,

158
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,133
I think you should review yourself.

159
00:09:00,035 --> 00:09:01,100
I don't really like the wine today.

160
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,351
Well...

161
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:04,631
Any other wine?

162
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,475
Let's open another bottle.

163
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:20,595
Why are you avoiding me?

164
00:09:22,648 --> 00:09:23,170
I'm not.

165
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:24,791
Yes, you are.

166
00:09:26,257 --> 00:09:26,942
Look, look.

167
00:09:26,977 --> 00:09:27,940
You are avoiding me right now.

168
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,520
I've had enough.

169
00:09:29,573 --> 00:09:31,386
I'm done with playing reserved tonight.

170
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:32,835
Why are you avoiding me?

171
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:34,088
I got it.

172
00:09:34,275 --> 00:09:35,164
It's because that night

173
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:35,980
we didn't make a deal.

174
00:09:36,017 --> 00:09:36,977
So that's why you're avoiding me.

175
00:09:37,182 --> 00:09:37,740
You're clear about that

176
00:09:37,768 --> 00:09:38,780
I would love to make this work.

177
00:09:38,915 --> 00:09:40,293
Let's change the topic, Fangning.

178
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:43,653
Ling Rui.

179
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,751
You're not cut out for coquetry, Lu Fangning.

180
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,635
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

181
00:09:52,195 --> 00:09:53,093
Go to the bathroom?

182
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:55,040
Can you solve the problem then?

183
00:09:56,524 --> 00:09:57,093
Yujiang.

184
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,368
What are you doing?

185
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,755
Can't you see?

186
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,702
Well, think again.

187
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,635
I don't want to think.

188
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,933
You tell me now.

189
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,733
You are always like this.

190
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:09,475
Whatever she asks you to do,

191
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,444
you'll try everything you could.

192
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:11,700
But you never paid even

193
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,146
the slightest attention to
what I asked you to do.

194
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,768
I used to think it was weird.

195
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,457
Now I know.

196
00:10:18,266 --> 00:10:19,130
You're in love with someone

197
00:10:19,155 --> 00:10:20,000
you can't love.

198
00:10:20,008 --> 00:10:20,880
So it doesn't matter

199
00:10:20,924 --> 00:10:22,080
who you get married with.

200
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,333
I just happened to show up,

201
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,410
and happened to be the perfect fit

202
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,195
to become your perfect wife.

203
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,210
You didn't need to pay any effort.

204
00:10:29,884 --> 00:10:30,257
Yujiang.

205
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,453
Lu Yiyao.

206
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:36,560
Although you don't know me,

207
00:10:37,253 --> 00:10:38,604
I know you very well.

208
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,417
Ever since we got engaged,

209
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,373
how many times we should dine together every week,

210
00:10:44,693 --> 00:10:45,493
how many times you should send me flowers,

211
00:10:46,204 --> 00:10:47,386
sent me gifts for our anniversary,

212
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:48,604
and drove me home,

213
00:10:49,422 --> 00:10:51,084
on all these things
you've never made a mistake.

214
00:10:51,555 --> 00:10:52,942
But she's the only reason that

215
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:56,124
you would ignore all the standards recklessly,

216
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,155
and call off the engagement

217
00:10:57,173 --> 00:10:58,350
with a single text message.

218
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:00,417
If it wasn't for Lu Fangning,

219
00:11:01,191 --> 00:11:02,311
would it be anyone else?

220
00:11:07,617 --> 00:11:09,102
So you invited them here today

221
00:11:09,653 --> 00:11:10,835
to tell her all the truth

222
00:11:11,653 --> 00:11:12,968
or to threaten me?

223
00:11:13,857 --> 00:11:14,426
Lu Yiyao,

224
00:11:14,755 --> 00:11:15,902
you underestimated me.

225
00:11:16,728 --> 00:11:17,857
I just wanted to see

226
00:11:17,857 --> 00:11:18,960
how rattled you are.

227
00:11:19,786 --> 00:11:21,110
You didn't let me down.

228
00:11:23,786 --> 00:11:24,820
Ling Rui is indeed a great man.

229
00:11:25,191 --> 00:11:27,040
I thought they were perfect for each other.

230
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:29,128
Well, that's disappointing for you, isn't it?

231
00:11:29,653 --> 00:11:30,391
I'm not disappointed.

232
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,182
I just want her to be happy.

233
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:33,937
No.

234
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:35,010
What you want is

235
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,755
her happiness is brought by you.

236
00:11:40,782 --> 00:11:42,213
I'm the one who made the mistake.

237
00:11:43,102 --> 00:11:44,915
I don't want her involved.

238
00:11:47,395 --> 00:11:47,902
OK.

239
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:49,351
Well, in that case,

240
00:11:49,742 --> 00:11:50,595
I'm gonna give you a chance.

241
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:53,928
I've changed my mind, Lu Yiyao.

242
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,195
You can either make yourself

243
00:11:56,195 --> 00:11:57,271
fall for me truly,

244
00:11:57,928 --> 00:11:59,013
or I'm gonna tell her

245
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,666
the truth why you called off

246
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,751
your engagement ten years ago,

247
00:12:01,964 --> 00:12:02,702
and the person that

248
00:12:02,737 --> 00:12:03,880
you truly loved

249
00:12:04,177 --> 00:12:05,004
deep down.

250
00:12:17,795 --> 00:12:18,568
You're done?

251
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,382
When are we gonna try again?

252
00:12:22,604 --> 00:12:23,884
Lu Fangning, I have to tell you...

253
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,964
Try it again.

254
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,110
Come, try the cake I made.

255
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:32,924
You can make a cake?

256
00:12:32,995 --> 00:12:33,591
Thank you.

257
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,044
But you always seem to like

258
00:12:36,062 --> 00:12:36,850
fruit flavor, right?

259
00:12:37,093 --> 00:12:37,946
It's alright.

260
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,226
I've always wanted to try

261
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:40,115
some other flavors.

262
00:12:40,275 --> 00:12:41,742
When I was a kid, I wanted something new,

263
00:12:41,768 --> 00:12:43,057
so I said that I liked fruit cake.

264
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:44,030
From then on, there had been

265
00:12:44,044 --> 00:12:45,070
only fruit cakes at my home.

266
00:12:45,146 --> 00:12:45,528
No other choice.

267
00:12:48,373 --> 00:12:49,013
Yummy.

268
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:57,004
Fangning.

269
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,382
Didn't you just tell me that

270
00:13:00,826 --> 00:13:01,555
your stomach ached

271
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,048
and you wanted to go home?

272
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:04,995
Me?

273
00:13:06,408 --> 00:13:07,013
My stomach hurts.

274
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,506
You just told me.

275
00:13:09,066 --> 00:13:09,982
Yeah, it hurts.

276
00:13:14,008 --> 00:13:15,173
It just came out of nowhere.

277
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,697
I'm so sorry, sis.

278
00:13:17,742 --> 00:13:18,791
We should probably go first.

279
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:19,351
Simon.

280
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,822
Sorry, sis Yujiang.

281
00:13:22,524 --> 00:13:23,617
Thank you for your hospitality today.

282
00:13:24,177 --> 00:13:24,960
She's always like this.

283
00:13:25,502 --> 00:13:26,382
We're gonna go home.

284
00:13:27,075 --> 00:13:28,462
It's okay. I'll walk you out.

285
00:13:29,102 --> 00:13:30,524
What a pity, all these foods.

286
00:13:31,742 --> 00:13:33,182
-Are you all right?
-All right.

287
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,035
Come on.

288
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,000
You OK?

289
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,435
Watch the steps.

290
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,400
Drive carefully.

291
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,497
Thank you for the dinner.

292
00:13:57,946 --> 00:13:58,515
Ms. Qin.

293
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,008
We may excuse ourselves.

294
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:03,084
Bye.

295
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:04,320
Bye.

296
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,515
Ling Rui.

297
00:14:33,982 --> 00:14:34,488
Ling Rui.

298
00:14:36,604 --> 00:14:37,920
Thank you for today.

299
00:14:39,093 --> 00:14:39,635
It's alright.

300
00:14:40,693 --> 00:14:41,137
Fangning.

301
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:42,640
Uncle.

302
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:44,844
Well, I gotta go.

303
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:46,222
You two get some rest early.

304
00:14:46,968 --> 00:14:47,700
Uncle.

305
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,395
Are you all right?

306
00:14:51,262 --> 00:14:51,902
-I'm fine.
-Fangning.

307
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:54,702
Flies.

308
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:56,968
Are there flies in this season?

309
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,955
There's so much greenery here.

310
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,084
Of course there are flies.

311
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:04,471
Simon.

312
00:15:04,915 --> 00:15:05,564
In short,

313
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,528
I hope you don't take that too personally.

314
00:15:10,986 --> 00:15:11,662
I'm leaving.

315
00:15:12,702 --> 00:15:14,053
You didn't drive here?
Let me drive you home.

316
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:15,191
Alright.

317
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:16,240
-Let's go.
-Fangning.

318
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,968
I have something to talk to you.

319
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:22,577
What is it?

320
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,253
I'll take a cab.

321
00:15:28,248 --> 00:15:28,835
Uh...

322
00:15:30,071 --> 00:15:30,604
Bye.

323
00:15:30,675 --> 00:15:31,742
Be careful, uncle.

324
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,346
What's up?

325
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,444
Let me answer it first.

326
00:15:49,475 --> 00:15:49,884
Hi.

327
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:54,071
Friday?

328
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,368
Reunion?

329
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,213
Will Mr. Yu be there?

330
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:01,324
If he'll be there,

331
00:16:02,151 --> 00:16:03,137
then I'll go, too.

332
00:16:04,577 --> 00:16:05,004
Bye.

333
00:16:10,506 --> 00:16:11,342
So,

334
00:16:12,017 --> 00:16:13,608
what did you want to tell me just now?

335
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:18,284
You look good today.

336
00:16:20,684 --> 00:16:21,422
Thank you.

337
00:16:23,137 --> 00:16:24,160
Nothing else?

338
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:25,164
Nope.

339
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:29,440
Well, I'm leaving then.

340
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:31,484
Drive carefully.

341
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,875
What did he mean?

342
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:39,911
He likes it this way?

343
00:16:43,395 --> 00:16:44,977
Why is he still avoiding me?

344
00:16:46,151 --> 00:16:48,106
Can we talk it through or not?

345
00:16:54,684 --> 00:16:55,297
Avoiding me?

346
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:56,728
Dislike me?

347
00:16:57,466 --> 00:16:58,106
That's impossible.

348
00:16:58,871 --> 00:16:59,902
How could anyone dislike me?

349
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,831
Am I not pretty enough?

350
00:17:04,693 --> 00:17:05,320
I am pretty indeed.

351
00:17:07,465 --> 00:17:08,363
He can't dislike me.

352
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:11,448
I can't try it again.

353
00:17:12,647 --> 00:17:15,119
What does he want then?

354
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,075
Are we gonna continue the contract or not?

355
00:17:18,835 --> 00:17:20,060
Or should I get another man?

356
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,493
Ms. Lu, Ms. Qin from Jiang Cheng Group

357
00:17:31,626 --> 00:17:32,897
insists on meeting with you.

358
00:17:33,164 --> 00:17:34,044
She should be here any minute.

359
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,546
OK.

360
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,560
These prices are okay.

361
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:43,671
This one's too high.

362
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,826
All right,

363
00:17:44,853 --> 00:17:45,822
I'll talk to them again

364
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,306
and try to keep the costs down.

365
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:47,946
Alright.

366
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:52,853
Give me a minute.

367
00:17:56,346 --> 00:17:56,844
Hello.

368
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:00,995
She's going to meet Ms. Lu?

369
00:18:03,511 --> 00:18:04,213
Okay, I got it.

370
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:12,968
Are you all right?

371
00:18:13,555 --> 00:18:14,222
Director Lu.

372
00:18:16,871 --> 00:18:17,377
I'm sorry.

373
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:18,195
Never mind.

374
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:23,235
What's the hurry?

375
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:26,035
What's going on?

376
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,768
You know all about it?

377
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,542
What did she say to you?

378
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,728
No matter what she said,

379
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,417
you can't believe it.

380
00:19:01,048 --> 00:19:01,760
She was just

381
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,013
venting her anger.

382
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:05,120
I didn't expect that

383
00:19:05,546 --> 00:19:06,346
she would tell me not

384
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,502
to prepare the contract.

385
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,528
Nothing else?

386
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,528
What else is there to say?

387
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:19,768
Alright.

388
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:22,577
I'm gonna go talk to her again

389
00:19:23,004 --> 00:19:24,088
and try to make a difference.

390
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:25,155
No need.

391
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,751
I thought Qin Yujiang

392
00:19:27,777 --> 00:19:28,980
was a reasonable businesswoman.

393
00:19:29,111 --> 00:19:30,044
It turned out she's not.

394
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,457
I don't believe that

395
00:19:31,697 --> 00:19:32,355
Infinity has to

396
00:19:32,355 --> 00:19:33,288
rely on their

397
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:33,831
production line.

398
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:35,580
I've got people looking for

399
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,764
a backup manufacturer.

400
00:19:36,871 --> 00:19:37,813
You can rest assured.

401
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,946
It's a little tricky.

402
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,715
But it's better than them disdaining Deer Sing,

403
00:19:41,937 --> 00:19:42,835
and making a fool of you.

404
00:19:45,022 --> 00:19:46,071
All right, I'm leaving then.

405
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:17,057
Yujiang.

406
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,351
What the hell do you want?

407
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:21,271
Lu Yiyao.

408
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,666
Not too much time for you.

409
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:23,493
Hope you can consider my offer.

410
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,044
Or the next time I go to Deer Sing,

411
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:27,706
perhaps it would be something else

412
00:20:28,071 --> 00:20:28,730
that I would tell Lu Fangning,

413
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:29,875
other than calling off the deal.

414
00:20:34,497 --> 00:20:34,951
Hello?

415
00:20:46,408 --> 00:20:47,742
I've checked on the manufacturers

416
00:20:47,742 --> 00:20:49,057
that we could find

417
00:20:49,057 --> 00:20:49,991
in this city and nearby.

418
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:52,106
But the manufacturing process

419
00:20:52,133 --> 00:20:52,888
is special,

420
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,320
all the materials should be consistent with

421
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:54,933
environmental standards,

422
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,871
and subject to strict quality control.

423
00:20:56,942 --> 00:20:58,640
Every product, from material to finished product,

424
00:20:58,648 --> 00:20:59,706
has to go through a rigorous operation of

425
00:20:59,706 --> 00:21:00,391
over a hundred processes.

426
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,044
So a large portion of the manufacturers

427
00:21:02,044 --> 00:21:02,791
find it difficult to finish

428
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:03,555
the manufacturing process

429
00:21:03,608 --> 00:21:04,453
within the expected time.

430
00:21:04,995 --> 00:21:05,848
Two of them

431
00:21:06,044 --> 00:21:07,013
could barely do this,

432
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,231
but their prices

433
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,355
are 20% more expensive than Jiang Cheng's.

434
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,973
How about the factories further?

435
00:21:12,257 --> 00:21:13,520
We've also consulted

436
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,586
the factories in Zhejiang and Jiangsu.

437
00:21:14,968 --> 00:21:16,337
It's just the shipping

438
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,528
is going to bring up our costs.

439
00:21:21,777 --> 00:21:22,844
In this case,

440
00:21:22,844 --> 00:21:23,884
if we forced it into production,

441
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:25,733
Deer Sing's fund flow would become

442
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:26,657
very difficult to handle.

443
00:21:29,537 --> 00:21:30,177
How about this?

444
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,057
Adjust the current design and technology.

445
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,240
But in that case,

446
00:21:34,577 --> 00:21:35,928
Infinity's launch date

447
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:37,244
might have to be postponed.

448
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,800
I don't think it matters.

449
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:40,550
We haven't officially announced

450
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,564
when to launch the product.

451
00:21:41,955 --> 00:21:42,800
But the news

452
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,133
has been spread all over the industry.

453
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,973
It's not a good time to postpone.

454
00:21:46,382 --> 00:21:48,302
Well, here is the thing. At the beginning,

455
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,075
there will be some

456
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:49,964
cash flow pressure.

457
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,031
But by the time

458
00:21:51,031 --> 00:21:52,088
the first batch hits the market,

459
00:21:52,213 --> 00:21:53,528
it'll be better soon enough.

460
00:21:54,257 --> 00:21:54,675
Ms. Lu,

461
00:21:55,164 --> 00:21:56,284
in order to launch Infinity,

462
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:57,475
you've fought so long.

463
00:21:57,955 --> 00:21:59,048
If we postpone now,

464
00:21:59,822 --> 00:22:01,413
I'm afraid that the board of directors

465
00:22:01,413 --> 00:22:02,817
would make a big deal out of this.

466
00:22:03,475 --> 00:22:04,497
It's gonna ruin everything.

467
00:22:08,853 --> 00:22:10,071
The risk of capital flow,

468
00:22:10,071 --> 00:22:10,693
how do we solve that?

469
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:14,080
Ms. Lu has prepared

470
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,764
for two years

471
00:22:14,853 --> 00:22:16,328
for Infinity project.

472
00:22:16,426 --> 00:22:17,164
We can't just give up

473
00:22:17,164 --> 00:22:18,080
because of

474
00:22:18,124 --> 00:22:19,013
the potential risks.

475
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:19,786
Besides,

476
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:21,155
cash flow issues have happened

477
00:22:21,155 --> 00:22:22,142
a few times before,

478
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,600
and Ms. Lu solved them successfully.

479
00:22:24,204 --> 00:22:26,551
Not to mention the fact that we have director Lu here.

480
00:22:26,888 --> 00:22:27,528
I think

481
00:22:27,528 --> 00:22:28,711
there's nothing to worry about.

482
00:22:30,648 --> 00:22:31,351
Director Lu.

483
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:32,640
Gao Erfan

484
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,248
just has so much faith in us.

485
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:35,377
Gao Erfan.

486
00:22:35,608 --> 00:22:35,991
Yes.

487
00:22:36,853 --> 00:22:37,690
I never liked

488
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,697
to invest all my money into my ideas.

489
00:22:39,724 --> 00:22:40,930
It's not really my style.

490
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,008
About this matter,

491
00:22:42,008 --> 00:22:43,031
I'll go discuss about it

492
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:43,920
with the Design Dept.

493
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,404
Let's leave it at that for now.

494
00:22:46,346 --> 00:22:46,960
Director Lu.

495
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,235
You can contact with other manufacturers.

496
00:22:49,351 --> 00:22:49,955
Back to your work now.

497
00:22:50,195 --> 00:22:50,613
OK.

498
00:23:02,862 --> 00:23:03,635
Wait for me.

499
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,410
What's the matter with you this time?

500
00:23:05,413 --> 00:23:06,115
It's a little unusual.

501
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,777
Why did you decide to go to the reunion?

502
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,124
I haven't seen Mr. Yu for a long time.

503
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,084
Why can't I go?

504
00:23:12,168 --> 00:23:13,271
I think if they see

505
00:23:13,271 --> 00:23:14,506
you got yourself a rich wife,

506
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,786
what their faces will look like?

507
00:23:16,106 --> 00:23:16,755
Peng Bo.

508
00:23:18,266 --> 00:23:19,946
Okay, I won't say it.

509
00:23:34,435 --> 00:23:35,831
I thought we have done discussion.

510
00:23:35,866 --> 00:23:36,791
Why are you still at work?

511
00:23:37,555 --> 00:23:39,315
I'm waiting for you, Ms. Lu.

512
00:23:40,435 --> 00:23:41,137
For what?

513
00:23:42,675 --> 00:23:43,368
This...

514
00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:46,391
You finally decide to quit your job?

515
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,884
How is that possible?

516
00:23:48,053 --> 00:23:48,871
I can get such good benefits,

517
00:23:49,022 --> 00:23:49,866
highly paid,

518
00:23:50,035 --> 00:23:50,844
and especially,

519
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,444
I've a charming boss like you.

520
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:53,706
I'm not going anywhere else.

521
00:23:54,364 --> 00:23:54,800
Ms. Lu,

522
00:23:55,137 --> 00:23:56,320
this is my

523
00:23:56,764 --> 00:23:57,768
annual leave application.

524
00:24:01,377 --> 00:24:02,773
Your plan to travel the world

525
00:24:02,773 --> 00:24:03,982
hasn't changed at all.

526
00:24:04,657 --> 00:24:06,364
You dare to ask for a leave
at such a busy period of time.

527
00:24:06,746 --> 00:24:07,528
Only because you came back

528
00:24:07,528 --> 00:24:08,462
every year,

529
00:24:08,808 --> 00:24:09,635
or I would think that

530
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,942
you're running away.

531
00:24:11,315 --> 00:24:12,248
Ms. Lu.

532
00:24:12,408 --> 00:24:13,208
Call me again.

533
00:24:13,777 --> 00:24:14,897
Ms. Lu.

534
00:24:15,164 --> 00:24:16,462
If you call me like that again,
I will not let you go.

535
00:24:16,577 --> 00:24:17,244
That's disgusting.

536
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,662
Thanks, Ms. Lu.

537
00:24:20,177 --> 00:24:21,795
Well, may you have a good weekend

538
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:22,942
with Dr. Ling.

539
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:23,813
I'm leaving.

540
00:24:27,182 --> 00:24:28,835
Dr. Ling doesn't have a weekend.

541
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:30,373
Friday?

542
00:24:30,684 --> 00:24:31,315
Reunion?

543
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:33,991
If Mr. Yu will be there,

544
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:35,342
then I'll go, too.

545
00:24:37,217 --> 00:24:38,177
The weekend is coming.

546
00:24:41,751 --> 00:24:42,622
Friday.

547
00:24:48,266 --> 00:24:49,617
He used to wear those

548
00:24:49,617 --> 00:24:50,728
corny clothes.

549
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,675
You don't even know why...

550
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:54,110
But he was still handsome.

551
00:24:54,142 --> 00:24:54,880
Come on.

552
00:24:55,182 --> 00:24:56,133
Don't I look good in it?

553
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,884
Does he look as good as me?

554
00:24:57,911 --> 00:24:59,164
You're just jealous.

555
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,626
Who are you talking about?

556
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:02,995
Curly.

557
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:04,293
Curly Peng.

558
00:25:04,444 --> 00:25:05,457
Don't call that, okay?

559
00:25:05,484 --> 00:25:06,690
Either you call me Dr. Peng,

560
00:25:06,728 --> 00:25:07,635
or just Curly.

561
00:25:07,688 --> 00:25:08,595
Who's Curly Peng?

562
00:25:08,684 --> 00:25:09,520
Look at yourself.

563
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,777
Has your curly hair ever changed?

564
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:12,871
I'm so jealous.

565
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:15,004
Don't get your hands on me.

566
00:25:15,288 --> 00:25:16,266
Control yourself.

567
00:25:16,604 --> 00:25:18,088
You've become bolder.

568
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,946
This must be Ling Rui.

569
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,897
We're supposed to call you

570
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:23,875
Dr. Ling now, right?

571
00:25:24,551 --> 00:25:25,173
Hello.

572
00:25:25,342 --> 00:25:27,100
Guys, Dr. Ling is here.

573
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,302
-Ling Rui.
-Dr. Ling.

574
00:25:29,031 --> 00:25:30,097
Sit down.

575
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,564
Dr. Ling,

576
00:25:31,644 --> 00:25:32,613
are you a physician

577
00:25:32,613 --> 00:25:33,377
or a surgeon?

578
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,031
I'm a surgeon.

579
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,902
Surgeon.

580
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,511
Do you do heart operations?

581
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,471
Don't only have him in your eyes, okay?

582
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:41,982
Am I not handsome? Why don't look at me?

583
00:25:42,071 --> 00:25:43,466
You? Forget it.

584
00:25:43,511 --> 00:25:44,195
Ling Rui is more handsome.

585
00:25:44,195 --> 00:25:45,022
Exactly.

586
00:25:46,008 --> 00:25:47,173
Well, where's Mr. Yu?

587
00:25:48,328 --> 00:25:49,120
Mr. Yu?

588
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:49,848
He hasn't arrived yet.

589
00:25:49,893 --> 00:25:50,755
We're all classmates.

590
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,342
Yeah, let's get together sometime.

591
00:25:51,395 --> 00:25:52,420
But if Mr. Yu knows that

592
00:25:52,426 --> 00:25:53,253
Ling Ri is here,

593
00:25:53,502 --> 00:25:54,293
he's gonna fly here.

594
00:25:54,604 --> 00:25:56,142
He is slow, okay?

595
00:25:56,195 --> 00:25:57,102
I'll give him a call.

596
00:25:58,250 --> 00:25:59,128
We must get together sometime.

597
00:25:59,146 --> 00:26:00,210
After all, we're classmates.

598
00:26:00,915 --> 00:26:01,706
Hi, Mr. Yu.

599
00:26:01,804 --> 00:26:03,040
But we're classmates and old friends.

600
00:26:03,084 --> 00:26:03,490
Ladies.

601
00:26:03,493 --> 00:26:04,675
Alright.

602
00:26:07,182 --> 00:26:07,831
Look,

603
00:26:08,222 --> 00:26:09,751
Mr. Yu got lost while driving.

604
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,613
I'm gonna go pick him up.

605
00:26:10,648 --> 00:26:11,430
Why don't you come with me?

606
00:26:11,475 --> 00:26:12,880
-I'll go, too.
-No.

607
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,422
Don't go.

608
00:26:13,448 --> 00:26:14,444
You just go by yourself.

609
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,626
Leave Ling Rui with us.

610
00:26:15,671 --> 00:26:16,470
Exactly.

611
00:26:16,506 --> 00:26:18,530
Are you afraid that we're gonna eat him?

612
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,630
Hey, guys.

613
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,280
Ling Rui hasn't seen Mr. Yu for long.

614
00:26:21,324 --> 00:26:22,320
He misses him so much.

615
00:26:22,364 --> 00:26:22,951
How about this?

616
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,408
Let him pick up Mr. Yu.

617
00:26:24,453 --> 00:26:25,090
And I'll chat with you.

618
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:25,840
I can talk too, right?

619
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:26,940
-No, no.
-I don't want that.

620
00:26:26,995 --> 00:26:28,648
We haven't seen Ling Rui for a long time.

621
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:30,770
-We all miss him so much. Right?
-Exactly.

622
00:26:30,773 --> 00:26:31,671
I'll take him away.

623
00:26:33,271 --> 00:26:34,302
Curly, you...

624
00:26:34,417 --> 00:26:35,240
So annoying.

625
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:35,662
Let's get out of here.

626
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,577
Or they are gonna eat you up.

627
00:26:36,604 --> 00:26:37,240
What are you doing?

628
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,155
Take care of the boys.

629
00:26:39,155 --> 00:26:39,973
Alright?

630
00:26:40,195 --> 00:26:40,960
We want Ling Rui.

631
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,462
We are all classmates.

632
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:45,040
Why all the differences?

633
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,697
We just want Ling Rui.

634
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,448
You're not as handsome as he is.
Don't speak.

635
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,217
-Oh my.
-That can't be changed.

636
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,930
We're both so good-looking.

637
00:26:50,933 --> 00:26:51,537
Why...

638
00:26:51,822 --> 00:26:52,746
Mr. Yu, this way.

639
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:53,724
Mind your steps.

640
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,580
Ling Rui,

641
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:55,804
are you usually that busy?

642
00:26:56,062 --> 00:26:56,755
All these years,

643
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,884
I haven't seen you at all.

644
00:27:00,506 --> 00:27:01,671
You didn't say this

645
00:27:01,671 --> 00:27:02,560
when you saw Ling Rui.

646
00:27:02,986 --> 00:27:04,417
I mean, he just put on an act.

647
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,831
Who of each and every one of you here

648
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:06,853
doesn't know that?

649
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,151
We all know that

650
00:27:08,195 --> 00:27:08,977
how he used to be like?

651
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,204
What's wrong with that?

652
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,053
He is handsome all the time, okay?

653
00:27:12,551 --> 00:27:14,408
You women are so shallow.

654
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,866
What else could you care other than his pretty face?

655
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:17,688
His face is enough.

656
00:27:18,808 --> 00:27:19,570
Listen to me,

657
00:27:19,911 --> 00:27:21,528
Mr. Yu called on the entire class

658
00:27:21,555 --> 00:27:22,497
to help poor students.

659
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,031
I donated him a big down-filled coat.

660
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:27,200
I just don't know if he still wears it or not.

661
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,550
Come on.

662
00:27:28,675 --> 00:27:29,440
He is a surgeon

663
00:27:29,484 --> 00:27:30,524
at a major hospital.

664
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:32,622
Why wear your cheap down jacket?

665
00:27:33,511 --> 00:27:34,320
The other day,

666
00:27:34,648 --> 00:27:35,973
I heard from the doctor at Ling Rui's hospital that

667
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:37,422
someone saw his wife

668
00:27:38,346 --> 00:27:39,955
who looks very rich.

669
00:27:40,782 --> 00:27:41,528
Her bag,

670
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:42,817
and her clothes...

671
00:27:43,431 --> 00:27:44,328
How much salary can

672
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:45,128
Ling Rui get every month?

673
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,826
They don't even care about that
little amount of money.

674
00:27:46,844 --> 00:27:47,386
You know?

675
00:27:47,386 --> 00:27:48,782
See? What I was saying?

676
00:27:49,315 --> 00:27:50,222
What did I tell you?

677
00:27:50,444 --> 00:27:52,000
When I came in, he was like

678
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:53,120
"Hello."

679
00:27:53,591 --> 00:27:54,995
I mean, who was he trying to fool?

680
00:27:56,044 --> 00:27:56,746
I'll tell you what.

681
00:27:56,915 --> 00:27:58,666
With a rich wife,

682
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,617
life is easy.

683
00:27:59,982 --> 00:28:01,386
He just did the grand.

684
00:28:01,795 --> 00:28:02,986
What's the big deal?

685
00:28:19,857 --> 00:28:20,444
Who is this?

686
00:28:30,426 --> 00:28:31,573
Who are you looking for?

687
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:32,488
Do you know her?

688
00:28:32,488 --> 00:28:33,360
Excuse me.

689
00:28:33,626 --> 00:28:35,208
For me, Lu Fangning,

690
00:28:35,208 --> 00:28:36,151
Ling Rui is quite amazing.

691
00:28:36,222 --> 00:28:36,933
Who are you?

692
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,471
I'm Ling Rui's wife,

693
00:28:38,471 --> 00:28:39,191
Lu Fangning.

694
00:28:39,191 --> 00:28:39,911
If you don't know,

695
00:28:39,911 --> 00:28:40,888
you can Baidu my name.

696
00:28:40,888 --> 00:28:41,422
Thanks.

697
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:44,800
He brought his wife...

698
00:28:44,871 --> 00:28:45,333
Fangning.

699
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,328
...to the reunion?

700
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,408
This wine

701
00:28:53,564 --> 00:28:55,093
is so terrible.

702
00:28:55,653 --> 00:28:57,128
After all, this is a reunion.

703
00:28:57,288 --> 00:28:58,337
How could you drink such terrible wine

704
00:28:58,373 --> 00:28:59,413
with your teacher?

705
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,848
I'll have my assistant

706
00:29:01,902 --> 00:29:02,808
get two bottles of fine wine

707
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,408
from my personal winehouse

708
00:29:04,408 --> 00:29:05,813
to celebrate with you all.

709
00:29:07,253 --> 00:29:08,097
I was just wondering

710
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,591
why you had to invite Ling Rui.

711
00:29:09,591 --> 00:29:11,120
It turns out you want him to pay for this.

712
00:29:11,857 --> 00:29:12,684
What do you mean?

713
00:29:13,528 --> 00:29:14,933
How could she say like that?

714
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:18,302
Forget it, Fangning.

715
00:29:19,128 --> 00:29:20,755
You're Lu Fangning.

716
00:29:21,004 --> 00:29:21,662
She's Lu Fangning,

717
00:29:21,662 --> 00:29:22,586
who is very rich.

718
00:29:22,586 --> 00:29:23,395
This lady,

719
00:29:23,653 --> 00:29:25,022
please mind your behavior

720
00:29:25,191 --> 00:29:26,133
and don't mess with our

721
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:26,862
reunion party.

722
00:29:27,502 --> 00:29:28,195
What?

723
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:29,991
Who is exactly rude? Can't you see that?

724
00:29:30,462 --> 00:29:31,724
You're all here for reunion.

725
00:29:31,742 --> 00:29:33,173
Some people are just speaking ill of others.

726
00:29:33,217 --> 00:29:34,595
Is that good manners?

727
00:29:34,817 --> 00:29:35,164
Is it?

728
00:29:36,302 --> 00:29:36,897
By the way,

729
00:29:38,035 --> 00:29:39,290
you're the classmate

730
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,440
who gave clothes to Ling Rui, right?

731
00:29:43,688 --> 00:29:45,164
It occurred to me that

732
00:29:45,448 --> 00:29:46,622
I meant to throw away

733
00:29:46,622 --> 00:29:47,857
that coat for so many times,

734
00:29:47,893 --> 00:29:49,173
but Ling Rui refused.

735
00:29:49,306 --> 00:29:50,613
I can see that it really means a lot

736
00:29:50,613 --> 00:29:51,777
to Ling Rui.

737
00:29:52,577 --> 00:29:53,991
But I've changed my mind.

738
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:55,057
When we get back today,

739
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,026
I'm gonna take that coat

740
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:57,217
and make it a pad for Doudou.

741
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,100
By the way,

742
00:29:58,186 --> 00:29:59,610
Doudou is our dog.

743
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,342
What do you mean?

744
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,048
What do you mean, Ling Rui?

745
00:30:05,493 --> 00:30:06,890
You got a rich wife, that's fine.

746
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,586
But now you're having your wife

747
00:30:08,586 --> 00:30:09,795
humiliate your old classmates?

748
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,266
I'm not humiliating you all.

749
00:30:12,337 --> 00:30:13,422
I'm only humiliating

750
00:30:13,422 --> 00:30:15,226
the two of you.

751
00:30:16,026 --> 00:30:16,820
But you know what,

752
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,457
in your whole life,

753
00:30:17,457 --> 00:30:18,631
it'll be considered as an honor

754
00:30:18,631 --> 00:30:20,000
to be humiliated by me.

755
00:30:20,293 --> 00:30:20,986
Just so you know,

756
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,995
it's not easy to be depended on by Ling Rui.

757
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,075
I was gonna give him tens of millions

758
00:30:25,111 --> 00:30:26,810
He refused it and called me shallow.

759
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,146
Now it took me so much effort
to get him depend on me.

760
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,413
Even if he's gonna make this place a mess,

761
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,333
I'm gonna let him do it.
What can you say about that?

762
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,275
A mess, huh?

763
00:30:35,004 --> 00:30:36,311
Just do it!

764
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,524
What are you doing?

765
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:43,706
What?

766
00:31:02,951 --> 00:31:03,600
It's all right, teacher.

767
00:31:03,786 --> 00:31:04,755
Ling Rui's got this.

768
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,333
But I don't wanna make it a mess.

769
00:31:12,444 --> 00:31:13,066
Let's go.

770
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:16,231
Are you all right?

771
00:31:16,293 --> 00:31:17,200
I'm angry.

772
00:31:20,515 --> 00:31:21,742
Mr. Yu, I'm sorry.

773
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:29,982
Ling Rui.

774
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,982
Don't beat her!

775
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:34,151
Mr. Yu, don't worry. He won't do that.

776
00:31:37,608 --> 00:31:38,906
What are you all doing?

777
00:31:38,906 --> 00:31:39,440
Huh?

778
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,066
Ling Rui.

779
00:31:42,497 --> 00:31:44,240
Why did you drag me out?

780
00:31:44,364 --> 00:31:45,724
I'm not done talking.

781
00:31:46,266 --> 00:31:47,751
They just taunted you like that.

782
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:48,720
How could we let them

783
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,911
finish this meal?

784
00:31:50,106 --> 00:31:50,853
That kind of snobs

785
00:31:50,853 --> 00:31:52,293
need to be defeated by our strength.

786
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:56,791
Why are you so angry?

787
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,435
Because...

788
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,097
Because those people

789
00:32:00,435 --> 00:32:01,875
are a bunch of losers,

790
00:32:01,875 --> 00:32:02,580
they're nasty,

791
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,106
and nobody would tolerate them.

792
00:32:04,302 --> 00:32:05,720
Okay, even though I know

793
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,942
I'm still impressive even I don't

794
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:07,626
wear high heels,

795
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,755
but my biggest regret today is that

796
00:32:08,862 --> 00:32:09,653
I didn't wear my

797
00:32:09,653 --> 00:32:10,995
11-centimeter heels here.

798
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:11,795
Or else when I saw

799
00:32:11,795 --> 00:32:12,640
that stinky man just now,

800
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,360
I could do like this.

801
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,657
And I could look at him this way.

802
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,191
What are you laughing at?

803
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:20,568
What's so funny?

804
00:32:23,582 --> 00:32:24,600
At times like this,

805
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,204
should I just kiss him?

806
00:32:27,217 --> 00:32:28,320
Someone else is around.

807
00:32:28,435 --> 00:32:29,991
Well, that's fine.

808
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:30,702
Should I kiss him?

809
00:32:30,791 --> 00:32:31,422
Do it.

810
00:32:41,688 --> 00:32:42,444
I'm not mad.

811
00:32:43,173 --> 00:32:43,671
So,

812
00:32:45,271 --> 00:32:46,142
don't be mad.

813
00:32:48,355 --> 00:32:48,782
I...

814
00:32:52,062 --> 00:32:52,880
You're not mad?

815
00:32:54,142 --> 00:32:55,386
Then why did you just

816
00:32:55,893 --> 00:32:56,577
do that

817
00:32:57,315 --> 00:32:57,795
and like that?

818
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:01,991
Because they're right.

819
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,124
When I was in school,

820
00:33:05,164 --> 00:33:06,346
my family was really poor,

821
00:33:07,226 --> 00:33:08,346
and we took a lot of help from others.

822
00:33:09,271 --> 00:33:10,666
Well, they couldn't say that about you anyway.

823
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:12,791
These things

824
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:15,546
are part of my life.

825
00:33:16,613 --> 00:33:17,520
I'm not trying to hide it.

826
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,688
As for

827
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,368
what they said about you,

828
00:33:22,453 --> 00:33:23,084
that's true too.

829
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,942
You're really awesome.

830
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:31,653
I don't have your good temper.

831
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:33,395
He has such a good temper,

832
00:33:33,617 --> 00:33:34,951
so he should be done

833
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,586
being mad at me about last time, right?

834
00:33:37,528 --> 00:33:38,613
It was different last time.

835
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,595
Why does he know what I'm thinking?
That's annoying.

836
00:33:47,413 --> 00:33:47,911
Fangning.

837
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,360
What's up?

838
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,911
Can I just

839
00:33:53,751 --> 00:33:55,804
ask you a favor?

840
00:34:15,431 --> 00:34:16,435
Is he a freak?

841
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:19,253
Cut it out.

842
00:34:29,545 --> 00:34:30,790
He looks funny.

843
00:35:13,146 --> 00:35:13,706
Let's go.

844
00:35:14,008 --> 00:35:14,551
Go?

845
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,620
You back to your house,

846
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,391
and me back to my place?

847
00:35:18,986 --> 00:35:19,537
What's up?

848
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,400
I'm feeling sorta uncomfortable.

849
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,008
Every time I have my period,

850
00:35:26,586 --> 00:35:27,475
I don't feel so good.

851
00:35:27,475 --> 00:35:28,577
I need someone to take care of me.

852
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,137
Well, I'll send you back to your house.

853
00:35:31,475 --> 00:35:32,746
What's the point of going back there?

854
00:35:33,448 --> 00:35:34,613
You're not there either.

855
00:35:34,675 --> 00:35:36,100
Besides, who would take care of

856
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:36,915
me at that place?

857
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,964
I want to go back to the apartment.

858
00:35:40,613 --> 00:35:42,560
Alright, I'll send you back.

859
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,257
Take a seat.

860
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,537
You know, because of the whole marriage thing,

861
00:35:59,582 --> 00:36:01,180
I've been a little busy,
so I haven't cleaned up this place.

862
00:36:01,288 --> 00:36:02,780
It's not always like this.

863
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:03,937
You know me.

864
00:36:04,435 --> 00:36:05,635
I go get you some hot water.

865
00:36:05,671 --> 00:36:06,462
Just a minute.

866
00:36:22,497 --> 00:36:23,457
It hurts.

867
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,862
It hurts.

868
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,257
Fangning.

869
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,964
Where's your hot-water bag?

870
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,924
Why would I have hot-water bag?

871
00:36:44,266 --> 00:36:45,546
What do you do when your hurts?

872
00:36:45,982 --> 00:36:46,346
I never...

873
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,915
I just endure it.

874
00:36:54,346 --> 00:36:55,235
I just want to go to my room

875
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,026
and clean up a little bit.

876
00:37:00,204 --> 00:37:00,684
Oh, it hurts.

877
00:37:00,711 --> 00:37:01,315
Are you OK?

878
00:37:01,368 --> 00:37:02,080
I'm fine.

879
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,280
One really can't lie.

880
00:37:54,942 --> 00:37:56,520
Why it hurts all of a sudden?

881
00:37:59,022 --> 00:38:01,288
This really hurts like hell.

882
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:12,693
Come in.

883
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,142
Fangning.

884
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:19,920
I got you some hot water.

885
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,475
You'll sleep better after drink this.

886
00:39:23,386 --> 00:39:23,840
Thank you.

887
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,373
Careful, it's hot.

888
00:39:26,124 --> 00:39:27,342
Aren't I supposed to

889
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,084
drink brown sugar water?

890
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,973
Drinking brown sugar water or hot water

891
00:39:32,257 --> 00:39:33,457
doesn't have difference in

892
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:34,435
helping with your symptoms.

893
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:39,635
Hold this over your belly.

894
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:43,164
Thank you.

895
00:39:54,222 --> 00:39:55,013
It hurts so much.

896
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,257
Have more hot water?

897
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,488
I don't want any water.

898
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,560
I want you.

899
00:40:08,924 --> 00:40:10,026
Then go to sleep.

900
00:40:13,128 --> 00:40:14,044
Sleep?

901
00:40:16,604 --> 00:40:17,546
Well, I mean

902
00:40:17,573 --> 00:40:18,382
you sleep on your own.

903
00:40:20,702 --> 00:40:21,502
Alright.

904
00:40:22,177 --> 00:40:23,466
Yeah, of course.

905
00:40:24,648 --> 00:40:26,133
I mean, I'm like this, right?

906
00:40:27,031 --> 00:40:28,177
I have to sleep alone.

907
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,702
Where are you going?

908
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,257
I'm like this.

909
00:40:36,764 --> 00:40:37,457
Can't you just

910
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,066
stay with me?

911
00:40:40,195 --> 00:40:41,137
Stay, please.

912
00:40:51,173 --> 00:40:52,177
It hurts.

913
00:41:19,662 --> 00:41:20,586
Much better.

914
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,444
Put your feet up.

915
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:43,066
Don't get cold.

916
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:50,177
You know what,

917
00:41:50,515 --> 00:41:52,017
I do feel better this way.
