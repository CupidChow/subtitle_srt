1
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,386
There's not a single soul here.

2
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:56,347
It's just the two of us.

3
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,978
You can see it
even though it's not nighttime.

4
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,938
The Summer Triangle.

5
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:06,649
It's the Winter Triangle.

6
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,280
Sunrise over sunset.

7
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,950
Winter…

8
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:17,911
over summer.

9
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,415
How did you know I wanted to come here?

10
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:25,251
I know everything.

11
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:29,839
Actually…

12
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:35,220
if you don't really tell me,
I won't know everything.

13
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,058
So…

14
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,393
when are you going to tell me?

15
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:00,995
I like someone.

16
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,883
I still regret my confession…

17
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,139
that day.

18
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,768
I knew this would happen.

19
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:28,273
From the moment you showed up,
I knew it.

20
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,570
It's always like this with you.

21
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,406
I'm barely holding it together.

22
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,325
I'm trying to hold it together,
but when I see you…

23
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,952
What?

24
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,291
We need to end this…

25
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,502
get out of each other's life.

26
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,009
You said that two years ago.

27
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,020
Hey, Song Ha-gyeong.

28
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,690
Do you know why I'm back?

29
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,155
I want to try getting through
that unbearable summer with you.

30
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,535
That's why I came back.

31
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:24,787
I'm not leaving.

32
00:03:26,205 --> 00:03:27,332
I'm not leaving.

33
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,549
Then what?

34
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,344
I'll stay with you.

35
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,310
Today made me even more certain.

36
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,688
I need to be by your side.

37
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,861
You couldn't even toss this box.

38
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,530
What were you thinking,
staying here all this time?

39
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,118
I want to stay here and find out.

40
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,164
It'll be hard for you to see me.
I know,

41
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,123
but…

42
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,919
if not, you won't even talk to me.

43
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,841
You never contacted me…

44
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,136
or tried to find me.

45
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,181
Don't you know why?

46
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,898
BAEK DO-YOUNG

47
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,950
Are you really gonna live here with me?

48
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,787
Who do you think you are?
What gives you the right?

49
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,417
No, you never had any rights
to this house.

50
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,628
If anyone does, it's certainly not you.

51
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,156
Under tonight's clear night sky,

52
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:09,452
you'll be able to clearly see
the Summer Triangle.

53
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,330
The three brightest stars
in the summer night sky

54
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:14,874
are called the Summer Triangle.

55
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,502
It looks like a constellation,

56
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:21,089
but this triangle
is actually Altair from Aquila,

57
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,383
Vega from Lyra,
and Deneb from Cygnus.

58
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:28,096
These three constellations
are grouped together.

59
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,724
Tonight after the early rainy season,
please look up and see this…

60
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,532
You'll catch a cold if you go out.

61
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,242
On the table.

62
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,537
MEDICINE

63
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:59,168
On unlucky days,
other misfortunes follow.

64
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,130
A flood,

65
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,882
and news I don't want to hear.

66
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,093
But it's okay.

67
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,095
My summers…

68
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,181
have always been like this.

69
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,116
Yes.

70
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,286
You're talking about that greenhouse?

71
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:37,039
Yes, I know which one it is.
Yes, I'll head over right away.

72
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,418
-What's all this?
-Combat uniform.

73
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,628
-Put them on. We need to go.
-Me too?

74
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,884
I want to try getting through
that unbearable summer with you.

75
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,720
I need to be by your side.

76
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,723
-Why?
-What?

77
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,100
Did your house get flooded badly too?

78
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,561
No, nothing like that.

79
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,313
Hey.

80
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,608
You need to wear a nose plug. It's a must.

81
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,904
Why is this a must?

82
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,533
So the property damage is…

83
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,745
-Three iron bars collapsed.
-Yes.

84
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,998
-And you lost two cows.
-Yes.

85
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,501
Officer Song!

86
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,796
Officer Song!

87
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,760
What's this? No!

88
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:33,346
-Sir.
-Officer Song.

89
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,306
Get ready. Let's go!

90
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,394
Good boy, right?

91
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,774
-Good boy, right?
-No.

92
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,193
Try at least one. That's how you learn.

93
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,616
Hey, go home.

94
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,703
They didn't teach me this
when I studied for the exam.

95
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:58,663
Go home!

96
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,549
Mom, why'd you tell me to take the exam?

97
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,468
You don't know it's flooding in Pacheon,
do you?

98
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:18,307
I can't eat, I just caught pigs.
I'm dying from the smell!

99
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,687
You're here?

100
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,524
Chief Shin,
are you sure one is enough?

101
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,026
It's fine. There are many people…

102
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,654
-Dr. Song.
-Yes.

103
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,573
-You went to the pig farm?
-Yes.

104
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,742
The smell is just…

105
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,329
Is it that bad?
There are a lot of pig farms.

106
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,331
Hey!

107
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:45,710
What, even Dr. Song is here?

108
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,671
What do these bookworms know?

109
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,756
I graduated from being
a bookworm a while ago.

110
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,134
I even fixed Seul's grandpa's roof myself.

111
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,344
That old man's still alive?

112
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,221
Yes, fortunately.

113
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,349
Someone came
and did a thorough job waterproofing it.

114
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,476
If you're curious, why don't you call?

115
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,856
Forget it. When he dies,
I'll decide whether or not to pay a visit.

116
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,443
You go ahead. I'm fine here alone.

117
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,612
Your house has problems too.

118
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,155
Chairman, it's okay.

119
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,617
Just a moment.

120
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,121
SEO SU-HYEOK

121
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,416
The date for the mediation hearing
has been set. July 7th.

122
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,016
You're here?

123
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,811
Looks like you pulled an all-nighter.
Five new bird cages.

124
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:52,401
Now you really know everything about me.

125
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,910
I booked a date
for the mediation hearing with Ms. Song.

126
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:04,163
I'd like to recommend
a settlement before mediation,

127
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,415
but you won't want that, right?

128
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:10,878
So, you're choosing to be the defendant?

129
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,171
TWO MONTHS AGO

130
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:16,050
The complaint isn't even filed.
There's not even a plaintiff yet.

131
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,427
She'll definitely contact us in a month.

132
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:22,014
I know
what Ha-gyeong's weakness is.

133
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,059
So you're saying… it's okay if we lose?

134
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:26,769
Yes.

135
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,897
What are you fighting for?

136
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,941
Just protect the peanut house.

137
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:37,321
So drag it out
until the end of this summer.

138
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,118
No matter how I look at it,

139
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:46,122
you two are very different
from the people I met in court.

140
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:48,290
You're pretty unique yourself.

141
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,925
Why are you both
so obsessed with the peanut house?

142
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:04,348
You know what?
A home shows the people in it.

143
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,435
If it's empty, we don't call it a home.

144
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,979
It's just a building.

145
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,315
It becomes a home
only when someone lives there.

146
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,945
A real home has footprints, scuff marks,
and a few damages.

147
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,114
That's what makes it a home.

148
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:24,577
So when you look at a home,
you can see how someone has lived

149
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,537
and how they'll keep living.

150
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:31,542
Just by looking at it,
you can get a sense of their personality,

151
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:36,213
habits, job, tastes, to some extent.

152
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,384
Pretty scary, right?

153
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,429
It is scary.

154
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,140
Director Baek,
don't ever come to my place.

155
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,728
As I mentioned before,

156
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:55,566
between Korea and the US,
I've moved more than ten times…

157
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,987
but there was only one place
that I considered to be my home.

158
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,326
I've seen the defendant enough.

159
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,204
Now I need to dig into the plaintiff.

160
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,666
Mr. Baek, what do you plan to do next?

161
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,792
So dirty.

162
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,127
-Gross.
-What's this?

163
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,046
-So gross.
-Why'd you go out?

164
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,631
Why'd you go out?

165
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,973
-For flood recovery.
-No ginseng this time, Ms. Song?

166
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,267
Didn't you see the wild ginseng?

167
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:31,894
The situation is a bit…

168
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,773
The buyers are already considering
other places.

169
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,858
What should I do about this now?

170
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:42,363
I'm sorry, sir. I'll call you right back.

171
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,369
Is the peanut house flood bad?
You keep getting calls.

172
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,956
Chief, I need to take a half-day leave.

173
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,459
-You can't. Headquarters wants you.
-Why?

174
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,253
About the fence project?

175
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,548
No, it's about the public competition
from headquarters.

176
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,216
The Patan High remodeling?

177
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:06,095
They need you
since you're in charge of that area.

178
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,431
You're from the last graduating class
before it closed, right?

179
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,643
Wrap this up and hurry over.
They want you there by 1:00 p.m.

180
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,813
-It's 12:30 now.
-Yeah, so hurry.

181
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,107
If you leave now, you'll make it.

182
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,650
If you take that for a spin…

183
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,529
PACHEON, A HAPPY CITY
WHERE NATURE BREATHES

184
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:32,371
By the way, do you smell cow manure?

185
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:38,961
I can't stand it.

186
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,005
Where are you going?

187
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,646
You called for me?

188
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,442
Oh, my, what's this?

189
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,365
Even the mayor is attending today.
You look way too casual.

190
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,077
I've completed my morning duties.

191
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:16,165
This is the biggest public competition
in the past five years.

192
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,250
The budget is 12 billion won.

193
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,002
And the mayor has special attention.

194
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,295
PATAN OBSERVATORY PROJECT

195
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:23,797
You just need to answer a few questions
during Q&A.

196
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,091
But don't overdo it.

197
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,138
DESIGN BASED ON THE SUMMER TRIANGLE

198
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:37,603
It's about renovating
the closed Patan High into an observatory.

199
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,729
He's from New York.

200
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,897
ARCHITECT: BAEK DO-HA

201
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,275
So they want to hear
from a veteran like you, Officer Song.

202
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:46,820
Here he comes.

203
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,330
-Hello.
-Say hello.

204
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:01,794
This is Director Baek from Pluto Atelier
who'll be handling this project.

205
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,588
This is Officer Song Ha-gyeong
who is in charge of Patan High.

206
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,217
Officer Song.

207
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,261
Nice to meet you. I'm Baek Do-ha.

208
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,935
When you think of abandoned schools,
what's the first thing you feel?

209
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,312
Fear, right?

210
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,564
Fear. That could be it.

211
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:25,067
Like how the King Sejong statue moved,

212
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,945
or the pages of the reading girl statue
flipped by themselves.

213
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,948
There are so many ghost tales.

214
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:35,744
These days, it's normal for influencers
to visit abandoned schools or houses.

215
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,871
But for me…

216
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,458
I want to see something.

217
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,677
I want to look at the stars.

218
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,116
In a place that no one visits anymore…

219
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:19,079
where no one expects anything,
I want to show people the stars there.

220
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:23,584
It feels like you could tear it down
since no one's there anymore,

221
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,920
but I want to show
that the stars have always been there.

222
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:35,596
The observatory renovation concept
is themed after the Summer Triangle.

223
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,600
There will be three halls:

224
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,186
Altair Hall, Vega Hall, and Deneb Hall.

225
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,316
Any more questions?

226
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,194
Officer Song…

227
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,990
you came all the way from Patan
for this presentation.

228
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:59,578
As the one overseeing Patan High,
is there anything you'd like to suggest?

229
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:01,371
Me?

230
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,379
Yes.

231
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,342
I'm Song Ha-gyeong
from Patan-myeon Office.

232
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:23,811
Well…

233
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:29,066
who would want an observatory like this?

234
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,277
Patan-myeon in Pacheon-si

235
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,906
is a place where communication
with the residents is crucial.

236
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,661
Out of its 13,000 residents,
more than half went to Patan High.

237
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,373
Furthermore, if an outsider
with American sensibilities

238
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:49,128
came to a school full of their memories
and turned it into an observatory,

239
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,130
who would welcome that?

240
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,050
I don't think this is a project
to be taken lightly. Thank you.

241
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,052
If it were true…

242
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,014
there'd be no scope
for development in Patan.

243
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,852
As a public servant,

244
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,480
do you have no desire
to promote development in the village?

245
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:10,607
I'm different.

246
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,611
I've successfully completed
several projects in Patan-myeon.

247
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,238
I'm not an outsider like you,

248
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,867
and as the last graduate of Patan High,
the residents trust me…

249
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,834
So what you're saying is
that you're the expert,

250
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,086
so we should work together?
Is that it?

251
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,590
You're a Patan High graduate,

252
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:38,010
the local official
in charge of Suhyeon-ri in Patan,

253
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:40,596
a local who can manage
the residents' complaints,

254
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,391
and you've successfully completed
every project you've taken on.

255
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:50,647
It sounds like local sentiment
plays a crucial role in this project.

256
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,068
Then I should get a proper look
at Patan and Patan High.

257
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:59,031
Officer Song, from the last graduating
class and in charge of the area…

258
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,785
could you show me around?

259
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,927
This is too much.
What are you trying to do?

260
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,429
This isn't a joke.
I spent a year on this project.

261
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:26,808
So, as expected, it's not a coincidence?

262
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,144
No way.

263
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,233
Is it guilt?

264
00:20:38,695 --> 00:20:39,571
What guilt?

265
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,034
Baek Do-young.

266
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,913
Why should I feel guilty
because of my brother?

267
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,292
You mean we should build
the observatory he wanted.

268
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,337
We made a promise.

269
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,508
Dr. Song, what are you doing out there?

270
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,553
-Yes, let's go in.
-Hurry up. Let's go.

271
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,437
Well…

272
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:21,905
Judging by all this stuff left behind,
it seems the school closed suddenly.

273
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,241
It was chaos.

274
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:29,329
Students called the education office,
tipping off the media…

275
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,789
Right.

276
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:34,960
Dr. Song here made the biggest fuss.

277
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:40,090
For a closed school,
there are a lot of recent snack bags.

278
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:43,010
Around July, for Confession Day,

279
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,054
a bunch of fools come up to the roof
to look at the stars.

280
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,222
"Confession Day?"

281
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:53,937
Dr. Song is the expert on that.
It's all because of her.

282
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:58,358
A superstition started
that if you confessed under those stars,

283
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,278
you'd stay together forever.

284
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:04,948
We had to stand guard all the time.
It was crazy.

285
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:09,161
The school shut down the following year.

286
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,374
The name is still there.

287
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,505
DENEB

288
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,010
Is it okay to name a club
after a short-lived star?

289
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,930
That's why it's better.
Living short but bright.

290
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,933
Dying in a supernova is cool too.

291
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:35,979
But what if we live up to the name?
You want the school to close?

292
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,105
That's no happening.

293
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:43,528
DENEB

294
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,782
Should we go in?

295
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,124
Deneb?

296
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,002
Then what's our club name,
the Magpie Bridge?

297
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,380
My love life isn't working out.

298
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,050
That's why I said

299
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:09,554
if you confess under the Summer Triangle
on July 7th…

300
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,891
-If you confess?
-You'll never break up.

301
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,395
Then we're definitely
stargazing that day.

302
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,316
-Everyone, gather around!
-Stop spreading superstitions!

303
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,569
Hey, what's a Korean high schooler
supposed to do?

304
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,530
I don't know! Ha-gyeong.

305
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,200
Everyone meet up on July 7th. We have to.

306
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,290
Officer Song.

307
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,465
Yes.

308
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:49,761
Since we're here, please look around.
I'll head back now.

309
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,645
Let's go in.

310
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:09,990
LIBRA

311
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,661
Isn't this you?

312
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:20,208
You went to this school?
That's amazing.

313
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,794
Want to see something more amazing?

314
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,893
What's this?

315
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:40,145
Ventilation hole.

316
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:44,774
Old classroom floors were all wood,
so these were for ventilation.

317
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:50,238
Students used them as secret storage too.

318
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,725
ALTAIR - DENEB - VEGA

319
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,068
BAEK DO-YOUNG

320
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,945
This is why I didn't want to open it.

321
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,738
In this box…

322
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:35,700
all the past memories remain intact.

323
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,402
Baek Do-young?

324
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,794
Okay, done.

325
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,381
What are you doing?

326
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,509
The flood made a mess, so I'm fixing it.

327
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,594
Are you okay, though?

328
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,164
You scared me!

329
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:05,749
What are you doing?

330
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,668
Mind your own business!

331
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:13,173
And don't fix anything.
Just leave it alone.

332
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,468
Do nothing? Leave it like this?

333
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:17,844
Yeah, leave it.

334
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,680
There's nothing precious here to fix.

335
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,641
Who falls for that?

336
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,770
You couldn't throw anything away?

337
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,815
No. What do you know?

338
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,859
What's precious to you
is precious to me too.

339
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,488
So what's precious to me
is precious to you too.

340
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:40,492
That's why you couldn't throw
anything from the box.

341
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,042
But you're not leaving
the house again, right?

342
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,799
Me?

343
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,385
Why would I leave my house?

344
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:02,305
Exactly. Don't do that. You're not a kid.

345
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,741
Baek Do-young?

346
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,344
As for the Haneul assault case,

347
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,389
it's his first offense,
so he'll get probation.

348
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:49,519
As for Daemyeong divorce case,
he has an account in Panama.

349
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:53,148
Use that as leverage for custody,
and we can skip the appeals.

350
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:57,652
Both are too boring for me.

351
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,363
-Are you a lawyer for fun?
-Yes.

352
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,281
CEO SEO NA-HYEON

353
00:29:01,364 --> 00:29:03,992
Are you sulking?

354
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,327
Another issue with Su-chan?

355
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,787
Do I look like a kid?

356
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:12,333
Cleaning up after you guys is getting old.

357
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,628
I want to focus on my current case.

358
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,047
The peanut house?

359
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,717
The property partition suit?

360
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,304
Yes. There's more room to interpret this.

361
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:26,473
-It's quite interesting.
-Really?

362
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:29,726
Want something more interesting?

363
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,645
Seo Su-hyeok's paternity suit.

364
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,982
There it is, your classic move.

365
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,902
What, you want me to dig up Dad's grave
and pull a tooth?

366
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:42,614
Boss, if you don't feed a dog--

367
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,783
-It'll bite its owner?
-No.

368
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,035
It'll eat whatever's around.

369
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:51,790
Why would it bite the owner?
To get itself put down?

370
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,335
But the stuff I picked up randomly
turned out to be pretty fun.

371
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:59,005
I'll do my best on the peanut house.

372
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,383
So don't look for me.

373
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,436
This place is a total mess.
The basement is insane.

374
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,982
What's Baek Do-ha's deal?
He sets everything up,

375
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,694
but somehow,
you're the one always reaching out.

376
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,571
You're the desperate one.

377
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:28,660
He switched the house title to his name,
claimed all the rights,

378
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,704
then just sat there,
waiting for you to call.

379
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:35,124
If he won the bid
for the Patan High project,

380
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,961
that means
he's prepared for at least a year.

381
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:40,964
What's his deal?

382
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,132
Did he say anything else?

383
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,428
I'm not leaving. I'm not getting out.

384
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,764
What happened again?

385
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,997
He's in amazing shape.

386
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,833
Birds of a feather.

387
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:21,462
Right, no wonder
he's defending Baek Do-ha.

388
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,090
Don't be so cynical.

389
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,259
-He's totally your type.
-Are you crazy?

390
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:33,808
Hey, who in their right mind
would date a woman who sued their client?

391
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,894
Actually, there are quite a few.

392
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,232
I'll be going now.

393
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,570
Take good care of Ha-gyeong.

394
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:50,533
Have a good time, you two.

395
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,829
I'm off.

396
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:56,873
Bye.

397
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:02,003
You checked everything?
You can leave then.

398
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,756
That's what he meant.

399
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,507
What?

400
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,468
Mr. Baek says,
by looking at someone's home,

401
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,720
you can tell what kind of person they are.

402
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,348
It really tells a lot.

403
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:15,141
Excuse me?

404
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:18,353
Actually, I came to ask you something.

405
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:23,274
I spent last night
going through your 50-page notice.

406
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,943
I couldn't fall asleep.

407
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,070
The more I read it,

408
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,781
the more I couldn't tell
if you wanted sell the house

409
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,450
or wanted me to stop you.
It's really unclear.

410
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,994
What are you saying?

411
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,537
This morning, I had my answer.

412
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,415
It all came down to one line.

413
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,378
Ms. Song.

414
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,964
You like Mr. Baek that much?

415
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,092
It reads like you like him so much,
you keep thinking of him,

416
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:52,637
so you want to leave this house.

417
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,888
Have you lost your mind?

418
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,435
I make money separating truth from lies.

419
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:04,023
Though I earn double
making lies undetectable.

420
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:08,319
So what's your real feeling?

421
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,242
I want to sell the house.
Nothing more, nothing less.

422
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,953
It's not fake or real. It's the truth.

423
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,789
I just want to leave this peanut house.

424
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,838
Understood. I'll be going.

425
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,886
Are you still curious
why I took this case?

426
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:34,846
Yes.

427
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:37,724
Baek Do-ha promised
to eat with me ten times.

428
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:41,436
I'm an outcast at home and work.

429
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,314
Where's my meal buddy?

430
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,942
Eat up.

431
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,610
-Thanks for the food.
-Sure.

432
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,654
-I'll put this here.
-Okay.

433
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:58,494
When Do-ha comes, the menu changes.

434
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:01,205
No wonder I feel like having a drink.

435
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,043
Wait, Director. Stop with the makgeolli.

436
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,839
I know you'll be doing the concrete work
this afternoon. You're being brazen.

437
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:15,470
Then you shouldn't have served
lacquer chicken. You started it.

438
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:19,390
Come on, this is to get your strength up,
so you could work.

439
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,435
If you keep this up,
no more protein for you.

440
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,272
Fine, man.

441
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:40,411
Didn't he have two sons?

442
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:44,499
Two, right? That kid and this guy.

443
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,293
Hasn't Director Baek remarried?

444
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,797
Don't try to find out.
There's a painful history.

445
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:55,468
How hard must it be
for one guy to play two roles?

446
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,429
He must be exhausted.

447
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,517
Now explain the dome.
It's the highlight of an observatory.

448
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:07,188
Given the school's setup,
maybe make the dome simple,

449
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,360
I was thinking
we could beam the lights inside.

450
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:14,237
We need something fun
even in bad weather.

451
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,366
Your brother would have smacked you.

452
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:22,662
"We couldn't see it today,
but next time, we definitely will."

453
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,997
Isn't that
how people coming to see the stars feel?

454
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,167
That was pretty deep, Dad.

455
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:32,296
You punk. What else? Show me what you got.

456
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,297
And…

457
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:37,760
Are you really leaving?
She bought dried corvina for you.

458
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,762
Stay over once in a while.

459
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:44,559
I can't, I really have a client meeting
early tomorrow morning.

460
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,561
Don't give me the look.

461
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:50,148
No, it's not what you think.
I have two moms, two dads.

462
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:51,899
I love the noise. American style.

463
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,236
I'll stay next time.

464
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,700
Why?

465
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,411
Look.

466
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,291
Thanks to you, the house is a mess.

467
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:11,085
Had we sold it on time,
this wouldn't have happened.

468
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,087
Who do I call about the moldy wallpaper?

469
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,590
Why's she always bossing you around,
and not me?

470
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,842
She's really nasty.

471
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:22,221
She's unbelievable.
She's always hitting me where it hurts.

472
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,766
Whenever she wants to stop me,
she brings up Do-young first.

473
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:29,979
Do you remember?

474
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:34,942
When Mom said she was remarrying,
you disappeared.

475
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,738
We had a serious crisis meeting.

476
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:45,661
To make teenage Baek Do-ha feel better,
we thought of camping trips or gifts.

477
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:47,747
It was complete chaos.

478
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:53,085
Do you know what Ha-gyeong said?

479
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:54,921
He just…

480
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,465
wants to come home.

481
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:02,720
So don't overreact. Act normal.

482
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,098
If we make a big deal out of it,
that stubborn dummy

483
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:09,477
will force a smile and act mature
to fix the mood.

484
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:14,899
She really…

485
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,406
The peanut house is for Ha-gyeong,

486
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,952
and Patan High is for Do-young?

487
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,537
And you're not in any of it?

488
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,168
Yes.

489
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,837
Oh, my!

490
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,673
Yes.

491
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,550
Ha-gyeong, from now on,

492
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,971
Do-ha will take care of the peanut house,
so you focus on your work.

493
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,769
The complaints team head's grandmother
suddenly passed away.

494
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,355
She was on duty today.

495
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,733
Do I have to fill in again?

496
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:02,571
-Want me to take the shift then?
-Today again?

497
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,407
-Yes.
-You were on duty yesterday too.

498
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,574
I really don't mind.

499
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,245
Then I'd feel bad.

500
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:20,089
This is funny.

501
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:25,469
"Deneb Hall"?

502
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,515
"Summer Triangle." What's this?

503
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,934
The headquarters' school project.

504
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:35,813
No need to care.
Some artsy, flaky architect is doing it.

505
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,027
"Summer Triangle."

506
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,947
Hey, do you think it's only in summer?

507
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,908
There's a triangle in spring and winter.

508
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:51,329
You just mash unrelated things
to make up a name?

509
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,289
I can't believe it.

510
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,213
Yes, this is Patan Office.

511
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:05,801
I can't sleep with all the noise.
Someone's at Patan High again.

512
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,304
It's almost July. It's that time of year.

513
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:12,058
-I see.
-I have to get to work early tomorrow.

514
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,226
Come fix this right now.

515
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,228
Yes, understood. I'll go right away.

516
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,112
-Where are you going?
-Kids are at the school again.

517
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:30,534
I'm going straight to the site,

518
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,162
so if there's another call, call me.

519
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,831
Yes, Officer Pi. Where are you now?

520
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,335
Looks like
some kids got into Patan High again.

521
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,586
NO ENTRY

522
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,880
No, there's no sign of
property damage yet.

523
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,342
Yes, then I'll wait…

524
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,222
Fireworks are going off inside.

525
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,724
I'm going in. Come as fast as you can.

526
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,648
Keys.

527
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:35,724
Hold my hand.

528
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:03,544
Who's there?

529
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,646
These punks.

530
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,234
Did he leave?

531
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:32,990
Hey, is this okay?
Breaking into school at night to confess?

532
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,825
Why not? It's nice.

533
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,955
Don't you have one?
Someone you'd never want to break up with?

534
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,969
This is all because of Baek Do-young.

535
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,555
He knows all these crazy superstitions.

536
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,642
You know
how many demerit points we'd get?

537
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,312
Hey, you guys were here?

538
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,900
-Hurry up.
-He's so annoying. Let's go.

539
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,286
What took you so long?

540
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,412
Sorry.

541
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,539
Where's Do-young?

542
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,625
Here.

543
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,169
Hey, hurry up.

544
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:42,059
On July 7th,
if you confess under the Summer Triangle,

545
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,603
you'll never break up.

546
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:56,699
You're right on time.

547
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,367
Look, the Summer Triangle.

548
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,082
You brats!

549
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,501
-Are you on the rooftop?
-Hey, he's coming!

550
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,878
Hurry!

551
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,465
Take a good picture.

552
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:18,637
Okay, one, two, three.

553
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:42,828
-It's so beautiful.
-No way.

554
00:43:43,871 --> 00:43:44,747
Mine's not working.

555
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,750
-Amazing.
-Mine isn't working.

556
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,004
Who brought these?

557
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:53,922
-What's over there?
-Freeze!

558
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,592
-Hey, hurry.
-Come out!

559
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,595
Hey, you brats, come here.

560
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,472
It's just a warning this time.

561
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,224
What grade and class are you in?

562
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,019
Kids are still doing this.

563
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,147
It happened a few times last year.

564
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,567
You know July is now the crackdown season?

565
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:17,529
We should just put up police tape here
on July 7th.

566
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,564
Back then, my summer

567
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:55,943
was always the season with guests.

568
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,533
A summer guest named Baek Do-ha.

569
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:11,208
When the summer guest came,
our summer began.

570
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:28,058
Perfect timing. Let's go see the stars.
There's a meteor shower tonight.

571
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,147
These Baek brothers.

572
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,107
Let's go.

573
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,530
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

574
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:51,582
At the start of my summers,
there were always those twin brothers.

575
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,084
Similar, yet completely different.

576
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:55,627
Baek Do-young…

577
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,464
and Baek Do-ha.

578
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,429
Hey, I can't see it.

579
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:11,143
Calibrate the telescope
with Vega as your reference.

580
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:14,521
Vega makes up the Summer Triangle
with Deneb and Altair.

581
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,858
So look for the brightest triangle.

582
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:20,527
How's she supposed to spot Vega?

583
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,530
It'd be faster to tell her
to find the Lyra constellation.

584
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:26,450
Hey, move. Let me see too.

585
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,118
Just go look at Altair.

586
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,705
Why do you go on about Altair
whenever you see me?

587
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:32,664
What's that about?

588
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,167
It's the dimmest of the triangle.

589
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,421
Plus, in astrology,
Altair is a symbol of bad luck.

590
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,839
That's so you. Bad luck.

591
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,720
-Then what are you?
-I'm obviously Vega.

592
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:50,432
Vega shines the brightest. Magnitude 0.03.

593
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,101
Perfect for a straight-A student like me.

594
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,188
You know what?

595
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:59,441
In the East,
Altair is the Cowherd, and Vega…

596
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:01,235
is the Weaver Girl.

597
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:06,823
Looks like I'll have to be Deneb.
I'm the Magpie Bridge.

598
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:09,743
What?

599
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:17,876
A meteor shower!

600
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:19,461
You're right.

601
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:24,967
Back then,
the Summer Triangle referred to us.

602
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,429
The twins were apart over 300 days a year,

603
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,391
but they were always together
for stargazing.

604
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:40,857
After their parents' divorce,
Do-ha stayed in America with his mom,

605
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,694
and Do-young came to Korea with his dad.

606
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:48,282
That's how Do-young
stayed in the peanut house.

607
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:50,158
But during summer,
it was three of us.

608
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:54,329
Because Do-ha always came back
in summer.

609
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,589
-I'll join you!
-What, Ha-gyeong?

610
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:07,551
-Hey, Jong-man is waiting for water.
-I want to spray too.

611
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:16,059
Yes! I won!

612
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,524
Hey, one more round. Just once.

613
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,444
We three were always together
every summer, but…

614
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:26,361
-Right.
-Hey!

615
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:28,822
Even when we were near,
we kept some distance.

616
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:33,118
Even when apart,
we tried not to drift too far.

617
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:38,290
Maintaining that right distance
was the secret to our triangle working.

618
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:40,959
But…

619
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:44,212
Okay, one, two, three.

620
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,885
Hey, one more.

621
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,269
Was it from that moment

622
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,939
that our triangle began to fall apart?

623
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,198
You're going to fall.

624
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:15,494
Hey. I'm completely sober now. Watch.

625
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:53,740
And on that summer night of July 7th,
when the Cowherd and Weaver meet,

626
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:59,538
for a brief moment, we became just two.

627
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,715
And all the points of our triangle…

628
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,968
ended up falling apart.

629
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,720
JONG-MAN

630
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,394
What?

631
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,188
Do-ha?

632
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,694
It's you, Do-young.

633
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,325
Can't sleep?

634
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:39,661
Ha-gyeong.

635
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:45,417
That place you said you wanted to go,
you want to go now?

636
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:47,961
Now?

637
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,630
Let's go.

638
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,766
So when are you going to say it?

639
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,318
I like you.

640
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:14,362
In the end,
I couldn't keep the right distance.

641
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:19,409
The three of us under the Summer Triangle

642
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:21,244
no longer exist.

643
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,080
We can never go back…

644
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:26,666
to that summer.

645
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,496
-Hello.
-Ms. Song, you're here?

646
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:06,122
Ms. Song!

647
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,791
Hurry, hurry!

648
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,167
-Come here.
-Why?

649
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:10,293
SONG, KIM, TRANSFER

650
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,379
What? Isn't this weird?

651
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:16,091
A random transfer now?
The regular July transfers are coming up.

652
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:21,054
Right? It's a one-for-one,
so I'm getting dragged along.

653
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,850
-You don't want it? Want to trade with me?
-No, it's fine.

654
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,811
I'll call my mom and be right back.

655
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:29,855
She's all smiles.

656
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,524
Just a moment.

657
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:35,443
CHIEF'S OFFICE

658
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,737
You said you wanted to go to headquarters.

659
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,489
I just got a call from higher up.

660
00:52:39,573 --> 00:52:41,366
I never applied to Architecture.

661
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:45,245
I really don't know either.
This is sudden for me too.

662
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,998
How will we handle complaints
without you?

663
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,545
But isn't this a good thing for you?

664
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:54,588
ARCHITECTURE

665
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:58,550
-What? I'm the project manager?
-How many times do I have to say it?

666
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:02,721
Meet Director Baek from Pluto
and get the contract signed.

667
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:05,473
Why am I in charge of
the observatory project?

668
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,644
Why would they give
such a big project to me?

669
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,148
Don't you know
you were urgently transferred for this?

670
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:19,029
This is your first task as the manager, so
explain it well and have it signed today.

671
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,239
Understood.

672
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,371
By the way,

673
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,374
did that jerk Baek Do-ha assign me this?

674
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,879
-I mean, the director?
-It was the mayor.

675
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,591
Director Baek said
it had to be Officer Song.

676
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:41,217
He even insisted.

677
00:53:42,135 --> 00:53:44,596
Did you really not hear anything
from Do-ha?

678
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,973
He hired Su-hyeok for the house.

679
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,601
He's definitely up to something.

680
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:53,647
I haven't heard anything,
and I never asked.

681
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:58,193
Last time I went to the peanut house,
it was flooded, the house was a mess.

682
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:00,946
All our old boxes were taken out.

683
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:04,366
There's still a lot of Do-young's stuff
in there.

684
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:06,993
What?

685
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:11,039
Where did the ramp go? It's gone?

686
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:12,624
They changed it.

687
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:17,045
They bragged about ten years
of history. Bullshit.

688
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,631
How can it change so easily?

689
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:21,508
It's your favorite place.

690
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,635
It's a bummer.

691
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,889
-Seung-taek.
-Yeah?

692
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:31,351
Nothing beats that place, right?

693
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:35,438
It's really nice.

694
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,984
Nothing beats this place. It's great.

695
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,111
-Should we eat?
-Yeah.

696
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,656
Looks delicious. Good choice.

697
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,787
By the way, Seul, has Ha-gyeong
talked to you about her feelings?

698
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,207
She hasn't talked to you either?

699
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:58,503
Song always leaves out
the most important things.

700
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:03,383
I can only guess.

701
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:06,511
I don't really know.

702
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:10,598
What Ha-gyeong feels, what she felt…

703
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:13,685
and who she liked.

704
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,584
Yes, this way.

705
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:41,004
Take a look at this.

706
00:55:41,588 --> 00:55:44,382
Just by looking at the models,
you can tell how stubborn he is.

707
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:49,721
Director Baek spent a whole year on this.

708
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,390
He said he'd only do this project
this summer.

709
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:55,060
He worked like crazy.

710
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:14,162
So where is he?

711
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:21,211
You're finally here, Officer Song.

712
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:25,131
That's the contract?

713
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:44,984
It's exactly like the work order.

714
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:48,988
Director Baek said
it had to be Officer Song.

715
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:50,698
He insisted so strongly.

716
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:51,616
Baek Do-ha.

717
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:54,494
You're not leaving, huh?

718
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:58,706
What now?

719
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:02,210
You fix the fence,
fix the house, fix the school.

720
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,462
What's next?

721
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,465
You.

722
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:10,176
And me.

723
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,348
Everything got messed up
since I listened to you.

724
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,058
What?

725
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,602
I thought you'd be happy
if I left like you said.

726
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:22,772
But no, you don't look happy.

727
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:25,608
Of course…

728
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:28,194
neither do I.

729
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:35,285
Being apart, nothing's gone right for us.

730
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,455
So?

731
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:41,916
Will I be happy if I'm with you?

732
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:44,210
I don't know.

733
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:09,861
If I stick around and you keep hating me,

734
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,697
maybe I'll see your true feelings.

735
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:17,994
So you resent me this summer.

736
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,207
I'll spend this summer…

737
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,168
liking you.

738
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:37,514
I like someone.

739
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:41,142
I regret my confession that day.

740
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:50,443
You finally said it.

741
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:54,614
Do-young.

742
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:57,534
Listen…

743
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,703
I like…

744
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:03,581
Do-ha.

745
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,546
You finally said that too.

746
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,800
You've always liked Do-ha.

747
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,274
When are you coming back?

748
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:35,947
Next time, the three of us
should go see the stars.

749
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,575
Until then,
take good care of Do-ha and the house.

750
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:45,915
Baek Do-young.

751
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,043
I promise I'll be back in summer.

752
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:51,921
The three of us will reunite then.

753
00:59:56,593 --> 01:00:00,179
Why can't I forget what I want to forget?

754
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,142
I'll spend this summer…

755
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,478
liking you.

756
01:00:08,646 --> 01:00:11,024
Why do you keep appearing before me…

757
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,651
when I want to forget you?

758
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:16,571
But…

759
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,657
from the moment you came back…

760
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:22,744
I like…

761
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:25,830
Do-ha.

762
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:27,290
I can't shake off…

763
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:30,418
my confession that day.

764
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:18,299
Two years of just waiting
and doing nothing is enough.

765
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:22,470
What's wrong with you?
What's gotten into you today?

766
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:25,348
To deal with Ha-gyeong,
I need to be this prepared.

767
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:27,600
Why do you want to stay by my side so bad?

768
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:29,977
Why do you want to get away from me?

769
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:33,439
We keep driving each other to
make the wrong choices.

770
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:35,692
You're dropping the case?

771
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:38,194
I'll give the house to Baek Do-ha.

772
01:01:38,277 --> 01:01:40,613
She needs to fight me.

773
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,323
You asked why I took the case.

774
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:44,617
That was Mr. Baek Do-ha's condition.

775
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,577
I'll do whatever it takes.

776
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:50,206
Hey, Baek Do-ha,
you're really annoying.

777
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:53,126
Let's never see each other.
