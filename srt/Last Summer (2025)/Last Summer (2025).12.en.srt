1
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:50,383
<i>Dear Your Honor.</i>

2
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:51,926
<i>Hello.</i>

3
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:56,347
<i>I'm Song Ha-gyeong, the plaintiff</i>
<i>in the co-owned property case.</i>

4
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,225
<i>How familiar are you with Pacheon?</i>

5
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,644
<i>You may not be familiar with it at all.</i>

6
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,149
<i>I haven't met anyone in the legal field</i>
<i>who lives here.</i>

7
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,108
What's going on?

8
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,068
The battery's dead.

9
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,819
<i>Maybe because we're near the DMZ.</i>

10
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,779
Let's take the bus.

11
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:12,447
<i>People believe Pacheon</i>

12
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,533
<i>would be the first place to be hit</i>
<i>if a war ever started.</i>

13
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:20,205
Hey!

14
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,583
<i>But for me,</i>
<i>every single day already feels like a war.</i>

15
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,171
The bus is here!

16
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,673
<i>I should probably introduce Bus 18.</i>

17
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,468
<i>It comes every 40 minutes,</i>
<i>stops at five villages and has…</i>

18
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,636
Wait!

19
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,137
<i>…only 18 seats. </i>

20
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,180
You get on first.

21
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,015
Hang on. Hurry!

22
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:44,062
<i>I had to throw myself onto the road</i>
<i>just to catch the bus.</i>

23
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,773
You are a natural.

24
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,651
<i>The place where I had to risk my life</i>
<i>every day to get to school</i>

25
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,947
<i>is Pacheon's northernmost area,</i>
<i>Patan-myeon.</i>

26
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,034
<i>I really hate Patan-myeon.</i>

27
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,328
<i>For the past 17 years,</i>
<i>Patan-myeon has slowly</i>

28
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,580
<i>shaped me into</i>
<i>a pretty wrecked human being.</i>

29
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,290
Ms. Song, am I doing this right?

30
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,545
They insisted that construction
be part of the design.

31
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,256
Then they went with the cheapest builder.

32
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,216
Are you listening to me?

33
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,468
<i>-I miss you.</i>
<i>-Me too.</i>

34
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,348
<i>A place you can't reach in summer</i>
<i>because of floods</i>

35
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,101
<i>and in winter, because of snowstorms.</i>

36
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,018
PETITION LETTER

37
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:29,357
<i>This awful place keeps taking away</i>
<i>everything I care about.</i>

38
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,735
<i>Now I'm even imagining things.</i>

39
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,362
You're up.

40
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,739
-Yes.
-What are you doing?

41
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,576
<i>I, Song Ha-gyeong, the plaintiff,</i>
<i>am losing my mind.</i>

42
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,577
Hey.

43
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,829
What the heck? Why are you reading this?

44
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,415
Hey, this is no petition letter.

45
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,708
It's a love letter.

46
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:48,877
As if.

47
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:53,381
Ha-gyeong,
you've been crazy about me every summer.

48
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,385
You think
I'm only crazy about you in summer?

49
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:58,845
Think again.

50
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,181
Of course, winter's included.

51
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,644
Hurry up or we'll be late.

52
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,273
Right, we should go to Hawaii.
Get ready already.

53
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:13,860
-Okay. What are you going to wear?
-I'll go with…

54
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,703
Aloha.

55
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,455
-Aloha.
-Aloha.

56
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,543
This temperature, humidity,

57
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,420
and the wind.

58
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,505
It's a perfect summer.

59
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,643
Who knew Seoul had a place like this?

60
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,394
It's winter, but it feels like summer.

61
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:52,941
I'm finally having a proper weekend
after months.

62
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,736
Isn't it nice spending winter with me?
I handle events so well.

63
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,073
Event? What's the occasion today?

64
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,241
Today is

65
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:04,827
the 120th day since you confessed to me.

66
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:05,828
What?

67
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,666
So then,
it's been 120 days since our first kiss.

68
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:14,212
Our first kiss was on the fence,
so it's been 3,805 days.

69
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,465
That was our first peck.
It's been 120 days.

70
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,805
Why don't we check
all special occasions in winter?

71
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,682
All 20 years at once?

72
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,309
I'm in.

73
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,812
I can't miss the Christmas
and year-end parties.

74
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,230
We'll do New Year's.

75
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,482
Let's not forget
Su-bak's birthday in winter.

76
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,566
And this day.

77
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,403
It was when we broke ground
on Peanut House 17 years ago.

78
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,822
And what about this day?

79
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,031
This day?

80
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,117
Okay, let's mark this day too.

81
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,493
What day is it?

82
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,662
Right. What day is it?

83
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:49,580
You really don't know?

84
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,000
No, what's this day?

85
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,377
My birthday.

86
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,348
I totally got you.
That was a nice surprise, right?

87
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,355
I pretended I totally forgot
to surprise you.

88
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,940
That's such a cliché.

89
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,860
Haven't you seen movies or shows?

90
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:23,656
Really?

91
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,577
December 17th is my birthday.

92
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,537
You remember that?

93
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,165
Hey, of course. December 17th.

94
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,709
-Who forgets their boyfriend's birthday?
-Exactly.

95
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,170
Actually, my birthday

96
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,713
is December 18th.

97
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:41,966
Hey.

98
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,426
Sure, the 18th.

99
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,636
I was going to say the 18th.

100
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,223
Where are you going? Hey!

101
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:57,482
Actually, it is the 17th.

102
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,283
Su-bak.

103
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,369
She knows your birthday
and this house's birthday.

104
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,913
She doesn't know my birthday.

105
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,918
Hey. Didn't you celebrate
your lunar birthday?

106
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,503
When's my lunar birthday?

107
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,807
Get out of the way.

108
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,849
Move.

109
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,519
Hey.

110
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,562
The 17th. I will never forget.

111
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,484
I've got your birthday, okay?

112
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,529
So tell me.

113
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,364
What will you do for me?

114
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,741
I'm Dr. Song of Patan-myeon.

115
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,620
I've been in charge
of events, parties, and celebrations

116
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,997
in this town for 17 years.

117
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,042
Trust me.

118
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,796
BAEK DO-HA'S BIRTHDAY PARTY PLAN

119
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:09,846
SEUNG-TAEK
MR. SHIN

120
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,848
Mr. Baek, what does Do-ha like?

121
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,141
<i>The ash tree?</i>

122
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:16,227
<i>I gave him the tree for his birthday.</i>
<i>He loved it.</i>

123
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,312
He's 29 now.

124
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,605
DO-HA'S DAD

125
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,150
This is bad. You didn't know either?

126
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:25,445
Speaking of which, you missed
his middle school entrance ceremony too.

127
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,990
<i>Yes, it overlapped with my</i>
<i>faculty appointment ceremony. Why?</i>

128
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,950
Ms. Nam, have a conscience, please!

129
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,076
DO-HA'S MOM

130
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,288
<i>In the States,</i>
<i>you hire a stripper for a party…</i>

131
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,206
YOON SO-HEE

132
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,969
ENJOY 30% OFF YOUR STAY
AT GRAND ROYAL PALACE HOTEL

133
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,987
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

134
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,157
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

135
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,286
<i>Happy birthday dear Do-ha</i>

136
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,830
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

137
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,051
Are you ready
for the best birthday ever?

138
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,011
-Yes.
-Let's go.

139
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:43,814
I put all my lectures and meetings
on hold today

140
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,483
to celebrate my boy's birthday.

141
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,651
Why?

142
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:48,236
But you didn't say anything.

143
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,487
You invited me.

144
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,990
You made all the calls
and told me to have a conscience.

145
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,534
I appreciate the thought, Mom.

146
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,536
Dad!

147
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,956
We have a really important plan.

148
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,416
Right. We were just about to head out.

149
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:07,755
Guys, I even canceled my flight.
Come in.

150
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:09,048
Come on in.

151
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,133
Come in! This is going to be fun!

152
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,469
Come in. Come in.

153
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,102
Hold on.

154
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,979
The hotel check-in isn't until later.

155
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,731
Okay, let's do round one of the party
and go right after.

156
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,900
-If we go before rush hour--
-Son!

157
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,069
Hurry up.

158
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,487
Okay, coming.

159
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,697
Hurry.

160
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:35,783
Let's go.

161
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,421
Dad.

162
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,850
You almost gave me a heart attack.

163
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,560
Sorry.

164
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,354
You and Do-ha were talking about
something serious.

165
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:08,899
Did Mr. Baek call you?

166
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,319
Before that…

167
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:15,323
I wanted to see you.

168
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,533
I just

169
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,495
wanted to sneak a peek
at my daughter's face.

170
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:27,126
Why sneak a peek? You promised
you wouldn't be like a water deer.

171
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,129
Come over.

172
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,340
Let's go inside.

173
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:34,508
Okay.

174
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,222
It's here.

175
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,311
How do you like the wrapping?
It feels like a birthday gift, right?

176
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:46,729
It feels like a wedding gift.

177
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:50,274
GOPCHANG

178
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,658
Now you even want to take a picture?

179
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,078
Let's eat.

180
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:10,711
It's good.

181
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,796
So good.

182
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:14,924
Is it good?

183
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,635
Everyone, let's have a toast.

184
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,136
Cheers.

185
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,399
This looks a lot different
since last time.

186
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,361
Living with you turned my son into a mess.

187
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,907
-Ms. Nam.
-You keep calling me "Ms. Nam."

188
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,660
How am I supposed to treat you
as my daughter-in-law?

189
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,579
We're not there yet.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

190
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:47,915
You go downstairs.

191
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,717
I love her rude attitude.

192
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,596
I'm actually grateful to her
for turning you into a mess.

193
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,557
Are you feeling relieved now?

194
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:07,184
So you should stop.

195
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,853
Why are you so worried?

196
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,107
I'm just
pretending to be Mom for once.

197
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,944
It feels like home now.

198
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,116
The vitamin bottle with the sleeping pills
is gone too.

199
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:25,870
I got rid of it.
I got a better sleeping aid.

200
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,549
What's all this?

201
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,677
Why's there so much?

202
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:47,057
I kept buying one
each time I missed you.

203
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:52,855
"I'll give it to her next winter.
She gets cold easily.

204
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,692
I'll give them to her next time."
I kept buying them like that.

205
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,328
They're tacky, but they're warm.

206
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,412
Really?

207
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,674
HA-GYEONG, HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

208
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,228
HA-GYEONG, HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

209
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:34,897
You've been carrying all these all along?

210
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:40,361
I'm sorry…

211
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,157
for being such a lousy dad.

212
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,494
I haven't found the answer.

213
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,329
It doesn't work that fast.

214
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:52,581
It took me this long
to be able to hold hands.

215
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,670
Next time, come back on my birthday,
not Do-ha's.

216
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,297
Give me gifts and cards
like these directly.

217
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,766
Ji-cheol. Song Ji-cheol.

218
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,978
-Mr. Baek is calling you.
-Okay.

219
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:18,566
Let's go, Dad.

220
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:23,821
Come on.

221
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,411
Is this supposed to be a shaman's house?
There are so many colors.

222
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,581
You did this, right?

223
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,166
That's Ji-cheol's pick.

224
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,713
That looks like a new rug.

225
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,674
Su-bak tore it up, so we got a new one.

226
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:49,638
<i>Song Ha-gyeong once said that this house</i>

227
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,016
<i>was a very selfish,</i>

228
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,769
<i>yet caring place,</i>
<i>built due to the adults' needs.</i>

229
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,355
You changed the lighting too.

230
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,525
Song Ha-gyeong said her eyes hurt.

231
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:05,029
With new owners,
the house has transformed.

232
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,656
It feels like a new era.

233
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,578
<i>She said it was a complete mess</i>

234
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,623
<i>built by the Baeks without a mom</i>

235
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,750
<i>and the Songs without money.</i>

236
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:21,462
What makes this house special is
how it changes with the people in it.

237
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,509
As a professor
at the world's top architecture school,

238
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,219
this house is a total disaster.

239
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,264
Who put two houses together like this?

240
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,267
It lacks aesthetics, but strangely,

241
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,603
it feels warm and cozy here.

242
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,650
I think it's because
you're right by the heater.

243
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,154
No wonder it feels warm. Makes sense.

244
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,906
<i>But things have changed now.</i>

245
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,449
The first house
you built back in the day…

246
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,117
<i>The guest has become the owner…</i>

247
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,371
<i>…and the owner the guest.</i>

248
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,498
<i>I guess the house…</i>

249
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,836
<i>and our relationship</i>
<i>will probably keep evolving.</i>

250
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:04,838
By the way,

251
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:06,924
my plans…

252
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,134
My hotel.

253
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:13,430
My birthday party. My cake.

254
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,900
-I'll get going.
-Bye.

255
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:25,818
Bye.

256
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,705
Come again…
even if you don't find an answer.

257
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,332
The passcode hasn't changed.

258
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,176
Bye.

259
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:52,594
Okay.

260
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,101
Take care.

261
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,185
Bye.

262
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,103
Take care.

263
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,438
-Bye.
-Next time, call first.

264
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,355
I won't.

265
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:10,070
I thought we'd be
checking out of the hotel at this time.

266
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,531
My parents are checking out
of our place instead.

267
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,493
It was meaningful in its own way.

268
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,746
No, Do-ha.

269
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,998
We still have more than
a dozen events left.

270
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,041
Right.

271
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,210
All those days on our calendar
are waiting for us!

272
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,211
They're waiting!

273
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,592
DECEMBER 20, SKI DAY

274
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:32,551
SAFETY ALERT

275
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,469
What do we do?

276
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,643
We don't have to worry about traffic

277
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:45,022
or roads closures from snow,
because we're taking the train.

278
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,482
-You got the tickets?
-Yes.

279
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,858
DEC 21, SOLSTICE STAR TOUR

280
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:48,776
Oh, my.

281
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:52,404
Did you forget today was
Patan-myeon's quarterly meeting,

282
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,323
Dr. Song, Master Baek?

283
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,617
Su-bak, are you okay?

284
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,659
DEC 23, MOVIE DAY

285
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:58,660
Are you okay?

286
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,578
SU-BAK CARE DAY

287
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,871
We won't go anywhere.

288
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:04,333
Right. How could we
go anywhere without you?

289
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,376
It's going to be all right.

290
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:09,463
It's okay.

291
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:11,590
We still have Christmas left.

292
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,719
But it feels like
the second we step out of the house,

293
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,846
everything falls apart.
It's like some curse.

294
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,142
If that's the case,
should we do it at home?

295
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,061
A home party?

296
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,187
Just the two of us?

297
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,898
Yes. This is our first Christmas together.

298
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,527
It's quite meaningful.

299
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,655
-I love it.
-Right?

300
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,368
I like it.

301
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,293
SEUL AND SEUNG-TAEK, 486 DAYS IN LOVE

302
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,587
SEUL AND SEUNG-TAEK,
2-YEAR ANNIVERSARY

303
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:53,257
SEUL AND SEUNG-TAEK,
100-DAY ANNIVERSARY

304
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,346
-Hey, I'm here.
-Oh, hey.

305
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,227
What are you doing here?

306
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:09,857
Did you come here
because you were thinking of me?

307
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,442
No, I came to have <i>ramyeon</i>.

308
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,239
I see.
A 12-year history is overwhelming.

309
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,118
This is my go-to shop.
Be careful not to cross paths.

310
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,203
Don't you know it's my friend's shop?

311
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,582
We dated for 12 years.
Your friend is my friend too.

312
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,250
Go make another friend!

313
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,377
I like<i> namatamago</i> here.

314
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,963
Okay. I'll leave.

315
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,258
Enjoy. I'll come another time.

316
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,342
Okay, bye.

317
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,904
How do we happen to meet here?

318
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:58,447
Tell me about it.

319
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:06,622
I thought we were the most
perfect couple ever back then.

320
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:08,749
By the way…

321
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,711
are you here to see our photo too?

322
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,589
No. I'll ask them to get rid of it.

323
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,884
We've been stuck here for too long.

324
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,518
Good. That's exactly what I wanted.
Do whatever you want!

325
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:59,216
Nothing beats home.
Classics are classics for a reason.

326
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,344
I know.
I feel so calm and relaxed.

327
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,015
Let's just enjoy ourselves
with no interruptions.

328
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,393
Sounds good.

329
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,319
Since we opened,

330
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,656
the two of you are the only ones
who have come here every Christmas.

331
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,784
Is your girlfriend running late?

332
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:30,372
Would you like me to bring you
the salmon tartare she usually has?

333
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,541
Actually--

334
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,834
She's here.

335
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,680
Aren't you training?
Why do we keep running into each other?

336
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,974
We see each other
more than when we were together.

337
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,854
Right back at you.
Why are you at every place I'm going to?

338
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,772
That feels unfair.

339
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,066
You think I'm still lurking around you?

340
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:01,820
Is this place yours? It's mine too.

341
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,322
My go-to place for ten years.

342
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,990
I'm here because I'm a regular too.

343
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,284
Now that you're here,
I guess I should leave again.

344
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,453
You ruined this Christmas again!

345
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,873
-What?
-Every Christmas with you

346
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,458
has always been like this.

347
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,544
Seul, I should be the one saying that.

348
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,842
<i>Let's get married.</i>

349
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,472
That guy's lines are so cringey.

350
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:32,559
Your offhand lines are kind of annoying,

351
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,352
but somehow better.

352
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,897
<i>Why the rush to get married now?</i>

353
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,984
Isn't my face a bit more annoying?

354
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,405
Way too handsome.

355
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:47,449
I agree.

356
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,121
I mean, Do-ha.

357
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,083
You're way too handsome,
ridiculously so.

358
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,292
What?

359
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:00,045
It wouldn't hurt
if you were ugly for a day.

360
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:01,922
Maybe every other day.

361
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,092
So, it's a bit hard for me.

362
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,557
What about your eyes?

363
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,936
Could they sparkle just a little?

364
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,063
Maybe take a break on holidays.

365
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,565
It's a bit hard for me too.

366
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:27,114
And your smile is so cute,
ridiculously so.

367
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,950
Why are your hands so warm,

368
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,618
ridiculously so?

369
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:34,496
You're sexy with glasses, sexy without,

370
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,914
ridiculously so.

371
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,500
When you get mad, you're so adorable.

372
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:48,051
And your eyebrows are so perfect,
ridiculously so.

373
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:51,847
Your voice is so incredible,
ridiculously so.

374
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,640
Why's your nose so pretty…

375
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:56,643
and so high?

376
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,811
Ridiculously so.

377
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,108
Your eyelashes are…

378
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,070
so pretty.

379
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,282
Want to go upstairs?

380
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:20,250
What is it?

381
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,880
Why are you just standing there?

382
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,592
Who do you think is responsible
for ruining Christmas?

383
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,093
You two are pros at fighting.

384
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:34,097
Let's hear it clearly from the experts
who the culprit is.

385
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,350
Well…

386
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,687
It's Christmas.
Can't you just make up and move on?

387
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:45,400
Speaking of Christmas,
I remember our first Christmas.

388
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:50,197
Because of his super important training,
he stood me up for two hours.

389
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,741
We have to mention
the following Christmas.

390
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:56,494
I bought expensive wine and you said
it tasted awful and went for <i>soju</i>.

391
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:00,624
Oh, right.
And the necklace I got you? You lost it.

392
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,584
Cost me my first paycheck
in the new team.

393
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,919
Oh, right.

394
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,670
Remember the Christmas in 2015?

395
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,506
It was my first Christmas alone
since you were on a trip,

396
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,551
and you said it wasn't a big deal.

397
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,429
-You went too far with that.
-Hey.

398
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:17,265
That day was when I lost the game
five to zero.

399
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,225
Look who's talking.

400
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:22,103
You said that stupid game
was no big deal to me!

401
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,897
Seul, you went too far with that.

402
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,236
And I've spent so many Christmases alone
while you were in Canada!

403
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,654
Isn't it the same for me?

404
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,530
I was lonely there being alone.

405
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,199
That's enough.

406
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,368
I waited for him
more than 300 days each year.

407
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:39,120
And I've never confessed to her
for 12 years.

408
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:43,625
I waited through a 17-hour time difference
to talk to you on the phone,

409
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,044
but you slept the whole damn day!

410
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,796
The whole damn day?

411
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,005
Yes, the whole damn day!

412
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:52,676
I'd been training nonstop
for 24 hours right before the final.

413
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,220
Some forget their boyfriend's birthday.

414
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,473
This guy tests his girlfriend
with his birthday.

415
00:25:58,556 --> 00:25:59,766
Stay out of this!

416
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:06,189
Did we just get kicked
out of our own place?

417
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,402
By the time we walk around the village,
it should be done, right?

418
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:14,072
Twelve years of their story
should be just as long as ours.

419
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:16,491
Here.

420
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:26,167
-Let's go, Master Baek.
-Let's go, Dr. Song.

421
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,594
The more I see it, the more I like it.

422
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,726
Right, it was here.

423
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,229
This is where my pregnancy rumor began.

424
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,732
Remember?

425
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,361
I called you asking for child support.

426
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,906
If you're going to be a long-distance dad,
do it right.

427
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,575
Send the child support on time.

428
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,617
Just hang up!

429
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,460
The weather's so nice.

430
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:11,171
Look. Here come the newlyweds.

431
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:17,052
This town is perfect for having kids,

432
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,720
because there's nothing else to do.

433
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,432
-Kids these days.
-Right?

434
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,976
Baek Do-ha! What are you going to do?

435
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:28,938
It's okay.

436
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,149
It all started then.

437
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,446
-The rumor is still around.
-Still?

438
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,659
It's okay to hear them now, isn't it?

439
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:44,996
What's that face?

440
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,084
-They've decorated this nicely.
-I know.

441
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:56,383
This is where it started.
Our first accomplishment.

442
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,761
It's <i>mo</i>!

443
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:00,929
It's <i>mo</i>!

444
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:02,847
-Yay!
-We won!

445
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:03,765
It's <i>mo</i>!

446
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:09,479
Had we lost, we wouldn't have begun
the fence and observatory projects.

447
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,649
That game changed a lot of things.

448
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,944
I can't believe
we're spending Christmas together.

449
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,366
Every corner of the village
has become a summary of life.

450
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,618
It's not awful anymore.

451
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:27,163
Why do you think I've been waiting
for this day so badly?

452
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:31,668
Oh, right.
I wanted to go somewhere with you.

453
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,420
Where?

454
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,340
What did you do hanging on this bar?

455
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,634
I cooled off

456
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:44,597
my frustration, anxiety, anger…

457
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,851
and the longing to see you.

458
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,948
There's something I've wanted to do
when you do this.

459
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,701
What is it?

460
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,380
What was that?

461
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,144
Su-bak.

462
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,979
Why are you alone?

463
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:36,399
Lee Seul. Oh Seung-taek.

464
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,400
Did you leave?

465
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:41,488
Seung-taek.

466
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,240
I think they left.

467
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:45,992
Oh Seung-taek!

468
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,497
Did they just leave after fighting?

469
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:54,584
Is this house some public property?
Everyone's coming and going as they want.

470
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,505
Let's put our host duties on pause.

471
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:01,049
Let's clean this up tomorrow.

472
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,973
Another failure.
Pulling off one event is so hard.

473
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,436
I guess it counted as an event.

474
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,773
Dr. Song and Master Baek's
Patan-myeon tour.

475
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,316
It was meaningful in its own way.

476
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,251
Right. Anniversaries don't really matter.

477
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,127
What matters is I'm with you

478
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,589
during winter.

479
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,760
No. It matters to me.

480
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,096
I'll make one work.

481
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,933
Sure. There's still New Year's Eve,

482
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,103
and the sunrise on January 1st.

483
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,439
I have to clean up.

484
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,777
Procrastinating isn't my thing.

485
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,237
Maybe tomorrow.

486
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,115
After we wake up…

487
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:10,994
let's catch up on everything
we couldn't do.

488
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,036
Okay.

489
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:19,294
There's one more person, so the
house chores should be divided equally.

490
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:36,477
SIX MONTHS LATER

491
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,730
JONG-MAN JR.

492
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,844
Ha-gyeong, look at this mess.

493
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,350
I didn't think of this.

494
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,936
One more person means
three times the chores.

495
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,354
It's strange.

496
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,606
I cleaned everything
before my business trip.

497
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,942
How did this place end up like this
in five days?

498
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,485
What about you?

499
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,612
Su-bak's bath is overdue by two days.

500
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,073
Su-bak's been stinky for two days
because of you!

501
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,242
Well…

502
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:37,914
Because of Professor Hermann's schedule,
the meeting got delayed.

503
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,207
I had no choice.

504
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,000
What a lame excuse.

505
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:44,545
Hey.

506
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:49,717
I told you to separate the colors.
I spent a lot to get that archive edition.

507
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:56,766
Are you that upset?

508
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,352
Is that so?

509
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,897
Now this T-shirt matters more than me?

510
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,027
Wait a minute.

511
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,071
Go.

512
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,531
Just go.

513
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,075
You switched the conditioner to rosemary?

514
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,416
I'm sorry I'm late.

515
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,379
Let go. I'm going to kill you.

516
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:34,512
We haven't met in a while.

517
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:37,640
Let's stop being upset
and do what we didn't get to do.

518
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,726
What didn't we do?

519
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,687
Seriously, what did we do?
You don't know? I'll let you know.

520
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,689
-Hey.
-I'll take a quick shower.

521
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,274
-Hang on a bit.
-Hey, forget it!

522
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,574
What's wrong?

523
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,787
-Nothing.
-Aren't you feeling well?

524
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,665
I'm okay. Go wash up.

525
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,625
Okay.

526
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,309
It's endless.

527
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,070
KIM DA-YE

528
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,071
At this hour?

529
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,239
Hi, Da-ye.

530
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,494
Ha-gyeong's not feeling well.

531
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,120
If it can wait, maybe later.

532
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,873
<i>It must be from yesterday's team dinner.</i>

533
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,501
<i>Looks like she overdid it even more</i>
<i>with the farewell.</i>

534
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,627
Farewell?

535
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,713
Is someone getting demoted again?

536
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,924
<i>You didn't know?</i>

537
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,967
<i>Ms. Song submitted</i>
<i>a one-year leave request.</i>

538
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:55,885
What?

539
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,181
Wait, a leave of absence?

540
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:02,767
For an entire year?

541
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,043
Junior.

542
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,257
This is your first meeting
with Director Baek?

543
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,134
-Yes.
-Brace yourself.

544
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:40,471
He's so thorough,
he makes plans from A to Z.

545
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,310
With designs like this,
there won't be any work-life balance.

546
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,064
-Do you have a girlfriend?
-Yes.

547
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:52,692
Ask for her forgiveness.

548
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:57,864
Right, and a sleeping bag for all-nighters
is a must when coming to work.

549
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,074
A sleeping bag.

550
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,701
Okay, a sleeping bag.

551
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:15,965
Director Baek.

552
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,758
-Yes?
-Here.

553
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,393
This looks good.

554
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,521
The line's now moved and…

555
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,107
Hyun, you're using curves now.
You've grown.

556
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,108
Good.

557
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,446
-Is the next one done by the newbie?
-Yes.

558
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,282
For a first-timer, it's classic and nice.

559
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,368
-Yes, looks good. I see the potential.
-It looks good?

560
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,664
Everything looks good.
Let's head out on time today.

561
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,334
Time to go home!

562
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:57,423
Take a day off tomorrow.
Just get some rest.

563
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,509
Go home now!

564
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,646
I'll do it.

565
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,815
Stay inside. It feels chilly.

566
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,026
It's over 34°C today.

567
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,071
No, not really. It's still winter.

568
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:22,740
Head inside.

569
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,617
-You're acting weird.
-No.

570
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,701
What's gotten into you?

571
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,536
I'll take care of it.

572
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,955
Be careful.

573
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:29,956
Hold on.

574
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,753
What's all this?

575
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,380
Is it some party?

576
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:41,592
Eat up.

577
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,391
And no more work dinners from now on.

578
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,893
You're so responsible,
but it's too much for your body.

579
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:52,895
What do you mean?

580
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,608
It's all good. The best.

581
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,361
Now eat up.

582
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:06,409
So…

583
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:09,704
when are you going to tell me?

584
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,710
Nothing. Whenever you're ready.

585
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,086
Take your time.

586
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,425
Aren't you going to bed?

587
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,596
Aren't you going to bed?

588
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,605
MUSIC FOR EXPECTING MOMS AND BABIES

589
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:39,108
What is it?

590
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,112
Hey.

591
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:46,490
What are you doing?

592
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,455
You two sleep first.

593
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,666
Sleep first.

594
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,009
So adorable.

595
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:08,804
So cute, right?

596
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,848
That's cute.

597
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,516
You got a new boyfriend?

598
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,353
Your jewelry changes
with the guy you're seeing.

599
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,814
By the way, why are we here?
Is Director Jeon having a baby?

600
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,360
-Seul.
-Yes?

601
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:25,446
What would you do if your friend
kept a huge secret from you?

602
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:29,867
I don't know.

603
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:33,913
Maybe they're hiding it for a reason.

604
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,290
What if that secret is life-changing?

605
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:40,002
What if you can't just stand by,
as a friend?

606
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,506
This one?

607
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,968
Is there one with a more subtle stone?

608
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,846
Without the knuckle effect,
something that hurts less.

609
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,767
Is there a ring
that isn't too heavy or too light,

610
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,020
one that feels barely there
and blends into daily life?

611
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,271
But with a large diamond.

612
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:01,357
Certainly, I'll check that for you.

613
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,400
Thanks.

614
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,943
I asked the question first.

615
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,572
Are you seeing someone?

616
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:10,616
Oh, well…

617
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,034
Just…

618
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:15,204
<i>Who's the guy you've been seeing?</i>

619
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,122
It's just some guy.

620
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,373
Why do you keep asking?

621
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:20,418
You're keeping that a secret?
Come on. Tell me.

622
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,504
-Why do you keep asking?
-Come on. Who is it?

623
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,298
Seung-taek.

624
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,092
What?

625
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:29,927
Hey.

626
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,279
Since when?

627
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:52,116
Why did you keep it from me
that you two got back together?

628
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:56,328
Just in case something goes wrong again…

629
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,707
Why didn't you tell me?

630
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,542
Well, I tried.

631
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:05,671
But every time I did,
you say you're out for a walk with Song,

632
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,257
or traveling with her,
or shopping with her.

633
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,094
Wait, then…

634
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,221
Oh Seung-taek.

635
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:18,100
Was it really yours?

636
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,560
What now?

637
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,688
-"What now?"
-I mean this.

638
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:24,523
Why is it here?

639
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,322
Wasn't it ours?

640
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,657
Was it theirs?

641
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,285
What are you talking about?

642
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,999
By the way, since when?

643
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:51,967
On our first Christmas,

644
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,012
I made you wait two hours

645
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,432
because I went overboard
trying to choose the best gift.

646
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,561
I didn't drink wine and chose <i>soju</i>

647
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:07,441
because I wanted to stay sober
a little longer with you.

648
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,819
I can't handle wine well.

649
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,784
You were my lucky charm.

650
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:23,457
Even with the 17-hour time difference,
you managed to stay awake

651
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,961
to call me whenever I had a match.

652
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,715
Was it Christmas seven years ago?

653
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:35,970
You came to see me
even though you had a match

654
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,138
the next day.

655
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,684
I did. For just three hours.

656
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,188
I just saw you at the airport
and flew back.

657
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,150
I just missed you so much.

658
00:42:58,033 --> 00:42:59,618
I actually went there

659
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,621
because I wanted to see you.

660
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,791
I was hoping to run into you again,

661
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:09,712
because we went there every Christmas.

662
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,759
Hoping for a Christmas miracle.

663
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:20,639
Seung-taek, let's--

664
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,141
I can't be your friend.

665
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,476
I still…

666
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,024
like you so much.

667
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,444
How can we be friends?

668
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:07,144
What have I done all along?

669
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,520
What have you done?

670
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,106
Did you think I was pregnant?

671
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:17,237
Da-ye told me you took a leave
for an entire year.

672
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,366
I did that…

673
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,078
to try med school again.

674
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:28,457
I decided to start studying again.

675
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:32,920
But you've been gagging a lot
and rubbing your stomach lately.

676
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,213
That's because of that day.

677
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,632
The team dinner and farewell party
lasted till dawn.

678
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:39,093
-I didn't feel fine.
-You've been putting on weight.

679
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:42,971
Is this funny?

680
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:47,601
It's because of you.
You cook three times a day for me.

681
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,403
Then we should do this.

682
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,738
Let's have a joint wedding.

683
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:01,907
What?

684
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:03,742
A home wedding.

685
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:08,205
In fact,
I've prepared something for you.

686
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:10,582
Prepare what?

687
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,463
VIRGIN ROAD
AISLE - ALTAR

688
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,464
Here.

689
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,466
This is the aisle.

690
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,010
There will likely be
many older guests from Patan.

691
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,096
So space out the seats in units.

692
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,974
In front of the gate,
we can set up a floral arch

693
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,518
that connects with the flowers
along the aisle.

694
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,815
And we'll turn this common area
into a photo zone.

695
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:38,277
We can decorate it nicely,
so people can take pictures.

696
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,028
Upstairs, the bride's room.

697
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,738
The first floor is barrier-free.

698
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,491
Seul's grandpa and Seung-taek
will be comfortable.

699
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:47,870
The outdoor tables
will be laid out in a zigzag

700
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,746
for the traffic flow and spaciousness.

701
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:52,541
That's it.

702
00:46:02,885 --> 00:46:03,719
What's wrong?

703
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:05,512
It's just…

704
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,058
I'm not into having a joint one.

705
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,148
<i>Does this make sense?</i>

706
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:18,901
I wanted to be the groom,
but I'm the planner.

707
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,986
Tell me about it.

708
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:23,447
I thought you were from a wedding company.

709
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,534
Don't tell me you've been married before.

710
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,246
So many times.

711
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,207
What?

712
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:36,919
To marry you,
I did all the sketches and research.

713
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,046
Everything was prepared.

714
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:40,923
Like what?

715
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:45,844
Like remodeling the house into a nursery,
researching a first birthday ring,

716
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,055
and checking out
hospitals and postpartum care…

717
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:52,851
We can't lose to them.
You can't even sleep if you lose, right?

718
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:55,103
But you know what?

719
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:56,855
Today is that day.

720
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,274
Let's just sleep.

721
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,786
-So cute.
-Yes, I like it.

722
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,454
Stand there.

723
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,090
-What is this?
-So cute, isn't it?

724
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,510
Yes, the roses and pansies.

725
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,720
Will hydrangeas be available that day?

726
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,140
Yes.

727
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,686
You think this photo is better
than this one?

728
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:36,937
This is way better.

729
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,982
-Both of them look better in this one.
-Okay.

730
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,903
The two of them
are really getting married

731
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,405
at our house tomorrow?

732
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:50,367
Right, it's their last night.
I wonder what they're up to today.

733
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:57,624
I've been your senior,

734
00:47:58,584 --> 00:47:59,418
a boyfriend,

735
00:48:00,168 --> 00:48:02,004
and a friend,

736
00:48:03,422 --> 00:48:05,215
but I didn't think I could be family.

737
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:07,593
Because I thought

738
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:11,054
that was something
that could never happen.

739
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:16,101
The road ahead with me will be icy,

740
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,520
but I'll become braver.

741
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,690
I'll drop my pride.

742
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,817
I'll let you win more.

743
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,694
I'll smile more.

744
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,993
I was actually scared

745
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:36,288
that bringing up marriage again

746
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:40,792
might make us break up.

747
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,418
It feels like the dream
I've had all my life…

748
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,631
has finally come true.

749
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,078
SEUNG-TAEK AND SEUL

750
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,100
Thank you.

751
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:26,022
Oh, my.

752
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,649
Oh, my goodness.

753
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,028
Oh, hello.

754
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,613
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

755
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,867
-It's been so long.
-It's been a while.

756
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:39,911
-Look at you! You've grown so much.
-You've really grown.

757
00:50:40,495 --> 00:50:41,955
-Congratulations.
-See you inside.

758
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:53,925
The purpose of this wedding is
to announce the union of both parties

759
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:57,471
and to establish their relationship
as life partners.

760
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,390
Hi. Let me see.

761
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,808
You've really dressed up.

762
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:02,809
WEDDING PROGRAM

763
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,394
1. INTRODUCTION
2. PREPARATION

764
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:07,564
How come it's so stiff?
This isn't a courtroom.

765
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,232
This is my style. Move over.

766
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,901
-Seriously.
-Move out of the way.

767
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:14,362
Hello. Go straight inside.

768
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,322
Hello.

769
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,239
I got it.

770
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:20,660
-Congratulations, Seul.
-Thanks.

771
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,078
-See you out there.
-Good luck.

772
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:22,996
Congratulations.

773
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:32,088
Perfect.

774
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,344
Let's go.

775
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:49,689
<i>Here comes the groom.</i>

776
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,235
Here I come!

777
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:56,488
Thank you.

778
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:10,752
Congratulations.

779
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:14,589
Now the bride, the star of today,
will make her entrance.

780
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:20,303
I hope all the guests will welcome her
with a round of enthusiastic cheers.

781
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,941
Please welcome the bride.

782
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:16,985
Don't cry.

783
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:23,158
They look amazing. Whose friends are they?

784
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:26,119
Pretty amazing, right? They're my friends.

785
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:33,043
Next, Village Head Go
will give the officiant's speech.

786
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,211
Give him a round of applause.

787
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:51,394
Marriage is more than a promise
between two people.

788
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,146
It's the beginning

789
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:56,733
of an everlasting bond shared with family.

790
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:03,406
Just as today begins
under this clear, blue sky,

791
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,701
there will be moments of

792
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:10,246
stormy winds…

793
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,631
I mean,

794
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,634
those winds will only make you…

795
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:25,428
They will only make you stronger.

796
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,472
Are you okay?

797
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,224
-What do we do?
-It's too windy.

798
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:37,732
So, just live well, be happy.

799
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:42,028
-Thank you so much for the warm words.
-Oh, no.

800
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:45,824
Considering the weather,
we'll keep the ceremony brief.

801
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:48,702
There's only one thing
that really matters at a wedding.

802
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:52,288
Next, we'll have the marriage vows
and notarization.

803
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:55,375
Bride and groom,
please look at each other.

804
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:02,257
Groom, will you love the bride
for all eternity?

805
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,093
Yes.

806
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:10,140
Bride, will you love the groom
for all eternity?

807
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:12,600
Yes!

808
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:17,147
Very well, then. I now pronounce you

809
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,482
husband and wife.

810
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,150
I'm throwing it.

811
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,618
-Su-bak!
-Hey, Song Su-bak.

812
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:17,499
Su-bak.

813
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,002
Why are you bringing this to me?

814
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,587
He's the flower boy.

815
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,924
Next up is Dr. Song.

816
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:26,841
Hey.

817
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,771
Everyone!

818
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:41,106
-Enjoy the food.
-Thanks.

819
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,065
A little more.

820
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:44,567
To be honest,
you were a disaster as the MC.

821
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,361
Then why didn't you do it yourself?

822
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:47,737
You said you'd do it.

823
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:54,119
Are you guys having a drink already?

824
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,663
Thank you.

825
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,333
Cheers.

826
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:02,877
-Hurry up.
-I'm coming with you.

827
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,379
Be careful, kiddos!

828
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,341
Seeing the kids,
I can tell this house hasn't changed.

829
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,222
Let's take a group photo outside.

830
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,265
Everyone, come on out!

831
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,267
-Okay.
-Let's go.

832
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,310
All right, one, two, three, smile!

833
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:29,946
Let's stick it on.

834
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,364
What a great picture.

835
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,490
So cute, right?

836
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,659
Yes. I wonder who took them.

837
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,122
All done?

838
00:57:47,881 --> 00:57:49,591
When are we going to clean all this up?

839
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:52,594
I know.

840
00:57:53,094 --> 00:57:54,220
What do you think of us?

841
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:01,311
You told me
a house tells you about its owner.

842
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:03,980
You and me.

843
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:05,732
What do you think of us?

844
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,617
We're doing great

845
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,578
and will surely keep doing well.

846
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:20,955
That's what it's telling me.

847
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:27,003
Not sure if the house changed us…

848
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:29,005
Or if we changed the house.

849
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:34,594
Let's begin.

850
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:53,696
Do-ha.

851
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:55,490
Come here.

852
00:58:58,618 --> 00:58:59,786
Remember this?

853
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:00,703
Of course.

854
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,664
This is where my first love began.

855
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:05,708
Did you like me back then?

856
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,336
Of course.

857
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:10,713
Me too.

858
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:14,551
Put it up.

859
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:15,802
There's a lot to clean up.

860
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:29,566
<i>We met one summer when we were 12,</i>
<i>and now we're 30.</i>

861
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,443
<i>It's already our 19th summer.</i>

862
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:38,908
Wow! I won!

863
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:42,412
<i>From the first summer we spent together…</i>

864
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,038
Oh, no.

865
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,166
One, two, three.

866
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:54,340
I'm going to like you all summer long.

867
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:57,760
<i>If you don't join me this summer,</i>

868
00:59:58,720 --> 00:59:59,887
<i>it means nothing to me.</i>

869
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:01,472
-Hey!
-Hey!

870
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:08,354
Ha-gyeong. I'm not leaving.

871
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:16,279
I like you.

872
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:20,033
Are you really leaving? Don't go.

873
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:23,911
I like you.

874
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:31,502
So warm.

875
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:37,842
JONG-MAN JR

876
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,476
<i>And now…</i>

877
01:00:47,852 --> 01:00:49,896
<i>Back to our 19th summer.</i>

878
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,192
<i>How many summers…</i>

879
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:57,278
<i>Do we still have ahead of us?</i>

880
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,601
<i>Today might be our last summer.</i>

881
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:31,979
<i>But we'll love each other</i>
<i>like it's our first.</i>

882
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:35,191
<i>-And we'll love each other…</i>
<i>-We'll love each other…</i>

883
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:37,443
<i>-like it's our last.</i>
<i>-like it's our last.</i>

884
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,678
<i>-This summer is always…</i>
<i>-This summer is always…</i>

885
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,515
<i>-our last summer.</i>
<i>-our last summer.</i>

886
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:20,421
THANKS FOR WATCHING LAST SUMMER
