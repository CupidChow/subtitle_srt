1
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,538
TWO YEARS AGO

2
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,124
I'm all packed, but…

3
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,584
I'm still thinking about it.

4
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,501
DAD

5
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,421
Thinking about what?
Weren't you coming back to Korea?

6
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,548
I just need a plan.

7
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,633
This summer had to be different.

8
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:56,097
Last summer,
the rainy season was pretty long.

9
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:03,146
The sky was always gloomy,
so I couldn't see any stars at all.

10
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:08,068
It was the hottest,
most boring summer of my life.

11
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,029
Was it all because

12
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,866
I couldn't finish my 100th war
with Ha-gyeong?

13
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,037
ONE YEAR AGO

14
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,163
In your name? Now?

15
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,958
No, soon. Ha-gyeong will ask for
the power of attorney. Do it then.

16
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,168
Please upload this file.

17
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,545
You're worried Ha-gyeong
might sell the peanut house?

18
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,882
I just won't give her
the power of attorney.

19
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:34,761
Then she'd have to fight with you, Dad.
That'd only make things harder for her.

20
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,681
You're the only adult
she has left around her.

21
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,101
If she fights with you,
how do you think she'd feel?

22
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,816
She needs to fight with me.

23
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:55,615
I've lived in this town for 17 years.

24
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,660
I'm sure you can make it happen too.

25
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:00,411
June in Seoul is still warming up.

26
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,579
We can do it!

27
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:07,168
This year, it might be hotter than summer.

28
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,546
But by July,

29
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,882
summer in Patan
will get pretty extreme too.

30
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,428
I have no choice
but to prepare thoroughly.

31
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,559
Even if something unexpected happens,
it's okay.

32
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,980
I came prepared to get hurt, at least.

33
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:32,152
TWO YEARS AGO

34
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,366
Baek Do-young died, didn't he?

35
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,452
That was a year ago.

36
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,290
Right?

37
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:55,425
Why did you… pretend to be Do-young?

38
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,094
What's the reason?

39
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:02,807
Why did you pretend to be Baek Do-young,
write letters, send emails,

40
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,894
and even talk to me on the phone? Why?

41
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,897
MAIN BUDDHA HALL

42
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,732
How could you do this to me?

43
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,359
Say something, Baek Do-ha.

44
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:18,615
Say something! At least make an excuse!

45
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,702
The result of trying hard
to keep anyone from getting hurt…

46
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,330
was just this.

47
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,956
Let's never see each other again.

48
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:32,795
So you resent me…

49
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,341
this summer.

50
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:39,886
I'll spend this summer…

51
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,430
liking you.

52
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,896
My 100th war with Ha-gyeong…

53
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,732
has finally begun well.

54
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,193
What did you say?

55
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,864
There's no one else you can hate but me.

56
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,242
Because I'm the only one left.

57
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,578
So hate me all you want.

58
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,372
By my side.

59
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,084
I'll do what I want too.

60
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:12,961
That's you liking me?

61
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:17,382
You do what you want. I'll do what I want.

62
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,009
Let's try enduring it.

63
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,887
You crazy bastard.

64
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,598
Being crazy
is better than regretting all day.

65
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,394
Two years of just waiting…

66
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,815
and doing nothing is enough.

67
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,791
Want to watch it together?

68
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,668
TAKING CARE OF SU-BAK

69
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,171
"Su-bak cries a lot,
so wash his face often…"

70
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:04,762
Hey, Su-bak!

71
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,307
Where did your mom go?

72
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,978
It's not even July yet,
but the weather is extreme already.

73
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,480
And in the end…

74
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,318
Song Ha-gyeong left the peanut house.

75
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,123
PROJECT TRANSFER REQUEST FORM

76
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,383
I have something to tell you.

77
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,721
Are you kidding me?

78
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:51,851
You made such a fuss last time
to impress the mayor,

79
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,770
and now you want to quit?

80
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,565
Cheontan Senior Center and the Disabled
Welfare Center haven't been completed.

81
00:05:57,648 --> 00:05:58,649
I'll take those on.

82
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:03,654
Considering you love the attention,
I got you the perfect position

83
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,783
and now you're changing your mind?

84
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,118
I won't fire you
even if you don't pull this stunt.

85
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,453
-Please stop--
-No!

86
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,830
I'm serious. Please fire me.

87
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,667
Song Ha-gyeong, what are you--

88
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:23,508
Yes, this is Manager Jeon Ye-eun.

89
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,469
Yes, I understand. Bye.

90
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,684
Stop talking and follow me.
The mayor's asking for you.

91
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,357
-Hello, sir.
-Come, have a seat.

92
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,193
Hello.

93
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,657
What are you doing?

94
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,201
All right.

95
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:57,125
Director Baek won the grand prize
at the Seoul Architecture Awards,

96
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,168
and Ms. Song is a graduate
of Patan High.

97
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,381
I have high expectations
for the synergy you'll create.

98
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,970
The only high school
in Patan-myeon shut down,

99
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,346
so it was all over the news.

100
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,225
Keep the public and media on track
without any noise,

101
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,602
and do a good job, okay?

102
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,897
The project wraps up next month,
right around your re-election, sir.

103
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:23,776
Winning the architecture award
before the re-election would be perfect.

104
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,112
I'm really looking forward to this.

105
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:31,826
Anyway, I hope
everyone will support Director Baek.

106
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,286
Power!

107
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,456
-Power!
-Power!

108
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,541
Power.

109
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,042
Power.

110
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,341
Things aren't going your way?

111
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,765
TRANSFER REQUEST FORM

112
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,394
Did you say you wanted to quit
because it didn't work out?

113
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,943
It's been three days. You want me
to bring you some stuff you need?

114
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,904
You left your tablet too.

115
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,990
-You went to Seul's house?
-That's--

116
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,910
-Ms. Song?
-Hello.

117
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,874
Mr. Baek,
as you know, this is a public space.

118
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,793
I'd appreciate it if you spoke formally.

119
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,337
The space ratio--

120
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,132
The green zone appears limited,
but it meets the Pacheon building codes.

121
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:34,305
Tourists and staff
need to have separate routes.

122
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,724
That's indicated
in the detailed design plans.

123
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,477
I just resent the file to you.

124
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,491
Want to see the elevations?
You might get something out of it.

125
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:59,539
As for this budget,
the design fee is set below the average.

126
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,833
I'll get back to you regarding that issue.

127
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:11,467
Ha-gyeong, you have to work with me
face-to-face till you're sick of it.

128
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,554
So stop questioning my feelings.

129
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,055
Let's face it fair and square.

130
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,858
You must be insane.

131
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,404
Hey, Song, how much did you drink?

132
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,115
-Seul.
-What's up?

133
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,658
You've been sober for a year.

134
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:39,370
Hey, stop drinking.
Stop, you troublemaker!

135
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:40,997
-Hey!
-Seriously!

136
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,295
Get it together.

137
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,213
-Hey.
-Take off your shoes.

138
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,967
Why am I so shaken up

139
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,555
by some American puppy's tricks?

140
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:02,768
For him, lawsuits and work
are all just simple games.

141
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:08,983
When he leaves,

142
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,570
I'll be alone again.

143
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:20,953
Work and home are a mess right now.

144
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,591
Stop questioning
and let's face it fair and square.

145
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,509
Fair and square.

146
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:40,389
No! Hey, Song Ha-gyeong!

147
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,770
Hey, why did you leave your own house
because of that jerk?

148
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,274
-Hey, why did you--
-Don't.

149
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,276
Why give up a 12-billion-won project?

150
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,403
It'd be easier if that jerk quit.

151
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,822
Don't throw things.

152
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,074
I'll make sure…

153
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,326
he knows who's in charge.

154
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,911
Why are you throwing a bag?

155
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,037
You're going to…

156
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,166
leave this place before long, you drifter!

157
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,418
You bastard!

158
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:12,671
It hurts.

159
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,716
Seul, it hurts.

160
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,302
MOTHER-IN-LAW'S KIMCHI STEW

00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,432

PATAN-MYEON VILLAGE HEADS' ASSOCIATION
PAVENGERS

173
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:57,341
Village heads, as you can see,

174
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,261
an outsider architect
is trying to change our school.

175
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,055
Village heads,
you're so devoted to our school.

176
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,600
I know you'd oppose it
even if I don't mention it,

177
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,644
but I brought you here just in case.

178
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:13,649
By the way, Song is dining out in Patan.

179
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:17,987
You all love
this Mother-in-law's kimchi stew.

180
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,113
It's delicious.

181
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,366
Shall we enjoy our meal then?

182
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,453
Eat up. It'll get cold.

183
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,037
PACHEON,
WHERE NATURE BREATHES

184
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,750
SCHEDULE

185
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:35,129
SAT - VILLAGE HEADS' MEETING
SUN - WOMEN'S ASSOC. AZALEA WINE

186
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,047
Gotta admit, I'm a genius.

187
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:43,554
Why should this genius leave?
I'll make you leave. Just wait.

188
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,515
Tae-young,
we need to spread out these panels.

189
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,310
-This side?
-The colors don't match the surrounding.

190
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,603
Try making it again.

191
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,397
SONG HA-GYEONG

192
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:03,616
Yes, Ms. Song.
I was just about to call you.

193
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:07,953
I set the date for the town hall meeting.
It's tomorrow. Can you make it?

194
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,249
The sooner the better. Thank you.
See you tomorrow.

195
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,003
What?

196
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,715
Hey, you have that town hall plan file
I sent before, right?

197
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:20,674
Pull it up quick.

198
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,511
Are you really going to do it?

199
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,554
Hey, Director Baek.

200
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,724
If we're going to do it, do it right.
No regrets.

201
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,185
What? Where?

202
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,234
PATAN MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION

203
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:39,860
PATAN WOMEN'S ASSOCIATION

204
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,403
What's all this?

205
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,705
-I want to finish it all at once.
-What?

206
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,084
I know revising the budget
is a headache for you.

207
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:59,797
I'll complete the schedule you spent
the whole week on in just one day. I will.

208
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,598
-Hello!
-Hello!

209
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,601
Ladies and gentlemen of the Council,

210
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,020
and our honored merchants,

211
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:18,566
-what day is today?
-Azalea wine brewing day!

212
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,526
This is a village festival.

213
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,737
Since it's hosted at
the Women's Association president's place,

214
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:26,532
I set up some parasols for you all.

215
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,621
All right, ladies.

216
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,999
Remove the calyx and toss it over here.

217
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,750
Leave the stamens as they are.

218
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,502
-Okay.
-You're doing great.

219
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:44,800
Wait, this isn't right.
Why am I picking calyxes here?

220
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:46,635
It's hot.

221
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,262
Hot!

222
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,098
It's nice and spacious,
but the heat's the problem.

223
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:55,561
My goodness,
Madam President, are you hot? Wear this.

224
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,563
It's cool.

225
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,607
I'll bring something to drink.

226
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,318
-I'm hot too!
-Got it.

227
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,905
This spot needs to dry completely.

228
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,866
-Here, have a drink.
-Thank you.

229
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:09,783
Thank you.

230
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,078
-I didn't get one.
-I'll bring you one.

231
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:17,458
Since it's hot, our Dr. Song
should say a few cool words.

232
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,461
-Me?
-Yes.

233
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,089
Applause!

234
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:33,432
Yes, these azalea petals you're trimming

235
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,351
will be used to brew
traditional liquor…

236
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,646
-Dugyeonju!
-It'll be used to make dugyeonju.

237
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,649
Every year,
the Women's Association holds this event,

238
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:45,569
removing the calyxes
from these azalea flowers.

239
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,488
Is everyone enjoying themselves?

240
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,365
-Yes!
-Yes!

241
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:55,454
Ms. Song,
they say Patan has lots of azalea flowers.

242
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,831
How many would there be in total?
A thousand?

243
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,794
Roughly speaking, about a million?

244
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,753
-Yes.
-Right?

245
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,421
That's so many.

246
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:08,133
My favorite K-pop song
is "A Million Roses".

247
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,885
Then sing it!

248
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,136
Sing it!

249
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,596
Sing it!

250
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,889
Sing it!

251
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,017
He's an architect.
You can't make him sing.

252
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,645
Madam President, you can't!

253
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:25,818
Long ago, on some star

254
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:29,321
When I came into this world

255
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,198
Oh, my, he sings so well.

256
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,493
I heard a small voice

257
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:40,124
Telling me to give love

258
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:41,375
Great!

259
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,670
Without hate, without hate
Without a hateful heart

260
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,587
So cool!

261
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,630
All together!

262
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:51,927
Generously, generously,
When I only give love

263
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:58,058
A million flowers, a million flowers
A million flowers will bloom

264
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,439
And I can go to my longed-for
Beautiful star

265
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,691
Applause!

266
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,069
What's with him?

267
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,488
Madam President,
please don't make me sing.

268
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,575
He's really lost it.

269
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,702
-Thank you, as always.
-Enjoy it.

270
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,169
Director Baek is usually like that.

271
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,545
Today he's extra pumped up.

272
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,546
I'll get going.

273
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,259
-You must be flustered.
-I'm fine.

274
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,970
-The real show's next.
-Exactly.

275
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,973
Where's next? Let's go.

276
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,701
But clearly, there are no trees here.

277
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,953
The school used to be
full of lush boxwood trees.

278
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,874
Sir, there normally aren't any trees
next to the observatory

279
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,459
because it'd block the view.

280
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,377
We're planning to transplant them.

281
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,339
What? Pull out the school's trees?

282
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:15,886
Why pull them out? Why?
Don't you know the Patan spirit?

283
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:20,099
The evergreen trees
That are green all year

284
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,685
Like the hearts of Patan people

285
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,897
Round sky and round village

286
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,858
Living with mountains and valleys

287
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:30,859
Heave-ho!

288
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,905
Patan

289
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,741
Eternal cradle

290
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:42,121
Let's embrace the clear spirit

291
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,790
Our Patan High School

292
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,505
Anyway, that's the spirit of this school.

293
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,924
What batch were you in?
Don't you even know that?

294
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,969
Well, I…

295
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:58,846
The director isn't from Pacheon.

296
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,599
He's not even Korean. He's American.

297
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,603
He's not from Patan High,

298
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,190
let alone Pacheon-si. It won't be easy.

299
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:13,318
All the contractors and
construction companies are Pacheon locals.

300
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,237
How will you communicate?

301
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,905
You can't! No way!

302
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:21,451
Even I, with dugyeonju and soybean noodle
soup running through my veins,

303
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,371
can't mess with Patan High.
Absolutely not.

304
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:25,664
No chance!

305
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,040
I already met the companies.

306
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,418
And, sir,
I eat soybean noodle soup every day too.

307
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:31,837
No triangles!

308
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,340
Since ancient times,
round things are the sky.

309
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,926
Square things are the earth. Get it?

310
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,763
That's why our Patan-myeon
is surrounded by mountains.

311
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,558
The land is round, the houses are square.

312
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,270
So there's harmony
between heaven and earth.

313
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,482
That's the kind of village it is.
But here…

314
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,236
you want to build a triangle?

315
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,696
Nice!

316
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,658
Goodbye, Baek Do-ha.

317
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,996
Village Head Go,
if you looked at the proposal,

318
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,874
the building itself isn't triangular.
It's just the internal--

319
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,170
You don't get it.

320
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,588
-Let's wrap this up.
-Right.

321
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,591
-Go, everyone go.
-Pointless.

322
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,800
What's he talking about?

323
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:21,845
Ms. Song. What did you do?

324
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:25,974
Being a Patan native,
you should've stopped this sooner.

325
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,270
-I'm sorry!
-Dr. Song, I'm disappointed.

326
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:32,856
Wait!

327
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:37,736
Please.

328
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,615
Gentlemen,

329
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,619
before coming here,
I met the Women's Association president.

330
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,413
This one's just for you.

331
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:57,464
Patan-myeon…

332
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,635
is most famous
for dugyeonju made from azaleas.

333
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,931
Isn't this the special edition?

334
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,892
The one the president only brings out
on holidays.

335
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,521
Brewed only with spring water
collected on Dano Day. One sip,

336
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,357
and you feel Patan's spring. That liquor!

337
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,277
No way, this must be fake.

338
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,698
Someone from Seoul, especially
an American, couldn't haven gotten this.

339
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:26,034
You'll know if it's real
once you taste it.

340
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,831
-It's real.
-Real?

341
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,541
-Really real?
-Yeah.

342
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,669
There are a few more bottles.
Want to sit and talk about Patan High?

343
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,254
-Sure.
-Get the glasses.

344
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:39,631
Village Heads?

345
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,008
Get the glasses.

346
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,594
-Village Head.
-Sir, have a seat.

347
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,013
Let's take our time and talk.

348
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,851
This isn't right. Just for a moment…

349
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,769
Let's go.

350
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,405
Cheers! Me too.

351
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,367
Aren't you drinking too much?

352
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,997
-What's up with you two?
-What about you, Madam President?

353
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,458
Why did you give
that precious dugyeonju to him?

354
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,003
You don't know about the azaleas disaster
caused by the floods.

355
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,340
Everything we dried was ruined.

356
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,760
That guy went all the way
to northern Gangwon just to pick azaleas.

357
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,304
Without him,
there would've been no event.

358
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,854
Thank you.

359
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:40,150
Here's to Patan!

360
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,818
-To Patan!
-To Patan!

361
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,112
All right.

362
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,450
Great!

363
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,537
Gentlemen, you've seen it a lot,

364
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,707
but the Summer Triangle is really bright.

365
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,086
Long ago, people looked at
this constellation to find the way.

366
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:03,840
Right. Sailors used it
for navigation, too.

367
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:07,052
If people can visit this village
which is less than an hour from Seoul,

368
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,887
to see the stars,

369
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,306
it'd be great for tourism.

370
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,974
Wait…

371
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,147
Now that I see you closely,
Ji-cheol's friend,

372
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,359
you're Director Baek's son, right?

373
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:25,362
-Yes.
-That's right.

374
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:27,656
The one who was going to study
the stars,

375
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:30,659
always climbing mountains at night,
that little troublemaker, right?

376
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:31,701
Right.

377
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,830
I haven't seen you for a while.

378
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,460
I'm his younger brother.

379
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,296
You'll see me often now.
I live in the peanut house.

380
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,635
Then you're a resident of Patan.

381
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,679
-Yes.
-What should we do? Just approve it?

382
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:56,393
How can we decide village matters
while drinking?

383
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:00,438
-Come on.
-That's true.

384
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:06,820
I know you've studied Patan a lot,

385
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,739
but what's really important?

386
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,450
The residents' hearts.

387
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:18,707
Have you made even one ally
in this town?

388
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:29,384
If you're going to ruin it, why not
just hang out with the village heads?

389
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,512
I'll eat the ruined ones. It's okay.

390
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:37,100
Your mom did that too.
She always ate the ruined ones.

391
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,604
Still, she picked flowers really well.

392
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:43,273
Every spring,
your mom picked the most azaleas.

393
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:47,485
I remember. I still have
three bottles of dugyeonju at home.

394
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:53,658
Mom made them in advance
for me to take along when I got married.

395
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:57,120
I helped with that too.
Your mom was terrible at cooking.

396
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,249
But she had quick hands.

397
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:05,378
She was great at picking azaleas,
go-stop, yut nori.

398
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:09,299
Yeah, I learned all those games
from Mom.

399
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:13,595
Back when your mom was alive,
she never missed a village event.

400
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,557
It's been a while
since I've seen your face. Nice.

401
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,646
What are you doing, Song Ha-gyeong?

402
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:26,107
Why are you talking about Mom here
and making pancakes now?

403
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,529
Let's decide with this.

404
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,574
Village matters?

405
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:42,457
Mr. President, even so,
this is too unfair for an American…

406
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,376
Deal.

407
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,089
But…

408
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,676
can I bring someone
to be on my team?

409
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,221
Ms. Song,
stop eating ruined hwajeon.

410
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,056
Team up with me.

411
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,894
-What?
-You're good at this kind of thing.

412
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,271
A showdown.

413
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,147
Now!

414
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:12,070
So you're deciding whether to support
the observatory with yut nori?

415
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,780
That's right.

416
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:18,785
More importantly,
why am I on Director Baek's team?

417
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,539
Ms. Song, are you not confident? Scared?

418
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,375
How am I supposed to
go up against you all?

419
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,545
And you can't settle village business
with yut nori…

420
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,171
Let's just do it.

421
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,881
Just try it.

422
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,009
-Do it.
-Okay, let's do it.

423
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,678
-Unbelievable.
-This guy said deal!

424
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,848
No, I can't do this. This is crazy.

425
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,850
-Come on, Dr. Song, let's go!
-Try it once.

426
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,852
Okay, let's see. Throw them.

427
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,104
The fence removal is on the line too.

428
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:50,066
Village Head Go said
if we don't play it seriously,

429
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,152
he'll take back
the fence removal approval too.

430
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,073
-Let's go.
-Okay, let's go.

431
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,703
-Yut!
-Yut!

432
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,789
Village Head Sim, you're doing great!

433
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,092
Gae!

434
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,804
Hey, yut nori is so fun!

435
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,390
-Madam President, gae, one, two.
-Do, gae.

436
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,725
Right.

437
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:26,353
Wasn't Dr. Song's mom
the goddess of yut nori?

438
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,106
She'd say "Mo!" and she got mo.
"Yut!" and she got yut.

439
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,234
But Dr. Song,
you must take after your dad.

440
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:41,117
Ae-jeong must be crying in heaven!

441
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:44,788
The former yut nori champion

442
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:48,708
is leaving!

443
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,380
-Our turn? Give us the yut.
-Here.

444
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:56,591
Hey, rubber band!

445
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:05,100
What should we do?
Dr. Song looks serious.

446
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,352
Even if she plays seriously,

447
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:10,397
from now on, she needs mo, yut, mo
to catch up.

448
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,898
No way they'll win today.

449
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:13,775
Village heads…

450
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,029
if I lose this game…

451
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,740
can you handle me?

452
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,076
What?

453
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,287
Hold up. If I lose…

454
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,581
you sure you can deal with me?

455
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,668
Oh, gosh.

456
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,628
KNOCKDOWN

457
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,171
I won!

458
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:06,119
It's mo.

459
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,457
-Mo!
-Isn't this cheating?

460
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,460
This almost came out as back-do.

461
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:17,547
If it were back-do, I'd win right away.
Why would I cheat? Let's go.

462
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,305
Here.

463
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,473
Please.

464
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,350
-Sir, we just need gae.
-Village Head Jo, rub your nose.

465
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,958
-Back-do!
-Back-do!

466
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,668
Back-do!

467
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,255
It is okay!

468
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,882
-Our turn? Yes.
-It's fine!

469
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:02,550
Good luck.

470
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,347
Please, really.

471
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,159
-Mo!
-Mo!

472
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,869
-Mo!
-Mo!

473
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,871
-We won!
-Mo!

474
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,059
She's finally back.

475
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,397
The Song Ha-gyeong I knew.

476
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:05,029
For a moment,
I became my old self again.

477
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,532
Because of Baek Do-ha.

478
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:25,008
What exactly are you trying to do?

479
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:32,307
Let's go. You're going home
to get your tablet, right?

480
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:34,058
Hurry. We'll miss the bus.

481
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,270
Hurry up.

482
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,483
Dr. Song's back. It's been a while.

483
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,404
You're still getting lots of love
from the elders.

484
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,615
What's your deal?

485
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,076
What were you thinking all day today?

486
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:57,415
Ms. Song, you made this plan.

487
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:01,127
You participated in yut nori,
won in the end,

488
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,047
and got the village heads' consent
all by yourself.

489
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,594
Seeing you having a blast
after such a long time made me happy.

490
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:17,143
To deal with Ha-gyeong,
I need to be this prepared.

491
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:19,938
I came back fully prepared.

492
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:24,400
"He only shows up for summer vacation
and doesn't even stay the whole month.

493
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,987
He won't follow through this time either."

494
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,490
These were your thoughts?

495
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:35,828
"In the end, Baek Do-ha
will definitely lose to Song Ha-gyeong."

496
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:38,331
You thought that, right?

497
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,382
Sorry about that, it keeps happening.

498
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,566
Why are you so adamant to stay by my side?

499
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,033
Why do you want to get away from me?

500
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:19,330
If you…

501
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,334
keep hovering in front of me…

502
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,838
I keep remembering what I'd forgotten.

503
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:32,969
I've barely held on.
I've coped well without you.

504
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,472
-But after you appeared--
-Is it hard?

505
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,809
Because I remind you of Do-young?

506
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,147
Of the times
the three of us spent together?

507
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:48,818
You too.

508
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,696
It's hard for you too.

509
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,033
When you see me,
you think of Baek Do-young too.

510
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,117
No.

511
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,205
When I see you…

512
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,168
I remember the version of myself
that liked you.

513
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,712
And then…

514
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:12,842
I remember leaving
without confessing my feelings for you.

515
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,966
My brother took that photo.

516
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,269
I emailed you Baek Do-young's name…

517
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,564
but he took the photos.

518
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,653
Among the things
the expedition members sent…

519
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:16,656
there was a camera.

520
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,953
It was full of photos of constellations,

521
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,997
especially… the Summer Triangle.

522
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,420
You're comfortable
talking about Do-young now.

523
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,466
Coming back,
I decided to focus on myself.

524
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,761
I won't keep doing things

525
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,890
for the sake of your feelings.

526
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:45,143
What?

527
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:50,314
So acting like Do-young
was all because of me?

528
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,487
Your mom was sick the whole time.

529
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,115
You were a mess taking care of her.

530
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:01,075
Do-young…

531
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:04,787
was missing.

532
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:09,625
I started lying
because I wanted him to still be alive.

533
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,879
I thought it'd be better
for you and me.

534
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,632
-That's how it started, but--
-You're saying…

535
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,845
you fell apart because of me.

536
00:36:25,391 --> 00:36:26,434
I was unhappy.

537
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,271
It was my way
of trying not to hurt anyone--

538
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,314
So…

539
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,941
you lied because of me.

540
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,165
Baek Do-ha…

541
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:51,667
do you get it now?

542
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,505
We keep driving each other
to make the wrong choices.

543
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,206
Seul.

544
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,253
I talked about Mom today
for the first time in a while,

545
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,297
while making dugyeonju.

546
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,175
I talked about Mom as if it was nothing.

547
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,264
But I shouldn't do that.

548
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,143
You know those "what ifs," Seul?

549
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:55,273
What if I'd left the city hall
earlier that day…

550
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,945
what if I hadn't ignored Mom's call
and answered right away…

551
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:07,743
what if I hadn't missed the bus
and got on right away?

552
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,914
Those "what ifs."

553
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,051
What if
I hadn't lived in the peanut house…

554
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:30,349
and I hadn't met the Baeks.

555
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:36,272
I think about it endlessly.

556
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,276
I remember the version of myself
that liked you.

557
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:42,945
And then…

558
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,950
I remember leaving
without confessing my feelings for you.

559
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,286
What about you?

560
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,580
When you see me…

561
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,459
don't you remember that summer
when you liked me?

562
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:02,006
Isn't that why you feel sorry to Do-young?

563
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,479
If I hadn't told Do-young

564
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,399
that I liked Do-ha…

565
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:27,239
What if I hadn't said it?

566
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,161
What if?

567
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,252
You're dropping the case?

568
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,923
Yes, I'll give the house to Baek Do-ha.

569
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:50,554
Are you serious?

570
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,224
You're giving me all the rights?

571
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:55,851
Yes.

572
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,188
I'll only take my share, which is 50%.

573
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,191
It's a wooden house that's been damaged.

574
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,984
Does 50% of the appraisal
make sense?

575
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,987
Then let's get it appraised.
I'll comply with that.

576
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,449
If you charge repair costs
for the flooding, I'll pay separately.

577
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,159
I'll be going then.

578
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,213
Let's talk.

579
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,142
Can you give up the peanut house?

580
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,147
I don't want to fight with you anymore.

581
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,901
I shouldn't have created the situation
in the first place.

582
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,403
I think I was a bit childish.

583
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,199
Fighting with you at the peanut house
all the time…

584
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:55,870
I don't want to do that.

585
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,998
If I keep doing that with you
without thinking,

586
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,209
I keep going back to those days.

587
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,254
-What's wrong with that?
-I don't want to.

588
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,800
I want to keep blaming you…

589
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,012
and living the way I have.

590
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,724
Without you.

591
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,856
Here's what you asked for before.

592
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,528
These are shops where you can get
ash tree saplings similar to Jong-man.

593
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,531
I've organized it thoroughly,

594
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,825
so you won't need to contact me
about this again.

595
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:35,469
WELCOME TO KAVER MAIL, DENEB

596
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,347
ALTAIR (BAEK)
VEGA (SONG)

597
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,353
You crazy bastard,
you're not Baek Do-young.

598
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,960
SONG HA-GYEONG

599
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,265
-Hey, Do-young.
-Hey, Song.

600
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,227
Your mom's surgery went well, right?

601
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,354
I'm glad.

602
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,982
I really wanted to come this time,

603
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:33,569
but it just so happened
that I'm climbing Denali next week.

604
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,779
It's the highest mountain
in North America.

605
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,449
Am I cool?

606
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,656
BAEK DO-HA

607
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:33,629
Get in.

608
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,424
Where are we going? Just tell me.

609
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:42,346
Don't you see the car behind honking?
Get in quick.

610
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,358
Seatbelt.

611
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,936
LEEDAEMYEONG-GA

612
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:35,315
This was the hardest for me.
It wasn't my usual method.

613
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:39,236
I couldn't find a technician
until completion…

614
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,280
so I carved it myself.

615
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:43,866
So,

616
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:46,577
I got this as a result.

617
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:52,207
By the completion date,
I got IVs five times.

618
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:54,293
But I got everything done on time.

619
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:56,128
Took less than six months.

620
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:59,965
So what? What are you trying to say?

621
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,385
What have you been doing for hours?

622
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,097
Song Ha-gyeong…

623
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:11,101
I'm about to play my last card.

624
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,855
I didn't think I'd play it this soon.

625
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,108
When I came to you this summer…

626
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:20,527
I kept thinking,

627
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,490
"I shouldn't use this,
Let there be no reason to use this."

628
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:27,784
But I'm playing it
not in July or August…

629
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:30,913
but in June.

630
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:37,002
I guess I still have a long way to go
to beat you, Ha-gyeong.

631
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:42,508
But I also brought my trump card.

632
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,677
August 31st.

633
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,473
That's our completion date.

634
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,477
Until then, try living with me.

635
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:59,441
Until this summer ends.
If you still can't endure it…

636
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,029
then I'll disappear from your life.

637
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,076
If being with me
is still painful for you…

638
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,620
I'll leave after the completion.

639
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,542
So stop pushing me away
and come home.

640
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,753
If you don't join me this summer…

641
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,090
it means nothing to me.

642
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,308
I need time…

643
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:35,769
to think.

644
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,406
Welcome.

645
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:21,523
You said your summer's always unlucky
with me around.

646
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,234
Then a bit more bad luck won't hurt.

647
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,653
It's summer anyway.

648
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,033
SCENT OF SUMMER

649
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:44,880
SONG HA-GYEONG
LIVED 17 YEARS, 2-YEAR GAP, LEAVE PATAN

650
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,887
BAEK DO-HA
COEL UNIV., LIVED 21 DAYS…

651
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:56,892
GIVE UP PEANUT HOUSE

652
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,399
Sir,

653
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:06,652
-one sake…
-One sake and one katsudon, please.

654
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:20,332
Are you a stalker?
You came to my house last time, and now…

655
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,460
This isn't even Pacheon.

656
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:26,797
In Seoul, a city with 10 million people,
we just ran into each other?

657
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,092
You're not trying to pretend
it's a coincidence?

658
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:32,594
Thank you.

659
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,930
-You ordered your usual.
-Yes.

660
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:36,431
You're off work early today.

661
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:48,068
-One sake and four skewers.
-One sake and four skewers.

662
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:53,407
Oh, no, we only have five skewers left.

663
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:56,243
-Give me four then.
-Me too, four.

664
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,217
Eating pork cutlet with rice?

665
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,429
What? Doesn't everyone eat it like this?

666
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:19,516
People who eat pork cutlet
and rice together like you

667
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:21,685
do that because
they're used to eating alone.

668
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,146
There's no one to steal your pork cutlet.

669
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,523
Unlike me, who always eats it first.

670
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:33,488
Right, four brothers and one sister.
You got pushed around a lot growing up?

671
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:35,532
You only handle appeals,

672
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,534
not because you're a fixer, right?

673
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,745
Right.

674
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:43,039
As the illegitimate child, I come last.
My siblings get the first trials.

675
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:48,211
As for you, you're quite short on funds.

676
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,091
I'm tired of this back-and-forth.

677
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,844
Let's just toast.
Miserable people together.

678
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,310
Why do you want to move to Seoul so badly?

679
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:04,936
What's so good?

680
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,314
Seoul's full of good things.

681
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,108
Everyone's on their smartphones.

682
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:14,362
So many people crammed together,
with zero interest

683
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,239
in people around them.

684
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,826
How great is that?
I love that there are no stars here.

685
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,079
No stars? Seoul's full of stars.

686
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,459
You've never seen Seoul's night view.

687
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:49,397
Here, you see people instead of stars.
Drunk people, exhausted workers.

688
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:53,235
This is the night view created by lights
that violate labor laws.

689
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,405
The garbage truck will be here soon.

690
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:06,790
What's this?

691
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,335
This is my 99% win rate secret.

692
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:15,173
I write keywords I find by researching
plaintiff and defendant on this bingo.

693
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:17,092
One bingo means no chance.

694
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:20,428
Two bingos means a decent win.
Three bingos means a perfect win.

695
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:24,516
Ordinary people
usually fit into these nine squares.

696
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,728
What did you write
in the center of my bingo?

697
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,606
What's your cheat code you wrote first?

698
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,901
Why would I tell you that?
You're my opponent.

699
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,820
I told you I'm not suing.

700
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:40,740
Then want to compete?

701
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,412
Song!

702
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:48,999
What?

703
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,335
Where did she go?

704
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,587
CALLING…
SONG

705
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,300
The call cannot be connected…

706
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:13,982
-Do-ha, where are you?
-At home.

707
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:16,109
What are you doing?

708
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:18,236
Ha-gyeong hasn't even come home.

709
00:53:19,112 --> 00:53:21,448
She hasn't answered her phone all day.

710
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:26,578
What are you thinking?
Aren't you worried about her?

711
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,791
Did you write that I'm illegitimate child?

712
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,628
I wrote "out-of-wedlock child."

713
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,755
Mind if I check
your brothers' butt-wiper too?

714
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:40,842
So "illegitimate child" gets a euphemism,
but "butt-wiper" doesn't? Why?

715
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,469
It could've been "appeals expert."

716
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,763
Whatever, moving on. My turn.

717
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,058
Did you write
my mom died from cancer?

718
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:50,602
Of course.
Her memorial day is coming up.

719
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:54,648
Your father ran away to Thailand
saying he couldn't care for her?

720
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,651
Why are you killing
two birds with one stone?

721
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,152
Do you have three bingos?

722
00:53:59,235 --> 00:54:01,071
No, two bingos. The center's still empty.

723
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,699
What did you write in the center?

724
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:08,453
"Baek Do-ha"? Or "peanut house"?

725
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:16,044
Did you finish talking
with Mr. Baek Do-ha?

726
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:20,298
It hasn't been long, but you two
seem to have enough to talk about

727
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:21,549
to start a lawsuit.

728
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,889
And there's something
I didn't mention before.

729
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:30,725
You asked why I took the case, right?

730
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:35,981
Because he said it was okay to lose.

731
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,608
I always make sure I win every fight,

732
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,820
so getting a request like that
was refreshing.

733
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,907
He told me to drag it out all summer
even if we lose.

734
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,493
That was Mr. Baek's condition.

735
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:58,003
Today's bingo game
was very eye-opening and hit deep.

736
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,464
Considering we barely know each other,
I was rather rude.

737
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:06,761
Barely know? Petition, self-representation
final argument, proof of contents.

738
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:10,515
I've read them dozens of times.
Plus, I heard a secret today.

739
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:15,145
Wait.

740
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:16,438
BAEK DO-HA

741
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:21,443
It's okay not to answer?
He's been texting constantly.

742
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,070
I don't need to see it anyway.

743
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:36,875
Sorry, I should go now.

744
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:37,917
Go ahead.

745
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:11,409
JONG-MAN JR

746
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:53,868
Song Ha-gyeong.

747
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:59,415
Hey, what? What's this power outage?

748
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,253
Did you check the breaker?

749
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,171
Right now, the basement floor…

750
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,423
I put varnish on it.

751
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:10,927
Do you have the time to worry about this?

752
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:13,388
Anything that might go bad?

753
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:14,889
Right.

754
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,609
Where did it go?

755
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:29,362
You scared me.

756
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,366
Looking for the dugyeonju
your mom made?

757
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:45,545
You're moving it, right?

758
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:52,635
No, it says,
"24-hour service to anywhere."

759
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:53,720
Patan isn't included?

760
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,514
Then you shouldn't have
advertised falsely.

761
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,558
Should I report this
to the consumer agency?

762
00:57:59,851 --> 00:58:00,685
Hey…

763
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,230
I already tried everything
when the power went out.

764
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,316
Give it back. Give it to me!

765
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:08,026
-Seriously.
-Give it back.

766
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,444
Seriously!

767
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,782
-Why did you kick me?
-Why did you snatch my phone?

768
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:21,080
Hey, what are you going to do?

769
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,545
This one's safe.

770
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:44,395
Hey.

771
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,524
-Just one sip.
-No.

772
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:50,109
Get one
from the Women's Association president.

773
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:51,861
This is the last one my mom made.

774
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:56,115
You're so cheap. Your mom
would've told you to share with me.

775
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:04,332
-Just one sip.
-No.

776
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,834
Just one sip.

777
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:09,587
-No!
-Just one sip, really.

778
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,297
-It's mine!
-Just one sip.

779
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:12,215
Let go!

780
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:17,679
You started it.

781
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:28,106
Baek Do-ha!

782
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:32,986
Cold!

783
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:44,581
Wait right there.

784
00:59:45,915 --> 00:59:49,877
Ha-gyeong, my bad! Ha-gyeong?

785
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:52,797
Ha-gyeong?

786
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:56,217
Song Ha-gyeong?

787
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,681
Hey!

788
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,562
Seriously.

789
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:58,589
It's amazing, right?

790
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:04,095
That's what a home is. Even if it seems
dead, it comes back to life right away.

791
01:02:06,097 --> 01:02:07,014
Baek Do-ha…

792
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,643
you're seriously such a pain.

793
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:15,398
You made me drink
all of my mom's dugyeonju.

794
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,942
I was going to take for my wedding.

795
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:23,865
You made me have a water fight at night
with someone I can't even stand.

796
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:27,160
And in the end…

797
01:02:29,078 --> 01:02:30,997
you made me give this answer.

798
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:39,255
Fine.

799
01:02:40,214 --> 01:02:41,174
Let's give it a try.

800
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:43,593
For real?

801
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:46,721
But don't go
even one day past the completion date.

802
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,352
I was really scared this time.

803
01:02:57,648 --> 01:03:00,234
Hey, summer's a throwaway season
for me anyway.

804
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:04,489
I never had luck to begin with.
Sticking with you won't change that.

805
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:09,535
Spending a season with you
won't change a thing between us.

806
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:12,997
Summer's long.

807
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,959
The one who stayed for just 21 days
now has 80 days.

808
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:24,008
I'll do whatever I can.

809
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,600
So I'm really going to…

810
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:34,894
change your mind.

811
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:43,694
Our last summer has begun.

812
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:26,237
-What's this?
-A house-sharing agreement.

813
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,448
Our summers always had lots of surprises.

814
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:30,449
Can't sleep?

815
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:34,078
Actually, why did you barge in?

816
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:37,498
I'm just trying to live
with the immature Song Ha-gyeong.

817
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:42,795
Come to think of it,
you two are equally immature.

818
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,547
It's because of you.

819
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:46,924
It's because of you,
so don't ask me anymore. Got it?

820
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:48,759
Yes, I'm coming.

821
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:50,887
Ms. Song, do you like Baek Do-ha?

822
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:52,555
I do.

823
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:56,225
I know Baek Do-ha's blueprints
better than he does.

824
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:59,353
What did I get caught for?
Don't get the wrong idea.

825
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:03,608
Yeah, actually I…
