1
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,497
<i>You need a variety of drawings</i>

2
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,500
<i>to design a house.</i>

3
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:45,170
<i>From the elevation to the section,</i>

4
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,797
<i>from the section to the perspective,</i>

5
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,008
<i>and from the perspective to models.</i>

6
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,052
<i>Song Ha-gyeong.</i>

7
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,722
Just wait for me in summer.

8
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:59,768
"Summer" is in both our names.

9
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,394
That's so childish.

10
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,149
Fine. Whatever.

11
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:09,360
For summer,
I'll make you my number one.

12
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:10,779
Happy?

13
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,241
<i>The face I knew.</i>

14
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,453
<i>The elevation drawing during the 21 days</i>

15
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,997
<i>had you, who hated summer,</i>

16
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:24,209
<i>and me, who loved summer.</i>

17
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:27,212
I want to try getting through
that unbearable summer with you.

18
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,339
<i>The face I never knew.</i>

19
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,466
<i>The section drawing of the 52 days</i>

20
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:36,763
<i>had you and me,</i>
<i>facing the summer together.</i>

21
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,266
<i>The unfamiliar face that no one saw.</i>

22
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,937
<i>That perspective in winter</i>

23
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,565
<i>had you and me, together as us.</i>

24
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,214
<i>What will the model we build together…</i>

25
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,967
<i>…look like?</i>

26
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:31,818
Did you sleep well?

27
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,653
Did your side look like this?

28
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,239
Why does it look different?

29
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,367
Maybe because we went over
another mountain together?

30
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,871
-You were talking in your sleep.
-That can't be right.

31
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,540
For real,
I could hear it through the wall.

32
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,083
Really?

33
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,210
What did I say?

34
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,590
You said you liked me,
that you missed me, that you loved me,

35
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,091
and I shouldn't go anywhere.

36
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,512
That wasn't sleep-talking.
I've wanted to say that.

37
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,975
Look at you. What's up with you?

38
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,268
I'm always like this.

39
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,232
You're amazing in winter.
I'm curious about the other seasons.

40
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,486
Why are you dressed up? Going somewhere?

41
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:19,532
Since I'm really back,
I need to keep my last promise.

42
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,993
Last promise? What is that?

43
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:31,294
The Cheontan-myeon mural street
I promised during my reelection campaign

44
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,338
is steadily coming along.

45
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,299
This project breathes new life
into a space,

46
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,219
-bringing culture and art together--
-Isn't it unfair?

47
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,595
What?

48
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:43,932
Unfair? What's he saying?
What is he talking about?

49
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,312
There are other projects
that need your attention.

50
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,689
There's a proper order for everything.

51
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,108
I'll look into everything, in order.

52
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,402
In terms of order, this should come first.

53
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,780
It's like being the lesser child.

54
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,285
There's a camera around.
Let's talk privately.

55
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,996
It's not just up to me.

56
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,501
Is it the pushback
from the solar business?

57
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,422
For matters like this,
you need to go through the right channels,

58
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,966
and make an official complaint.

59
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:20,843
We need a personal touch
rather than an official one,

60
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:23,263
to handle both
complaints and public opinions.

61
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,724
Yes, if that's something for Patan.

62
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,270
I'll see you soon.

63
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,859
Where did he disappear to all day?

64
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,785
JOURNALIST KIM GYEONG-MIN

65
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,629

S.P.A. CHATROOM
31 PARTICIPANTS

71
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,234
<i>Renews spotlight? As if.</i>

72
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,987
<i>We went through so much</i>
<i>filing all those complaints.</i>

73
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,322
<i>Still, it paid off.</i>

74
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,616
<i>With all the complaints,</i>
<i>the construction was shut down.</i>

75
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,287
<i>Now we need to get the mayor</i>
<i>firmly on our side,</i>

76
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,247
<i>but he's still wishy-washy.</i>

77
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,834
<i>I heard the observatory architect</i>
<i>had returned.</i>

78
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,920
<i>What if he pushes for construction again?</i>

79
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,548
<i>We should come up with a plan.</i>

80
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,842
<i>How about a get-together?</i>

81
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:56,773
<i>We should keep a low profile.</i>
<i>Drawing attention will just cause trouble.</i>

82
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:58,107
STEPPING STONE LEFT THE CHAT

83
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,525
NO OBSERVATORY LEFT THE CHAT

84
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,029
This isn't easy.

85
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:07,408
<i>Excuse me. Could you check on</i>
<i>what I requested for last time?</i>

86
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:12,497
He's really sneaky.

87
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,542
He used to be a regular,
but I never knew who he was.

88
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,377
Been a while since he came.

89
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,134
You scared me.

90
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,762
-You're home?
-Yes.

91
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:32,058
Hey. What's all this?

92
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,730
We need to restart
the observatory project.

93
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,484
You're after the one who's sabotaging
our construction with nasty complaints?

94
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,278
But it won't be easy.

95
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,197
So I got my backup line running.

96
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,784
Right on time for the meeting.

97
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,286
Join us, Ms. Song.

98
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,206
What? What are you doing?

99
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,293
<i>Hey, Dr. Song.</i>

100
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,880
-You made it.
-Village heads.

101
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,551
<i>Master Baek, we did this often</i>
<i>when you were in the States.</i>

102
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,261
It continues here in Patan.

103
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,346
Our PT star summit.

104
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:14,725
Okay, gentlemen.

105
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,477
Let's start the briefing.

106
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,818
Just like you said,
the source feeding stories to the reporter

107
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,446
was someone from our village.

108
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,781
I checked through my sources,

109
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,908
and apparently, a lot of people

110
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:33,536
<i>took out private loans</i>
<i>to invest in the solar project.</i>

111
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,997
<i>They're probably fixated</i>

112
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,250
on the money they'll make
once the solar project gets approved.

113
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:43,129
The observatory and solar project
can't coexist in the same area.

114
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,883
They interfere with each other,
investors won't stay quiet about it.

115
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,177
Take a look at this.

116
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,764
<i>It's the person who crashed</i>
<i>the City Hall server.</i>

117
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,183
<i>It's the same IP address used</i>

118
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,351
<i>for complaints</i>
<i>from the anti-observatory group.</i>

119
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:01,189
I went to the Internet café
that the IP trace pointed to.

120
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,690
He never turned up.

121
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:05,109
-What?
-We talked in the chat, though.

122
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,570
Our team has started
the performance today.

123
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,740
Are they building the observatory again?

124
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,950
CONSTRUCTION PAUSED

125
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,286
Looks like
they'll resume the construction.

126
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,580
Yes. From today.

127
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,165
From today?

128
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,960
We've started taking action too.

129
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:26,088
Looks like the observatory construction
will start.

130
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,006
Really?

131
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,800
It's been pretty noisy around the school.

132
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,762
-I thought it was already over.
-What?

133
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,680
I saw the building the other day.

134
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,935
It looked ready to open. It was spotless.

135
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,269
Is that so?

136
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,604
<i>Sure enough.</i>

137
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,273
You really sped up the preparations.

138
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:48,778
Then, gentlemen.
The operation begins tomorrow, right?

139
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,530
-<i>Yes.</i>
-See you tomorrow.

140
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,450
-With Ms. Song too.
<i>-Let's do this, Ms. Song.</i>

141
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,701
-<i>Way to go.</i>
-Okay.

142
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,708
Everything all right?

143
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:08,089
This is Mr. Jo.

144
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,632
All clear here.

145
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,467
CLOTHES DONATION BIN

146
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,594
This is Jeon. Jeon, all clear.

147
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,263
<i>Hwangtae,</i> clear.

148
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:17,348
<i>Gorani,</i> all clear.

149
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:25,690
All clear here too.

150
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:31,612
This is Dr. Song, Master Baek. Clear.

151
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:34,615
You think they'll show up?

152
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:37,577
They've been waiting
for the final approval.

153
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,996
Tomorrow's the big day.

154
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,623
Then the day before,

155
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:46,586
the rival project resumed.
They'll come to check.

156
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:56,345
<i>Crow.</i>

157
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,306
A suspicious crow passed by.

158
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,905
UNDER CONSTRUCTION
DO NOT ENTER

159
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,164
See that?

160
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,958
They're ready to resume.
Convince the investors…

161
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,419
You won't even do that?

162
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,588
I've given you all those leads.

163
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,511
Crow spotted me. Charge forward!

164
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,016
Charge forward!

165
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,726
Oh, no. What do I do? Stop.

166
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,895
He's running away.

167
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,107
Are you okay?

168
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:06,791
Get him!

169
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:08,209
Get him!

170
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,797
He's the one! Get him!

171
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,319
Got you.

172
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,154
I knew this day would come.

173
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,782
I kept up my running in Patan.

174
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,409
Pavengers, situation's over.

175
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,369
Don't you dare.

176
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,206
You're Stepping Stone?

177
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,628
Patan!

178
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,546
Patan!

179
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:55,881
Cheers!

180
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,565
It's been a while. Did you miss me?

181
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,858
What are you doing here?

182
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:17,361
I said we should catch up,
"Stepping Stone."

183
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,992
After getting cut from the public project,

184
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,704
you thought the solar project would
help you become the next county chief?

185
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,747
Is that why your username is
"Stepping Stone?"

186
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:29,999
Unbelievable.

187
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,584
Don't worry. Eat.

188
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:36,005
There's a lot of money invested.
You're first place…

189
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:37,840
and he's second.

190
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:47,683
Who are you?

191
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,477
"Who are you?"

192
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,063
-"Who are you?"
-Wait.

193
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,566
Not the stomach.
It really hurt back then.

194
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,694
Why would I hit you?
Get your punishment elsewhere.

195
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,449
You jerk, you're still wearing that watch.

196
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,454
So?

197
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:12,208
The gambling debt kept increasing.

198
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,295
The solar project's the only way
to settle the debt.

199
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,296
He told me so.

200
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,423
What are you saying?

201
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:23,636
I just shared the information
that there was an option.

202
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:26,514
Detective, he's the one who hurt Ms. Song.

203
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,227
You told me to do that!

204
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,437
-Me?
-Yes.

205
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:42,863
STOP THE REMODELING

206
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:44,532
<i>I saw the building a few days ago.</i>

207
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:48,327
It looked ready to open. It was spotless.

208
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:57,044
I just told you to stir the pot.
I didn't tell you to actually hurt her.

209
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,214
Unbelievable.
I did what you told me to.

210
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,466
Hey, you can't lie here.

211
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,344
He's hiding the truth.
He can't get away with it.

212
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:09,223
Chang-joo, I'm not hiding the truth.
You really can't do this to me!

213
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,391
POLICE FOR THE PEOPLE

214
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:14,478
Those who pushed the solar project
are still Pacheon residents.

215
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,522
I feel bad about it.

216
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,609
We've developed plans
for those individuals.

217
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,361
Ms. Song?

218
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:24,697
Yes.

219
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:27,241
We need more people
to manage the observatory

220
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,784
and improve the surrounding area.

221
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,412
This could provide
long-term job opportunities

222
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,997
for those who've suffered losses.

223
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,710
It's been my goal
to make it a space for everyone,

224
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:40,296
not just a select few.

225
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,591
I believe the observatory

226
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,093
could help the local economy

227
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:48,846
and become Pacheon's next landmark.

228
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,435
You two will show the stars to me

229
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,437
and the people in the community.

230
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:58,814
I look forward to it.

231
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,317
-Thanks for your support.
-Thank you.

232
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:04,111
Take care.

233
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,742
Yes! Hey, that was awesome.

234
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,537
I'm genuinely impressed.

235
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,998
Baek Do-ha in winter
is rough and wild. Just my type.

236
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,542
And Song Ha-gyeong in winter
is hot and cold,

237
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,419
switching back and forth.
Totally my type.

238
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,881
There are many sides to my personality
you don't know yet.

239
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,513
Let's stay close and see it all,
the good and the bad.

240
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,603
By the way,
we've been kind of flirty everywhere.

241
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,729
Let's be careful.

242
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,194
Promise me.

243
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,489
Once the construction's back on,
let's separate work and personal life.

244
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:51,325
Of course.
Don't bring personal life to work,

245
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,452
and don't bring work to our personal life.

246
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:54,662
Sure thing.

247
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,665
Let's keep it separated, like this space.

248
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,044
Hey.

249
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,381
What do we do about this?

250
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,884
August 31st. What will you do about this?

251
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,431
A contract's a contract.

252
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,685
What? The year is missing here.

253
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,604
Double-check it next time, Dr. Song.

254
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,523
Are you kidding me?

255
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,149
Then you really want me to leave?

256
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,652
-Are you kidding me?
-Exactly.

257
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,788
I don't think
we need contracts like this anymore.

258
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,425
Patan-myeon needs to step up their game.

259
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,430
Everything's so fresh. Just like you.

260
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,355
So good.

261
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,402
Here. This place's nice.

262
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,404
No need to compromise, no arguments.

263
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,247
We've been getting along
without fighting.

264
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,124
I guess it really is winter, right?

265
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,043
How about a date after this?

266
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,211
Sounds good. How about a movie?

267
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,337
Or a café?

268
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,799
Or Seoul?
Should I kidnap you to the south coast?

269
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,593
-That sounds good.
-Right?

270
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:34,720
One second.

271
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,559
-Hey, Jong-shin.
-Hello, Ms. Kim.

272
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,730
One month is enough.
Keep the restart schedule as it is.

273
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:46,398
Thanks.

274
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,194
-Wait, a month?
-Wait, ten days?

275
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:53,363
That's crazy. Absolutely not.

276
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,823
No way. Absolutely not.

277
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:57,659
-Later, bye.
-Talk to you later.

278
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,498
-Hey, Song Ha-gyeong.
-You said "hey," Director Baek?

279
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,250
Draw the line between
work and personal life.

280
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:09,797
I didn't know this was work, Ms. Song.

281
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,301
Adjust the schedule in ten days.

282
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:19,056
The main reason this project got held up
was Pluto, wasn't it, Director Baek?

283
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,974
I think City Hall shares the blame

284
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,894
for not stopping the protest
and complaints, Ms. Song.

285
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,441
It's a public project.
I'm sure you know we have a set budget.

286
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:33,362
I made five design changes with
Sangdong City Hall on public projects.

287
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,031
That's exactly why I'm here.

288
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:41,537
And it's been annoying me.
Please call me "Supervisor."

289
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,996
Right.

290
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,499
-Supervisor Song.
-That's right.

291
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,709
You're known as a mad dog about rules.

292
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,461
-Once you bite down--
-I don't let go.

293
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,756
So, do you want to get bitten?

294
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,763
Shall we take a break?

295
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,153
You can't play your cards like this,
Director Baek.

296
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:18,782
"Play my cards," Supervisor Song?
I meant to explore each other, privately.

297
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,452
Studying during my break
isn't really my thing.

298
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,913
But I'm intrigued.

299
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,459
Our break is almost over.
We should speed things up.

300
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,133
Director Baek. Ms. Song?

301
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,597
The food is here. Where'd they go?

302
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,100
We don't need to make
the hidden walls streamlined.

303
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,977
This will make it sturdier

304
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,605
and cost less to maintain,
Supervisor Song!

305
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,065
It all sounds nice,

306
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,610
but we might end up going over budget
to cut costs.

307
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,195
That's nonsense again.

308
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,239
Let's go to my office.
I'll show you the model.

309
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,617
-Fine, let's go.
-What?

310
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,410
-I'll go see it.
-Where are you going?

311
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,710
Now you see how important it is?

312
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,920
What's all this touching?

313
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,466
I told you not to bring
personal matters to work.

314
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:26,433
This is my office, okay?
It's a personal space.

315
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,992
Seriously! How many times
do I have to tell you?

316
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,203
I said this won't work, Director Baek!

317
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:52,042
Are you okay? She seems really upset--

318
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,460
There's blood on your lip.

319
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,212
-Blood?
-Yes.

320
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,424
This? It's winter, it's just chapped.

321
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:02,719
Don't be dramatic.

322
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,638
-Ms. Song.
-Yes?

323
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,682
What if this leaves a scar?

324
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,851
Director Baek. It won't.

325
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,606
Then… If we pick up where we left off…

326
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:16,775
it might help.

327
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,083
Hey, put me down! Seriously, hey!

328
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,005
What was that?

329
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,424
Oh, no.

330
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,509
Are you okay?

331
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,978
What do we do?

332
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,229
Tell me about it.

333
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,733
You put me on a roller coaster ride.

334
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,110
Ms. Song. I mean, Song Ha-gyeong.

335
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,865
Let's stop fighting, please?
Life's too short not to love each other.

336
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,366
Stop being stubborn.

337
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,952
I'm not being stubborn. I'm being sincere.

338
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,581
We have to check the dome joints
and finish the initial landscaping.

339
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,458
You saw the files I sent you earlier.

340
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,838
I saw the updated perspective.
We do need to check the dome.

341
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,841
You never know until you check inside.

342
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:27,512
I really want to
keep this last promise the right way,

343
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,931
so we can make a new promise.

344
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,059
What's the new promise?

345
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,817
Anything you can imagine.

346
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:44,988
I give you my word.

347
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,783
I'll do my best
to support you, Director Baek.

348
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:50,911
Supervisor Song…

349
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,288
I won't let you down.

350
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,668
-Let's do this!
-Let's do this!

351
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,345
<i>To build a building,</i>
<i>you should keep many promises.</i>

352
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,723
All the connections are good, right?

353
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:14,059
<i>A promise</i>
<i>between the client and the architect,</i>

354
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,394
<i>between the weather and the date,</i>

355
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,188
<i>and between the meters and the numbers.</i>

356
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,482
How long does it take for the dome
to open fully?

357
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,702
DENEB
WELCOME TO THE DENEB ROOM

358
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,289
2. NO VISITORS WITHOUT APPROVAL
3. BE KIND

359
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,708
SUMMER TRIANGLE

360
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,712
<i>A promise not to change.</i>

361
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:46,049
By the way,

362
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,677
do the stars seem extra special
from the dome?

363
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,680
You don't just look at the stars.

364
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,391
You get to feel the sky.

365
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,518
We couldn't see anything
because of the weather.

366
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,479
-But we'll see them for sure later.
-We'll see them for sure later.

367
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,608
I'm tired of hearing that.

368
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,987
-I copied it without thinking.
-Did I say it too much?

369
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:17,122
I don't think the stars
will be easy to see from here.

370
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:21,710
Actually, I'll make it
the right way later.

371
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,130
Okay, that's a promise.

372
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:28,508
Design by Baek Do-young,
architecture by Baek Do-ha,

373
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,468
supervision by Song Ha-gyeong.

374
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,680
-The three of us are making it together.
-Okay.

375
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,474
Let's put it in.

376
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,897
<i>A promise to share our hearts.</i>

377
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,535
ALTAIR, DENEB, VEGA

378
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,915
PATAN HIGH OBSERVATORY
RENOVATION PROJECT

379
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:07,380
<i>A promise to show</i>
<i>the best version of ourselves.</i>

380
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:16,556
That was really grueling.
Patan Observatory.

381
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,185
Why? It kept us together
through those grueling times.

382
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,813
Who says the observatory
brought us together?

383
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,151
-It was me.
-I think I played a bigger part in it.

384
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:33,114
If I hadn't mentioned August 31st,
would you have even seen me?

385
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:36,534
You would've had to have insisted,
if you wanted to see me.

386
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,079
We came this far through thick and thin.

387
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,956
Seriously though,

388
00:25:41,748 --> 00:25:45,210
if I hadn't kept my promise and left,
what would you have done?

389
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,005
I mean, just hypothetically.

390
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,759
I'd track you down and give you hell.

391
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,220
Don't you dare take it literally
and leave.

392
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,474
Even so, I'd go around the globe
and find my way back to you.

393
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,726
Of course you should.

394
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,646
I'm not letting go. I can't!

395
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,525
Gross! Disgusting!

396
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,610
You're here?

397
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,363
Okay, look at the camera.

398
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,202
Take a good picture!

399
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,414
Okay, one, two, three.

400
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,668
-Did it turn out okay?
-Let's see.

401
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,795
Did it turn out well?

402
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,213
Yes, it looks good.

403
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,216
-Let me see.
-It looks good.

404
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,511
After over a decade,
how come nothing's changed?

405
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,263
Something's changed.

406
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,265
Do-young is gone.

407
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,893
Things between us have changed.

408
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,770
How does it feel, now that it's finished?

409
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:50,233
I like it.

410
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:55,322
It's designed to connect with people
who want to see the stars.

411
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:57,824
What about you, Ha-gyeong?

412
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,704
We have an observatory in our town

413
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,956
where we get
the best view of the Summer Triangle.

414
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,000
That's all that matters.

415
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,669
<i>Your goal for ten years from now.</i>

416
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,087
After ten years?

417
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:14,132
I'll retire from the national team
with no regrets,

418
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,509
and become a coach for the national team.

419
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,720
I'll be the wife
of the national team coach.

420
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:24,100
I'll graduate from med school and join
the international medical community.

421
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:27,896
I'll travel around the world
and study the stars.

422
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,691
Well…

423
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,902
I'll build an observatory.

424
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:38,448
<i>Although not all of our summer promises</i>
<i>came true…</i>

425
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,371
<i>and a lot changed over the winter.</i>

426
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,331
-What?
-Hey, you saw that?

427
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,499
Was it a shooting star?

428
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,084
We have to make a wish.

429
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,377
Make a wish.

430
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,796
<i>Like the stars that connect us,</i>

431
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,132
<i>the heart of our promises</i>

432
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,385
<i>is still</i>

433
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,597
<i>shining brightly.</i>

434
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,977
Do-ha left this just as it was.

435
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:09,771
Remember?

436
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,732
We hopped over the fence
to see the stars.

437
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,151
That was really fun.

438
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,488
I found the courage to confess to you.

439
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,865
Let's go now. It's getting late.

440
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,369
Seung-taek.
You know what I wished for earlier?

441
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,831
That we could be friends.

442
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,376
Let's stay friends.

443
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:36,005
We don't need to destroy, erase everything
like it never happened.

444
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,298
It's 12 years of our lives.

445
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,593
Don't be ridiculous.

446
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,513
How can we be friends?

447
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:45,849
Why not? Being friends is the easiest.

448
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,393
Compared to secretly having a crush,

449
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,729
or being an athlete's girlfriend
for 12 years,

450
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:52,230
it should be easier.

451
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,400
We'll keep running
into each other like this,

452
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,652
and we can't be awkward
every single time.

453
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,320
Also…

454
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,825
without each other in those 12 years,

455
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,952
there's barely anything left.

456
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,254
Do you want to make one last bet?

457
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,924
To see if we can really be friends?

458
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:36,399
<i>How about dinner to celebrate</i>
<i>the completion?</i>

459
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,280
MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM "NUMBER ONE"

460
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,783
<i>At 7:30 p.m., at Star Lounge.</i>

461
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,704
<i>Remember that suit you wore</i>
<i>when we went head-to-head at your office?</i>

462
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,040
<i>Wear that. Look sexy.</i>

463
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,397
Please have a seat.

464
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,113
Hold on.

465
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,503
Figures my taste wasn't wrong.

466
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,797
I can't take my eyes off you.

467
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,965
Right back at you.

468
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,717
It feels like my vision's getting better.

469
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,349
Right.

470
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,562
Making a memory out of this moment
would be perfect.

471
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:15,832
A gift for finishing the project.

472
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,209
To celebrate

473
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:21,462
that we made our way back to each other
across a 14-hour time difference.

474
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,590
Give me your hand.

475
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,649
And…

476
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,616
What is this now?

477
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,713
AUTO TRANSFER - BAEK DO-HA

478
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,176
Ha-gyeong, stop seducing me.

479
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:09,969
No, wait.

480
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,931
Are you already tired of me?
Is this like "take this and get lost"?

481
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,891
It's for taking care of Su-bak.

482
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,186
I've saved up everything you've sent.

483
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,231
That could cover several round trips
to the States.

484
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,153
You should go to the States.

485
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,241
What do you mean?

486
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,245
The Hermann project.
Go work on that.

487
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,958
Come on, I just got here.
Why are you telling me to go?

488
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,834
I know you wanted to do that.

489
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,796
You were up all night
watching it yesterday.

490
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,101
Just let architect Baek Do-ha
do what he really wants

491
00:32:59,018 --> 00:32:59,978
from now on.

492
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,314
With no guilt, obligation,

493
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,525
or pressure.

494
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:10,071
This time, I won't drill through walls,

495
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,615
and you don't need to leave notes.

496
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,242
I'll wait for you anyway.

497
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:17,787
Consider that watch
my little chain on you.

498
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,250
Ha-gyeong, you're unbelievable.

499
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,169
So, Mr. Baek…

500
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:29,465
feels like tonight could be

501
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,552
our last night.

502
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,097
We're not going home tonight.

503
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,641
We're going upstairs.

504
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:46,774
Once we finish this.

505
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,736
Let's eat.

506
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,071
-Let's eat fast.
-Okay.

507
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,453
-Is it good?
-Yes.

508
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:07,920
What?

509
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:11,883
Are you okay?

510
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:20,558
You didn't check if the food had peanuts?

511
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,144
How could I leave you?

512
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,022
It's my first time in 17 years.

513
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:30,318
-Take me back there.
-No, we're going to the hospital.

514
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:35,448
I barely managed to book
the Grand Royal Palace Hotel.

515
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:38,493
That's almost my entire month's salary.

516
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,453
Hey.

517
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,829
Let me just stay one night.

518
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:42,789
No.

519
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:49,796
Stop following me.

520
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,631
Go to your room.

521
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,966
I don't want you seeing me like this.

522
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,803
Hey.

523
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,891
Gosh, why do you have to be this cute?

524
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,938
No, I'm not. I'm going for an elegant
and sophisticated look today.

525
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,609
I'm the cool lady sending off
her boyfriend today.

526
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,195
So let's just say goodbye here, all right?

527
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,575
Seriously.

528
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:31,295
Hey.

529
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,465
Ha-gyeong.

530
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,551
Don't be too cute.

531
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,555
I wish I'd known this side of you sooner.

532
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:41,639
Hey.

533
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,183
Forget seeing me like this.

534
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:46,727
So what if you look like this?
You're just lovely.

535
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,696
Wait for me
till the end of the Hermann project?

536
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,197
I can't say how long it'll take.

537
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,490
Are you serious?

538
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:03,786
I waited 344 days just for 21 days.

539
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,663
I'll visit you, if I miss you.

540
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,374
I'll probably check in first
because I'll want to see you.

541
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,838
I don't think
I have enough time off for that.

542
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,301
What if someone

543
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,345
snatches this cutie while I'm away?

544
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,849
Did you see my phone?
You're my number one.

545
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,935
Don't worry, just go.

546
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,666
Oh, my.

547
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,795
What? It's all gone.

548
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,303
Yay.

549
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:06,182
Hey, Do-ha.

550
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,939
Has he really left?

551
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,024
Already?

552
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:22,949
NUMBER ONE

553
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,370
Song Ha-gyeong.
You said you'd let him go.

554
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:31,499
So do it cool. Like a cool girl, okay?

555
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,403
INSTANT NOODLES

556
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,410
THE LATE KIM AE-JEONG

557
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,754
INSTANT NOODLES

558
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,973
There.

559
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,245
Is it good?

560
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,540
Too bad I can't see…

561
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,501
your happy face.

562
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,494
Ae-jeong.

563
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,496
I'll get going now.

564
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,043
Bye-bye.

565
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,693
Are you running away again?

566
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,124
Seems like you're doing well.

567
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:21,919
They call you "Father Teresa" in Thailand.

568
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,091
Why do you always get new flowers?

569
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,971
Because my Ae-jeong

570
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,890
is just like a flower.

571
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,813
You're so silly.

572
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:46,861
Why do you stop by the Peanut House?
You don't even come inside.

573
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,031
Did you know that?

574
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:59,081
Just… checking in.

575
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:04,503
I was sneaking a peek at my daughter.

576
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,047
What are you, a water deer?

577
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,424
What?

578
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:09,800
I don't get you.

579
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,346
Sorry.

580
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:19,143
I'm always the one who runs away.

581
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,104
After you left like that…

582
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,983
it was always a mystery to me.

583
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,654
"Why did Dad leave the house?"

584
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,700
I just couldn't find the answer.

585
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,455
That made me resent the one
who gave me the question.

586
00:41:41,874 --> 00:41:44,126
I couldn't find the answer,
so it drove me crazy.

587
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,963
I felt that way the whole time.

588
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:52,426
It's only natural.

589
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,598
There's no one to give me the answer…

590
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:01,393
and I never even asked.

591
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,480
I should've just asked you,

592
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,358
holding your hand.

593
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,862
Then perhaps…

594
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,491
could it have been different?

595
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,670
You probably need time
to find the answer too.

596
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,172
I'll wait for you until then.

597
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,134
Thank you.

598
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,350
But one thing.

599
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,853
Don't run away like a water deer.

600
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:02,580
<i>It might seem like a complicated case,</i>
<i>but the issue is clear.</i>

601
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:06,792
<i>It's a dispute over company ownership.</i>
<i>Let's take a look at the next case.</i>

602
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,711
<i>Okay, let's check out the video.</i>

603
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:10,796
He's a regular here.

604
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:12,506
He appears frequently on legal shows.

605
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:16,594
He's on a roll with his career,
which is amazing, so I follow him.

606
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:18,637
I know him a little too.

607
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,347
Thank you.

608
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,892
<i>So the issue is</i>
<i>how the shares are divided?</i>

609
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,769
<i>No, the issue is who runs the company.</i>

610
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,354
I'm aging day by day.

611
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,857
And how does he keep looking so good?

612
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:32,234
He's way out of reach now.

613
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,986
I don't think I'm that far gone.

614
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,908
No way. A celeb is in the house.

615
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,077
I'll have the same thing, please.

616
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,329
Coming right up.

617
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,958
I'm not supposed to be this happy
to see my ex.

618
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,544
Where's your current boyfriend?

619
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,257
I hope it's not a situation
where I'm needed.

620
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:57,635
Leave your card, just in case.

621
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,803
I didn't think you'd be gone so fast.

622
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,953
Blurring the line
between a friend and something more

623
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,498
-can be a reason to break up, right?
-Yes, it can be.

624
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:32,002
Architects work with numbers and logic.

625
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,380
If they misinterpret,
isn't it their fault?

626
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,798
I get it now.

627
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,385
His head's buried in numbers,
no wonder he can't communicate.

628
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,678
That's not true.

629
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,681
-I speak three languages.
-Why do you keep interrupting us?

630
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,269
You're talking to me right now.

631
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,647
-Why not talk to me directly?
-Fine.

632
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:55,192
I'm so confused right now.
Aren't you supposed to be in the US?

633
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:58,320
In an era of online contracts
and working from home,

634
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,947
a virtual meeting would suffice.

635
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,617
But anyway,
how could you meet your ex right away?

636
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,661
And at 10:34 p.m., at that?

637
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,872
What could exes
possibly have to talk about,

638
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:10,624
sitting side by side like that?

639
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,836
We keep running into each other
by chance.

640
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,755
And you asked me to see her
as a friend sometimes.

641
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,885
Hold on a second.
That's rich coming from you.

642
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:25,764
You're supposed to be in the US.
Why're you here with a girl who likes you?

643
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:27,850
I find this misunderstanding
a bit offensive.

644
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:30,769
I just wanted to celebrate Do-ha's return
to the Hermann project.

645
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,231
Of course, like you said,
I do like Do-ha.

646
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:37,568
-Hey.
-I was never his ex, but he's your ex.

647
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,903
So are you Do-ha's guardian or something?

648
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,406
Should I book you a plane ticket now?

649
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:45,242
My flight's tomorrow morning anyway.
I appreciate the thought.

650
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:51,790
You're with your ex-boyfriend,
but PM Yoon is just my colleague.

651
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:55,002
So, you want to go back to being my ex
and my colleague?

652
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:57,421
You still have my number?

653
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,882
As you know,
I have a very high success rate

654
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,717
in cases between couples, even divorces.

655
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:04,303
How reassuring to have you around.

656
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,224
Fine.

657
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:13,145
Seems like our relationship
could use a little remodeling, right?

658
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:14,938
Exactly what I want.

659
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:18,650
It's time to do remodeling
once and for all.

660
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:38,253
How exactly is this supposed to be
a remodel?

661
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,339
And why am I sitting here?

662
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,051
We need to decide

663
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,803
who can analyze situations
and make strategic decisions.

664
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:50,682
Did you see that?

665
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:55,270
We're deciding who starts remodeling
our relationship.

666
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,027
Nice.

667
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,156
You got this, right?

668
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,891
Despite all the scheming and tricks,
I proved myself eventually.

669
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:37,354
Don't you remember who shot down
six out of eight?

670
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:38,438
Whatever.

671
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,441
Now, as the winner, I'll go ahead

672
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:44,820
and start remodeling our relationship.
Everyone agrees, right?

673
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:48,031
Winner makes the call. Sure.

674
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:51,451
Have a good trip back to the States,
PM Yoon.

675
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,078
Let's just meet virtually from now.

676
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,249
You sure can make a goodbye feel harsh.

677
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,545
You two. Shake hands.

678
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:09,428
This should do it.

679
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,599
Don't you dare call it destiny
when you run into each other.

680
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,643
Except for weddings or funerals.

681
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,813
Sure, why not.
Reaching agreements is my job, after all.

682
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,525
If it's not your wedding,
it'd be fun seeing her.

683
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,278
By the way, I'm good at hosting events.

684
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:31,491
And Ha-gyeong,

685
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:33,952
as for you…

686
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,144
Hey.

687
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,272
How did that get destroyed?

688
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,236
Are you okay?

689
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:12,949
I brought it on myself…

690
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,160
with all that drilling.

691
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,246
Are you blaming me?

692
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,707
Don't you remember who caused it
in the first place?

693
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:24,586
By the way,

694
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:29,049
ever since I came back,
haven't you been sleeping better?

695
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:33,387
So? Why do you ask?

696
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:35,639
What I'm saying is,

697
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,892
don't you want to keep sleeping well?

698
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:43,146
Isn't it the same for you?
You've been sleeping like a baby.

699
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:49,486
When people change and time passes,
the house should change too.

700
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,198
We might as well renovate the whole place.

701
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:56,827
Let's make it our home.

702
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,289
<i>For our remodeling,</i>

703
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,793
<i>we agreed not to make any designs.</i>

704
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,389
Am I doing this right?

705
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,433
<i>We wanted to make a home for us…</i>

706
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:23,186
<i>not for anyone else.</i>

707
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:28,483
Is it good?

708
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,955
<i>When Ha-gyeong twisted everything,</i>

709
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,249
<i>I got tangled up.</i>

710
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,543
Red light, green light…

711
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,422
You come here! Hey!

712
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,757
SU-BAK

713
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,095
Su-bak. Do you like it?

714
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,222
<i>In a house we designed our own way…</i>

715
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,599
I like it.

716
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,017
<i>…how will our lives</i>

717
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,644
<i>get tangled?</i>

718
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,314
All right.

719
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:11,067
Your kimchi stew is my favorite.

720
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,194
Thank you.

721
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,236
Thanks for the food.

722
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:14,154
Eat up.

723
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,914
Work makes food taste amazing.

724
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:25,373
<i>Without any blueprint…</i>

725
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:27,083
What was that?

726
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,168
<i>…how chaotic…</i>

727
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,461
Dig in.

728
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:31,213
<i>…and lovely are we going to be?</i>

729
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,090
You can't do that by yourself.

730
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,676
-I'll help you.
-I said I can.

731
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,763
I guess I can't. Can you…

732
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,491
Hold on. Sorry.

733
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,660
SEUL

734
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,370
Come on, Seul!

735
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,456
Hello?

736
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,917
GOPCHANG

737
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,436
Sir!

738
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,981
One extra flame-grilled <i>gopchang</i>, please.

739
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:34,568
Right, make it extra cheesy too!

740
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:39,239
Hey. Take a seat.
This place is amazing.

741
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:41,616
Grab a seat.

742
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,543
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

743
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:53,753
Wow, cheese <i>gopchang.</i>

744
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,141
-Want some?
-Cheese <i>gopchang.</i>

745
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:07,225
<i>Cheese gopchang? </i>Okay.

746
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:12,647
Have some too.

747
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:13,648
Okay.

748
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,279
Hey, Baek Do.

749
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:22,490
What makes you think you can build
Seung-taek's house?

750
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,410
What, barrier-free?

751
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,579
How did you know?

752
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:29,456
My new friend told me.

753
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:33,460
His name is Oh Seung-taek.
You guys probably know him.

754
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,011
This smoky flavor.

755
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,096
It's that smoky flavor.

756
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:48,308
The smoky flavor I had with Seung-taek
back then.

757
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,812
So good.

758
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,940
Hey, so what's going on?

759
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:57,275
-Are you seeing Seung-taek again?
-Yes!

760
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,486
We became best friends.

761
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,489
That's why I've been busy lately.

762
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,616
I thought I knew him,

763
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:08,370
but he keeps surprising me.

764
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,039
Seriously, Oh Seung-taek.

765
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:14,709
My buddy.

766
00:54:16,252 --> 00:54:19,172
Since it's just for me,
I went for an open layout.

767
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:20,507
Any furniture ideas?

768
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,176
-What?
-You said we're friends.

769
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:25,929
Can you raise your head?

770
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,681
-Okay, good.
-Okay.

771
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:31,142
Why are you showing me this?

772
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,602
Because we're friends.

773
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,938
This is tiring.

774
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:38,733
He sure knows how to draw the line.

775
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:41,653
As expected from a sportsman,

776
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:44,739
he's never going to let me win.

777
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:47,867
Ever since his accident,

778
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:51,496
we've kind of stopped sharing
our true feelings.

779
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,290
I thought if I did, we'd break up.

780
00:54:55,166 --> 00:55:01,047
We got through those five years
making bets on you guys.

781
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:04,384
That's the line for us.

782
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:09,139
No sad stories. No painful stories.

783
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:14,019
No uncomfortable stories.

784
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:24,946
If getting over that line is
what it takes to become real friends,

785
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,198
I really want to go past it.

786
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,450
Hey.

787
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,702
You guys must've had

788
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:34,164
your own stubborn line,
like a 38th-parallel, for those 17 years.

789
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:35,999
How did you get over that?

790
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,637
SEUL

791
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:04,736
Hey, Seul.

792
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,741
Hey, buddy.

793
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,287
How much did you drink?

794
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,373
I just had a drink
with Baek Do-ha and Song,

795
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:19,667
my best friends.

796
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:24,339
And then, you know,
I wanted to see another friend too.

797
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,884
Get up now. I can't help you up.

798
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,011
Can you get to the car?

799
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:33,598
Seung-taek.
Should we play a game too?

800
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:35,767
It's called…

801
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,895
the Song Ha-gyeong game.

802
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:43,650
This is a perfect game
when you can't be honest.

803
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:45,401
They say it made them honest.

804
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:51,574
We've had 12 years
of dating and a breakup.

805
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:54,410
There's a lot we never got to say.

806
00:56:56,287 --> 00:57:01,584
You have to go through stuff like this
to become real friends.

807
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:06,464
If you can't be honest,
you just say the opposite.

808
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,174
Just say the opposite?

809
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,759
-Oh, yay.
-So?

810
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,094
If you win?

811
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:13,012
Grant a wish.

812
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:20,395
I don't like being friends with you.

813
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:24,149
I hate seeing you at least like this.

814
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:40,790
I want to stay friends with you.

815
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,797
Because I want you to see just me,
not anyone else.

816
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:52,093
I want you to hold on to me
and stay with me,

817
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,720
smiling even when it's tough.

818
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:58,224
I hope you never do any of the things
you've missed out on because of me

819
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,310
and cry alone…

820
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,397
quietly without me knowing.

821
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:06,733
Seung-taek.

822
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:10,695
Even when I see you like that,
I don't feel sorry

823
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:11,905
or hurt one bit.

824
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,741
This thought kept coming to me

825
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:18,912
and made me never want to stay
in the rink, even at midnight!

826
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:24,334
So, keep clinging to me.
Beg me to at least stay friends.

827
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:29,339
Every time you see me,
all those old memories will hurt you.

828
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:32,133
But don't leave my side anyway.
Latch onto me like a leech.

829
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:36,095
Let's be friends for life.

830
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:42,018
Every time I see you
being so hard on yourself,

831
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,146
my heart overflows with joy.

832
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:52,153
Every time you pretend you're okay,
I get so thrilled I'm going crazy.

833
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:54,948
So, please…

834
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:58,076
Please, let's do that.

835
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:07,001
Now, got it?

836
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:11,256
I can't be your friend.

837
00:59:13,675 --> 00:59:15,134
Wait, that wasn't a lie.

838
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,139
Congratulations.

839
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,141
You won

840
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:24,727
the last bet.

841
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:49,919
Yes.

842
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,463
I calmed her down. She's asleep.

843
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:55,466
Her eyes are all puffy
after meeting Seung-taek.

844
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:59,554
<i>I'll have to stay over here tonight.</i>

845
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:02,432
I should be by her side now.
If not now, when else?

846
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:05,893
<i>I'll be home tomorrow night.</i>

847
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:16,779
Hey!

848
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:23,077
It's all set and ready to go.

849
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:28,041
-Why are you outside? It's cold.
-I couldn't wait to show you.

850
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:33,796
All right.

851
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,006
One.

852
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:37,425
-Two. Three.
-Three.

853
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,978
It's totally random,

854
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,105
but somehow cozy.

855
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:55,652
In my 29 years as an architect,
this is the messiest thing I've ever done,

856
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:57,987
but it's my favorite.

857
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:01,824
I especially love this partition line.

858
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,841
There's only one room.

859
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,219
How could there be two beds?

860
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,304
This is quite a masterpiece.

861
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,765
I recycled our partition wall
to make this bed frame.

862
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,475
It's very meaningful.

863
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,560
Is this why you suggested remodeling?

864
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:32,230
Come on, what are you thinking?
No way.

865
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:37,777
Aren't you going to lie down?

866
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:41,447
It's comfy.

867
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,318
<i>Event? What's the occasion?</i>

868
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,237
My birthday! You really don't know?

869
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,739
<i>How could you forget</i>
<i>your boyfriend's birthday?</i>

870
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,783
You're so gorgeous. Shall we go upstairs?

871
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,786
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

872
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:54,831
-Are you here to see our photo too?
-No.

873
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,165
<i>Are you seeing someone?</i>

874
01:03:57,959 --> 01:03:58,793
What's wrong?

875
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:01,587
<i>Wait, a leave of absence?</i>
<i>For an entire year?</i>

876
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:04,423
<i>How am I supposed to treat you</i>
<i>as my daughter-in-law?</i>

877
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:07,593
<i>I actually went there</i>
<i>because I wanted to see you,</i>

878
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,721
<i>hoping for a Christmas miracle.</i>

879
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,391
Here come the bride and groom!

880
01:04:13,474 --> 01:04:14,725
<i>What do you think of us?</i>

881
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,979
<i>You and me. What do you think of us?</i>
