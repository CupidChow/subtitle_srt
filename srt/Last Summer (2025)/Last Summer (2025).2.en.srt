1
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,285
This way.

2
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:36,786
Thank you.

3
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,164
Do-ha.

4
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:41,458
Ta-da!

5
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,127
This is your room.

6
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:07,192
Do-ha, today
is your big architectural debut.

7
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:11,071
Now go on, do whatever you feel like.

8
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,990
For real?
So I can just drill anywhere I want?

9
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,327
Not anywhere, wait.
That won't do. Hold on for a second.

10
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,669
What is this?

11
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,719
I first met Song Ha-gyeong
in the summer when I was 12.

12
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,430
By age 12,

13
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,599
she was already crazy.

14
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,520
I'm pretty sure it was genetic.

15
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,731
This peanut house
was built by crazy grown-ups.

16
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:51,027
I don't want to.
Dad, I seriously almost lost my vision.

17
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,071
Why the room next to hers?

18
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,281
Ha-gyeong did that because she's shy.

19
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,867
She's cute once you get to know her.

20
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,079
Dad's judgment hasn't been reliable.

21
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,581
That's refreshing.

22
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,376
It's okay, eat up.

23
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,213
-Our daughters are so cute, right?
-Yes.

24
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,716
No, they're fake daughters.
I'm your only real daughter!

25
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,386
You're lying.
You're the one who's super ugly.

26
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,638
-Stop.
-It's true. She's ugly.

27
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,808
-Ha-gyeong.
-You can't do that.

28
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:22,892
Hey.

29
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,479
-Stop!
-Why?

30
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,815
-Stop it.
-Hey, you.

31
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:31,025
-Hey!
-You two, stop it already!

32
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,652
-Man!
-Do-ha!

33
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,449
Ha-gyeong.

34
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:42,328
Our very first war
started at the dining table.

35
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,960
You two can't come out
until you sincerely make up.

36
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,944
Hey, that's a wooden wall,
your head can't smash it.

37
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,949
I guess it might, with that thick head.

38
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,453
You jerk!

39
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:30,168
Is this Yong-e Hyeoltu?
You suck so bad.

40
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:35,798
Hey, lose a round,
and you'll be calling me "boss" forever.

41
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,760
Hold up.

42
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:42,931
If I lose,
are you sure you can deal with me?

43
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,682
I thought she sounded crazy.

44
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,191
PERFECT VICTORY

45
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,651
-Okay!
-Seriously!

46
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,320
PERFECT VICTORY

47
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,449
-You can't beat me.
-One more round.

48
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,617
START FIGHT

49
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,911
If you go easy on me, I'll kill you.

50
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,375
Are you kidding me?

51
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,878
PERFECT VICTORY - WIN

52
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,589
After losing 60 rounds straight,

53
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,302
she yelled all night
that she'd kill me if I went easy on her.

54
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:27,892
I won! Did you see that?
That's how I do it.

55
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,854
When she finally got her first win,
I passed out tired.

56
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:37,568
Our first truce happened
while we were both too tired to function.

57
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:38,987
JOHN'S TREE STORY

58
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:43,241
She said the main character resembled me

59
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,034
and tried to name the tree.

60
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,620
-It's Jong-man.
-No, it's Baek Do-ha.

61
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,081
No, it's Jong-man…

62
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,667
That sparked our second war…

63
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,254
Forget it. Fine, let's go with Jong-man.

64
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,673
What? You got no backbone?

65
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,050
Our second truce was reached
in the silliest way.

66
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,011
I'll name it Su-bak. Su-bak.

67
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,679
That's so tacky.

68
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,514
Remember the first time we saw him?

69
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,309
He ate watermelon till his fur turned red.

70
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:12,395
You're so naive,
that's why you're never first.

71
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,776
-What?
-You're always throwing stuff.

72
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,695
You're picking a fight, huh?

73
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,613
For the next 15 years…

74
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,823
Su-bak.

75
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:29,620
…we went through 99 wars and 99 truces.

76
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,917
SU-BAK

77
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:39,088
Hey, you're officially Su-bak from now on.

78
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:44,343
Did Ha-gyeong know?
I've always, every single time,

79
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,013
let her win eventually.

80
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,056
MAIN BUDDHA HALL

81
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,515
How could you do that?

82
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:50,933
And…

83
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,518
Say something, Do-ha.

84
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,187
In the summer of 2022…

85
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,689
Make an excuse, at least!

86
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,693
…our 100th war broke out.

87
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,613
Get lost.

88
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,449
Back then, I didn't realize…

89
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:07,867
Let's never see each other.

90
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,244
…that our war…

91
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,163
You bastard.

92
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,000
…would last this long.

93
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:20,713
Song Ha-gyeong.

94
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,343
Do you still hate me so much?

95
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:27,970
I never realized…

96
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,517
you'd hate me so much.

97
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:40,900
Sadly, it seems Ha-gyeong still does.

98
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,450
Yes, sir. I'm heading to my desk.

99
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:51,369
I'll email you right away.

100
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,871
Yes, it can be completed by today.

101
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,667
Are you kidding me?

102
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,253
You haven't updated him?

103
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,463
It's okay, I'll explain.

104
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,841
How exactly will you do that?

105
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,385
Don't you know Mr. Oh's temper?
He'll freak out.

106
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,595
I'm telling you, just trust me.

107
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,851
What's going on in that head of yours?

108
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,565
It's sturdy.

109
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,235
How great is this? Neat and classy.

110
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:29,198
This is exactly how I wanted it.
See? This way works much better.

111
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,743
Isn't it amazing how open it feels?

112
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,496
So it's true,
you eventually end up giving in.

113
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,374
What was that? Your company motto.

114
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,336
-"A home is where people live."
-That's true.

115
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:47,175
I wanted my house my way, and you did
an amazing job making it happen.

116
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,807
I love it.

117
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:03,399
Wait, what's up with the railing?
It's completely opposite!

118
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:09,071
Right? You wanted this railing in metal,

119
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,408
and the wall over here in glass.

120
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:16,954
You knew that, and still did this?
People can see into the house!

121
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:22,293
They can't, and you get a great view.

122
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,591
What do you think?

123
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,804
I love it.

124
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,808
It took me two whole months.

125
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,563
If this railing was metal,
like you requested,

126
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:45,608
you wouldn't be able
to enjoy the view here.

127
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:52,198
If the whole second-floor wall is glass,
people outside can see in much easier.

128
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,243
When you hired me to build this house,

129
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,578
it was to enjoy your retirement here.

130
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,247
I did.

131
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:05,628
From now on, you can enjoy the landscape
through all four seasons.

132
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,676
Well done.

133
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:21,060
You could've ended up
getting sued this time, okay?

134
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,314
How did it turn out?
He'll even refer us to his friend.

135
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,317
-You didn't catch that, huh?
-You…

136
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,992
I said just do one thing.

137
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,203
Either just make it how the client wants,

138
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,747
or explain a little and leave it at that.

139
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:46,627
I can't. I've got to fight
to convince the resident.

140
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:48,921
Why are you always fighting?

141
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,258
Sometimes you just have
to let things go and move on.

142
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,636
How can I just let things go?
I'm the architect here.

143
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,806
If you keep giving in, you'll regret it.

144
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,642
No matter how long or how difficult,

145
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,603
we have to push through, right?

146
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:06,689
You're as stubborn as a mule.

147
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,901
-Talk about being stubborn.
-I'm not, I'm being sincere.

148
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,084
Do you still hate me so much?

149
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:35,843
Don't fool yourself. Why would I hate you?
There's nothing between us.

150
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:42,016
Mr. Baek, to hate someone,
you have to care first.

151
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,226
And there's nothing left between us.

152
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,228
That's a lie.

153
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:52,401
No, I don't feel anything
even when I see you.

154
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,239
That's a lie.

155
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,575
If that were true,

156
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,869
why would you sue
because I'm in the house?

157
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,249
You're seriously mistaken.

158
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,627
It's not that I hate you,
it's just ridiculous.

159
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,214
How can you claim any rights to the house?

160
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,508
I've lived in it, taken care of it.

161
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,594
What do you think you can do now?

162
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:22,223
Curious? About how I really feel,
even hiring a lawyer?

163
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,766
No, not even a little.

164
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,977
I couldn't care less about you.

165
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,697
What happened with Ha-gyeong?

166
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,702
She's been silent for an hour now,
driving me crazy.

167
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:46,997
Hey.

168
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:52,420
"Baek Do?" You have him saved as Baek Do,
Mr. Oh Seung-taek.

169
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,548
You must be so close. Giving him updates.

170
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,174
Are you Do-ha's minion?

171
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,175
Give it back.

172
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,805
I'm not a minion. What's that for?

173
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,307
-Just call me "hey."
-How could I do that?

174
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,269
You're close to Mr. Baek,
and I'm suing him.

175
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:12,815
That's why you met him behind my back

176
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,609
and introduced him to Mr. Seo?

177
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,072
Why? You have that lawyer friend.

178
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,450
The youngest son of S&J, 99% win rate,

179
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,243
who flipped the Factory case.

180
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:29,165
Look, I didn't know
Su-hyeok would take the case.

181
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,126
He handles celebs and big-money clients.

182
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,004
When he took the case, I was shocked too.

183
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,756
Either way, you introduced them.

184
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,844
This is where it ends for us.

185
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,637
Have you talked to Do-ha?

186
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,808
-It's been two years.
-That stupid "two years."

187
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,812
Seung-taek, it's driving me nuts.

188
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,358
I'm telling you,
it's the same as always between us.

189
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,402
There's nothing between us.

190
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,702
But you know me.

191
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,498
I don't back down from a fight.

192
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:14,668
Hey, what are you up to now?

193
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:19,590
This security footage shows Mr. Kim Gi-man

194
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:23,552
spent about 11 minutes in the hotel room.

195
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:28,015
That's not enough time to sleep
or have sex,

196
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,768
but plenty of time to inject a drug.

197
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,023
It's very likely he administered drugs
in the hotel room

198
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,859
alongside his acquaintances.

199
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,905
The prosecution recommends a sentence
of two years and six months.

200
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:48,035
-Bingo.
-Defense counsel, you may begin your case.

201
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,456
Why do you think

202
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,126
the defendant couldn't
have had sex in 11 minutes?

203
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,963
That's ridiculous.
Didn't you see the footage?

204
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:03,717
The defendant was in a fencing uniform
at the hotel room.

205
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:07,596
That uniform takes at least eight minutes
to put on and take off.

206
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,267
That means it happened
in just three minutes.

207
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,768
In three minutes.

208
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,396
Sorry?

209
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,857
-What is he talking about?
-Right.

210
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:22,820
As you said, taking the uniform on and off

211
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,531
leaves only about three minutes.
However…

212
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,243
that's more than enough for the defendant.

213
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,997
He's finished in a minute.

214
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:37,293
If you doubt it,

215
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:44,425
we're ready to submit a report
stating he has medical issues.

216
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,513
If still in doubt,

217
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,391
we'll submit prescriptions showing

218
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,852
he has been taking medication

219
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,438
for over three years.

220
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,066
That's all.

221
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,491
You lunatic,
almost the entire audience was reporters!

222
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,835
You told me to do whatever it took.
I did my part.

223
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,338
You can compete in the Olympics.

224
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,839
Who cares about that?

225
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:28,135
All the headlines
are full of "three minutes."

226
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,595
This is defamation.

227
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:33,766
For just 30 minutes,
put your phone down.

228
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:37,811
Soon, basketball player Go's wedding
and air quality will bury this.

229
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:42,149
People really don't care about
others' business.

230
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,778
COURT

231
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,781
I hear your fee is 100 million won
for this case.

232
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,784
You normally take big cases.

233
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:55,579
Why would you take
the tiny peanut house case?

234
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:58,499
With the Haerim Construction case,

235
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,335
you must be swamped with court hearings.

236
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,254
You've done plenty of research.

237
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,715
You enjoy making the defendant look bad.

238
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,467
I tried to benchmark that.

239
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,972
What did Do-ha say when he hired you?

240
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,808
What are the conditions and purpose?

241
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,728
Why should I tell you that?

242
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,818
Why did you take the peanut house case?

243
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,696
-It's a tiny case. Makes no sense.
-It's fun.

244
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,864
Sorry?

245
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,033
-That's all?
-Yes.

246
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,667
Give that to me.
That's why you were waiting for me.

247
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,883
Case number 2022164.

248
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:53,262
Look the case up.
It's the one where S&J lost.

249
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,056
I defended the case.

250
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:00,019
You'd better back out
before it gets messier.

251
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:05,190
The correct way to refer to it is
Case Number 2022-Gohap-164.

252
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:09,486
Then you can look it up properly.
The correct term is "represented myself,"

253
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,321
not "defended the case."

254
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:15,617
I'll take a look.
It'll be fun seeing your writing again.

255
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,372
As you know,
appeals are my area of expertise.

256
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,625
My client is thinking about
taking this to appeal.

257
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,377
You'd better brace yourself.

258
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,213
Besides, I'm not planning to back off yet.

259
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,507
Well then.

260
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:44,063
You've only lived in the house
for 21 days a year,

261
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,398
and yet you claim to know its value,

262
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,817
because you only recall the good parts,

263
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:52,821
not the nightmare parts. Plus…

264
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,239
Is there no next part?

265
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,575
As you said, she showed up in court.

266
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:02,414
She realized I wouldn't budge,
so I figured she'd go to you.

267
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,336
Looks like
you know everything about Ms. Song.

268
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,215
Take a look at this too.

269
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,634
Here's a file with the details

270
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,804
of how Ms. Song managed the house
the last two years.

271
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,931
She claims that because you neglected

272
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,518
your duty to manage the house,
she has more rights.

273
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:26,522
She attached every receipt
to show she's been handling repairs

274
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,273
and maintenance alone.

275
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,694
This part could be used
to our disadvantage.

276
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,906
No, this part
definitely won't work against us.

277
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,958
There were over 200 complaints in a day
during the monsoon.

278
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,794
The word "rain" makes me feel sick.

279
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,921
I'm worried about this year.

280
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,507
People are worried that without the fence,

281
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,968
the farmland will get wiped out.

282
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,137
Headquarters called and said

283
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:03,183
the fence project lead needs to attend
a meeting tomorrow due to the complaints.

284
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,937
They said we need to make some adjustments
to the project.

285
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:11,692
And, Ms. Song,
you're the first in standby team one.

286
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:16,071
If a heavy rain advisory comes in,
go and reassure the residents.

287
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,156
This psycho!

288
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,328
Sorry about that.

289
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,375
Baek Do-ha, you really wanna die?

290
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:35,799
What? The money you sent every month
was actually for maintenance?

291
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:39,720
You think I'll buy that?
Do you really take me for a fool?

292
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,931
You think the notices you sent make sense?

293
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,559
You exaggerated a bit too much.

294
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,146
I only wrote the truth.

295
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:51,440
You know how hard it was to manage?

296
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,068
Forget it. Cut the crap.

297
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:58,071
Why did the money for Su-bak
turn into fees?

298
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,990
I sent money every month.

299
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,325
What?

300
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,536
But you still failed to do the repairs.

301
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,996
I can't believe this.

302
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,624
What did I fail to do?

303
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:10,876
Jong-man.

304
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,007
On top of that, it's my private property.

305
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,426
What happened to my tree? Explain.

306
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,556
You know the neighbor's mulberry tree?

307
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,142
Leaf blight got to it.

308
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,188
Trees, once they get sick,
lose leaves fast.

309
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,607
You didn't take care of it properly.

310
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,776
Hey, Ha-gyeong.

311
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:39,321
Since coming back,
I've found many things against you.

312
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:43,617
You wanna keep fighting?
If this goes to court, you'll lose.

313
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,993
What?

314
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:49,414
You damaged the fence, our common property
and cut this without consent.

315
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,375
Ha-gyeong, you won't win…

316
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,253
this time.

317
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,839
I'm not letting you win.

318
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,218
-Letting me win?
-You didn't know?

319
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:05,931
I've always, every single time…
ended up letting you win.

320
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,392
-Why?
-Why?

321
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,104
You ask because you don't know?

322
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:22,489
Why are you doing this?
You didn't come for the house, did you?

323
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:30,247
You finally want to know?
You want me to tell you?

324
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,915
No, don't tell me.

325
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:36,086
I don't care to hear
or know anything from you anymore.

326
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,297
You're lying.

327
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,049
You want to know.

328
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,475
How would I believe what you say?

329
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,814
You're basically a scammer,
you shameless being.

330
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,400
Do you not feel sorry?

331
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:04,573
You should've been put in jail for fraud
two years ago.

332
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,579
Hey, Song Ha-gyeong.

333
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:14,458
Like I said back then,

334
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,919
I don't feel sorry at all.

335
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,341
Ask me a hundred times, I'll say the same.

336
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,433
Yeah, I guess that's why you did that.

337
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,814
Thanks for proving you're garbage
till the end.

338
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,861
I tried to end this nicely
with lame childhood memories,

339
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,490
but fine, let's drag each other
through the mud.

340
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,743
That's the ending that suits us.

341
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:22,442
Leave, leave

342
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,529
Disappear

343
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,157
Please just leave

344
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:31,493
Please

345
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,788
Su-bak… isn't she really cute?

346
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,626
She's doing the same thing as high school.

347
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,045
She still hasn't grown up.

348
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,590
Please get out of my sight

349
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,800
ARCHITECTURAL TEAM

350
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:59,437
We're getting swamped with complaints,
you couldn't get consent forms.

351
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,939
That's where we're at.

352
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,942
I'm actively dealing with the complaints.

353
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,820
I've got over 40% of the consent forms.

354
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,739
You're being optimistic
when it's less than half.

355
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,493
If I sign, does it make it 41%?

356
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:33,054
JEON NAM-JIN

357
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:37,976
As someone living in Pacheon
and as a public architect, I agree.

358
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:41,021
I'll fully agree and support

359
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,773
whatever Ms. Song does on this project.

360
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,904
I'll get all the consent forms.

361
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:51,573
Please do that.

362
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,870
Ms. Song.

363
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:02,751
Hey, Ha-gyeong!
I'll give you a ride. Just hop in.

364
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,672
Ha-gyeong, I've forgiven you.

365
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:12,260
Even though you sued me and
I had to pay a fine using my savings,

366
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,597
I think of it as the price of loving you.

367
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,894
Right, you know how much people at HQ
are still badmouthing you?

368
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:24,564
Every time, I've defended you.

369
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,816
You didn't know, did you?

370
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,527
Mr. Jeon.

371
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,906
When did you say you bought the car?

372
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:36,284
This, Coco,
has only been around for six months.

373
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:38,662
Hop in.

374
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:44,459
If Coco's side mirror gets smashed,
you'd be really sad?

375
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,253
Yeah.

376
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,756
-You want me to make you sad?
-No, wait.

377
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,133
Hold on.

378
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:54,427
Get your hands off.

379
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,471
You'll go, right?

380
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,516
I should.

381
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:02,310
Bye.

382
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:14,489
See you around, Ha-gyeong!

383
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,102
I'll find your treat.

384
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,441
Where's the treat?

385
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:52,861
Is it over there?

386
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,822
There it is.

387
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:03,663
ZOLPIDEM

388
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:26,853
Your phone's been ringing forever.
From Grandpa, heart?

389
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:31,358
Don't be ridiculous.
My grandpa would never call me.

390
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,109
It's ringing again.

391
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,821
Maybe there's something wrong?
Look. It says "Grandpa."

392
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,425
Grandpa, what's going on?

393
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,302
Ms. Iseul?

394
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:01,679
Yes?

395
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,974
I've heard a lot about you
from your grandfather.

396
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:08,144
I work at Daeguk Bank. I'm Yoon Jeong-han.

397
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:17,153
I'm sorry,
but I don't understand what's going on.

398
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,406
Did Grandpa take a loan…

399
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,326
or are we having a blind date?

400
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,370
Yes, it's not about a loan.

401
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:28,081
It's a blind date. He didn't mention it?

402
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:30,792
No.

403
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:35,296
I'm really caught off guard right now.

404
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,466
I have a boyfriend! I'm so sorry!

405
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,517
How could you do that?

406
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,354
I've been with my boyfriend
for over ten years.

407
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:54,399
I said I'd never approve of that guy.

408
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,777
You either cut ties with me

409
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,780
or go to that guy. Make a choice!

410
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,574
I'm holding my ground

411
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:06,619
by not cutting ties with you
and I'm not marrying him either.

412
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,414
I'm trying to find middle ground!

413
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,543
Can't you see how much I'm trying?

414
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:17,756
And honestly, what's wrong with him?

415
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,385
He's good-looking, smart, well-educated,
from a prosecutor's family.

416
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,598
Not that that's why I like him.

417
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,268
Someone like him
is more than enough for me!

418
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:34,063
Enough? How can he be enough for you?

419
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,906
OH SEUNG-TAEK

420
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:07,931
Let's run!

421
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,061
ONE SHOT ONE GOAL!

422
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,771
Oh Seung-taek!

423
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,232
You got this!

424
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,945
So handsome!

425
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:31,621
Baek-do, sit one seat away.

426
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:35,458
-Why are you like this?
-Keep a proper distance.

427
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:37,961
My last loyalty to Song.

428
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,338
The last loyalty.

429
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,596
That final line is kind of short.

430
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,890
I always settle for middle ground.

431
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,893
You and Ha-gyeong.

432
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,980
Grandpa and Seung-taek.

433
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,284
What?

434
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,620
Hey, how did you get in?

435
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:16,165
I came in through the common area.

436
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,334
Don't you know the house is linked?

437
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:24,132
There's a big window in the living room,
and you've got blackout curtains?

438
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,551
-Sleep in the room.
-Why do you care?

439
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,678
I can sleep anywhere.

440
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:32,265
Of course I care.
You slept in my room too.

441
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,692
You're welcome to sleep there.

442
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,488
What? No. Why would I sleep in your room?

443
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:50,742
Yes, you did. Quite often at that.

444
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,243
No, I didn't.

445
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,706
-Where did you get that?
-The basement.

446
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,838
-Get out.
-What? Hey!

447
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,799
-Get out. Hey, you should go.
-What's with you?

448
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,510
Don't come in.

449
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,636
What?

450
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,809
Don't you know
every house has a master key?

451
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,481
I've been wondering about this forever.

452
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:08,444
How'd you pass the exam
and get into med school?

453
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,697
Hey.

454
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:25,086
Song Ha-gyeong.

455
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,923
You want the house?

456
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,968
What's this bull?

457
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,679
Bull? We're turning 30 next year.

458
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:38,766
There are better words like "suggestion,"
"mercy," or "kindness."

459
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,729
On one condition.

460
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,650
Let's go find Jong-man together.

461
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:55,908
Mr. Baek.

462
00:33:56,784 --> 00:34:00,038
I stayed up all night for three days
to make this.

463
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,627
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

464
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:12,383
They have three kids.
Everything goes but the walls.

465
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,053
Sorry?

466
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,304
What are you doing?

467
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,896
-Changing the design.
-Turn down Professor Kim's.

468
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,023
CEO Choi's too.

469
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,567
CEO Choi's…

470
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:33,488
How can we reject that?
That's worth a fortune.

471
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,572
Turn it down.

472
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:42,580
The completion date stays the same?

473
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:47,085
This is unrealistic. Why's he doing this?

474
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,962
I think I'm dying.

475
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:54,092
The contest hasn't even been announced.
Why are we doing this?

476
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:57,970
I'll settle this.

477
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,395
PERMIT LIST
TIMELINE?

478
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:09,023
Hey, Do-ha, we need to talk.

479
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:11,943
Two private
and one public project left, right?

480
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:13,736
Why's this taking so long?

481
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,197
Well…

482
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,158
the person in charge went on long leave--

483
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,202
-I know, to Jeju Island.
-Yeah.

484
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,000
My fiancée's dress fitting is next week.

485
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:31,587
I've been looking for loans,
my pride's at an all-time low.

486
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:32,839
Stop that.

487
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:33,965
FLIGHT BOOKED

488
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,800
I booked the earliest one.

489
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:38,427
Been dumped thrice,
putting up three buildings.

490
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,973
-She's my last chance.
-Get the permit, no matter what.

491
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,517
Then, we should start the Patan project.

492
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,771
I'll book the hotel too.
One day should be enough, right?

493
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,232
Are you even human?

494
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,863
If this Patan project doesn't work out,
you and I are done.

495
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,409
It will work out, for sure.

496
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,871
I designed it,
you went all out carving it.

497
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,957
Summer's my lucky season.

498
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,210
Don't look for me. I've done my bit.

499
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,965
Make sure you eat something.
It'll be around lunchtime.

500
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,091
ASH TREE

501
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,394
It had thicker branches than those.

502
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:34,233
Why aren't you picking up the phone?

503
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:38,404
Weren't we supposed to meet in front?
You should've said you came in.

504
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,531
Sir, how much is this?

505
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:45,411
No, this one's a different variety.
Jong-man was an ash tree from Jirisan.

506
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,456
Let's go to another one.

507
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,512
The leaves are too small.

508
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,603
The stem's kind of thick.

509
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:17,109
The stem needs to be thin

510
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:20,029
with the leaves spread out
for more shade.

511
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,115
Wanna see another shop?

512
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,664
The leaf veins are different.

513
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,000
Jong-man's leaf veins looked really bold.

514
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:37,213
You said they're like fingerprints.
How do we find the same veins?

515
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,424
You can. There are twin trees.

516
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:43,135
These trees are twins.

517
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,388
I took the cuttings from one tree

518
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:47,473
and just put it out to sell today.

519
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:48,975
How about these?

520
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,397
-Shall we look over there?
-Shall we?

521
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,982
We'll come back.

522
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:02,863
Let's just get a big one.
This one looks similar.

523
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:07,493
Build a childish tree house with this,
though you're 29.

524
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:09,870
No, I'll get a small one.

525
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,999
The same one like 17 years ago.

526
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:16,502
Fine, then get a small one.

527
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,671
Hey, this one looks the same.

528
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:22,216
No, a bigger one might be better.

529
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,803
What should I pick? I can't decide.

530
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,430
Cut the crap, just buy it.

531
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,686
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Did you forget why we're here?

532
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,898
-Let's do our best.
-I'm already doing my best.

533
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,026
I took a half-day off for this.

534
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,736
Who said to kill that tree?

535
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,616
You never raised anything.

536
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,620
I did the raising while you were gone.

537
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,415
I took care of Su-bak and Jong-man.

538
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:55,708
You did nothing.

539
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,419
Don't you remember?

540
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,589
I took pictures
and sent them to you every year.

541
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,552
You need to see it.

542
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,014
I sent this photo of Jong-man in 2013.

543
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,683
This is in 2014.

544
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,788
Let's hurry. Traffic's bad.

545
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,960
-Is this from Jirisan?
-That's a different variety.

546
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,014
Next time, let's go to a plant market.

547
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:54,975
It's hard to find Jong-man.

548
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,606
Still, we've got those.

549
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:04,610
They purify the air, soothe your mind,

550
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:08,864
and help with insomnia.
They're especially good for insomnia.

551
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,534
-I'll put a few in your room.
-Delete my photos.

552
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:16,372
No, you sent all those Jong-man's photos.

553
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,540
Not them.

554
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,793
-Why?
-"Why?"

555
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,586
Those are my photos.

556
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,588
Hey, they're my photos of you.

557
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:28,092
Didn't you see it on my phone?
Looks good, unlike you.

558
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:31,220
-Want me to send it? For a profile pic?
-Forget it.

559
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,975
Stick to your word.
The buyers are barely holding on.

560
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:37,852
Don't you say otherwise.

561
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:41,814
Why do you only talk about
selling the house every time we meet?

562
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:45,693
Not easy to get a buyer like that.
They won't renovate the house.

563
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:49,363
If you're eager to sell it,
why turn down every single offer?

564
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,450
What?

565
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:58,664
Well… you know…

566
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,459
I'm close with Mr. Koo.

567
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:05,963
I've heard about every buyer
who got rejected over the years.

568
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,257
It's just that I have to

569
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,427
sell it to a decent person
who'll keep things clean.

570
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,888
Fine, if you say so, then so be it.

571
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:19,810
Let's come separately,
choose what we want, and text.

572
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:23,606
And don't talk to me from now on.

573
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:38,245
Does Ha-gyeong have trouble sleeping?

574
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,540
OH SEUNG-TAEK, ONE SHOT ONE GOAL!

575
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,752
Did it start two years ago?

576
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,884
Ever since then, right?

577
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,596
She can't sleep…

578
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,766
so she goes to a sleep clinic.

579
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,937
I managed to get her off the pills.

580
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:07,358
After her mom passed away,
her dad started wandering abroad.

581
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:09,985
She became the only one left.

582
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,613
How could she get any sleep?

583
00:42:30,464 --> 00:42:32,258
Rosemary really works wonders.

584
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,602
-What are you doing?
-What do you mean?

585
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,230
I've been watching you.

586
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,193
Since the last time I saw you…

587
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,238
What? Why?

588
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:57,575
You've really aged.

589
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,537
At our age, we need to use eye cream,
firming cream.

590
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:03,247
You turn 30, too late.

591
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:07,209
Get off.

592
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,302
Ha-gyeong!

593
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:26,895
Who's that?

594
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:30,399
None of your business. Go on in.

595
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,902
What are you doing here?

596
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:40,868
There's no cafe around here.

597
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,371
Hey, your neighborhood
hasn't really changed.

598
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:48,334
There's nothing around, so quiet at night.

599
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,087
Mosquito.

600
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,714
What brings you here?

601
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,675
-Who's he?
-Who's the guy with the attitude?

602
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,927
Who's this rude guy?

603
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:03,932
Ha-gyeong. Is he your boyfriend?

604
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:07,978
You should go.
If you want to talk, just email me.

605
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:09,396
-Leave.
-Email? Wait.

606
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:13,067
Hold on. Didn't you block me yet? Why?

607
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:16,695
You haven't gotten over me yet?

608
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:20,991
Ha-gyeong, why do you keep giving me
a hard time?

609
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,827
No wonder I kept thinking about you.

610
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:27,956
All right, why don't we talk inside,
if that's okay?

611
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:30,709
I need to talk to you.

612
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,922
Say bye and come in.

613
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,842
Where do you think you're going?

614
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,140
-Who are you?
-None of your business.

615
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,727
You should leave now.
And don't come back.

616
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:49,853
Stop it.

617
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,941
Hey. Hey.

618
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:58,987
Who do you think you are?

619
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:03,200
Who asked you to butt in?
Ha-gyeong, is he your boyfriend or what?

620
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,660
Stop it.

621
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,412
You don't get it.

622
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,789
Hey! Unbelievable.

623
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,418
Let go. Hey, let go.

624
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:15,462
Let go on three or you'll regret it.

625
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,880
One, two…

626
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,932
I didn't fall down.
I'm just warming up.

627
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:29,101
Seriously.

628
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,519
You're in big trouble.

629
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:40,988
My back hurts.

630
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:47,953
It's not like I wanted
to wait outside at this late hour.

631
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:51,915
There are tons of mosquitos too.
See? I'm covered in sweat.

632
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,376
I was just standing there.

633
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,504
I saw a familiar face, so I said hi…

634
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:03,385
And I ended up like this.

635
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:08,390
After your breakup,
did he keep coming to see you?

636
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,393
Well, not really.

637
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:15,481
I know what's going on here.
You think I'm a stalker?

638
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:19,568
I wasn't going to bring this up,

639
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:23,614
but I'm the head of
a local architectural firm in Pacheon.

640
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:25,616
So?

641
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,493
You don't get it.

642
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:31,747
My cousin is a section-chief
government official,

643
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,916
my uncle is the township head.

644
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:37,961
My aunt was just promoted
to director of construction at City Hall.

645
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,256
I'm embarrassed to say this,

646
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,885
but in Pacheon,
I'm a bit of a celebrity.

647
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:47,471
So why would I…

648
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,850
the 27th descendant
of the Pacheon Jeon Clan,

649
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:54,353
commit a crime in Pacheon…

650
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:56,980
How would I dare commit a crime, Officer?

651
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:00,108
Cut it out.
The officer doesn't like those antics.

652
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:01,985
Is your surname really Pi?

653
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:05,656
Yes, I'm the 30th descendant
of the Hongcheon Pi Clan.

654
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,533
Pleased to meet you.

655
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:14,957
In this neighborhood, Song Ha-gyeong
isn't more famous than me, is she?

656
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,254
I think it'll be quicker for me to talk.

657
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,590
I think he came
to get some closure with me.

658
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:28,679
As you can see, he's a man of gestures.

659
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,931
-He tripped himself.
-Song Ha-gyeong.

660
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,019
Whose side are you on?

661
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:38,689
Don't do me like that.

662
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:41,191
I stayed on your side.

663
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,859
Mr. Jeon, that's enough.

664
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,319
Hey, Ha-gyeong.

665
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:47,948
Why are you doing this?
You said so before.

666
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,325
You couldn't stand it, wanted it cut.

667
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:55,747
You'd always say that when we'd meet,
so I cut down all your trees.

668
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,457
I told you to cut it out!

669
00:47:58,333 --> 00:48:00,252
-Stop it.
-For real!

670
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,422
-Stop talking!
-Hold on, hold on.

671
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:04,715
One second!

672
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,968
Hey, Song Ha-gyeong.

673
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:13,640
Do you know how much I spent
to cut down those trees?

674
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,892
How much, you son of a bitch?

675
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:23,066
About 250,000 won…

676
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,193
Are you okay?

677
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:49,926
Hey, Song Ha-gyeong.

678
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,727
Is what he said true?

679
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:03,565
Yeah. I told him to cut it.

680
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:09,780
Why are you overreacting?
They're just trees.

681
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:13,325
They'll be nothing when the house is sold.

682
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,327
You mean that?

683
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:18,372
Can selling the house erase…

684
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,041
17 years of our memories?

685
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,506
Memories? What are we, children?

686
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,967
We have bills,
you're talking about memories?

687
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:36,807
Because we kissed there one time?

688
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:40,435
Then, my ex and I would kiss

689
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,312
every time at the bus stop.

690
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,315
And the ex before that, at the beach.

691
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,234
Are those all memories?

692
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:50,737
If your heart races every time,
how do you live?

693
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,491
Don't force your memories on me.

694
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:58,286
You were here 21 days out of the year.

695
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,581
You stayed briefly in summer.

696
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,086
Who are you to say anything to me?

697
00:50:11,466 --> 00:50:14,094
Your words can have a lot interpretations.

698
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:15,804
So what?

699
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,850
Were you disappointed?
Are you saying you felt hurt?

700
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,644
You want me to stay longer?

701
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,368
Hey.

702
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:41,788
You just come briefly on vacation,
then leave.

703
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,666
You may think this place
is your vacation home.

704
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,084
But for me…

705
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:48,712
it's terrible.

706
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,591
There's so much stuff in every corner.

707
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:58,638
This space is huge.
It's like a condensed version of my life.

708
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,057
I'm so sick of it!

709
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,146
If you don't leave, I will.

710
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,279
PET EXCLUSIVE TAXI
RUFF RIDE

711
00:52:17,175 --> 00:52:19,928
What in the world is going on?

712
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:24,432
If you'd explain the context first,
I'd appreciate it as the owner.

713
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,228
Drink more.

714
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,899
Su-bak!

715
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,527
Why did you come out?

716
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,577
It's scary, right?

717
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:51,543
Heavy rain advisory is issued
for the entire metropolitan area.

718
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:53,795
Particularly in Patan of Pacheon,

719
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:57,173
a rate of 100 ml per hour
of heavy rain is anticipated.

720
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,717
Hence the warning.

721
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:05,765
Due to the sudden heavy downpours,
there's a risk of flooding and landslides,

722
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,519
so nearby residents
should evacuate to a safe area.

723
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:31,625
I don't know.

724
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:35,337
I think something happened with Baek Do.

725
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:40,133
Seung-taek, talk to Baek Do
and call me back.

726
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:44,804
I'll find out what happened
from Ha-gyeong.

727
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:46,932
Song?

728
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:50,018
Wanna have a beer?

729
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,106
Where did she go?

730
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:52,914
No.

731
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,258
I called it a stupid memory.

732
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,806
So this is how I'll die?

733
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,580
Song Ha-gyeong!

734
00:57:24,732 --> 00:57:25,859
Hey, Song Ha-gyeong.

735
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:28,945
Are you okay? Feeling better?

736
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,834
The box. What about the box?

737
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:45,712
Why do you…

738
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,342
Move.

739
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:08,943
Got a death wish?

740
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,698
What is it?

741
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:19,162
You said those are useless.
You said you were sick of it.

742
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,001
You risked your life for that?

743
00:58:27,128 --> 00:58:28,755
BAEK DO-YOUNG

744
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:35,011
We have a box

745
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:38,640
that should never be opened.

746
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,936
Especially not for Ha-gyeong.

747
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,901
I knew it.

748
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,198
I knew it the second you showed up.

749
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:02,038
This happens every time I see you.

750
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,166
I'm barely holding it together.

751
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,919
I'm barely holding it in, but every time…

752
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,045
Every time what?

753
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:17,262
We end up a mess like this.

754
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:26,938
We really need to end this.

755
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,942
Let's get out of each other's life.

756
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,703
You said that two years ago.

757
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:51,713
Go ahead, say the rest.

758
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:57,343
Sure.

759
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,762
You and me…

760
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:03,349
when I think it can't get any worse,
it gets worse.

761
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:07,687
I'm scared of how much worse
it could become.

762
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,403
I won't sell the house.

763
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:17,905
So you should stop too.

764
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:20,992
Don't come back.

765
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:27,206
Let's not be involved
with each other for good.

766
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,667
So…

767
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:33,171
get lost.

768
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,260
Fine.

769
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:42,513
I'll get out of your life.

770
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:46,434
Just like you want, for good.

771
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,145
I'll never come back.

772
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:53,316
I'll disappear for good.

773
01:00:58,571 --> 01:00:59,822
I would've said that…

774
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:03,409
ten years ago.

775
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:06,371
And…

776
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:10,500
two years ago as well.

777
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:15,380
But not anymore.

778
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,591
I won't listen to you.

779
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,345
Song Ha-gyeong.

780
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,014
Do you know why I came back?

781
01:01:27,225 --> 01:01:30,853
I want to try getting through
that unbearable summer with you.

782
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:36,526
That's why I came back.

783
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:40,196
I'm not leaving.

784
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:43,074
I won't get lost.

785
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:49,497
I know.

786
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,959
For us to face the summer together,

787
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:56,254
we'll have to open that box.

788
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:01,342
I came back this summer

789
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,637
to open the box.

790
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:22,864
BAEK DO-YOUNG

791
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,878
Mr. Baek, so what's your next plan?

792
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:40,465
It's renovating the abandoned school
into an observatory.

793
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,008
The architect's from New York.

794
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,135
What are you doing here?

795
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:46,095
-You really won't get lost?
-Ha-gyeong.

796
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,723
-You like Mr. Baek that much?
-I do.

797
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:49,932
If you confess

798
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:51,851
under the Summer Triangle

799
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:54,353
on July 7th, you'll never break up.

800
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:58,399
Why do you keep appearing before me
when I want to forget you?

801
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:02,069
-Hate me all you want, by my side.
-Hey!

802
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:04,781
I'm going to like you all summer long.

803
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,909
Are you really gonna live here with me?

804
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:11,287
Who do you think you are?
What gives you the right?

805
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,664
If anyone has the right, it's not you.
