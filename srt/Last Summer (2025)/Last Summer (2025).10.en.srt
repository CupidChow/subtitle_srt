1
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,084
<i>My brother was always transparent.</i>

2
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:48,256
<i>When I followed his gaze,</i>
<i>I could see it all.</i>

3
00:00:48,923 --> 00:00:50,508
<i>That he wanted to stay with our mom.</i>

4
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,761
How's she part of our family?

5
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:55,263
You're the one barging into my house.

6
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,848
We need to be together now.

7
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:59,559
We're going to see
the Summer Triangle from today.

8
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:03,229
You said Gemini was your favorite
because it was just for the two of us.

9
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:04,689
Guys.

10
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:05,940
What is that?

11
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,108
I want to see it too.

12
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,651
-Me too.
-Give it to me.

13
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,653
-Come here.
-You guys…

14
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:11,571
Hey!

15
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,156
Let me see!

16
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,158
-Hey, kids.
-Come here.

17
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,494
Don't get hurt.

18
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:18,787
Let me see.

19
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,455
-They look the same.
-Constellations?

20
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,957
-Is that from <i>The Little Mermaid</i>?
<i>-The Little Mermaid.</i>

21
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,251
<i>That he completely forgot</i>
<i>about our promise</i>

22
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,754
<i>and now has a new family.</i>

23
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:33,593
<i>That he liked living</i>
<i>in this house with them.</i>

24
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:36,888
<i>And that</i>

25
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,766
<i>he liked…</i>

26
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,061
<i>Song Ha-gyeong.</i>

27
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,150
<i>I knew why he liked her too.</i>

28
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,319
<i>Because I also</i>

29
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,780
<i>fell for her in no time.</i>

30
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:57,325
The best you can do is step aside.

31
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,580
<i>Do-young was transparent until the end.</i>

32
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:04,833
<i>And not long after…</i>

33
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,878
<i>I heard that he'd gone missing.</i>

34
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:14,676
What do you mean?

35
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,346
Just like I said.

36
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,265
So you're saying…

37
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,393
Do-young is…

38
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,770
He was discovered…

39
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:28,898
in the south of Denali.

40
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,026
So…

41
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,447
it took you this long to come back
because…

42
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:42,912
To bring him…

43
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:45,790
home.

44
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,127
To Do-young's home.

45
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:12,942
You did this alone…

46
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,112
All alone back then and even now…

47
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,614
You really--

48
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,331
I didn't want to confuse you

49
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,459
when nothing was certain.

50
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,879
I've received too many messages

51
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,257
saying that…

52
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,219
it might've been him.

53
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,815
This time, I'll listen
and talk things through with you.

54
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:55,443
So tell me everything.

55
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,488
Everything that's happened.

56
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,754
<i>Three years ago…</i>

57
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,466
<i>I received his belongings.</i>

58
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,344
<i>He'd gone missing.</i>

59
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,764
<i>We knew what it meant.</i>

60
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,559
<i>But…</i>

61
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,188
<i>nothing had been confirmed.</i>

62
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:34,941
<i>I wanted to believe</i>

63
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,736
<i>that there was a chance he was alive.</i>

64
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,118
SONG

65
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,543
<i>Hey, Baek Do-young.</i>

66
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:55,837
<i>Hello?</i>

67
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,714
<i>Hey!</i>

68
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,132
Hey.

69
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,970
<i>-Do-young.</i>
-What is it?

70
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,889
<i>My mom's in the ER now.</i>
<i>What do I do?</i>

71
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,435
<i>I had no choice but to believe.</i>

72
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:58,858
I didn't want to
put you through this again.

73
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,695
Our family had such a hard time

74
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,656
waiting for him to get back to us.

75
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,203
I know it's late,
but you deserve to say bye to him.

76
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,246
I can't imagine…

77
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,376
how you've felt all this time.

78
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,214
It's great to be young!

79
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,354
I finally made it.
The amazing Peanut House.

80
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,609
Let's go inside. It's freezing in Korea.

81
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,782
Not that way. To the right.

82
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,212
These scamps,

83
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,132
they've never made a face like this
in front of me.

84
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:10,388
But why is she always between my boys?

85
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:18,104
I was curious to find out
what's so special about the Peanut House.

86
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,814
It's not so impressive.

87
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:23,860
It's just the style, pattern, and texture
that were trendy back then.

88
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,196
It has absolutely
no architectural elegance.

89
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,533
Is this the best you can do,
Director Baek?

90
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,495
It's more about practicality
than aesthetics,

91
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,497
for the person living here.

92
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,585
That's why no one's asking you
to design houses, Mom.

93
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:44,881
Ever since he was young,
your dad never had an eye for style.

94
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,633
His taste improved thanks to me,

95
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,845
but looking at this house,
it's back to square one.

96
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:55,099
Ms. Nam, don't you think
that's too harsh to say right off the bat?

97
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:56,601
You think so?

98
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,935
Sorry, Peanut House.

99
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,607
You and I have met before, right?

100
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,109
Yes.

101
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,325
<i>Ms. Nam.</i>

102
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,082
Did you call me? Do-ha's friend?

103
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,667
<i>Take him to a doctor right away.</i>

104
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,879
<i>If you keep neglecting him,</i>
<i>I'm reporting you for child abuse!</i>

105
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,341
<i>He's had a runny nose all day,</i>
<i>and you didn't even notice.</i>

106
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:32,053
<i>Are you really that busy</i>
<i>that you can't tell your own son's sick?</i>

107
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,098
You still got that attitude.

108
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,559
You haven't changed.

109
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,312
You haven't changed either,

110
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,564
-still just as selfish.
-Hey.

111
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,283
It was a good call
to place him in the columbarium.

112
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,827
He can finally rest in peace.

113
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,373
I picked a place that's easiest to get to.

114
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,751
I don't think I can come often.

115
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,795
Send me pictures sometimes.

116
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,176
But the three of you,

117
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,428
how are you coping so well?

118
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,434
This is actually our third memorial.

119
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,397
We already held a funeral

120
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,816
when Do-young went missing.

121
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,946
I'm sure you're shocked, Ha-gyeong.
We had a memorial already this year.

122
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:36,284
Thanks to Do-ha,
we're doing it twice this year.

123
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,832
Bringing him home wouldn't have been easy.
Do-ha handled it well.

124
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:48,337
It was the first time
I'd ever seen Do-ha be stubborn.

125
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,302
All right.

126
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:57,805
Why don't we go see Do-young?

127
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,660
I guess what he ate
while climbing the Himalayas

128
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:20,911
did the trick.

129
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,372
What was that?

130
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,126
It was like some curry,
which you eat with your hands.

131
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,712
Dalbam?

132
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,839
It's <i>dāl bhāt.</i>

133
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,428
I know Do-young

134
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,765
loved instant food and junk food.

135
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,769
Whenever he visited the US in winter,
the three of us had a burger party.

136
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,229
He loved a full-course Korean meal.

137
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,441
When Do-young came to Korea,
all he wanted was kimchi stew.

138
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,237
Can you not ruin my memories, please?

139
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,118
When did he fix this?

140
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,663
I can tell you did it.

141
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:07,583
I was always the one tidying up
after he made a mess.

142
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,754
You've been coming here all along?

143
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,761
REPUBLIC OF KOREA
PASSPORT

144
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:28,270
My son was real-world traveler.

145
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,900
He hardly had any time to be home…

146
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,320
and kept busy, right?

147
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,947
Hey, Baek Do!

148
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,785
You said you'd be wandering around,
following the stars.

149
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,077
Baek Do

150
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:12,500
lived a dramatic life
and made a dramatic comeback, too.

151
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,884
He must've had a hard time

152
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,803
pretending to be Do-young.

153
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,853
Are you okay?

154
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,731
Did you stubbornness pay off?

155
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,900
I'm really glad.

156
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,862
It finally feels like
we said goodbye to him properly

157
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,699
and you and Mom look at peace.

158
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,162
You remember

159
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,915
when you said you'd come back
to the Peanut House?

160
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:59,129
You said it takes both determination
and a plan to come home.

161
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,673
Do you still feel so?

162
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,801
<i>Think about what?</i>

163
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,136
<i>I thought you were coming back</i>
<i>to Korea now.</i>

164
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,223
I made up my mind, but I need a plan.

165
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:14,228
It's different now.
Things are sorted out.

166
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,150
I'm telling the truth, Director Baek.

167
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,529
Let's go, it's cold. Where's Mom?

168
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,297
Funny seeing you like this.
Has it been five months?

169
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,550
I knew I'd run into you one day
because of Song or Do-ha.

170
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,552
I didn't know it'd be because of Do-young.

171
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:48,846
Tell me about it.

172
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,645
You're going to Seoul for training.
I need a ride to the station.

173
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,315
I have a date today.

174
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,318
Why?

175
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,779
Did you think I wouldn't date anyone
and wait for you forever?

176
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:07,740
Put your seatbelt on.

177
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,756
The whole July 7 fate thing
was total bullshit.

178
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,467
I guess Do-young made it up
just to recruit members.

179
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,470
It's baseless and meaningless.

180
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,180
Nothing showed up when I looked up.

181
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:36,268
It was so frustrating
that I spent 12 years believing that.

182
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,479
I can't even punch Do-young now.

183
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,404
Still, it was nice

184
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,741
to see Do-young again.

185
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,925
You've cleaned it out.

186
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,635
I did the day after we broke up.

187
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:18,727
I knew it.
You're surprisingly cold and brutal.

188
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,065
I cleaned everything up

189
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,235
the very day we broke up.

190
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,322
Do you know how many boxes
of your things there were?

191
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,409
I threw away all the victory pucks.

192
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:37,788
There were roughly 127 of them
when I counted them.

193
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:38,706
Good.

194
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,291
I don't do small talk anymore.

195
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,294
Look. This frown.

196
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,258
I've leveled up to a person
who is insensitive to others' feelings.

197
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:50,634
Good.

198
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:55,556
My current boyfriend
is just amazing.

199
00:16:55,639 --> 00:17:00,519
I've only got a month of my twenties left,
so I'm making the most of it every day.

200
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,771
I was hung up on one guy

201
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,649
for over ten years, and I had no idea

202
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,570
there were so many guys out there.

203
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,284
<i>Was I too harsh?</i>

204
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,621
<i>Or are you jealous?</i>

205
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:21,915
Get off.

206
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,585
You're here.
Your boyfriend must be waiting.

207
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,258
Fine.

208
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,274
Good job getting through it.

209
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:50,402
I've had to arrange a funeral too,
so I know how hard it is.

210
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,573
We kept it simple, though.

211
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,368
I hope it's really over now.

212
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,250
What do you mean?

213
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,464
Never mind. Let's just relax today.

214
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,384
Let's get inside. It's cold.

215
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,313
<i>I hope it's really over now.</i>

216
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:42,788
Baek Do-ha.

217
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:46,708
What are you doing?

218
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:50,295
Are you okay?

219
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,301
Yes. Why?

220
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,137
I said, are you okay?

221
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,222
Why are you here?

222
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,184
You've been acting weird.

223
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,522
What's weird is my room.

224
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,400
I'm talking about what you did.

225
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:15,737
Song Ha-gyeong…

226
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,948
just how much did you miss me?

227
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,290
DRILL IT WHEN YOU THINK OF ME

228
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,755
I should've told you
to knit whenever you missed me.

229
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,924
Then I'd probably have ten more gloves.

230
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,802
I was just trying to destress
during those months.

231
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:41,180
I asked you to drill it
in a heart shape, though.

232
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,264
I'm a bit disappointed.

233
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,849
Geez, hey!

234
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,310
So did you find all the notes I left?

235
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:48,854
Can I go check?

236
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:57,946
Why?

237
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,952
These two were ones
I'd hidden in my room.

238
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,412
How often did you sneak in?

239
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,623
You know I'm competitive.

240
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,708
You said to find them,
so I checked everywhere.

241
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,170
You left so many naggy notes.

242
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,715
-Your voice followed me everywhere.
-The plan worked.

243
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,553
As I searched, I realized

244
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,931
you'd written down all the things
you wanted to hear.

245
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,974
You never fail to impress.

246
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,686
But you haven't found the last one yet.

247
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:31,980
There's more?

248
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,190
Just as I thought.

249
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,859
I knew you wouldn't find it.

250
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,444
What? Where did you hide it?

251
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,323
Somewhere you haven't opened?

252
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,493
Somewhere I haven't opened?

253
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,184
USE SOLAR PANELS
AROUND THE OBSERVATORY

254
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,197
-Can't sleep?
-You too?

255
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,369
Shall we have some hot cocoa?

256
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:41,633
I came downstairs because
I thought the light might wake you up.

257
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,927
I might as well have stayed with you.

258
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,972
I think you should get some sleep.

259
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,310
Aren't you tired
after saying bye to Do-young?

260
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,522
I usually can't sleep well in this house.

261
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,282
How could I sleep?

262
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,535
The girl I like is right next to mine.

263
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:14,291
I hear you breathing softly
and tossing around.

264
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,126
You wouldn't either, if you were me.

265
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:20,339
Not because
you're thinking about Do-young?

266
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,429
It's been ages since I went into his room.

267
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,849
Looks like you've been going there often.

268
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:36,688
I couldn't bring myself to go in there
all this time.

269
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,737
Do-young's passport has so many stamps.

270
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,448
Traveling around all those countries,

271
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,701
what did Do-young see
through that cheap telescope?

272
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:58,752
I can't even remember.

273
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:00,462
I tried my best…

274
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,549
to forget about Do-young the whole time.

275
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,511
I'm such a mean person, right?

276
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:11,515
I kept blaming you,
saying it was your fault.

277
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,559
I tried hard to forget.

278
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,354
No way.

279
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,107
You're kind

280
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:22,567
and transparent.

281
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,153
Of course,

282
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,614
Do-young was too.

283
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,284
I was the bad one.

284
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,496
Everyone in this house

285
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,624
was way too nice…

286
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:40,335
unlike me.

287
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:42,879
By the way,

288
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,840
you broke your promise too.

289
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,635
You said you'd shatter my fantasy
while we lived here.

290
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,680
<i>To shatter your fantasy.</i>

291
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,057
You have too many fantasies
about this house.

292
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,601
Break them while living here.

293
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,021
Hey, that's…

294
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,898
We really need to get some sleep.

295
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,901
Let's go upstairs. Should I tuck you in?

296
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,236
No thanks.

297
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,239
I'm not a kid.

298
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:20,876
What?

299
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:30,010
How late did he stay up making all this?

300
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,769
Why are you back to work already?

301
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,939
How did the funeral go?

302
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,067
Seems like you had a blast
while I was away.

303
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,320
There are more delivery receipts
than work files.

304
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:49,779
Well…

305
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,824
-What about the thing I asked you for?
-Right.

306
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,705
Like you said,
whenever the solar plant was set up

307
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,415
and site photos were released,

308
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,334
there were reports
against the observatory.

309
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,670
But there's nothing we can do on our end.

310
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,714
The complaints have eased a little.

311
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,801
How was the honeymoon?
You had a good time?

312
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,179
Come on, that was three months ago.

313
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,724
Your wedding gift was
the second most expensive,

314
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,142
so you're excused.

315
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,105
Director, your friend's here.

316
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:30,987
Seung-taek.

317
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,209
Seung-taek, are you sure

318
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,212
you won't regret this?

319
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:53,468
FOUR MONTHS AGO

320
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:02,102
This is totally barrier-free, but…

321
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:09,776
Seung-taek, are you…

322
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:17,284
I'll leave it in your hands.
It's my last house.

323
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,386
Hey, Baek Do.

324
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:41,141
It's been a while.
How about we go see the stars?

325
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,813
It's quite neat now, right?

326
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:48,857
Yes.

327
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,941
It's empty.

328
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,402
It's been almost ten years.

329
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,364
I haven't come since my accident.

330
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,158
All my memories here

331
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,535
are from when I could stand
on my own two feet.

332
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,165
Thanks, man.
I got to relive those memories.

333
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,130
Wow. It's still here.

334
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:16,718
DENEB ROCKS, BAEK DO-YOUNG

335
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:22,140
Do-young lived like Deneb
till the very last moment.

336
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,266
I don't think so.

337
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,936
He probably wanted Altair.

338
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,440
You know I spent a year

339
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,026
pretending to be Do-young.

340
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:35,653
Back then,

341
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,323
I went to the places he'd gone
and saw the stars

342
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,453
to send photos and videos to Ha-gyeong.

343
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:06,059
<i>So when you pretended to be Do-young,</i>
<i>what did you realize?</i>

344
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,978
That I'm such a jerk.

345
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:10,939
No, you're not.

346
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,069
You had no choice.

347
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,280
I know exactly how you must've felt

348
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,659
pretending to be Do-young.

349
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,327
I really understand.

350
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,996
I know better than anyone.

351
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:28,790
How would you know?

352
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,251
Dude, I know everything.

353
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:47,267
Wow, look at how
freaking detailed this design is.

354
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,393
That's my son.

355
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:51,938
Like mother, like son.
It's the same down to the layer.

356
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:53,940
No.

357
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:56,651
I would never turn down
the Hermann project

358
00:28:56,735 --> 00:29:00,280
to put everything into
the Patan High renovation project.

359
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:04,367
That's the part
I felt was the least like Do-ha.

360
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,328
But who knows what's on his mind?

361
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:09,706
You're right.

362
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,332
Three years ago,

363
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,252
he said we should give Do-young
a peaceful goodbye in the States.

364
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,881
Then out of the blue,
he brought him back to Korea.

365
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:21,634
Why don't you ask him?
He might tell you--

366
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:24,637
As if. You still don't know him.

367
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:28,808
He's great at acting like

368
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,269
he's okay with me.

369
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,191
Actually, that's why I came.
I'll try to find out.

370
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,736
I want to get to know my son.

371
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,658
Su-bak.

372
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:49,370
Why's your dad so busy
as soon as he arrived in Korea?

373
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,415
Do you know why?

374
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,501
Is he actually busy, or just acting busy?

375
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:06,930
<i>Don't worry. By the time you find</i>
<i>the last note, I'll have returned.</i>

376
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,183
<i>Just as I thought.</i>

377
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,434
You wouldn't find it.

378
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,269
What? Where did you hide it?

379
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,314
Somewhere you haven't opened.

380
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,233
Su-bak.

381
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,861
What haven't I opened?

382
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:29,744
Is he back?

383
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,672
What?

384
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:46,886
What's this?

385
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,429
Breathing holes?

386
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:52,183
Ms. Nam.
Are you doing a Baek Do-ha tour?

387
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,561
Yes. I'm investigating my son.

388
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:59,065
By looking at a house, you can tell
what kind of people live in it.

389
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:06,197
I wondered who your son takes after.

390
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:20,086
Turns out,
Do-young is everywhere around here.

391
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,090
I think that's Do-young's.

392
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,051
The markings are different.

393
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,515
I wonder what Do-ha had on his mind

394
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:34,809
when he went to these places.

395
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,533
Looks like he can't sleep here either.

396
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,841
Are you playing hide-and-seek
with your mom?

397
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,092
She just left.

398
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,178
You know I'm good at games.

399
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,388
If it's urgent, she'll call.

400
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:18,811
Hey.

401
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,271
Some things don't change.

402
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,774
You still hide sleeping pills here.

403
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,986
Don't you know insomnia
is an architect's best buddy?

404
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,072
How much sleep did you get?

405
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:30,990
Four hours?

406
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:31,908
In two days?

407
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,077
In three days?

408
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:38,831
Do-ha.

409
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,959
Is it worse since Do-young's funeral?

410
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:45,630
What do you mean?

411
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:50,635
I became this successful
because I worked instead of sleeping.

412
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,181
-Let's call it a day.
-Sure.

413
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,277
Baek Do-ha!

414
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,236
Looks like this isn't Do-ha's home either.

415
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,157
This is when I wish Do-young were here.

416
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,993
He knew everything about Do-ha.

417
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,474
THE 27TH WILL TO HA-GYEONG

418
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,241
You scared me.

419
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,744
Why are you standing there in the dark?

420
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,665
You're late.

421
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:28,501
You look exhausted.

422
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,088
Yes.

423
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,093
After being away,
I have so much work to catch up on.

424
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:38,553
I see.

425
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,472
Go get some rest.

426
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,308
Sleep tight.

427
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:45,810
Okay.

428
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,062
I'm tired.

429
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,691
Let's catch up on the rest tomorrow.

430
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,957
Why should I feel guilty
because of my brother?

431
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,625
I decided to focus on myself.

432
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,669
What's precious to you
is precious to me too.

433
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:14,338
I hope it's really over now.

434
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,889
<i>Every time that happened,</i>

435
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,725
<i>our eyes would meet.</i>

436
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:13,189
One, two, three.

437
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,526
<i>Every time I wanted something…</i>

438
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,409
<i>and he gave it up for me.</i>

439
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,828
How long are you guys
going to go on like that?

440
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:29,956
What do you mean?

441
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,793
Did you know that
Song Ha-gyeong confessed to me before?

442
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,879
Back then, she told me that--

443
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,422
I don't want to hear it.

444
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,758
Do-young.

445
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,804
If you really care about us…

446
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:50,643
the best you can do is step aside.

447
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,188
<i>And the last time our eyes met.</i>

448
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,971
What are you doing?

449
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:27,930
Going on a trip?

450
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:31,017
I'm on leave. I should go somewhere.

451
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,316
With you.

452
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:47,491
Hey.

453
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,994
-Wait, are we taking the train?
-Yes.

454
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,537
Is it far away?

455
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,498
I don't think I'd hear your real feelings
at Peanut House.

456
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,541
So I'm kidnapping you.

457
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,545
That sounds familiar.

458
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,589
You can call it our last goodbye trip.

459
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,675
No,
maybe we should call it a runaway trip.

460
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:14,060
<i>What do you mean?</i>
<i>Why would he suddenly come from the US?</i>

461
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,813
What kind of a mom doesn't know
her son's friend's number?

462
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,274
What?

463
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,319
What are you talking about?
You think I'd know that?

464
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,072
-Hey.
-Anywhere that he might go?

465
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,156
You know anything?

466
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,200
Well…

467
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,495
Mom got back from her honeymoon
with our stepdad,

468
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,829
and Do-ha went missing.

469
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,048
Hey, Baek Do-ha.

470
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,136
It's you, Ha-gyeong.

471
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,389
Who runs away from the US to Patan?

472
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,100
Me.

473
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,477
Is this funny?

474
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,022
Why are you dressed so lightly?

475
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,899
How did you know I was here?

476
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,484
Where else would you go?

477
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:07,822
Let's go, or you'll catch a cold.

478
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,242
Your family and mine
are freaking out because of you.

479
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:12,785
Ha-gyeong.

480
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:15,830
It's our first winter

481
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,290
since we kissed back in summer.

482
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,002
Should we run away,

483
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:24,755
just the two of us?

484
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,805
You were here.

485
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,684
It's supposed to be a runaway trip.
You can't go back home.

486
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,312
Let's go on a trip
to see the Winter Triangle.

487
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:48,988
Wait.

488
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,615
Why are we here again?

489
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:57,705
To finally see the Winter Triangle
for the very last time.

490
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,957
You keep saying "the last time."

491
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,751
Is this a goodbye trip?

492
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,756
We have to hurry.
We have to make it to the top today.

493
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,467
Let's go.

494
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,729
You don't get along with your stepdad?

495
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:24,607
Well…

496
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:26,859
It's not bad,

497
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,236
but it's not good either.

498
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,946
Then why did you run away?

499
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,366
I don't know,
it didn't feel like home anymore.

500
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:38,746
It changed again,
since one person came.

501
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,333
Funny, isn't it?

502
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,591
Hey.

503
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:51,509
Put these on.

504
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,220
The famous Song Ha-gyeong gloves.

505
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:57,348
It's my first time
seeing it up close. Hey.

506
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,726
-You think this will fit my hand?
-It fits like a glove.

507
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:35,928
Here.

508
00:42:40,349 --> 00:42:41,183
What are you doing?

509
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,752
Shall we go now?

510
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,756
Yes, let's go.

511
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,307
It's still here.

512
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,310
We never really got to drink this, right?

513
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,020
We never got to hold hands.

514
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,481
I still have that in the box.

515
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:31,400
-Exactly as it was.
-I know.

516
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:43,287
Baek Do-young wanted to come here
back in high school?

517
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,289
You know he's always been crazy.

518
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:48,250
We can't blame him alone.
We went up with him too.

519
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,960
Let's take a break.

520
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,045
Are we there yet?

521
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,800
Hey, I swear,
being around him makes me go crazy.

522
00:43:57,801 --> 00:43:59,219
You wouldn't know

523
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,430
about all the stuff
that happened in Patan-myeon.

524
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:05,100
You wouldn't know
all the stuff that happened in the States.

525
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:10,272
You spent only two months a year together,
yet you act like you know everything.

526
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,900
Says the one who's showing off
in front of his family.

527
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:15,444
Fine.

528
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:18,030
Then do you know what that rare mushroom

529
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:20,032
Do-young stuffed in his pocket
in Nepal was?

530
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:20,949
Yak poop.

531
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,119
-His tear trigger?
<i>-Sailor Moon</i>'s last episode.

532
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,539
What was the first R-rated movie
he watched?

533
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:31,502
How would I know?

534
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,795
He said he saw it with you.

535
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,383
What was his favorite food in Nepal?

536
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,926
I saw it on the postcard. <i>Samosa</i>.

537
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,679
-Not bad.
-Okay, then.

538
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,557
Why did Do-young go looking
for the Summer Triangle?

539
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,564
To form a triangle with you.

540
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:53,649
Nope.

541
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:55,567
You're wrong.

542
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:17,047
Come on. You said it's here.

543
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,133
It might be visible from the top.

544
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,510
If you can't see it here,
it's just not visible.

545
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:24,138
That's weird.

546
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,181
There should be Betelgeuse,

547
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,891
Sirius, Procyon,

548
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,144
forming a perfect triangle around here.

549
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,563
Forget it.

550
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,315
I'll go to the bathroom.

551
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,233
Okay.

552
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:49,079
We'll be able to see the Winter Triangle
when we reach the top.

553
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,624
Anyway, feeling better now?

554
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,460
What do you mean, triangle?

555
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,087
You don't even like this deep down.

556
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:59,006
That's not true.

557
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,175
I love that the three of us
ran away together.

558
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,845
Why are you smiling? What's so funny?

559
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,931
I know you can't stand it.

560
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:08,849
What?

561
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,894
Even now, you're annoyed
because I got between you two.

562
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,271
So why are you smiling?

563
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:18,942
Isn't that how you feel?

564
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,277
What?

565
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,279
Why are you projecting what you feel
onto me?

566
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:24,031
You've felt that way all along.

567
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,407
Who's the liar here?

568
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,993
Me? Don't call me a liar.
Are you done talking now?

569
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,873
You guys were having

570
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,291
a full-on staring contest,

571
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,876
so I wanted to join.

572
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,052
You can't even land a hit.

573
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:56,522
Bring it on.

574
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,732
<i>Still can't see it.</i>

575
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,275
We got fooled again.

576
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,985
The Winter Triangle, my foot.

577
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,987
Patan Mountain has a better view.

578
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:04,905
That's right.

579
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:07,241
Patan Mountain's view is better.

580
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,787
I saw it on Patan Mountain.

581
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:13,247
The Winter Triangle.

582
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,043
Before Do-young left,

583
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:19,836
I confessed to him.

584
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:26,343
Did you know that
Song Ha-gyeong confessed to me before?

585
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,055
Back then, she told me that--

586
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,306
I said that I liked someone.

587
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,768
That I liked Do-ha,

588
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,563
not Do-young.

589
00:47:39,898 --> 00:47:42,317
So I felt sorry for Do-young all along.

590
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:46,071
Maybe he couldn't come home
because of that confession.

591
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:49,116
Maybe that accident happened
because of me.

592
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,826
I blamed and resented myself…

593
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:54,997
locking it up in a box.

594
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,293
I felt guilty about opening that box.

595
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,548
So I acted like I'd forgotten

596
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:06,800
the whole time…

597
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,763
But you kept coming every summer,

598
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,515
and now in winter,

599
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,351
you brought back Do-young.

600
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,272
So I had to open it…

601
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:27,237
and there,
I found the last note you left.

602
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,332
<i>If I bring Do-young back,</i>

603
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:40,709
<i>will I be able to…</i>

604
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,671
<i>stay in this house?</i>

605
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:52,304
We tried to forget Do-young

606
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:56,308
by tucking him away in a box.

607
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,687
I remember it all now.

608
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:04,441
Why he brought you here ten years ago

609
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:07,653
and the real reason he found
the Summer Triangle.

610
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,239
It was all for you.

611
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,334
What is this?

612
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,050
Were you chasing stars in the US too?

613
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,010
I took it when I went to Bear Mountain

614
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,721
with Mom, Do-ha,

615
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:36,765
and my stepdad.

616
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:43,689
I'm worried about Do-ha.

617
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,278
<i>How Do-young tried to overcome</i>
<i>a 14-hour time difference.</i>

618
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,492
Do-ha is moving again.

619
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,161
He acts cheerful,

620
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:00,080
but I can tell he's sad.
He's transparent.

621
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:06,044
Stars used to work best with him,

622
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:08,714
but it doesn't seem to work anymore.

623
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,885
I need some new ideas.

624
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:20,600
<i>How Do-young tried to bridge</i>
<i>a 9,500-km distance.</i>

625
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,310
<i>I remember it all.</i>

626
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,114
Baek Do-ha.

627
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:38,368
I made myself a promise
during those five months without you.

628
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,329
I knew you'd definitely come back,

629
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:44,416
and when you did, you'd tell me something.

630
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:45,333
What could it be?

631
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:50,672
I promised myself
that when I hear it, I'd hold your hand

632
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,508
and never let go.

633
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,970
I promised that to myself.

634
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,230
You told me

635
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,567
that not all our memories were bad.

636
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:13,820
Tell me

637
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,698
what Do-young meant to you.

638
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,831
Not sure if it was a dream…

639
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,796
but I kept seeing him since I came back.

640
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,220
SONG

641
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,391
<i>-Do-young.</i>
-Yes.

642
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,309
<i>What do I do?</i>

643
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:45,227
<i>To be specific…</i>

644
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:47,562
What is it?

645
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:49,272
<i>…since I acted like I was Do-young,</i>

646
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,948
<i>every time I slept,</i>
<i>I'd keep seeing his last moments.</i>

647
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:08,416
<i>If I didn't sleep,</i>

648
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,003
<i>his memories would come flooding back,</i>
<i>keeping me awake.</i>

649
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,187
<i>It was painful,</i>

650
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:31,356
<i>nostalgic,</i>

651
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:33,817
<i>and delightful</i>

652
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,279
<i>for those three years.</i>

653
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,953
<i>But one thing's for sure.</i>

654
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,835
<i>Ever since I moved in here</i>
<i>to live with you,</i>

655
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:54,379
<i>he keeps showing up.</i>

656
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,904
All I remember is taking what was his.

657
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,032
I was never a good little brother.

658
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,327
I'm sure he resented me--

659
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,786
You really think so?

660
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,956
Is he really that kind of person?

661
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,542
Are you really that kind of person?

662
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,881
Do-ha, you are

663
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,050
someone who changes others.

664
00:53:41,927 --> 00:53:44,471
Since you came, I've changed so much.

665
00:53:45,513 --> 00:53:46,348
Look.

666
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:49,726
I used to just let my hands freeze,

667
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,811
but now I'm holding your hands.

668
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:54,147
That's who you are.

669
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,484
Do-ha, if it weren't for you,

670
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,820
I'd never have sorted that box out.

671
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,329
I've felt sorry for him all this while.

672
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,791
But back then, I felt like…

673
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,129
if I said "sorry,"
I'd really start to feel bad.

674
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,178
So instead, I kept blaming you,

675
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,098
and you blamed yourself too.

676
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,809
That's how we ended up going in circles.

677
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,562
Do-young never blamed anyone.

678
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,898
But we did whatever we wanted.

679
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,361
We're such fools.

680
00:54:51,287 --> 00:54:52,163
Fools.

681
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:55,583
Are you done watching?

682
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:59,337
Then you should go back home.

683
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,221
Let's go back, Do-ha,

684
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:10,932
to our house.

685
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:38,877
<i>Hi, Ha-gyeong.</i>

686
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,796
<i>This is already the 27th will.</i>

687
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,592
<i>It's the day before</i>
<i>climbing Denali in Alaska.</i>

688
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:49,679
<i>I had a drink, hoping for</i>
<i>a successful climb and a safe return.</i>

689
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,682
<i>Speaking of which…</i>

690
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,144
<i>you want me to tell you a secret?</i>

691
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,316
<i>The reason why I confessed to Ha-gyeong.</i>

692
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,026
I like…

693
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:06,196
Do-ha.

694
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:08,698
<i>I actually confessed</i>

695
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,035
<i>just so I'd get rejected.</i>

696
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:16,790
<i>I wanted to end it for the fools</i>

697
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,917
<i>who couldn't confess properly.</i>

698
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,088
Are you calling me a liar?
Are you done talking?

699
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:28,426
<i>Looking into Do-ha's eyes,</i>
<i>I could see it all.</i>

700
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,847
<i>The way he pretends to be mean</i>

701
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:36,559
<i>and then gets hurt by what he said.</i>

702
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:39,979
<i>He is…</i>

703
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,942
<i>as hopelessly kind-hearted as you,</i>

704
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:46,861
<i>so he doesn't even realize it.</i>

705
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,494
You knew there'd be no stars, didn't you?

706
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:58,957
Do-ha might wake up.

707
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,001
Did you really just pick a random spot?

708
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,046
You're such a liar.

709
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:07,090
Who cares?

710
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,551
You want to escape Patan.

711
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,719
Do-ha doesn't want to go home.

712
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:15,014
We were happy thanks to that.

713
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:26,067
<i>So, Song Ha-gyeong.</i>

714
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,404
<i>If I can't talk later,</i>

715
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,407
<i>then I want you to be Deneb</i>

716
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:36,661
<i>to help connect me and Do-ha.</i>

717
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:40,540
<i>That's the price</i>
<i>of being stuck between us.</i>

718
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,592
Do-young.

719
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:53,178
Why is the Summer Triangle your favorite?

720
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,180
Summer.

721
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:56,931
Every summer,

722
00:57:58,850 --> 00:57:59,851
you come back.

723
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:31,591
<i>I knew it from the beginning</i>
<i>that if I returned to this house,</i>

724
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,678
<i>he'd appear by my side again.</i>

725
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:08,253
<i>This house showed me my guilt</i>

726
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:11,881
<i>and kept me up all night,</i>

727
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,342
<i>because the house</i>

728
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:18,137
<i>was full of haunting memories.</i>

729
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:19,722
<i>But…</i>

730
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:28,773
<i>now it's okay.</i>

731
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:33,236
<i>This house has always been a place</i>

732
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,405
<i>where people come and go.</i>

733
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:36,614
Baek Do-ha!

734
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,122
Ta-da.

735
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:54,882
It's like a whole other world.

736
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:56,718
Right?

737
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:58,720
Song Ha-gyeong.

738
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,139
Can I make every step I take mine?

739
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:03,725
It's yours.

740
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,394
It's all yours, Do-ha.

741
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,450
<i>Hey, that's mine.</i>

742
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,076
<i>Fine, take it.</i>

743
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:25,622
<i>It's snow!</i>

744
01:00:26,372 --> 01:00:27,206
<i>Song Ha-gyeong.</i>

745
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,878
<i>Do you think we'll ever move out</i>
<i>of this Peanut House?</i>

746
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,298
<i>I don't know.</i>

747
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:38,301
<i>Maybe if the roof caves in</i>

748
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,763
<i>or the house falls apart in a storm?</i>

749
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:48,811
So, until that day comes,

750
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:50,938
it's my house.

751
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:54,275
Sure.

752
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:55,902
It's your house.

753
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,404
It's all yours, Baek Do-ha.

754
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:09,874
I'm doomed.

755
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:14,796
My hands won't freeze.

756
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,340
Hold my hand.

757
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:23,304
It's warm.

758
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,526
Is this how you do it?

759
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:21,904
<i>What's this now?</i>

760
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:24,323
<i>Song Ha-gyeong, stop seducing me.</i>

761
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,992
What's all this about?

762
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:29,245
<i>Since I'm really back now,</i>
<i>I need to keep my last promise.</i>

763
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:30,455
<i>But it won't be easy.</i>

764
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:32,623
<i>There's a proper order for everything.</i>

765
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:33,750
<i>Charge forward!</i>

766
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:38,296
The main reason this project got held up
was Pluto, wasn't it, Director Baek?

767
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:39,964
Baek Do!

768
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:41,257
<i>How much did you drink?</i>

769
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,384
<i>We see each other</i>
<i>more than we did back then.</i>

770
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:48,264
<i>We've been getting along without fighting.</i>
<i>I guess it's really winter, right?</i>

771
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:53,019
<i>Feels like tonight could be</i>
<i>our last night.</i>

772
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,437
Wait, a leave of absence?

773
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,689
<i>Junior!</i>
