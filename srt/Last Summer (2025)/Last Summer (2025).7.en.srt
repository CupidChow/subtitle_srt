1
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:40,707
You want a fight? Fine.

2
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,584
Seriously.

3
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:43,918
<i>Summer was good.</i>

4
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,006
<i>It was my summer.</i>

5
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,509
It's good.

6
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:58,391
<i>It felt just like the summer I remembered.</i>

7
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:03,480
<i>At least until this moment…</i>

8
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,356
I've decided to date Seo Su-hyeok.

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,816
<i>…that's what I thought.</i>

10
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,947
<i>This summer is expected to be</i>
<i>the hottest on record.</i>

11
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,574
<i>Many believe it won't be long</i>

12
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:18,828
<i>before Korea starts to feel like</i>
<i>a tropical country.</i>

13
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:24,292
<i>That's right. I saw an article recently</i>
<i>about bananas being harvested in Korea.</i>

14
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,503
<i>It's not only bananas, but mangoes…</i>

15
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,671
-Hey.
-<i>We might be able to grow them.</i>

16
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,089
<i>They're already growing them.</i>

17
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,968
-<i>Korean bananas.</i>
-Hey.

18
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,807
Apparently, bananas
are being grown in Korea.

19
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,644
What are you talking about?
Go out for a run?

20
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:44,312
Why are you sitting around?

21
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,356
<i>Last year,</i>
<i>we experienced tropical nights…</i>

22
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,691
I don't have a TV.

23
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,777
<i>The daily high in New York reached over…</i>

24
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,696
-I thought you never wore skirts.
<i>-40 degrees?</i>

25
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,949
<i>It's expected to be</i>
<i>the worst summer on record.</i>

26
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,408
The worst summer?

27
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,661
<i>We visited a banana farm.</i>

28
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:09,170
Good morning.

29
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,550
Korea is growing bananas now, apparently.

30
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:18,596
Anyway, why are you here so early?

31
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,056
I didn't call for you.

32
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,016
I came to visit Ms. Song.

33
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,436
I know.
Is it true that you're dating Ha-gyeong?

34
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,355
You're here.

35
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,071
Move. You're in the way.

36
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,242
Don't leave the TV on.

37
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,916
Hey, are you really going?

38
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:48,793
Hey!

39
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,130
Korea is growing bananas now!

40
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,020
<i>Ha-gyeong, like you said…</i>

41
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:11,482
<i>…the worst summer has begun for me too.</i>

42
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,328
Hey--

43
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,289
You have agreed to go out with me?

44
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,584
I heard it from Mr. Baek.

45
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,546
I'm used to surprises,
so I rarely get surprised.

46
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:37,217
But you're really unpredictable.

47
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,812
-Don't be ridiculous.
-Why is it ridiculous?

48
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,357
We've seen each other a lot.

49
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,821
I'm done with this messy drama with you.

50
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,866
I want to have a real relationship…

51
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,161
that's appropriate for my age.

52
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:10,583
He's hot and got his career going.
Why wouldn't I want to be with him?

53
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,895
I didn't know Seoul had a spot like this.

54
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,899
I'm usually around people
with all kinds of issues,

55
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,028
so this is where I come to relax
and recharge alone.

56
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,865
So?

57
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:46,536
I need to hear the rest
of what you were saying in the car.

58
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,498
I want to hear it directly from you.

59
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,172
Hey, don't hang up!

60
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,509
Let me talk to Ha-gyeong.
Stop pretending, okay?

61
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,969
You're with her, right?

62
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,971
What? I'm busy. Bye.

63
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,640
<i>Sorry about that.</i>

64
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,561
Yesterday, I got caught up
in some situation,

65
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,354
and ended up saying that.

66
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,733
A was feeling pretty cornered.

67
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:22,447
But after saying that,
it made me want to really go for it.

68
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:26,159
Turns out A's leg was fine.

69
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,286
So…

70
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,581
why don't we actually start dating?

71
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:41,090
I was nervous listening to that.

72
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,928
Next time, start with the main point.
I'd appreciate that.

73
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,767
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

74
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,194
By the way, I have a question.

75
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,907
Why did you ask me out yesterday?

76
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,159
We bumped into each other yesterday.

77
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,287
Had you been drinking?

78
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,792
You know I was driving
when I ran into you.

79
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,837
Right. It was just so out of the blue.

80
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:22,965
I really didn't see it coming.

81
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,218
I felt like that day…

82
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,930
was my only chance with you.

83
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,350
Even if it's a long shot,

84
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,228
if the time feels right, I go for it.

85
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,730
Isn't it weird?

86
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,317
I shouldn't have been involved.

87
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,820
But yesterday,
I felt like I shouldn't miss the chance.

88
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,031
Whenever I'm with you,

89
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,325
my boring life gets interesting.

90
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,955
And I make choices I normally wouldn't.
Weird, right?

91
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:01,087
No… I think I get what you mean.

92
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:10,847
By the way, Attorney Seo…

93
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,599
are you okay with me?

94
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,937
Are you asking if I'm okay with dating you
when you like Mr. Baek?

95
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:25,153
I'm getting used to
your wild manner of speech.

96
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,739
It's okay, I'm not in love yet either.

97
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,784
I want to go with my feelings.

98
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,998
How about we meet between 9:00 and 6:00
for our work-life balance?

99
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,960
We can meet when we want.
I'll come to you, if I want to see you.

100
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,504
Or you can come to Seoul.

101
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:48,217
You already love Seoul,
and anyway, your boyfriend is there.

102
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,259
I get what this is about.

103
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,178
You want me to go back to Hermann project.

104
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:35,097
Good, I'm glad you know
you have to go back.

105
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,849
But don't get me wrong.

106
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,851
That's not why I'm dating Seo Su-hyeok.

107
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:40,770
Then?

108
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,733
The timing just works, unlike you and me.

109
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,819
Attorney Seo is so uncomplicated,

110
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,655
which makes me uncomplicated too.

111
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,241
He's easygoing, so I become easygoing too.

112
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:56,118
People reflect who they're with.
It rubs off on you.

113
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,205
Like you look good with Yoon So-hee.

114
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,667
Same here. I chose what felt right.

115
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,628
Hey, Song Ha-gyeong.
Will you stop it already?

116
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:07,547
What do you mean?

117
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,300
-You've always liked me from the start.
-That's nonsense.

118
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,053
There wasn't a single moment
you didn't like me.

119
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,305
-Bullshit.
-Despite all that?

120
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,724
You're going to keep this up?

121
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,518
Twisting it all up like this?

122
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,858
Your ego's out of control.

123
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,946
It's not my ego. There's plenty of proof.
I just didn't hear it from you.

124
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,198
All right, then.

125
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,410
Go ahead
and introduce me to that crazy lawyer.

126
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,494
Let's meet up.

127
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,788
No way. Don't be childish.

128
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,667
I knew it. You can't ask twice, can you?

129
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,003
Sure, I thought so.

130
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,513
Go, Oh Seung-taek!

131
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,057
-Go for it!
-You got this!

132
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,353
OH SEUNG-TAEK
ONE SHOT, ONE GOAL

133
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,481
HOCKEY GENIUS SEUNG-TAEK
FIRES ONE INTO THE NET!

134
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,077
Looks like …

135
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,955
your caseload
has been pretty light lately.

136
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,584
I have to come even if I'm busy.
It's my longtime friend,

137
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,336
my girlfriend's alum,

138
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,339
my girlfriend's best friend's boyfriend,

139
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:33,382
and a friend of my client in the match.

140
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:41,932
Su-hyeok,
when did you start liking Song?

141
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,893
Actually, no.

142
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,270
How did you ask her out?

143
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,900
What kind of defense attorney
dates the plaintiff?

144
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,859
Me.

145
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,405
Fate like this doesn't come easy.

146
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,240
So,

147
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,827
did you have a thing for her
since her first lawsuit?

148
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,622
Wait, is that why you took the case?

149
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,500
Not exactly,
but I did wonder, "Is this fate?"

150
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,837
for about three seconds.

151
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,734
Oh Seung-taek!

152
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:57,049
Listen, can't you keep your work
and personal life separate?

153
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,219
I always keep them separate.

154
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,431
With Ha-gyeong, it's strictly personal.

155
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,144
I can see what Ha-gyeong's thinking.

156
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:09,854
But…

157
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,857
I really can't understand you.

158
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,735
How could you date Ha-gyeong
after handling both lawsuits?

159
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,945
Why?

160
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,281
She's an attractive woman.

161
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,003
I've seen the defendant enough.

162
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:20,174
Now I need to dig into the plaintiff.

163
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:24,345
I find Plaintiff Song Ha-gyeong
more and more interesting.

164
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,851
-Good work.
-Good job.

165
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,436
See you next week.

166
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,354
Seul.

167
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,565
Why didn't you just wait outside?

168
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,734
Wait, hey!

169
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,241
<i>A stage two bedsore.</i>

170
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,993
The skin's peeled off,
but it's not deep, fortunately.

171
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,411
That's a relief.

172
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,498
There's no infection, thanks to first aid.

173
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,584
To spread the pressure out, put a cushion…

174
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,257
It'd help to change his position often.

175
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,383
CHANGE POSITIONS

176
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,010
One second.

177
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,180
There.

178
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,266
Good.

179
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,434
-You're doing everything right.
-Thanks.

180
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,562
Also, apply hydro--

181
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,438
-This one?
-Exactly.

182
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,031
It's all my fault, seriously.

183
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,826
Seriously, I can't believe I missed it.

184
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,245
I'm a terrible girlfriend, seriously.

185
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,831
How many times
are you going to say "seriously"?

186
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,917
Give it to me.

187
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,295
-You saw it?
-Of course I did.

188
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,588
Here.

189
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,799
Your eleventh win and another puck.

190
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,264
But remember, don't push yourself
with this month's games.

191
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:56,854
You'll have to skip
the Gangneung joint training, right?

192
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,233
It's not as bad as before, right?

193
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,278
That's a relief.

194
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,159
All right, Seul. Bye.

195
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,793
She said Seung-taek is--

196
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,296
BAEK DO-HA

197
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,507
Luckily, it's just stage two, so--

198
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,384
BAEK DO-HA

199
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,845
The treatment isn't going to--

200
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,973
Take too long.

201
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,310
Sorry, I'll take the call.

202
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,231
-Hello?
-<i>It's common area cleaning day today.</i>

203
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:45,486
<i>We agreed to do it together.</i>
<i>Article three, paragraph two, remember?</i>

204
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,365
Did you sign a contract?

205
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:50,783
As you know…

206
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,494
my hobby's filing lawsuits,

207
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,704
and my specialty is drafting contracts.

208
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,669
DETAILED CONTRACT FOR SHARED LIVING

209
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,255
This clause works against you.

210
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:13,138
Mr. Baek's only around in the summer,
and you spent 17 years in Pacheon.

211
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:18,185
If unexpected situations happen here,
whose loss would be greater?

212
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,858
Wait, Attorney Seo,
I thought you were my lawyer.

213
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,862
I'm here as her boyfriend right now.

214
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,949
From what I know of you,

215
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,493
you'll definitely keep your word.

216
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,954
Of course.

217
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,918
All of these clauses
were created by Ha-gyeong.

218
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,420
About how we'll walk together,

219
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:49,758
share the chores, and figure out
how to manage this house together.

220
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,594
That was to make sure
we respect our own boundaries

221
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,097
and we do our part
in terms of money and space.

222
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,056
Exactly.

223
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,059
Rules to share responsibility
since we live together.

224
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,478
Technically, we're not living together.

225
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,772
Do-ha lives in his place, I live in mine.

226
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,983
In completely separate buildings.

227
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,819
It's one connected building.
Selling it needs mutual agreement.

228
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,196
Isn't that how we met this lawyer?

229
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,073
Our individual spaces are off-limits!

230
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,415
I want to see your room, Ha-gyeong.

231
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,297
Can you give me a tour?

232
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:32,259
Come in.

233
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,180
This is my room. Not much to see.

234
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:42,352
Get him out by 10:00.

235
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,188
Article One, paragraph 8.

236
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,982
Any personal guests
should leave by 10:00 p.m.

237
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,901
You know, right?

238
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,368
The walls are so thin and close together.

239
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,163
This used to be one room,

240
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,415
but our parents had a crazy idea
to build a wall--

241
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,374
No.

242
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,543
That's not it.

243
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:10,464
I mean he'd hear…

244
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:14,885
everything happening here.

245
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,232
Like…

246
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,756
PATAN HIGH SCHOOL

247
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,428
…saying how
you turn out to be incredible,

248
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,515
or you're hiding a love letter
from your first crush,

249
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,310
or you secretly have a crush.

250
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:12,359
You didn't seem to care about me
in front of Mr. Baek.

251
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,362
I'm not into playing cupid.

252
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,533
What's going on?

253
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,089
Sorry.

254
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,466
The house is a mess,

255
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:40,053
and so is the person who lives in it.

256
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,099
I've been inconsiderate all day.

257
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:49,062
I knew what I was getting into,
so you don't need to say sorry.

258
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,356
But it doesn't feel that nice.

259
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,737
It makes me wonder if this is jealousy.

260
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,574
I'm glad I came over.

261
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,370
-Attorney Seo.
-You should go inside.

262
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:16,173
Let's change
how we address each other next time.

263
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,462
My boyfriend isn't too happy
about this situation.

264
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,589
-What?
-It's disrespectful to him.

265
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,675
I messed up a lot today.

266
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,720
Unbelievable.

267
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,974
I think we should start
locking up this common area.

268
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,309
And this phrase.

269
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,396
We should remove "unexpected situations."

270
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,398
I've got a boyfriend now.

271
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,901
There shouldn't be
any unexpected situations or surprises

272
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,319
between us anymore.

273
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,676
Baek Do-ha.

274
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,848
You don't have to stay until August 31st.

275
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,435
I talked to Mr. Shin yesterday.

276
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,062
The design changes are complete,

277
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,690
so the architect's work
is pretty much done.

278
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,110
No need to wait for the completion date.

279
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:03,030
Just head back to the States
and get back to your project.

280
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,823
-Hey.
-And then…

281
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:07,951
come visit again.

282
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:10,746
You can come by anytime.

283
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,668
Come by like you always did,

284
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,879
just as a guest.

285
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,009
The next-door place is your dad's.

286
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,928
So just live your life…

287
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,514
and come over on vacation.

288
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,726
I'd forgotten.

289
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,937
You're a guest, so you can come anytime.

290
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,525
This summer doesn't have to be the last.

291
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,529
Just go ahead
and do that Hermann project.

292
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,908
Once you're done, come visit.

293
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:48,992
Hey, Song Ha-gyeong.

294
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,036
Then I'll take a day off to hang with you.

295
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:54,372
You know I'm a pro at hosting guests.

296
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,393
<i>Bullshit.</i>

297
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,237
Gosh, this is bullshit.

298
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:34,246
I'm not saying this to you.
It's this summer I'm talking about.

299
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,667
What? Come visit?

300
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,003
Host me as a guest? Unbelievable.

301
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:49,177
What brings you here?

302
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,683
Yang Jae-ho. Pacheon-si, Gyeonggi-do.

303
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,810
-Patan-myeon, Nakham-ri 12, right?
-Yes.

304
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,019
All right, three sacks.

305
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,521
Three sacks.

306
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,192
-Three sacks.
-Two sacks.

307
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,821
-Two sacks.
-Being young is great.

308
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,823
By the way, why do you look like that?

309
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,032
What do you mean?

310
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,244
What, do I look like a guest?

311
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,829
Here.

312
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,290
Good.

313
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,543
Next, Nam Jeong-su.

314
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,711
Five sacks.

315
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,506
Look at you, so strong!

316
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,314
How come you're so weak?

317
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,858
You're way taller than me.
I'm disappointed.

318
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,819
It's because your push is off balance!

319
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,197
It feels like
I'm the only one pushing here.

320
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,574
This has got to move.

321
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,871
The parking brake!
That's why it's stuck!

322
00:24:57,954 --> 00:25:00,749
-But I checked.
-What do you think you're doing?

323
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,375
Hey, Jin-guk.

324
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,753
You got a new car? Move it now.

325
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:08,548
You can't just park here.

326
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,967
The fence is already high,
blocking the view.

327
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:12,969
-Wait, who are you?
-Me?

328
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,140
I live here.

329
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:18,892
I'm a resident here!

330
00:25:29,069 --> 00:25:31,112
Ha-gyeong?

331
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,418
Su-bak.

332
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,712
Have you eaten?

333
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:51,675
For Patan to become a better town,

334
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,301
it needs development.

335
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:57,430
So should we focus
on expanding roads or fixing drainage?

336
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:01,351
Ladies and gentlemen,
why don't we vote with a show of hands?

337
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,019
I think streetlights

338
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,063
are more urgent than that,
don't you think?

339
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,025
And who are you?

340
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:11,111
Me?

341
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:15,156
I'm the resident of Peanut House,
Patan-myeon, Jangsu-ro 101-23.

342
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:20,704
And speaking of the bus number 18,
it takes forever to come,

343
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,247
but it barely even stops.

344
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,582
And water deer, right?

345
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,293
The reward should go up.

346
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,628
Considering the crop
and residential damage,

347
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,213
the estimated damage is--

348
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:36,011
Wait, Mr. Architect.
How long have you lived in Patan, again?

349
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:40,265
It's been 22 days.

350
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:45,145
<i>He's a real piece of work,</i>
<i>worse than Dr. Song.</i>

351
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,943
No one measures up to Dr. Song,

352
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,738
but Director Baek,
I'll make you a master.

353
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,906
How's that sound, "Master Baek"?

354
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,326
You're not at Dr. Song level,

355
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,745
but a bachelor's feels too low.

356
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,496
"Master" is just right for you.

357
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,540
After trying it myself,

358
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:09,085
I realized Ha-gyeong
definitely earned that Dr. Song title.

359
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,505
Of course. When it rains,
she's the one checking for leaks.

360
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,841
When it snows, she's the one

361
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:19,304
pestering the township head
to get sand and calcium chloride.

362
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:22,640
She even replaced the bus stop benches

363
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,518
with ones that have
both heating and cooling.

364
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:28,229
There's no one like Dr. Song.

365
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,106
Master Baek, you can't keep up.

366
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:38,198
No, that's not it.

367
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:42,160
This will kill the persimmon tree
at the persimmon lady's house.

368
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,997
Her dried persimmons are always a must
at the women's events.

369
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,291
It's the township office's fault.

370
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,085
Why should the residents suffer?

371
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,088
Treat the tree right now!

372
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,552
Ma'am, you didn't dress warm enough.

373
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,845
I'm cold.

374
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:05,266
In weather like this, it's dangerous
to be alone. You could get hurt.

375
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,893
Thanks, Ha-gyeong.

376
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,020
Here.

377
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,731
Keep yourself warm.
It's too cold for your bones.

378
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,781
What?

379
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,387
I'm Master Baek now.

380
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,598
They can't call me "Dr. Baek" yet.

381
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,017
But at least I got the master's.

382
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:52,981
Do I still feel like a guest?

383
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:58,820
Song Ha-gyeong.

384
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,615
Your plan's just too obvious.

385
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,286
You treat me like I'm not even here.

386
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,663
You come home late on purpose.

387
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:12,417
And like you said,
you make me feel like I don't belong,

388
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,502
leaving me hanging, till I finally leave.

389
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,299
You're making me realize
how lonely this house is, so I'll leave.

390
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,510
You think I don't see what you're doing?

391
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,138
If you know, just leave, okay?

392
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,350
Number one, my foot.

393
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,108
Just wait for me in the summer.

394
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,196
Summer is in both our names.

395
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,115
That's so childish.

396
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,703
Fine. Whatever.

397
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,290
For summer, I'll make you my number one.

398
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:53,875
Happy?

399
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,421
You said I'd be number one in summer,

400
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,300
that you'd only think of me.

401
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,277
You must be hungry.

402
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,531
I feel bad making you do all the cooking.

403
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,493
You must be exhausted from working
in the sun all day, right?

404
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,786
What are you doing?

405
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:33,456
My mom said a good host
treats guests well,

406
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,501
making sure they leave
without feeling disappointed.

407
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,254
Go ahead, eat.

408
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,590
Are you joking?

409
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,133
No need to do the dishes.

410
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,511
Why are you acting nice?
That's not like you.

411
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:48,513
-You're upset because I'm being nice?
-Yes.

412
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,891
Don't be nice. Yell at me to get lost,

413
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:55,019
get mad, throw a fit, and just be mean!

414
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,564
Why would you act all nice?
It's so annoying.

415
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:28,803
What? Was it today already?

416
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,931
Time really flies.

417
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,313
<i>I loved summer.</i>

418
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:42,025
<i>Or rather, I had to love it.</i>

419
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,070
<i>I had waited for the summer</i>

420
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,740
<i>through the endless cold.</i>

421
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,000
<i>I was convinced that summer was mine.</i>

422
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,502
<i>But then…</i>

423
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:06,341
<i>you ended up disappearing from the summer.</i>

424
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,886
<i>I let my guard down because it was summer.</i>

425
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,181
<i>I thought summer was mine…</i>

426
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,101
<i>or at least that's what I believed.</i>

427
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,195
<i>For summer, I'll make you my number one.</i>

428
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,993
<i>I'll wait only for you,</i>
<i>at least in summer.</i>

429
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:52,845
Hi, Hyun.
Sorry for calling so late.

430
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,808
I have a favor to ask.

431
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,699
The date on your ticket was yesterday.

432
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,784
So it's already past, right?

433
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,705
You wanted Do-ha return
to where he should be.

434
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:25,003
I know I don't have the power
or position for that,

435
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,963
but I'm doing my best.

436
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,925
Why haven't you
managed to bring him back yet?

437
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:35,805
You came in so strong,
but your skills seem to fall a bit short.

438
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:42,687
I'll admit that.

439
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,566
I didn't know much
about Do-ha here in Pacheon.

440
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,362
I don't really know him either…

441
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:53,990
these days.

442
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,908
Ms. Song.

443
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,079
Did you know the first step in remodeling
is always demolition?

444
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:03,916
To fix anything,
you first have to know what needs fixing

445
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,877
and start by tearing it down.

446
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,506
Whether it's nostalgia,
illusions, delusion…

447
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:12,759
or old memories.

448
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,886
Whatever it is.

449
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,056
But Do-ha isn't doing that.

450
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,062
Do you know why?

451
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,068
How am I supposed to know…

452
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:32,528
the reason?

453
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,369
Thank you for completing the revisions
on a tight schedule.

454
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,164
The team leader
will now handle supervision.

455
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,752
I'll stay involved in carrying out
the design intent.

456
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,172
Design continues through construction.

457
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,382
Sure.

458
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:04,519
Letting Director Jeon go
turned out to be great.

459
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,397
Sure, we had to do all the hard work,
but the site's organized.

460
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:12,068
And with the updated plans,
we got a new inspection and safety rating.

461
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,947
Ms. Jeon hasn't complained either.
Isn't that great?

462
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,118
It is great.

463
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:23,037
Everything's going smoothly.
There's nothing to worry about.

464
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,455
But you seem so unmotivated.

465
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,335
Can you check the pipe connections?
I'm leaving now.

466
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:30,878
What?

467
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,840
-Thanks.
-Sure.

468
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:37,218
Why did you ask me
to introduce you to Su-hyeok?

469
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:41,597
I don't know.
I brought this on myself.

470
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,601
Seung-taek, I've become Master Baek.

471
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,104
Master Baek?

472
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,314
Ha-gyeong completely disappeared

473
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,151
from the Peanut House and Pacheon.

474
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,654
-What?
-She's all work, and so am I.

475
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,072
Song's out on dates.

476
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:02,827
What?

477
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,705
With her boyfriend.

478
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,960
You're the one who missed your chance.
Su-hyeok grabbed his.

479
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,796
Hey, Seul…

480
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,631
-Whose side are you on?
-Song's side.

481
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,302
You've spent nearly 20 years
without defining a relationship,

482
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,930
but Su-hyeok went for it right away!

483
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,892
Come on, Seul.

484
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,358
Was I too harsh earlier?

485
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,069
No, he has to learn his lesson.

486
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,489
Seung-taek.

487
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,745
Should we go to Patan for our anniversary?

488
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,788
To see the Summer Triangle?

489
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,063
You didn't forget, right?

490
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:13,940
How could I forget?

491
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,943
I was annoyed
you were always looking down on me.

492
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:18,694
Now I'm paying you back.

493
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,822
How does it feel looking up at me?

494
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:24,075
Beautiful.

495
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,792
PACHEON CITY HALL

496
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,674
Ms. Song, isn't this the place
where we caught

497
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,094
those high school kids
when we were on duty?

498
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,638
You're right.

499
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,267
Now that Patan High is being remodeled
into an observatory,

500
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,935
high schoolers are saying

501
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,813
the magic of confession day
will disappear.

502
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,648
Apparently, the one who started it

503
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,943
said it must happen
on Patan High's rooftop.

504
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:03,447
I heard from Officer Pi
that they're increasing patrols.

505
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,743
What if the kids rush in again
and cause trouble?

506
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,331
<i>July 7. </i>

507
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,186
What was that?

508
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:57,918
<i>Hey, Song. You know the photo</i>
<i>from the July 7th stargazing,</i>

509
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,464
<i>the one in the box? </i>

510
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,674
<i>Can you give it to me?</i>

511
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:09,972
I wanted to share it with Seung-taek
on our 12-year anniversary.

512
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,308
-Sure, I'll look for it.
-<i>Song</i>.

513
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:16,729
I'm sorry
if I brought up any painful memories.

514
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:20,399
Hey, don't make a big deal.
It's just a photo.

515
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,737
Right, you two were inseparable
since then.

516
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,115
I'll look for it.

517
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,869
See? My Himalayan climbing tip.

518
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:17,373
You have to eat <i>dāl bhāt</i>
with your hands, okay?

519
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,707
Okay, I get it.

520
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:20,918
Hey.

521
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,462
Are you leaving soon?

522
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:25,965
I have to.

523
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,509
To see Do-ha before I leave,

524
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,386
I'd better keep myself busy.

525
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,476
Are you…

526
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,187
not talking to Do-ha?

527
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,192
He won't need me
when you take such good care of him.

528
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:51,532
In any case, tell me more
about that <i>dāl bhāt </i>thing.

529
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:55,703
So, it's basically a set meal.

530
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:59,415
It's like a local platter, and
it's different depending on the region.

531
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,145
-Why did you tag along?
-Of course I did.

532
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:24,398
Aren't architects supposed to check
their own work?

533
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:27,234
You might not know,
but I contributed a lot.

534
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,905
When you were busy checking the scale
for hours the other day,

535
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,448
she revised the plans.

536
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,658
You'd better not say you don't know.

537
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:37,703
We've managed to get this far
thanks to PM Yoon

538
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,330
keeping things moving.

539
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:44,043
I want to see the exterior wall texture
and the signpost.

540
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:46,837
Knowing you,
it should be freakishly detailed.

541
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,216
Let's get this done quick
and head back.

542
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,843
I've got your back, team!

543
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,512
-Yay!
-Yay!

544
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,848
-It's off by about 1mm, right?
-Yes.

545
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,518
-Double-check.
-Okay.

546
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:03,437
Everyone, gather around.

547
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,319
The spacing of these vertical pieces
and the plywood thickness are off by 1mm.

548
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:15,991
You said the layout wasn't clear,
so I revised even the detailed plans.

549
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,040
Park Hyun, what the heck?

550
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,291
Before you leave,

551
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,627
please check
the materials and equipment carefully.

552
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,504
-Are you out of your mind?
-Just in case--

553
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,464
What's going on?

554
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:34,343
You think this is your playground?

555
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,305
Going up the scaffolding
with no safety gear?

556
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:42,059
-You almost fell, you know?
-Come on, Director Baek.

557
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,396
It was just one story high.
It's fine, isn't it?

558
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:48,148
You don't care if he gets hurt
and can never do design work?

559
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,443
Didn't I tell you to be careful on site?

560
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:55,614
If your injury causes delays,
will you take responsibility?

561
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,242
I'm sorry.

562
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,328
Hey, what's with him today?

563
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,664
He's definitely got a temper.

564
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:05,624
I've never seen him like that.

565
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,010
Baek Do-ha.

566
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,596
Baek Do-ha!

567
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:21,307
Don't say anything weird.

568
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,892
He's in year one,
when accidents happen the most.

569
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:26,270
I only talked about basic safety.

570
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,900
You can go all out with anything on site.

571
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:35,112
No, you have to go all out.

572
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,489
You can never stress safety enough.

573
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,492
That's all I was talking about.
Don't read more into it.

574
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,852
<i>Up until three years ago,</i>

575
00:44:06,935 --> 00:44:09,813
<i>I never thought I'd be able to work</i>
<i>in architecture again.</i>

576
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,567
<i>I had suffered a serious accident.</i>

577
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,862
<i>I couldn't even be in tall buildings</i>

578
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,406
<i>for quite a while. </i>

579
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,575
<i>I'm not sure if that's why,</i>

580
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:24,953
<i>but I ended up moving</i>
<i>to a single-story house.</i>

581
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:27,831
<i>I couldn't design anything</i>

582
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,209
<i>over two stories for quite a while. </i>

583
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,795
<i>I'd fallen into a slump.</i>

584
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,006
You can never stress safety enough.

585
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,966
That's all I was talking about.

586
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:39,802
Don't read more into it.

587
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:57,736
Hot.

588
00:44:58,987 --> 00:44:59,822
What are you doing?

589
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,657
You see,

590
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:04,410
the one who recommended this
said I had to eat it this way.

591
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,661
So hot.

592
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,123
Who recommended it?

593
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:15,045
There was a friend
who loved the mountains.

594
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,255
He bragged about this.

595
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,757
This is called <i>dāl bhāt.</i>

596
00:45:18,841 --> 00:45:21,927
He said this food could make you
succeed in climbing the Himalayas,

597
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:22,886
or so he claimed.

598
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:25,055
That said,

599
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,016
he tried climbing the Himalayas
three times after eating this,

600
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,101
and made it to the top.

601
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,647
Listening to that story
nearly drove me crazy.

602
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,360
Is it good?

603
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,197
What kind of taste is this?

604
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:44,450
Try it.

605
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:51,707
Anyway, the way he described it

606
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,876
was way over the top.

607
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:57,087
It felt more like a myth
than some superstition.

608
00:45:58,172 --> 00:45:59,965
But the taste is nothing special.

609
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:03,051
I should've tried it sooner
and scolded him.

610
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:05,929
Right.

611
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,891
He's the one who made up
the July 7th superstition.

612
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,809
It's causing Pacheon a lot of trouble.

613
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:15,105
That's why I snuck out today
to have a date with you.

614
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,982
What's the July 7th superstition?

615
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,651
It's called Confession Day.

616
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,820
There's a superstition
that couples who confess

617
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,238
at Patan High on July 7th

618
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:24,907
never break up.

619
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:28,952
But since Seul and Seung-taek
are still going strong,

620
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,829
it might not be just a superstition.

621
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,336
Had I known about
that superstition earlier,

622
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,379
I would've confessed today.

623
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:46,053
He was seriously good at causing trouble.

624
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:50,974
I couldn't help but notice.
It's all in past tense.

625
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,144
You had a huge fight?

626
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,689
I wish we had.

627
00:46:59,733 --> 00:47:01,527
He died three years ago…

628
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:03,570
in the mountains.

629
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:07,866
I see.

630
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,497
I was completely honest in front of him.

631
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,417
And I really regret it.

632
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:23,090
Baek Do-ha really gets on my nerves.

633
00:47:24,424 --> 00:47:26,218
My brother has a knack for it.

634
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:27,886
Why is that?

635
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,682
I feel so comfortable around you.
I can talk about anything.

636
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,310
But with him, it's always like a war.

637
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,647
Feeling uneasy for no reason?

638
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:43,026
You can't help
but say mean things for no reason?

639
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,236
Exactly.

640
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,864
You think that's for no reason?

641
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:07,175
Why do I end up saying everything
in front of you?

642
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,929
That's strange.

643
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,057
Did something get into the food?

644
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:21,440
I talked about Baek Do-young
for the first time in ages.

645
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,651
And it's to you, Attorney Seo.

646
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,948
Thanks for sharing it with me.

647
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:36,038
By the way,
you're still calling me "Attorney Seo."

648
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,499
You really don't know what to call me?

649
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:43,545
No.

650
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,765
Then, instead of the name,

651
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,059
SPEED DIAL 1
ATTORNEY SEO

652
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:58,769
I'll be your speed dial number one.

653
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:41,228
-Yes.
-Again? Okay, got it.

654
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,854
I'll sort it out at the site now.

655
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,148
Sure, I'll send you the documents.

656
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,150
If they're students, I'll give a warning.

657
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,068
Bye.

658
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:54,366
Sorry I can't take you home.

659
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:57,244
No worries. I need to get to the site now.

660
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:01,206
Sure enough,
the July 7th thing really happened.

This is the ER,

672
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,322
Ms. Song, you need sutures…

673
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:44,077
The laceration is clean
and the bleeding's under control.

674
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,704
Can we just apply Steri-Strips?

675
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:47,789
Do you work in this field?

676
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:51,751
I dropped out of medical school
in my third year.

677
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,592
I should've taken you home.

678
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:02,554
Gosh, I'm really okay.
This happens a lot.

679
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:04,890
When you handle complaints,
this happens often.

680
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:07,851
I was shocked when I got the call.

681
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,437
I'm really fine.

682
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,817
Still, I'm glad
I set it as speed dial one…

683
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,155
since Officer Pi contacted me
on speed dial one.

684
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:23,742
I know.

685
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:26,119
By the way…

686
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:29,956
don't we need to let Mr. Baek know?

687
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,168
What for? I'm okay.

688
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,795
It's really no biggie.

689
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,756
And Director Baek

690
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,759
is sensitive about accidents,
so he'll overreact.

691
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,430
He'll make a fuss over nothing,

692
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,766
so don't say anything to him.

693
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:02,238

00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,836
<i>but Ha-gyeong is in the hospital.</i>

703
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:00,880
-Where's the ward?
-That way.

704
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,049
<i>I'm tied up with work right now.</i>

705
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,259
<i>Would you mind</i>

706
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:06,928
<i>going to the hospital for her</i>
<i>instead of me?</i>

707
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:10,849
Because of that July 7th thing,
City Hall was in total chaos.

708
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,560
Do people have nowhere else to go?

709
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:16,021
Why come to an abandoned school to flirt?

710
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:20,984
All those young people poured in
and made a complete mess.

711
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,112
And you ended up getting hurt.

712
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:29,367
We might as well make it a holiday
to let them get out of town.

713
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,618
Aren't you busy?

714
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,963
How could you not tell me
you had an accident?

715
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,799
-Because it's nothing.
-Nothing?

716
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,260
You need two weeks to recover here.

717
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:53,183
Song Ha-gyeong, don't you have my number?
Did you delete it?

718
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,477
Why in the world did you not call me?

719
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:58,730
Baek Do-ha.

720
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,608
Why would I call you?

721
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:04,194
-I've got Attorney Seo.
-Hey, Song Ha-gyeong!

722
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,079
What's with all the drama?

723
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:17,290
You were in the hospital and ignored
my calls, and now what?

724
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,251
"What's with all the drama?"

725
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,505
Don't you care how worried I am?

726
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:27,217
This is why I didn't tell you.
I was going to go home tomorrow anyway.

727
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,929
It makes me uncomfortable seeing people
popping in over nothing.

728
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,933
-I'm here just as a formality.
-Why am I the only one?

729
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:38,853
Why am I the only one who didn't know,
when everyone else knew?

730
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,821
Fine, that's enough.

731
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,866
Everything's sorted out.
It's nothing serious. So just go.

732
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:54,119
Are you leaving me out?

733
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,623
From your daily life and your world?

734
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,296
Are you doing this
to make me realize that?

735
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,173
Because I don't get it?

736
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,471
Hey, Baek Do-ha.

737
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,640
Looks like you think

738
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:18,476
everything I'm doing is just a show
for your sake.

739
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,395
Please, don't 'cause drama.

740
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:25,233
The final argument?
That was two years ago.

741
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,485
It feels like ages to me.

742
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,738
I can barely remember
what happened two days ago.

743
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,283
You're reading too much
into what happened two years ago.

744
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,452
Isn't that ridiculous?

745
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,538
I guess you think I meant all that.

746
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:42,167
But I just threw in all the random tips
I'd picked up,

747
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,545
all for the sake of winning the trial.

748
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:47,755
Baek Do-ha.

749
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:49,966
You know what?

750
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,010
Whenever you come back,

751
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:54,804
all you do is talk about the old me,
who I used to be.

752
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:02,770
Song Ha-gyeong.

753
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:05,607
You forced me into being a guest…

754
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,568
and now to be part of the past.

755
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:12,947
Are you panicking
because your box might open?

756
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:46,648
-Hi.
-Hi.

757
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,441
-Ms. Song?
-Yes.

758
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,776
You can go home today.

759
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:55,490
I was worried about an infection,

760
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:57,617
but things are going
way better than I expected.

761
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:59,827
The first aid was done really well.

762
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,122
Help her with the discharge process.

763
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,040
Sure.

764
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,792
<i>You forced me into being a guest,</i>

765
00:59:06,626 --> 00:59:08,002
and now to be part of the past.

766
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,755
Are you panicking
because your box might open?

767
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:12,423
I'm sorry,

768
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:16,511
but I'd like to stay one more day.
Can I get discharged tomorrow?

769
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,889
Wait here for a moment. I'll get the car.

770
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,474
Sure.

771
01:00:18,823 --> 01:00:19,866
What the heck?

772
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:22,493
What are you doing?

773
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,080
What are you doing?

774
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,729
Hey, what are you doing?
Stop the car.

775
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,272
I don't think I'll ever hear

776
01:00:52,273 --> 01:00:54,692
your true feelings at Patan
or at the Peanut House.

777
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,402
What?

778
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:58,946
Did you buckle up tight?

779
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:02,950
We're not going home today.

780
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,578
<i>Let's stay together tonight, just us.</i>

781
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,038
<i>This is obsession, okay?</i>

782
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,416
<i>If you twist it, I will too.</i>
<i>It's us, after all.</i>

783
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:53,668
<i>I need to do everything I can too.</i>

784
01:01:53,751 --> 01:01:55,586
Attorney Seo!

785
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,005
-Hey, Baek Do-ha.
-Ha-gyeong.

786
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,841
-Shall we go to Donghae now?
-What?

787
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:01,217
<i>Then come over to my place.</i>

788
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,719
He invited her to his place?

789
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:04,137
<i>You haven't eaten yet?</i>

790
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:08,433
When it's about Ha-gyeong,
I have no intention of playing fair.

791
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,476
I blacked out.

792
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,104
<i>What on earth happened last night?</i>

793
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:14,313
Hey, Baek Do-ha.

794
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,524
Stop! I must be crazy.

795
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:18,067
<i>You like someone like her?</i>

796
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,278
<i>Transparent. Song Ha-gyeong's transparent.</i>

797
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,654
<i>I've liked you all along.</i>

798
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:24,031
<i>I've always liked you, and I still do.</i>

799
01:02:25,032 --> 01:02:25,867
<i>I like you.</i>
