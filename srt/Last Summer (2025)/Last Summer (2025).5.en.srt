1
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:31,364
LAST
SUMMER

2
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:36,494
This is going to be our home now.
Look. What do you think?

3
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:39,706
Eighty percent of my insomnia
started at this Peanut House.

4
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:41,458
Should we go in? Let's check it out.

5
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,835
Which side is our home?

6
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,712
Which side do you want it to be?

7
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,010
If I wanted to cry…
No, let me correct that.

8
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:55,513
When my hands got cold, I studied…

9
00:00:56,514 --> 00:01:00,852
thinking, "If I became the top student,
got a perfect score, and I did my part…

10
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,813
my hands would feel less cold."

11
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,231
Mom!

12
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:06,858
-Ha-gyeong!
-Let's play!

13
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,193
I don't want to eat!

14
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,989
Don't be so difficult. Just eat!

15
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,533
Stop that. Move.

16
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,746
REPORT CARD
CLASS RANK 1

17
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,248
I'll leave.

18
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,211
Mom, I'm just gonna leave this house!

19
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:29,839
Ha-gyeong!

20
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,808
I'm not even second or third place.

21
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,062
Do I even have a place in this house?

22
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,483
Baek Do-ha said
that a home is where people live.

23
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:53,363
That's only knowing half the story.

24
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,280
This animal…

25
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,990
'Cause there are many people here.

26
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,242
…has a pocket.

27
00:01:57,325 --> 00:02:00,411
Even in the hot summer,
my hands were always cold.

28
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,627
The foster siblings
who passed through our home…

29
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,628
Bye, Ha-gyeong.

30
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,588
I'm leaving.

31
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,011
…and Baek Do-young…

32
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,224
and Dad…

33
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,937
I'm heading off.

34
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,022
…and Mom…

35
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,526
and Baek Do-ha.

36
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,656
They kept coming…

37
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,617
and going.

38
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:51,963
Hey, Su-bak.

39
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:56,718
And finally,
I was left all alone in the house…

40
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,181
and he came back.

41
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:04,392
You came back.

42
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,216
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

43
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,938
JONG-MAN JR.

44
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,911
That's right. Hi, Su-bak.

45
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,087
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes, totally.

46
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,842
So you went for a run.

47
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,594
You should pace yourself well.

48
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,098
Living with you
takes stamina and mental strength.

49
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,600
Why?

50
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,852
Good morning.

51
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:07,181
-You seem really happy.
-Yes, I'm super happy.

52
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,731
You two really live together.

53
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,112
-Good morning.
-Morning.

54
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:24,365
It's really nice to see, right? Nice.

55
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,202
In this era of low birth rates,
having more young people in our village

56
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,246
is a really good thing.

57
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,873
It is good, indeed.

58
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:35,126
Will Patan-myeon's average age
go down now?

59
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,673
At least that sign was made properly.

60
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,052
Thanks to that,
Dr. Song's house looks pretty decent now.

61
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:48,139
The past few days of construction,

62
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,933
your neighbors have been
putting up with all the noise.

63
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,186
Why don't you go over and say hi sometime?

64
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,103
Great idea.

65
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,396
-Of course.
-Right.

66
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,273
Do you have any dugyeonju left?

67
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,318
-No.
-No, we don't.

68
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:02,361
Why?

69
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,698
I'll be late for work. I've got to go.
Have a good day.

70
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:06,949
-Sure.
-Okay.

71
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,951
-You're not coming in my car?
-No.

72
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,287
But you can't say hi without dugyeonju.

73
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,832
We actually broke two bottles of it.

74
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,626
You broke those?

75
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,170
-You want it?
-Of course.

76
00:06:19,253 --> 00:06:20,963
Then we'll buy you each a bottle.

77
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,882
-Good.
-Special edition, right?

78
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,884
PACHEON CITY HALL
WHERE NATURE BREATHES

79
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,679
-What do I do about this?
-What?

80
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:32,767
He says the observatory project
destroyed his family.

81
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,185
Destroyed how?

82
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,397
"This rural village is already dark.

83
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,484
Is it right to leave only
darker matters behind?

84
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,111
Correct this now or I'll…

85
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:47,156
split your head in two with a crowbar…"
What do I do?

86
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,408
People like that probably won't show up.

87
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:53,746
-Officer Song, come to my desk.
-Yes, ma'am.

88
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,624
Yes.

89
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,710
Please hurry with the detailed plan
for Patan High

90
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:01,212
and share it with Pluto.

91
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,714
-Maybe by this week--
-I've sent it already.

92
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,216
Already?

93
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,386
And if you approve the material cost
by 1:00 p.m.,

94
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,138
I'll place the order right away.

95
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,181
Why are you placing the order so soon?

96
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,016
Don't we have enough time?

97
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,645
Now, Pluto checks
the ordered materials themselves too.

98
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:22,984
To meet the deadline, August 31st,
there can't be a single error.

99
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,987
Wait, August 31?

100
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,905
You're going overboard again.

101
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:29,866
Pluto won't allow that.

102
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:35,830
Director Baek Do-ha set the date himself.

103
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,915
PATAN HIGH OBSERVATORY RENOVATION

104
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,043
AUGUST 31 - COMPLETION

105
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,463
You all saw the schedule I sent, right?

106
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:44,922
-Yes.
-Yes.

107
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,132
This renovation project

108
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,051
has far more invisible problems
than visible ones.

109
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,389
So I organized and checked
potential issues that may occur on-site,

110
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:54,849
so review them carefully.

111
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:58,144
Why are you even checking
fine dust levels?

112
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,979
To start the interior work.

113
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:02,690
Taking care of workers' conditions
improves efficiency.

114
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,361
The completion date
can't be delayed even by one day.

115
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,947
That's not an option for us.
To achieve that,

116
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,909
we'll finish demolition and repairs
by the end of this month,

117
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,077
exterior finishing by mid-July,

118
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,498
and interior work by early August.

119
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,499
Then…

120
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,583
OFFICIAL COMPLETION

121
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,127
Done.

122
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,422
There's no time to waste.

123
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,183
Officer Song's hazing is over.

124
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:41,145
She even sent the detailed plan.

125
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,357
Looks like she's ready
to fully support our project now.

126
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,944
But why did she suddenly
change her mind overnight?

127
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,488
Who knows.

128
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,156
Season Two really started.

129
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,286
I told Yu-jeong
and cleared my whole week.

130
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,914
-Starting today, I can work until--
-No.

131
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:01,958
I'll leave on time.

132
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,170
I hate working overtime,
so I put my soul into the planning.

133
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,174
-Just today?
-No, every day.

134
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:11,717
Every day?

135
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:45,459
Oh, my! You scared me.

136
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,630
Why are you sprawled out in my house?

137
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,341
Su-bak's treats are all here.

138
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,263
Could you not just
waltz in and out of my place?

139
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,056
And you can't feed him
just anything.

140
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:02,768
Jeez.

141
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,657
I couldn't get the portion quite right.

142
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:21,245
Like you said, it's hard
to deal with food waste in this house.

143
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,997
Sharing food with your neighbor helps.

144
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,050
Living with you
is making me talk just like you.

145
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,095
"I made it for you."
That's all I needed to say.

146
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:00,910
Sit.

147
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,572
What now?

148
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,742
Can we talk after you're done eating?

149
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,502
COHABITATION AGREEMENT

150
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:08,269
"Until August 31st, no matter
what unexpected situation arises,

151
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,563
Baek Do-ha and Song Ha-gyeong
will live together.

152
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,398
If this clause is violated,

153
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:15,484
Song Ha-gyeong transfers 100%
of Peanut House to Baek Do-ha."

154
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,070
-What's this?
-A cohabitation agreement.

155
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:23,325
For our comfortable and safe cohabitation,

156
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,578
I think we need a clear arrangement.

157
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,456
There's no guarantee
you won't run away again.

158
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:29,623
Run away?

159
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,629
Think about what you did to me
before we ended up living together here.

160
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,214
You sued me out of the blue,

161
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,843
then dropped the lawsuit
saying you'd give up ownership.

162
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,345
And now,
you want to try living together.

163
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,348
What if something comes up
between us again

164
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,142
while we're living together?

165
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,393
Something like what?

166
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:53,314
You leaving the house again
or disappearing from my life,

167
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,441
or me receiving a second complaint.

168
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,152
I need to prepare
for all those scenarios.

169
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:01,030
Our summers always had
a lot of unexpected things.

170
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,324
I don't trust you.

171
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:24,845
"Detailed contract for shared living
at the Peanut House.

172
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,975
If the original term of the contract,
the completion date, isn't fulfilled,

173
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,353
the ownership of the house
shall be fully transferred

174
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,146
to Party A, Song Ha-gyeong."

175
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,816
I revised it to contract format
with detailed clauses.

176
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,989
Starting today, electricity, water, gas,
and maintenance fees will be split evenly.

177
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,659
Shared spaces can be used
only during designated time slots.

178
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,494
And let's not enter each other's spaces.

179
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,122
You can't just come and go as you please.

180
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,542
And most importantly,

181
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,586
the premise is that
we do our work professionally.

182
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,506
Let's keep the private
and professional parts separate

183
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,509
and respect each other's spaces
at all times. Got it?

184
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,261
So you'll respect my space too.

185
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,554
Isn't that obvious?

186
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,349
Hey… I have one question.

187
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:15,020
What changed your mind
about living with me?

188
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,273
Can I ask what it is?

189
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,193
To shatter your fantasy.

190
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,905
I thought about it, and you were right.

191
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,617
We need to live together
for this to really end.

192
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,080
You have too many fantasies
about this house.

193
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:36,959
It's just a house, but you have fantasies
because you haven't lived here.

194
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,795
Break them while living here.

195
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,674
Right. I have a question too.

196
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,513
Since yesterday, this part…

197
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,310
"No matter
what unexpected situation arises."

198
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:55,895
It's really been bothering me.

199
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:58,397
What unexpected situation?

200
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,617
It's called "unexpected" for a reason.

201
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,369
Only an idiot
would give a heads-up about it.

202
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,792
Anyway, got it.

203
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,562
RECIPIENT BAEK DO-HA

204
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:41,815
Who is it?

205
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,692
RECIPIENT BAEK DO-HA

206
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:47,821
RECIPIENT BAEK DO-HA

207
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:50,950
RECIPIENT BAEK DO-HA

208
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,705
He's unbelievable.

209
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,168
Where did he go?

210
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,086
BAEK DO-HA

211
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,965
-Hey, Song.
-Are you crazy?

212
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,384
How many packages did you order?

213
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,011
And why do you keep
sending your stuff to my house?

214
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,348
Sorry. Could you put them
in your fridge for me?

215
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:17,393
-What did you say?
-My fridge is full.

216
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,353
They're perishable,
so refrigerate them now.

217
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,647
-I'm busy. I've got to go.
-Hey, wait…

218
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,115
I knew you and Officer Song were
childhood friends, but this is unique.

219
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,742
Did your father really build it?

220
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,785
Yes.

221
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:38,622
So you're basically living together,
but separately.

222
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,291
You're living together, but not together.

223
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,920
-Right?
-As an architect…

224
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,380
I want to see her house too.

225
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,633
But she won't be happy about it, right?

226
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:53,095
The director said
never cross this yellow line.

227
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,060
-Pizza delivery.
-I didn't order any.

228
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,398
-That's me.
-Oh, it was here.

229
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,607
-Yes.
-Enjoy.

230
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,608
-Thank you.
-Sure.

231
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,489
Want a piece? You can come over.

232
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,242
You go ahead and eat.

233
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,128
Ha-gyeong! Ha-gyeong!

234
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,839
I made your favorite kimchi pancakes.

235
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,592
You can't cross that line.

236
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:34,887
My guests can only go
as far as this couch here.

237
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,350
Of course,
you have a ceasefire line at home.

238
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,936
You live in the DMZ.

239
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,235
Where…

240
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,365
What is happening?

241
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,492
Come in.

242
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,168
Jeez.

243
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,420
Let's sit.

244
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:14,009
Happy now?
Now I'm invited by both of you.

245
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,929
Sit and eat now. It'll get cold.

246
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,438
Here.

247
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,694
I didn't think of that way.
You're really smart.

248
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,906
I used my brain. Thanks to Ha-gyeong,
it's smarter now.

249
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:40,160
She's so smart and capable.
I should call her "Dr. Song."

250
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,038
She tutored my daughter
and sent her to college.

251
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,582
And Jang's immature son
became a decent man

252
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,710
all thanks to her.
She's an amazing girl.

253
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:52,089
I wouldn't trade Dr. Song
for a hundred other doctors.

254
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,173
Enough. Now, food.

255
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:16,822
Again?

256
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:25,497
Su-bak, come here.

257
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:27,249
How was your day? Have you eaten yet?

258
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,878
Song! You're home!

259
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:32,713
What are you doing here?

260
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,259
She's here.

261
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:55,068
You know what this house means
to Song Ha-gyeong.

262
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,320
Why are you doing this?

263
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,158
Your slices are inconsistently cut.

264
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,577
Do you want me to change knives?

265
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,873
What's your real reason
for barging into this house?

266
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,753
I'm just trying to live with
Song Ha-gyeong, who's still growing.

267
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,049
For now, matching her pace.
Just like this.

268
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,967
Slowly.

269
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,264
I had fixed everything for Mom,

270
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,433
so you won't have any problems
moving around.

271
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,771
Hey, that aside,

272
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:34,775
what on earth did Baek Do-ha do
to make you let him live here?

273
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,194
-Well…
-He begged.

274
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:43,075
We'll live together until August 31,
and if she still doesn't like it,

275
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,452
I said I'd disappear forever.

276
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,663
Your last card was strong.

277
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:50,749
-Look at this.
-What's this?

278
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,585
"Detailed contract."

279
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,963
Is this how you two live together?

280
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:59,424
Looking at you both,
you're equally immature.

281
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,468
-Don't look.
-Hey!

282
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,141
Hey, this detailed contract

283
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:11,645
was all made by Song Ha-gyeong.
It'll be hard living with her, right?

284
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,274
-Hey.
-Hey, Baek Do.

285
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,067
You always make me do everything.

286
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,610
You keep moving around.

287
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:20,654
Come on back.

288
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,573
-Go, hurry up.
-I'm coming.

289
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,703
She's only harsh to me, isn't she?

290
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,838
-It's good.
-Right?

291
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:38,797
It's really good.

292
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,092
You just sliced it. I did everything.
I did almost all the plating too.

293
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:44,886
I seasoned it. Don't be ridiculous.

294
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:45,971
I did everything.

295
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,515
Slicing and seasoning is
everything in cooking.

296
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,142
You were so bad at slicing, though.

297
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,059
It's delicious.

298
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,103
It's fine, as long as it tastes good.

299
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:56,148
-Right?
-Yes, it tastes good.

300
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,065
See?

301
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,485
-All right. I'll close the door.
-Thanks.

302
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,458
Is this why you're living with Baek Do-ha?

303
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:21,840
The Peanut House has changed so much
in just a few days.

304
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,053
It finally feels like a home.

305
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,311
JONG-MAN JR

306
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:50,744
-Thanks for the food! Bye!
-Bye!

307
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,287
Bye. Thanks for the food.

308
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,663
Bye!

309
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,842
Let's go, Su-bak. Come on.

310
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,306
It's really weird
that they're living together.

311
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:14,434
Ha-gyeong seemed happy though, right?

312
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,855
Yes, it's been a while
since I've seen her smile so genuinely.

313
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:22,484
I'll wait until August 31st too,

314
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,821
but if he makes Song suffer even a bit,
I won't let it slide.

315
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,825
By the way, Seul, I think I won again.

316
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,202
I said Song Ha-gyeong
would accept Baek Do-ha.

317
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,955
Seriously, Song Ha-gyeong.

318
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,707
She seems really strong,
but she always cuts him some slack.

319
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,379
-I deposited it.
-Nice.

320
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,344
By the way,

321
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,222
I was surprised to hear
you wanted to go to the Peanut House.

322
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:55,892
You never go to other peoples' homes,
no matter how close you are.

323
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,979
Do-ha invited me for the first time.

324
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:02,023
So I tried something I don't usually do.

325
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:04,025
And also,

326
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,945
how much longer
can we meet like this?

327
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,085
Why aren't you saying anything?

328
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,838
It's about time you said something mean.

329
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,717
Why say anything?
You'll do whatever you want anyway.

330
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:34,890
Still, inviting Seung-taek
was a good thing.

331
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,769
First praise from Song Ha-gyeong.

332
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,571
And all you want to do with me
is just eat meals together?

333
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,198
To cook for me and feed me?

334
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,867
Why is that "just"?

335
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,328
That's huge.

336
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,289
Three meals a day.

337
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,585
Sounds of spoons, chopsticks,
chewing, and talking.

338
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,670
These are so precious.

339
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,133
I want you to think of me…

340
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,344
every time you eat.

341
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,430
Actually,

342
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:19,017
I want to make you think of me
in every corner of the house.

343
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,021
Eating together, sleeping together,

344
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:25,899
working together,
and inviting people we both know,

345
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,735
I want you to think of me always.

346
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,296
It finally feels like a home.

347
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,627
Can't sleep?

348
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,588
No.

349
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,049
Right.

350
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,969
I can't sleep,
so I'm trying to read this book.

351
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,268
The sleep kit I bought doesn't work?

352
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,900
If that worked,

353
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,611
I wouldn't be going
to the sleep clinic I can barely afford.

354
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:56,656
And in this house,
all the deer sounds and training noises

355
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,867
wake me up in the middle of the night.

356
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,495
You must've been scared.

357
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:08,585
Don't be ridiculous.
It's not scary. I'm a grown-up woman.

358
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,882
By the way,

359
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:17,719
did you contact the lawyer
about postponing the mediation?

360
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,727
Right. Did you watch that drama yesterday?

361
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:29,314
-I didn't.
-That famous one.

362
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,231
Right.

363
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:32,359
-It's so good these days.
-It is.

364
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,695
I want you to think of me
every time you eat.

365
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,863
You aren't eating much.

366
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,158
It's nothing.

367
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,079
It tastes a bit different
from what I know.

368
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,374
-Who is it?
-Hello.

369
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:50,210
-I'll tell you if it goes well.
-Honey.

370
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,503
-Yes?
-Are you okay?

371
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,254
-What do you mean?
-Look at this.

372
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,632
PACHEON CITY HALL BULLETIN BOARD

373
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,593
JEON NAM-JIN
STATUS: RETURN

374
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,513
Excuse me. Sorry.

375
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,810
JEON NAM-JIN

376
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:10,855
Darn it.

377
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:11,773
Cheers!

378
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:13,400
-Patan!
-Patan!

379
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:15,693
Cheers!

380
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,115
How much is that project?

381
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,908
Budget's 12 billion won.

382
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:26,413
The mayor picked this project
for re-election.

383
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:30,166
I heard it was finally rejected,
but they're doing it.

384
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:33,294
So who won it?

385
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,296
Someone has better ties than Nam-jin?

386
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,589
-Would there be?
-No.

387
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:40,301
If you win public support
with public architecture,

388
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:44,222
you can go straight to City Council,
and even become a governor and a mayor.

389
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,850
-Hello.
-I have a reservation at 7:00.

390
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,227
It's the innermost room.

391
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,277
Hey, who's this?

392
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,280
Lawyer Seo, funny we meet here.

393
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,033
It's really so good to see you.

394
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,369
Wait. Hold on.

395
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,413
Are you here to see me?

396
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,623
Come here.

397
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,168
Hey, guys, say hello.

398
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,254
This is Lawyer Seo from Seo & Joo.

399
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,257
Hello.

400
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,136
He only works
for first-class VIPs like me.

401
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,262
Applause.

402
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:27,974
-Seo & Joo!
-Seo & Joo!

403
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,185
-Seo & Joo! Seo and…
-Seo & Joo! Seo and…

404
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,188
My party is waiting. Excuse me.

405
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,190
Okay.

406
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,117
You're here.

407
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,870
You're the lawyer
who only works for VIPs.

408
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,622
The soundproofing is terrible.

409
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,336
Thanks to that, I became a VIP too.

410
00:30:02,884 --> 00:30:06,304
Postponing mediation
isn't difficult at all…

411
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,475
but I'm curious how you two
suddenly came to live together.

412
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,685
I'd like to learn the skill.

413
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:17,065
What skill?

414
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:22,153
Ms. Song Ha-gyeong was quite stubborn

415
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,155
when playing bingo with me.

416
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,617
Bingo game?

417
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,287
You two met up alone?

418
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:32,831
Yes.

419
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,293
I find Plaintiff Song Ha-gyeong
more and more interesting.

420
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,465
Right. She's not easy to deal with.

421
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,177
Wait. Hold on a second.

422
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,348
Yes?

423
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,560
Of course.
The materials and the construction

424
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:57,397
should all involve us locals.
What are you talking about?

425
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,484
I don't know.
Let's meet soon and talk, okay?

426
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,460
I heard
you're going to be joining our project.

427
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,507
As a public architect,
you'll advise us and manage the site.

428
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,508
Yes.

429
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,887
Right. I was rude last time.

430
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:37,186
Coming from abroad,
you wouldn't know the local context.

431
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,855
Given local context,

432
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:41,190
I know well
we should work with a local architect.

433
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,068
I look forward to working with you.

434
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,195
Right. I…

435
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,325
What? Okay.

436
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,076
Nice.

437
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,578
You got this.

438
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,340
Right.

439
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,093
First of all…

440
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,763
Jeez, my chest is burning.

441
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,223
First, Director Baek should know

442
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,435
that the
Public Architecture Department's opinion

443
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,062
is the city's opinion.

444
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,814
One thousand of Suhyeon-ri residents

445
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,942
and 13,000 Patan-myeon residents

446
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,235
and 170,000 Patan City residents.

447
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,320
It represents them all.

448
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,821
That freak…

449
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:37,914
Baek Do-ha's going to lash out
at Jeon Nam-jin for cutting his tree.

450
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,710
Please cover for my shortcomings.

451
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,546
I'm excited to work with someone
with a deep understanding

452
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,423
of the local context.

453
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,175
-What?
-Architecture…

454
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,302
is all about locality.

455
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,096
And on-site, just trust me…

456
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:56,182
He's totally professionally
ignoring him.

457
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:59,852
I've been having my eye on
the warehouse renovation project

458
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,938
that the former director did too.

459
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,065
-Why is he like that?
-Oh, my.

460
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:08,319
That was also done with Officer Song here.
We were working together.

461
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,534
Let's wrap it up here today.

462
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,578
You two figure out your rhythm gradually.

463
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:21,541
All right.

464
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:41,060
In case you hear something weird

465
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:44,939
and misunderstand and misinterpret it
while working at the City Hall,

466
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,107
I'll tell you first.

467
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,193
I once sued someone over Jong-man.

468
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,658
Jeon Nam-jin was involved in it.
I don't want to get into the details.

469
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,412
Anyway, something like that happened,

470
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:03,332
and I won the lawsuit,
and he was fined seven million won.

471
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,333
That happened once.

472
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,629
It was resolved peacefully,

473
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:12,675
so don't bring personal feelings
into professional work either.

474
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:18,264
It doesn't seem resolved at all.

475
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:21,184
Tell me more details.

476
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,811
Don't ask anymore.
My trauma's coming back.

477
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,564
So did you really date Jeon Nam-jin?

478
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,234
Why do you want to know that now?

479
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:32,862
It's because of you!

480
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:37,450
It's because of you,
so don't ask me anymore, okay?

481
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,535
It's all because of you!

482
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,622
Today's bad air quality
is because of you,

483
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,291
him only pooping once today
is because of you,

484
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:47,960
and what I hate the most,
tangsuyuk with sauce poured on it…

485
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,378
That's all because of you too!

486
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,679
Are you sure you have time for this?

487
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:01,099
Are you prepared for tomorrow's meeting?

488
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,683
The hazing on the site is no joke.

489
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,144
Don't grovel on-site
and embarrass me, okay?

490
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,483
What's wrong with her?

491
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,531
Su-bak.
You only pooped once today?

492
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,698
OBSERVATORY RENOVATION

493
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,159
Thank you for your hard work.

494
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,162
Hello, yes. Hello.

495
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,247
Hello.

496
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,541
-Thank you for your hard work.
-Oh, my.

497
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:29,710
Hey, bro! We meet on this site too.

498
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:30,795
You look great.

499
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,380
Come on.

500
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,591
Why aren't you coming
to the morning soccer club anymore?

501
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,428
Seeing Director Jeon Nam-jin
puts my mind at ease.

502
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:42,431
The blueprint for this project
really worried me.

503
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,017
It's such a creative blueprint.

504
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:48,104
It's even specifying machines by area.

505
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,774
I've never seen something like that
in 30 years of my carpentry career.

506
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,734
Where's he from?

507
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,278
He doesn't seem local.

508
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,071
He's…

509
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,449
He grew up in New York with his mother,
who's an architecture professor.

510
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,786
Public architecture is hard for outsiders.

511
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,414
That's why I'm attached.

512
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:11,210
No wonder. He's clearly someone
who just draws plans at a desk.

513
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:14,463
Last time, I was even told
to break the bearing wall.

514
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,965
I was totally dumbfounded.

515
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:20,011
I'll listen to your advice and skip it.
Let's just do it that way.

516
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,638
Bro, just trust me.

517
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,349
Without my advice,
you can't meet the deadline.

518
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,517
And today…

519
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,228
Director Baek, where are you?

520
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,396
Everyone's here--

521
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:32,273
What?

522
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:38,029
Director Baek,
you're supposed to be in the office now.

523
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,280
This…

524
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,741
Why's this wall standing?

525
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:44,952
It's a load-bearing wall.

526
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:49,248
If you just break it,
the building will collapse.

527
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,838
I marked non-bearing walls for demolition.

528
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,716
Did you not see the blueprint?

529
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,477
Gosh, seriously!

530
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,854
That's your blueprint.

531
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:15,524
Patan High School is old,
and has no original plans. Right?

532
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,071
Come out.

533
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,115
Look.

534
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,537
You hear this sound?

535
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,957
Load-bearing and non-load-bearing

536
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,335
have different densities,
so the sound is subtly different.

537
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,005
It might be too difficult for you.

538
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,258
What the…

539
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,429
Do you think the same, sir?

540
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,724
He's right. They're all connected.

541
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,728
You've only been in the office.
You don't know the site.

542
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,983
All right, guys.

543
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,278
Today we're…

544
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:04,115
This is the last day.
Let's not waste energy. It's a good day.

545
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:07,326
Should we do it
on the beam and the column now?

546
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,036
Would that satisfy him?

547
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,872
Then we'll have to remove
the ceiling and walls too.

548
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,834
Are all the walls removed yet?

549
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,671
Just break everything
as he says with a breaker.

550
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:20,047
Then the site will be ruined.

551
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:24,593
Everyone go to the office first.
You can talk there…

552
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:33,894
What are you doing?

553
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,855
Are you crazy?

554
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:40,109
Wait. Don't.

555
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,618
What? Don't!

556
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,288
Please don't!

557
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,625
Don't, please!

558
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:11,474
Should I break that one too?

559
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:15,019
I'll finish it.

560
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:25,112
Sir, I need you to trust…

561
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,741
my blueprint.

562
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,161
Okay.

563
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,290
I checked the level with a tape

564
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,542
and measured it for over a month.

565
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:40,878
I heard that

566
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:45,299
you're finishing up today.
Shouldn't you move quickly?

567
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,010
As you know, our schedule is tight.

568
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,805
But if we have defect,
it'll be a big trouble.

569
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,868
Why did I avoid his eyes earlier?

570
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,877
This isn't the Baek Do-ha I knew.

571
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:26,465
I probably didn't know much about him.

572
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:32,054
He only stayed for 21 days,
and then flew back before summer ended.

573
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,557
Of course I didn't know him.

574
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,328
Whatever.

575
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,547
It's just a black goat.

576
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,049
Why did you come down
to the humans' territory?

577
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:19,560
Chang-su?

578
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,105
Gosh, you scared me.

579
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,192
What brings you here?

580
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,153
Is someone else living here now?

581
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,450
Mr. Baek's son is staying for a bit.

582
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,745
I see.

583
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,413
Why do you ask?

584
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,460
What the…

585
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:04,813
What was that?

586
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,198
What's going on?

587
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,920
Jeez, not again!

588
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,347
-Hello.
-Baek Do-ha, where are you?

589
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,475
I'm trapped at home.
The door won't open.

590
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,851
Where are you?

591
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,813
-The bathroom.
-Okay. I'll be right there.

592
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,441
-Song Ha-gyeong.
-You came?

593
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,151
I'm here. Move away from the door.

594
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,072
Jeez.

595
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,494
Thanks.

596
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:20,723
Maybe I should really move out
of this crappy house. The location's bad.

597
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,267
Why did Dad build a wooden house

598
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,436
that creaks and cracks
whenever it rains?

599
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,731
Right. I saw a black goat
in front of the house today.

600
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:31,650
You should've called me sooner.

601
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:34,695
Don't underestimate this house.

602
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:40,618
Right.

603
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,329
I should tell you this now…

604
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,582
since you're living here for a while.

605
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,142
Sometimes, lights were on
in an empty room.

606
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,105
Is this happening again?

607
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:29,958
Some doors fixed themselves.

608
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,672
What's wrong with this thing?

609
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:44,181
A broken faucet
suddenly started working perfectly.

610
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,520
MASTER BAEK

611
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,109
-Hey, Ha-gyeong.
-Hi, Mr. Baek.

612
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,568
Did you come to my house?

613
00:44:56,652 --> 00:45:00,114
What? No, I haven't been yet.

614
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,032
I'll definitely come this week.

615
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,786
Maybe there's a ghost in this house.

616
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:08,038
-So don't--
-I fixed it.

617
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:13,377
I'm talking about things
that happened before you came.

618
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,796
-One year ago--
-I know. I fixed it.

619
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:22,970
What? Really?
You've been sneaking into my house?

620
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,973
How could a ghost have fixed
all those things here?

621
00:45:26,056 --> 00:45:28,308
-Grow up.
-Hey.

622
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:32,438
Every time you asked my dad for help,
he told me to come here.

623
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:36,650
I knew you'd freak out if you saw me,
so I came when you were away.

624
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,736
You told me to disappear.

625
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,198
So to avoid upsetting you,
I came while you were away for work.

626
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:47,661
Song Ha-gyeong.

627
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:02,718
A ghost? You have a serious problem.

628
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,188
If anything needs fixing, call me.

629
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,078
Jeez, you scared me.

630
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,749
Hey, I just checked.

631
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,126
You know the hallway
from the lobby to the office.

632
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,920
There'll be a structure going in.

633
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,338
So that line might go over.

634
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:44,927
SHARED SPACE
PLEASE TAKE CALLS OUTSIDE

635
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,804
Hey, I'll call you back.

636
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,976
Let's go. You must be feeling great.

637
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,484
Let's go.

638
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,402
Let's go.

639
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:05,656
-Rub him properly.
-I am doing that.

640
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,786
Good boy.

641
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,829
You're being such a good boy today.

642
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,750
-Chairwoman.
-Hi.

643
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,085
Hello.

644
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,587
Oh, hello.

645
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:30,931
Here I go.

646
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,230
You've been holding that?

647
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:39,940
Oh, please.

648
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,196
Hey, give it.

649
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,073
Take this.

650
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,556
-Hey.
-Did you eat the gimbap?

651
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:13,807
I'm eating it now.

652
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,684
I made a smoothie too.

653
00:48:15,767 --> 00:48:17,227
I'm drinking that too.

654
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,354
Enjoy.

655
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,899
I will. Thanks.

656
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,187
Yes, coming.

657
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:09,821
Who are you?

658
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:12,866
Baek Do-ha's house?

659
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,120
Next door.

660
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:32,469
It's scary how fast you move.

661
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,596
You received my mail less than a day ago.

662
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,058
Right after the conference,
I heard about you and took a late flight.

663
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,560
The fastest time slot
was only business class,

664
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,437
so my month's rent's gone.

665
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,897
That must've hurt you.

666
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,734
You suddenly quit your job
and went to Korea. That was fine.

667
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,821
At least you've been working
remotely on video calls.

668
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:54,366
That was fine too.
At first, it was video calls.

669
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,659
Then it was emails.

670
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,661
Then you said you wanted to quit.

671
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:00,455
I have a project to focus on.

672
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,374
Are you really ditching Hermann Project?

673
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:03,750
It's your design.

674
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:09,047
The whole flight here,
I racked my brain.

675
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,176
"It must be Baek Do-young.

676
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:17,222
Okay, I'll somehow persuade him.

677
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,517
I'll drag him back
even if I have to beat him."

678
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,937
Is it because of Song Ha-gyeong?

679
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,900
-Living together.
-Working together too.

680
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:32,446
You're doing something
you usually don't do.

681
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:36,742
You must be that desperate
and staking everything on it.

682
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:39,244
Bringing personal matters
into professional work?

683
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,956
You don't know Officer Song well.

684
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:44,750
She's competent.

685
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,127
She's the best at her job.

686
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,047
I'll leave for now.

687
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,342
I need to revise my strategy too.

688
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,393
So did you explain everything?

689
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:08,148
You came to explain everything. Did you?

690
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,777
You couldn't sleep even with pills.

691
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,488
The reason why I've been bothering you.

692
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:19,451
The reason
why I had to fly here to this house.

693
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,204
Did you explain it all?

694
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:29,586
I really need to take you back.

695
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,047
I'll leave for now.

696
00:52:01,993 --> 00:52:03,245
Hey.

697
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:06,331
That woman who made
a spectacular entrance earlier

698
00:52:06,414 --> 00:52:08,542
is someone I studied with in New York--

699
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,043
Why are you explaining that?

700
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,629
It's not something unusual.

701
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,218
Give them the right address, though.

702
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,012
Why always make them ring my bell?

703
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,433
Well…

704
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,978
You have something to say?

705
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:30,564
I have work to finish now.

706
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:34,693
No, go ahead, work.

707
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,389
Baek Do-ha's house?

708
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,614
I'm Yoon So-hee.

709
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:22,991
I'm Song Ha-gyeong.

710
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,912
Friends with Baek Do-ha and Do-young?

711
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,207
You know Baek Do-young?

712
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,001
He always came in winter.

713
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:38,006
Baek Do-ha's mother was my professor.
Professor Nam Ae-min.

714
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:40,717
I see.

715
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,219
You don't know me well,
but I know you well.

716
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,890
I heard about you endlessly
from both of them.

717
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:51,519
The childhood friend living next door
in the Peanut House in Korea.

718
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,358
But why did you come to see me?

719
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:58,652
Song Ha-gyeong.

720
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,405
Do you like Baek Do-ha?

721
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:11,873
Do you genuinely like him?

722
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,294
-I--
-I like him.

723
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:23,009
But I like Architect Baek Do-ha
twice as much as the man…

724
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:25,595
No, ten times more.

725
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:29,975
If I had to choose one,
without a moment's hesitation,

726
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,643
I'd choose Architect Baek Do-ha.

727
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:35,230
I love the designs
Baek Do-ha created that much.

728
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,149
Okay.

729
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:43,196
But why are you telling me this?

730
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:52,247
You'll live together
until August 31st, right?

731
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:57,127
But I want to take Baek Do-ha
right now.

732
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:03,842
I want you to let him
go back to where he belongs.

733
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,052
Please let him go.

734
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:57,979
Early on in the project,
we held an internal team competition.

735
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:02,150
Baek Do-ha's design was the only one
that got unanimous approval.

736
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,528
He devoted over two years to it,

737
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:07,197
and he's giving it all up…

738
00:56:08,156 --> 00:56:09,824
to live with you.

739
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:13,203
But I'm taking him back within a week.

740
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,456
It's too important an opportunity for him.

741
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,428
If he's leaving anyway…

742
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:33,264
why did he change that thing?

743
00:56:35,183 --> 00:56:36,559
My resolutions

744
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:39,104
melted away in an instant.

745
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:44,651
All those resolutions I froze
melted away.

746
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:49,405
Because of the bright lights
that suddenly turned on in this house.

747
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:55,537
Don't let anyone in.
Don't get carried away too soon.

748
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:58,957
Don't try to trust again.

749
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,045
Su-bak.

750
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:15,098
Su-bak?

751
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:26,860
Hey, Su-bak.

752
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:31,489
Su-bak.

753
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:34,534
Su-bak, wake up. Su-bak.

754
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,289
Hospital.

755
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:40,540
BAEK DO-HA

756
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,760
The call cannot be connected…

757
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,053
SONG HA-GYEONG

758
00:57:59,017 --> 00:58:01,519
Yes, I've turned down the AC.

759
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:05,648
And wiping him with a wet towel
lowered his temperature.

760
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:08,818
His tongue's a bit swollen
and has no energy yet.

761
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:10,653
I'll give him electrolytes.

762
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,657
Yes, thank you.

763
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,953
What's wrong? Is Su-bak sick?

764
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:23,500
-Should you take him to the hospital?
-It's okay. I've always done this alone.

765
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:27,962
You must've been scared.

766
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,721
Why did you fix the shoe rack?

767
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:41,726
That's how Su-bak knows
I'm home from work.

768
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:45,730
I didn't leave it broken. It's our signal.

769
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:49,275
Your job is designing
and arranging fantasies,

770
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:51,486
so you thought
I'd be grateful if you fixed it?

771
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:52,904
This is a home.

772
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,408
Not a blueprint or 3D screen house,
a real home.

773
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,540
You never lived here, you won't know.

774
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,087
So don't touch anything.

775
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,389
Did something happen?

776
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:24,435
What happened? It's something
I've always done alone.

777
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:29,899
You leaving your traces

778
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:32,151
is just ridiculous.

779
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:01,681
Just go to your room.

780
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,267
It's okay. I can do it alone.

781
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,763
I knew from the beginning.

782
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:43,514
Since Baek Do-ha returned

783
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:46,434
and the light near my room
turned on again that night.

784
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:49,354
My hands…

785
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,357
would get cold again.

786
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:58,196
Girls, stop being picky with food

787
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:00,615
and stop going to bed late.
You won't grow tall.

788
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,911
You little brats!

789
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:06,704
Don't ever come back!

790
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:15,672
Hurry, please come quickly.

791
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:18,383
Please, I'm begging you.

792
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,718
Mom.

793
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:23,513
How can you leave
when Mom's like that?

794
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:26,307
Ha-gyeong, I'm not running away.

795
01:01:26,391 --> 01:01:28,351
-I'm going to go make money.
-You are though.

796
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,686
No, I'm not.

797
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:32,980
Take good care of Mom
until I come back, okay?

798
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:37,860
Dad.

799
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,658
Don't ever come back!

800
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,453
A house that only shows
people's backs leaving.

801
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,545
A house that causes insomnia.

802
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:58,214
In this house…

803
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:01,008
memories of cold hands…

804
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:04,178
float around.

805
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:11,978
It's okay.

806
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,356
This house is a place

807
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,900
where people come and go.

808
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:20,445
That's…

809
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,364
That's the kind of house it is.

810
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:39,589
Just…

811
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:44,552
You looked so cold.

812
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,475
And it's summer.

813
01:02:51,851 --> 01:02:52,935
What do you mean?

814
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:57,857
I know.

815
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:00,443
That's…

816
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:04,822
what you're saying right now.

817
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:53,704
Yoon So-hee?

818
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:56,332
Architect Baek Do-ha's official partner.

819
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:00,419
An architect with skills, looks, speech.
That's not common.

820
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:01,671
What can you do about it?

821
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:04,090
Would you have done this
if it were So-hee?

822
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:06,050
Go where you belong.

823
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:09,762
Song Ha-gyeong, do you really want me
to disappear from your life?

824
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,557
You didn't answer over 20 calls?

825
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,350
If I don't answer, you should know.

826
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:17,061
Why do you become an 18-year-old
when you're with me?

827
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:19,939
Don't make that face
like you're about to cry.

828
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:21,858
-Are you done talking?
-No.

829
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:25,152
There's more.
I'm so embarrassed because of you!

830
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:27,864
Did you come to tease me?

831
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:31,367
I think I have feelings for you.

832
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,660
Let's date.
