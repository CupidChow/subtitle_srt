00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,497
-Take that out.
-Good.

4
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,333
-Great job.
-I made it. Applause.

5
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,251
Little kiss.

6
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,004
I don't get them.

7
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:47,547
There you go.

8
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,715
Me too.

9
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,341
Take that.

10
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,385
Hey!

11
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,720
It's twisted. Bring it back.

12
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,306
-Do you want to get in trouble?
-Wow!

13
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,059
Play with your toy, not this.

14
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,977
<i>When you get to the final stage,</i>

15
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,063
<i>you have to make a choice.</i>

16
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,774
<i>Just like in this situation.</i>

17
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,317
Here.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,651
<i>There are two paths.</i>

19
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,570
<i>Will you undo it…</i>

20
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,531
<i>or just push through it?</i>

21
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:18,244
Hey, just undo it and start over,
like I did.

22
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,790
I don't need to.
It'll somehow get done.

23
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,208
<i>At the final moment of choice,</i>

24
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,336
<i>I twisted my own path.</i>

25
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,130
<i>No, let me correct that.</i>

26
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,883
<i>I went my own way.</i>

27
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,011
Hey, is this okay?

28
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,221
It has six fingers.

29
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,892
That's my daughter.

30
00:01:42,143 --> 00:01:44,562
A little twist in life can bring you luck.

31
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,024
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>Once it's twisted, I twist it even more.</i>

32
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,488
Hey, look.

33
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,616
This may look like a normal glove…

34
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,161
but it has an extra finger.

35
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,497
Hey, what the heck?

36
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,541
When did you take that?

37
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,459
<i>That's clearly Ha-gyeong's glove.</i>

38
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,837
What?

39
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,755
You know nothing about me.

40
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:14,509
<i>You knew you screwed up,</i>
<i>but you still got it done somehow.</i>

41
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:15,885
I didn't screw up.

42
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:19,305
<i>That's the day</i>
<i>the Song Ha-gyeong glove came about.</i>

43
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,431

44
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,227
Oh, this?

45
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,147
You said you couldn't stand
the sight of it, so…

46
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,190
You!

00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,110

00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,362
<i>In my 29 years of life…</i>

38 DAYS AGO

50
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,740
<i>…I've filed two lawsuits.</i>

53
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,623
<i>After some dramatic career shifts…</i>

54
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:49,210
Hello.

55
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,924
<i>…I got a boyfriend two weeks ago.</i>

56
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:58,803
<i>And now,</i>

57
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,055
<i>I'm being kidnapped.</i>

58
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,391
Are we going to Busan?

59
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,393
Shall we?
You like the noodles there, right?

60
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,106
Why don't we have some soju with clams
in Mokpo, while we're at it?

61
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,942
Sounds good. And for you…

62
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,613
I'll even throw in some yogurt
if you like.

63
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,698
No, it's just a scratch.

64
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,952
Actually, let's have potato liquor
in Pyeongchang.

65
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,495
I've always wanted to try that.

66
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,956
Really? Sounds good to me.

67
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,416
Then we're staying overnight.

68
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,334
Right?

69
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,211
Stop the car or I'll call the cops.

70
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,845
You seem to be doing all right.

71
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,932
Mr. Jeon is dog-sitting Su-bak,
so don't worry about anything.

72
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,642
Keep your guest company.

73
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,770
Let's have a blast today.

74
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,737
Hey. Tell me where we're going!

75
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,708
What are you doing?

76
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:25,181
The sea is so beautiful.

77
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,394
I need to call my boyfriend.
Can I borrow your phone?

78
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,895
The sky's pretty too.

79
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,357
I need to tell my boyfriend to pick me up
since a psycho kidnapped me.

80
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:38,278
You see that lighthouse?
Let's go there and eat some octopus.

81
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,115
If you leave me out, we'll go to Namhae.

82
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,120
You act like I'm invisible,
so I'm letting you know I'm here.

83
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,164
Let's stay together tonight.

84
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,919
If you twist it, I will too.
It's you and me.

85
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,673
It looks like you're doing what you can.

86
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,925
I need to do everything I can, too.

87
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,853
Excuse me, ma'am.
Could I borrow your phone?

88
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:12,854
What for?

89
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:15,273
I'm in a rush. I'll make one quick call.

90
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,692
-What is it about?
-I'm--

91
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,740
All twisted up. Twisted donut.

92
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,749
This donut is perfect for us.

93
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,334
Do-ha.

94
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,211
My hair is starting to turn gray…

95
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,797
ever since you showed up.

96
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,468
I pulled out two gray hairs,
and I'm only 29.

97
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,806
Just leave me alone.
You're being obsessive.

98
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:51,559
Unbelievable.

99
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,729
So I'm a guest, a guy from the past,
and obsessive now?

100
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:56,814
Fine.

101
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,192
We might as well make more nicknames.

102
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,235
What?

103
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,075
What do you call me now?

104
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:11,829
Let's go eat octopus.

105
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:15,792
What a nice day.

106
00:06:25,843 --> 00:06:26,677
Hey, Baek Do-ha.

107
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,347
Do you think one night's enough
to hear me out?

108
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,185
Excuse me, ma'am. Can we have one soju?

109
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:37,105
-Actually, make it ten, please.
-Sure.

110
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,981
You can't drink, you're on meds.

111
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,274
We'll just have yogurt…

112
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:44,403
-Ten bottles of soju, please.
-Geez.

113
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,243
You could've ordered one at a time.

114
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:52,912
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

115
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:57,625
This wound is no big deal.

116
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,003
Hey, you…

117
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,589
Are you insane?

118
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:08,010
To deal with a crazy guy,
I have to be crazy too, right?

119
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,514
Hey, you…

120
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,103
Unbelievable.

121
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,856
Let's settle this once and for all today.

122
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,777
It might be tough to hear what I feel.
Since I see you're trying, I'll tell you.

123
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,118
Come on.

124
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,997
I'll say it this once.

125
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:37,999
Listen carefully.

126
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,549
Hey, you…

127
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,345
Listen really carefully.

128
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,476
Fine.

129
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:58,853
I…

130
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,941
actually…

131
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,820
I never thought you'd say that.

132
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,197
Had you told me sooner…

133
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,033
it would've made my decision easier.

134
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,702
<i>Out of nowhere? What's this about?</i>

135
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,204
I'll think about what you said.

136
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,957
-<i>What did I say?</i>
-You have a point.

137
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,708
I think I might've overreacted.

138
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:03,751
<i>Overreacted?</i>

139
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,546
I'll give you a week, like you said.

140
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,881
I'm mature enough for that.

141
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,091
<i>A week for what?</i>

142
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,636
<i>I'm going crazy.</i>

143
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:16,931
Don't act like you don't know.
I recorded what you said at the end.

144
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,850
Recorded? What did you record?

145
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,812
What did I tell you?

146
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,030
Hey, Baek Do-ha.

147
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,115
Ms. Song.

148
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:38,661
Attorney Seo.

149
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,670
When did you get here?

150
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:48,921
I brought your phone.

151
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:50,840
Oh, right.

152
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,182
Get in.

153
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,634
How's your arm?

154
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,595
Not bad.

155
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:42,183
I wanted to chase after you
like back in the day,

156
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:46,228
but to behave like an adult,
I played tennis instead.

157
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:53,944
Today, Mr. Baek, who likes you,
kidnapped you right before my eyes.

158
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:57,073
There's no way nothing happened.

159
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:57,990
I…

160
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,368
blacked out.

161
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,121
I did.

162
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,084
As you saw this morning,

163
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,336
Baek Do-ha dragged me to the west coast.

164
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:14,507
I had some octopus,
and since I was so upset and baffled,

165
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,384
I drank a little too.

166
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,261
-You called me too.
-Sorry?

167
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,014
-Attorney Seo.
-Hey.

168
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,809
Attorney Seo!

169
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,060
ATTORNEY SEO SU-HYEOK

170
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:28,896
I want to go home.

171
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,402
My goodness. I'm so sorry.

172
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,489
Did I cross your mind today?

173
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,574
What?

174
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:44,620
Did you wish I were there
to eat that octopus with you?

175
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:49,250
Or did you wish we saw
the beautiful sea together?

176
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,755
Shall we go to the east coast?

177
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,341
-What?
-But…

178
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,511
I have a big meeting tomorrow morning,

179
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,013
and I'm worried about you.

180
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,018
As mature adults, we should go home.

181
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:14,275
Right.

182
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,026
Where your kidnapper is.

183
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,246
Here's the thing.

184
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,958
Why hasn't Mr. Baek made a single call?

185
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,712
Your phone should be blowing up.

186
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,175
Probably because…

187
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,554
he knows you're coming back home.

188
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:01,989
Attorney Seo.

189
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,368
Is this for me?

190
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,037
Help yourself.

191
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,167
Were you always like this?

192
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,504
I know. I'm just as surprised.

193
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,381
Feeling all right?

194
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,468
All good.

195
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:23,969
And memory?

196
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,432
Not yet.

197
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,451
Are you sure?

198
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:50,287
Yes.

199
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,164
You really want to…

200
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,124
drop me as your lawyer?

201
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,793
Yes.

202
00:13:56,794 --> 00:14:00,548
Thanks to you,
I could see my problem clearly.

203
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:07,513
It was wrong of me to hire you
to drag things out through summer.

204
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:11,141
Even one-on-one wouldn't have been enough.

205
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,145
From now on, it's just her and me.

206
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,648
This was our game from the start.

207
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:20,359
But in that game…

208
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,153
Ha-gyeong chose me.

209
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,280
Exactly.

210
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:25,948
That's why…

211
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,909
I think I'll keep breaking the rules.

212
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,995
Because…

213
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,456
you're such a good guy.

214
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,792
I can't help feeling desperate.

215
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,797
That's why I can't act like an adult.

216
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,758
When it's about Ha-gyeong…

217
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,219
I won't play fair.

218
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,105
Is it possible

219
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,691
to adjust the height?

220
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,985
It might hit the knees in a wheelchair.

221
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:07,072
There's an additional fee
for switching tables.

222
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,366
-Is that okay?
-Well, yes.

223
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:15,581
And there are no bumps on the way
to the reception,

224
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,082
bathroom, and elevator,

225
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,418
that would get in the way
of a wheelchair, right?

226
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:22,338
I'll check that for you.
Please give me a second.

227
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,255
Sure.

228
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,593
You said he didn't propose that day.

229
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,553
Song! Don't jinx it.

230
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,264
So you didn't see him that day?

231
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,894
His mom called.
They've got a primary doctor now.

232
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,481
While he's at his parents' place,

233
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,067
I'll do whatever I can on my own.

234
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,527
Ms. Lee.

235
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,655
-Yes?
-Once you confirm the booking,

236
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,866
we can install a ramp
that fits the height.

237
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:54,703
And this is
the additional charge breakdown

238
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,288
reflecting your requests.

239
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,709
The deposit is five percent,
five million won upfront.

240
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,419
Do you want to proceed?

241
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,345
CHICKEN FEET

242
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,097
The venue fee is ridiculous.

243
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:15,808
Should I have given in to temptation?

244
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,602
No, Lee Seul. Get a grip.

245
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,772
Don't give in to temptation.
I decided to start fresh.

246
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:24,483
Start fresh?

247
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,819
I'm done trying to keep everyone happy.

248
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:31,699
I'm going head-to-head with Grandpa
and setting things straight.

249
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,493
Gosh, whatever.

250
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,745
Let's get hammered!

251
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:38,580
Let's get hammered!

252
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,426
Wait, what's going on here?

253
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,888
What is it this time?

254
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,349
Remember that time when I blacked out?

255
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,185
When you sued the sharp guy?

256
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,855
When you quit med school?

257
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,315
What did I get myself into?

258
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,359
You called Director Jeon

259
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:11,447
and listed a hundred reasons
why you dumped him.

260
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,700
After you saw
the civil service exam schedule,

261
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,785
you dropped out,
instead of taking a year off.

262
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,581
-What did I end up doing yesterday?
-You blacked out?

263
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,960
Why did you drink that much?

264
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,629
To hide it.

265
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,508
-Hide what?
-My feelings.

266
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,822
Sir. Wait, sir.

267
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,282
Where are you headed?

268
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,700
Can you take me with you?

269
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,078
I need to get away from that jerk.

270
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,622
-She's always like this.
-Sir.

271
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:04,374
-Sir, where are you headed?
-Where do you want to go?

272
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,834
To Patan.

273
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,294
Thank you.

274
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,257
You remember something?

275
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:15,928
What on earth happened yesterday?

276
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,597
Hey, Baek Do-ha.

277
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,057
Hey!

278
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,475
I must be crazy.

279
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:26,814
You and your drunk talk.

280
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,442
When you crashed at my place
because of Do-ha…

281
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,904
you said this to me while you were drunk.

282
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,405
Even if I go back…

283
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,284
I'll be all alone again.

284
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,750
He said he recorded what I said.

285
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,586
I just can't remember it at all.

286
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,797
He recorded something?

287
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,634
Gosh!

288
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:12,985
<i>First, get a hold of his phone.</i>

289
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,570
<i>You need to know before you act.</i>

290
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,489
<i>It could turn out to be nothing.</i>

291
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,366
What a bummer.

292
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,245
I'm missing the key ingredients.
Such a bummer.

293
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,670
Are you making khow suey?

294
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,506
This is really bad.

295
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:38,594
Without the sauce,
the dish won't turn out right.

296
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,471
There's no aji amarillo sauce.

297
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,389
Exactly.

298
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,185
We'll need to go to Cheontan Food Market.

299
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,895
It's a 40-minute drive.

300
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,480
Since you have a car, could you help me?

301
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,317
Cheontan Food Market?

302
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:58,530
Thanks.

303
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,120
Be quiet.

304
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,627
ALL RECORDINGS

305
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,462
Here.

306
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:17,466
We've got harissa, sambal,
piri piri, everything.

307
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:20,177
Wait. My phone is gone.

308
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,347
Oh, here's your phone.

309
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,599
-There it is.
-He tried to lick it.

310
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:26,516
Hey! Song Su-bak!

311
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,186
I told you not to, didn't I?

312
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,781
<i>I'll make sujebi.</i>
<i>Prepare the broth and dough.</i>

313
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,991
<i>Mix the flour and water equally.</i>

314
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,956
I'm done cutting. I'm beat.

315
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,751
Where are the plates?

316
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,628
Plates…

317
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,341
Plates are in the back…

318
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,181
The floor is very slippery.

319
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,309
It must be really clean.

320
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,610
CIVIL SERVANT ASSAULTED

321
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,654
Complaints have been up lately.

322
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,198
But have you seen a site
with no complaints?

323
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:24,783
Sir!

324
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,619
Can you take a look
at the pipe connection?

325
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,620
All right!

326
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,707
I heard Ms. Song wasn't hurt that badly.

327
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,293
It's just an accident.

328
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:46,972
Hey, Baek Do-ha.

329
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,683
I'll think about us as well.

330
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,310
I never thought you'd say that.

331
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,023
<i>But, Do-ha,</i>

332
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,566
I need some time.

333
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:01,069
As you know,
I'm seeing Mr. Seo Su-hyeok.

334
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,408
One week.
Give me one week.

335
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,410
I'll give you a week, like you said.

336
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,121
I'm mature enough for that.

337
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:12,873
Cheers.

338
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,374
No way.

339
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,592
So annoying. I can't get anything done.

340
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,927
I can't…

341
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:27,929
<i>Can't stop thinking about Do-ha?</i>

342
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,683
Gosh, this is crazy.

343
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:33,268
<i>Song.</i>

344
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,687
<i>There's no other way.</i>

345
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,532
You're back.

346
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,079
Today, they had a <i>Chobok</i> celebration.

347
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,998
The women's group president brought these.

348
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,835
To top it off, some makgeolli.

349
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,423
So? How about a drink?

350
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,844
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

351
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,896
We've never done a proper drink like this
as adults, have we?

352
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,397
Tell me about it.

353
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:22,067
You were the only one drinking
the night you blacked out.

354
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,404
That day, I was in a really fragile state.

355
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,156
I'd taken some medicine too.

356
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,993
I've been drinking
with village heads and elders

357
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,037
in Patan for ten years.

358
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,415
I've been drinking

359
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:40,502
with site managers and workers
for ten years.

360
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,299
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

361
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,389
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

362
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,736
Oh, my, we're out of ice.

363
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:08,280
I'll go grab some.

364
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:09,781
Yeah.

365
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:17,914
He can drink a lot.

366
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,169
Song Ha-gyeong, get it together.

367
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,840
I'm the kind of person
who always has to win.

368
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,928
I'm not losing like this.

369
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,814
Farewell, Baek Do-ha.

370
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,197
It's home-made pine-needle liquor
Chief Jo's wanted.

371
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,950
It's been aging for ten years,
and it's over 35%.

372
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,416
Why do you want me drunk?

373
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:03,919
What do you mean?

374
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,881
-What?
-Are you that curious? A week?

375
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:10,842
No, it's just…

376
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,181
Go ahead and listen.

377
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,933
You can delete it if you want.

378
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,895
I just wanted to prove
I can hold my liquor

379
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,355
better than you do.

380
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,441
Even if we go on like this,
we'll still be sober all night.

381
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:30,028
How about a quick game?
Loser has to drink?

382
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,905
<i>Nice.</i>

383
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,198
<i>I'm good at games.</i>

384
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:34,532
Sure.

385
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,869
I'll get a board game from the basement.

386
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,246
No need. We've got a game.

387
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,623
The Song Ha-gyeong game.

388
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,250
It's called…

389
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,335
the "Lie Game."

390
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,302
-No.
-Why not? You're good at this.

391
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,263
Whoever tells the truth drinks.

392
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,933
Song Ha-gyeong language.
Speak the opposite. That's your forte.

393
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,019
Scared of losing?

394
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,273
Fine, never mind.

395
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,236
Let's do it!

396
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,320
Okay.

397
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:27,502
When you said
you'd redo the entire design…

398
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,212
I hate to admit it…

399
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:31,840
but it was pretty cool.

400
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,430
When I first saw you
in your work clothes…

401
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,598
you looked awful.

402
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:43,268
You looked ugly…

403
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:45,645
and annoying.

404
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,778
To be honest,
whenever you ran in the morning…

405
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,700
you looked pretty sexy.

406
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,791
Now that we live together,

407
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,918
I can't handle your bare face.

408
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,255
When I see you,
no butterflies, no excitement.

409
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:14,966
So it's not hard.

410
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:19,846
What the…

411
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,182
Was that a lie, or what?

412
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,310
I've always felt bad…

413
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,731
about leaving because you said so
two years ago.

414
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:32,901
I've always…

415
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,571
wanted to say sorry for that.

416
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:42,869
Fine.

417
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,081
I expected it from you, you jerk.

418
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,249
I know you don't feel sorry.

419
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,053
And…

420
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,978
I've liked you all along.

421
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,857
And I still do.

422
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:25,203
Hey. What was that? Why did you drink?

423
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:28,665
We're playing the Lie Game.

424
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:31,626
I like you.

425
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,046
I always have and I still do.

426
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,217
I've never not liked you.

427
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,820
Song Ha-gyeong.

428
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,241
I like you.

429
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,657
<i>The cicadas were so loud,</i>

430
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,993
<i>so I'm sure he couldn't hear it.</i>

431
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,631
PACHEON CITY HALL

432
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,648
I like you.

433
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,882
How many times will you count?

434
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:44,968
It has to be accurate.

435
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:48,721
Chiefs.

436
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,474
-Hey, Dr. Song.
-Hi, there.

437
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,689
What brings you here?

438
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,572
-Sir.
-Sir. Here.

439
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,906
-He's finally here.
-What?

440
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,951
Oh, man. His legs are giving out on him.

441
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:12,620
Take a seat.

442
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,080
Gosh.

443
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:18,835
Unbelievable.

444
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,379
There's no need to count them.

445
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:23,882
Just right.

446
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:26,509
What is going on? What's this mix?

447
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,562
CONSENT FORM
PATAN-MYEON FENCE REMOVAL PROJECT

448
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,613
CHA JEONG-SUK

449
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,993
So what happened was…

450
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,376
This will collect moisture,
damaging the stone fence.

451
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,463
Over the past few days,
I've seen the north-facing stone fences

452
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,256
have cracks from the eroding ground.

453
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,967
Didn't you see it
when it poured last time?

454
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,719
The stone fences aren't the problem.

455
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,512
This is basically a wall.

456
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,891
Good thing Dr. Song fixed the drainage.
Or it wouldn't have lasted.

457
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,851
-Right?
-Yes.

458
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:17,936
It's thanks to her.

459
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,063
So this outer stone-fence problem…

460
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,149
had nothing to do
with the drainage system.

461
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,281
Wait, these accidents

462
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:33,034
aren't necessarily
because of illegal parking.

463
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,078
The accidents happened on the same side.

464
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:38,873
If this were only half as tall,
accidents would be cut in half.

465
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,543
Ae-jeong had an accident here too.

466
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,047
-Sorry?
-Dr. Song made a huge fuss

467
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,925
after her mom's accident,
but she still couldn't take it down.

468
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:53,221
<i>Looks like Master Baek has a good eye.</i>

469
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,390
<i>He seemed to know everyone.</i>

470
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,850
<i>He could spot every house</i>
<i>that didn't submit the form.</i>

471
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,686
So, now we need to go down there…

472
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,854
Is it okay if I go now?

473
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:03,690
Wait, what are you talking about?

474
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,152
Darn it.

475
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:12,532
<i>He went door to door</i>
<i>getting consent forms.</i>

476
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,701
One sack, it's the last one!

477
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:16,953
Good work.

478
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,872
Wait. Sign the consent form.

479
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:23,501
<i>On top of that,</i>
<i>he pushed people to reach their quotas.</i>

480
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:26,504
-Stop shaking.
-I can't stop shaking.

481
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:32,927
Is Ha-gyeong's dream project
finally accomplished?

482
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:38,391
Your mom even created a team
to improve the village.

483
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,308
Right?

484
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:45,648
Finally, we're free.

485
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:48,651
Still, for us,

486
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,821
there's no one like Dr. Song.
Dr. Song is the best.

487
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,909
-Let's have a drink.
-All right.

488
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:57,869
This isn't beer.

489
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,705
Have a seat, Dr. Song.

490
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,598
I wiped off the oil from the hinge

491
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,641
to make it rusty again.

492
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:22,977
Pretty good, right?

493
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,063
So the whole time,

494
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,566
all that rambling about Master Baek
was for consent forms?

495
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,695
Well, kind of.

496
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,283
You know I have a good memory.

497
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,327
Being in Patan

498
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,788
made me remember your complaint.

499
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:47,502
"This stone fence
took away the only time

500
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,545
<i>I could hold my mom's hand."</i>

501
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:50,505
You hungry?

502
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,090
How about some tteokbokki?

503
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,050
<i>"This stone fence</i>

504
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,803
<i>took away the only time</i>

505
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,013
<i>I could hold my mom's hand."</i>

506
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,685
Oh, no.

507
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,562
Are you hurt?

508
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,365
"If we tear down
the roadside stone fences,

509
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:20,243
the road widens,
and if the road widens,

510
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,912
the town will flourish."
Add a line like that.

511
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:24,705
All done.

512
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,488
Who's fixing who?

513
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,700
You're always right.

514
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,745
The shoe rack, and the fences.

515
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,498
You're right about everything.

516
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:12,587
The architect's ideas and theories…

517
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,299
were just pretentious. I'll admit it.

518
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,470
The reason you don't eat in Patan

519
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,473
is because you remember it everywhere.

520
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,728
I just want you to know…

521
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,773
that your past isn't filled with pain…

522
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,239
and you don't have to throw
everything away.

523
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,076
I wanted to let you know that.

524
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:03,012
<i>Are the cicadas louder…</i>

525
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,724
<i>or is my heartbeat louder?</i>

526
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,313
<i>Let's ignore it for now.</i>

527
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,446
Goseong Group's inheritance dispute,

528
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,532
it's massive
in terms of media attention and scale.

529
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:27,578
This case could significantly affect
the group's overall image.

530
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:29,956
Attorney Seo, take this.

531
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:34,126
Sure, I'll contact
Goseong Group's legal team--

532
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,586
I mean, Attorney Seo Su-hyeok.

533
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,257
Na-hyeon.

534
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,011
Ms. Seo.

535
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:48,307
Next. A consultant
for Jeju Special Law revision.

536
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,852
Who wants to go?
Just kill time for three days.

537
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,646
Babble on the topic all day,

538
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:56,357
then butter up the politicians
over booze at night.

539
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:57,775
Nice and clean.

540
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:03,990
I'll go.

541
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,203
Instead of the inheritance one,
I'll take the Jeju one.

542
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,383
1:55 P.M.

543
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,677
2 P.M.
BUDGET MEETING WITH PLUTO ATELIER

544
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,070
Let's go.

545
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:44,613
Okay.

546
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,537
As for what you mentioned before,
this material might work better.

547
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,747
Right?

548
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,585
Ms. Song?

549
00:38:59,128 --> 00:38:59,962
What?

550
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,470
Oh, no.

551
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:10,014
The garden bench I made…

552
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,727
Sorry about that.

553
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:23,361
Wasn't this the strategy meeting
before the budget meeting?

554
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:26,530
That's why we were choosing
the best material for the model.

555
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,908
That's right.

556
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:32,995
I said I'd try to make this model
within a week, right?

557
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,164
<i>A week?</i>

558
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:37,500
We talked about it together back then.

559
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,251
<i>Back then?</i>

560
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:42,505
You said back then
there would be budget problems,

561
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,048
so we're here for a status check.

562
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,341
I see.

563
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:49,970
There are…

564
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:51,806
three days left now.

565
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,236
Well…

566
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:09,532
You said earlier
that we'd talked about it together…

567
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,580
ATTORNEY SEO SU-HYEOK

568
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,379
Yes, Attorney Seo.

569
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,631
<i>Ms. Song. Do you have time today?</i>

570
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,512
Today? Well…

571
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,098
I don't really have any plans--

572
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,391
<i>Then come over to my place.</i>

573
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,435
To your place?

574
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:49,488
Hey, Jong-shin.

575
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:52,783
I'm dragging my feet here.

576
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,243
<i>What is it this time?</i>

577
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,662
It's just some annoying stuff going on.

578
00:40:56,745 --> 00:41:00,040
<i>Take it easy.</i>
<i>The site can keep going as usual?</i>

579
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:04,336
Yeah, just lay the concrete for now.
I'm working on the rooftop right now.

580
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,089
<i>-All right. I'll let you get to it.</i>
-Bye.

581
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,563
What?

582
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:24,106
He invited her to his place?

583
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,275
Mr. Baek.

584
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:28,944
Do you still believe in what you said?

585
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:35,034
That a house shows how someone has lived
and how they'll live.

586
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,996
You said
a house reveals the person inside.

587
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,791
I shouldn't have said that.

588
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,606
What are these?

589
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,613
PREMIUM TOILET PAPER

590
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:16,367
I thought I was getting
something premium…

591
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,129
You're here?

592
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,549
You didn't have to.

593
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:33,842
Thank you.

594
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,135
Please come in.

595
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,315
You didn't rent the studio
to have me over, right?

596
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:52,403
I use subscription services a lot
to manage daily essentials.

597
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,406
So, do you see me a little?

598
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:57,908
What do you mean?

599
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,952
In a column Mr. Baek wrote,

600
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:02,871
a home can show
someone's personality, habits,

601
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,123
job, daily routines,

602
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:07,001
whether they're married
and what their partner likes.

603
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:13,132
My girlfriend got me
the five-ply embossed one.

604
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,968
Does that make me a more layered person?

605
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,264
You haven't eaten yet, right?

606
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,729
Do you normally eat like this?

607
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,397
It's like a birthday feast.

608
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,858
It is, actually.

609
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:32,985
Sorry?

610
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,279
This is from my birth mother.

611
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,240
My sister gave me this.

612
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:40,534
Help yourself.

613
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,662
And my mother's good
at making this <i>gosari</i> dish.

614
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,461
You should've told me
that it was your birthday.

615
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,590
If I had known,
I wouldn't have brought that toilet paper.

616
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,925
Then all those gifts piled up
by the door--

617
00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:00,929
No. Those are all bribes
I'd rather not bring inside.

618
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,767
They're for Attorney Seo,
not Seo Su-hyeok.

619
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:09,313
The only gift for me
is that premium toilet paper.

620
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,275
Let's meet tomorrow again.

621
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,111
Tomorrow, I'll give you a proper gift.

622
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,198
Not sure if you heard…

623
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,825
but I'm no longer Attorney Seo.

624
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:27,665
Mr. Baek came by
the day after he kidnapped you

625
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:28,791
to get me off the case.

626
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:32,127
He said he wanted to go
one-on-one with you.

627
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:39,218
Now it's just the two of us,
without the lawsuit,

628
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,470
how does that feel?

629
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:04,576
Su-bak.

630
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,664
Hey, where did you get that?

631
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,876
Hey, hold on. Hey.

632
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,344
<i>I got B minus.</i>

633
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:24,972
<i>Are my grades toast?</i>

634
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,933
I told you to start over, didn't I?

635
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,226
<i>How dare you?</i>

636
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:33,981
Hey.

637
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,732
That was my first laugh of the day.

638
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,777
<i>You made Song Ha-gyeong glove.</i>

639
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:44,366
<i>Let someone hold your hand if you're cold,</i>
<i>instead of wearing some odd glove.</i>

640
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,785
<i>What? My hands aren't cold at all.</i>

641
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,288
<i>It's actually really warm.</i>

642
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,632
So…

643
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,885
have you remembered anything?

644
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,512
Nope.

645
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,347
If you don't remember,

646
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:12,060
why not just ask Mr. Baek
what happened?

647
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:14,354
I don't want to.

648
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:19,985
Is it like the time you didn't ask
whether he'd read the final arguments?

649
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:25,782
Attorney Seo.

650
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,410
Let me tell you a little bit
about my life.

651
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,206
It's more twisted than this.

652
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:37,544
So I'm not sure where to start
and how to sort it out.

653
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:45,010
Then what was the first thing you twisted?

654
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,350
Not sure what that is.

655
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,436
But I know what got most twisted.

656
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,233
My very first confession ever…

657
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,693
didn't go to the person I liked…

658
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,905
but to someone who liked me.

659
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,284
<i>Dāl bhāt.</i>

660
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:11,078
You mean him?

661
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:14,289
Yes.

662
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,256
Attorney Seo.

663
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:27,261
I have a trick I've relied on
whenever things got twisted.

664
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:28,762
Wanna know what it is?

665
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,891
Freezing it in the fridge.

666
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:35,978
This is how.

667
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,773
When my hands are cold,
I freeze everything nearby.

668
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:43,569
That way,
I don't even notice my hands are cold.

669
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,905
And somehow I barely…

670
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,449
-Barely…
-You're barely…

671
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,786
holding on, completely blacked out?

672
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:05,549
I invited you today
because I was feeling childish.

673
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,176
You went to the west coast.

674
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,346
I fought my urge
to take you to the east coast.

675
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,725
I came up with somewhere stronger.

676
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,147
So I bought a wine, which I never do…

677
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:24,067
fixed the light that'd been out for days,

678
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,737
and said I'd go on a business trip.

679
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:30,282
It's along the same lines
as playing tennis.

680
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:35,412
I've been wondering if it's okay
to get involved with you two,

681
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:39,041
and I wanted to really think it through.

682
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:53,138
Are you insane?
Why do you keep grinning?

683
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:58,018
Before moving abroad, have you
tried knitting for a school project?

684
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,854
You know what Ha-gyeong did?

685
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:05,233
She knitted a glove with six fingers.

686
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:06,902
Isn't that funny?

687
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,031
Are you crazy?
Are you all right?

688
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,366
I mean,

689
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:16,203
Ha-gyeong's box is packed
with things like that.

690
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:22,876
That's how she is,

691
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:26,171
but I kept trying to fix what's twisted…

692
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:28,882
which is crazy.

693
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:31,885
So…

694
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:34,179
what I'm saying is,

695
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,390
I'm really sorry, Yoon So-hee…

696
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,728
but give up on me and go back now.

697
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:44,231
You're the only one I can trust.

698
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,192
Go handle the project.

699
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:48,944
Don't waste your time.

700
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,124
When will you talk about Do-young?

701
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,336
What about him?

702
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,631
What he wrote in the email.

703
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,722
You want to see me play the villain?
Care to see my last desperate move?

704
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,891
-That's not who you are.
-You know nothing.

705
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:22,978
Should I show you
how much of a villain I am?

706
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,522
-Hey.
-I'll call Song Ha-gyeong.

707
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:30,152
You know she keeps checking
my social media?

708
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:33,363
She's liked and unliked my posts
so many times.

709
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,285
What? Why?

710
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:41,455
Do you have to ask?
To see you, obviously.

711
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,082
To see how you're doing,
pictures of you.

712
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,792
She knew about me all along.

713
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,421
You like someone like her?

714
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:51,715
Yes.

715
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,678
-She's transparent.
-No, she's not. She's devious.

716
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,557
No. She's transparent.

717
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:07,689
You're insane.

718
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,983
You're nuts. Get lost.

719
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,487
-Happy?
-The moon is out.

720
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,242
So cute.

721
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,078
I love it.

722
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,379
Just get lost.

723
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,011
I can't get into my own house.

724
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:47,062
So, Ms. Song.
Find that lost memory.

725
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:51,233
If you track down that memory,
you'll see your feelings.

726
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,694
There, you'll find the answer about us.

727
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,446
When I come back…

728
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:58,740
let's talk about it.

729
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,165
<i>Following the broken film of my memories,</i>

730
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:09,876
<i>I only confirmed them.</i>

731
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,547
<i>That racing heart.</i>

732
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,384
<i>The feelings I'd felt every summer.</i>

733
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:23,306
<i>The feelings I shut away</i>
<i>because of guilt.</i>

734
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:28,854
It won't work, right?

735
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,148
I don't think so.

736
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,191
-Right?
-Yes.

737
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:44,870
You said a week would do.

738
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,038
What?

739
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,832
<i>One week is enough.</i>

740
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,543
<i>The recording's going well, right?</i>

741
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:55,213
You promised that you'd find a way
to secure that budget.

742
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,842
<i>I'll even reallocate the budget</i>
<i>to get all the money.</i>

743
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,302
Oh, no.

744
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:02,429
That's why we decided
not to go with marble

745
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,638
and use tiles throughout.

746
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:06,766
This.

747
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:09,060
This.

748
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,696
One week is enough.

749
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,325
The recording's going well, right?

750
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:29,039
Do you know who I am?
I'm Dr. Song of Patan.

751
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,082
You know what?

752
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,877
I'll step up and support you.

753
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:37,923
I'll even reallocate the budget
to get all the money.

754
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,800
Director Baek.

755
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,218
I'll act as the liaison

756
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:45,764
with the residents
to make things easier for you.

757
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,141
So please,

758
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:53,605
don't go overboard, trying to use
only premium materials throughout.

759
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:58,693
Promise.

760
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,285
Copy.

761
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,204
Come on, signature.

762
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:14,793
Okay.

763
00:54:16,544 --> 00:54:17,921
<i>Darn it.</i>

764
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:19,047
What do I do?

765
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,840
<i>What have I been doing for a week?</i>

766
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,012
Sir, I'll count on you.

767
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:27,681
-Sure, bye.
-Bye.

768
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,608
Director Baek?

769
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:41,569
Ms. Song.

770
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,862
Yes?

771
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,823
This is the equipment materials
change form.

772
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:46,658
You didn't get it approved?

773
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,994
It's due today, so I came to get it.

774
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:50,453
But he already left.

775
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,998
Without this,
we can't install the electricity tomorrow.

776
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:55,875
Oh, no. This is bad.

777
00:54:58,795 --> 00:54:59,796
What do we do?

778
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,393
Ms. Song.

779
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,729
Hi.

780
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:19,482
Wait, Hyun.

781
00:55:21,067 --> 00:55:23,737
The director is in a meeting,
but it's almost over.

782
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,238
You can see him in a bit.

783
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:27,282
No, I'm a little busy now.

784
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,284
Could you pass this along for me?

785
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:30,952
-Sure.
-Thank you.

786
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:32,662
Song.

787
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,289
Seung-taek.

788
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:40,045
What's going on?
Is Do-ha building your newlywed home?

789
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,631
Seul and I visited the wedding hall.

790
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:46,551
Oh.

791
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:48,261
Are you two keeping that a secret?

792
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,266
I was thinking
how long you'd just keep dating.

793
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:54,601
What about you?

794
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,895
How long will this go on with Do-ha?

795
00:55:58,521 --> 00:55:59,981
That's an unexpected question.

796
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:04,069
Song Ha-gyeong.
Let me stick my nose in just this once.

797
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,445
Listen, this may be the last.

798
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:16,414
<i>If you keep pushing him away,</i>
<i>you think he'll keep chasing you?</i>

799
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:21,419
He's only like that with you.
He only opens up to you.

800
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,422
Don't let those moments

801
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:26,674
just slip by.

802
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:40,647
Hi, Attorney Seo.

803
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,150
Did you arrive safely?

804
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,570
I'm free now. I'm actually in Seoul.

805
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:52,158
Sure, I'll be right there. See you soon.

806
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,251
Hello?

807
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:10,969
Where's Director Baek?

808
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,763
Did he get hurt a lot? How bad?

809
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:17,517
We did some first aid,
but the bleeding didn't stop.

810
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,477
-So he went home.
-I see.

811
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,409
Baek Do-ha!

812
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,505
Where did he go?

813
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,344
Where are you?

814
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,846
<i>Me? I'm home.</i>

815
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:57,515
Home? Where exactly?

816
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:08,693
What's wrong?

817
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:12,447
I heard you got hurt. Is it bad?

818
00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:17,452
You mean this?

819
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:24,334
I can't believe Ms. Song
came running here.

820
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,171
I called to ask for more time.

821
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:34,969
Hey!

822
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,766
You heard I got hurt and came running?

823
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,582
This is why I like you.

824
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,284
Hey, Baek Do-ha.

825
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:46,416
Why do you keep hovering around me?

826
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,168
So, you don't like it?

827
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,553
Even so…

828
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:02,307
you understand Song Ha-gyeong language.

829
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:06,811
I hate you.

830
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:09,981
You know that, right?

831
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:14,569
So just go.

832
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,114
Okay?

833
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,745
Are you really leaving?

834
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:26,331
No.

835
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,292
I won't go.

836
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:35,715
Don't go.

837
01:00:41,554 --> 01:00:42,555
Don't go.

838
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:49,562
I won't.

839
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:33,606
<i>Looks like we won't be sleeping tonight.</i>

840
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,066
-Hey.
-Can't do that.

841
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:36,526
Stop it.

842
01:01:36,609 --> 01:01:39,112
<i>I still hate him, but I like him.</i>

843
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,197
<i>Baek Do-ha, I like you.</i>

844
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,366
<i>I'm going to hold your hand.</i>

845
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,993
Have you eaten?
If it's okay, why don't we--

846
01:01:46,077 --> 01:01:47,495
-I'm at the east coast.
<i>-What?</i>

847
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:49,747
We somehow made it to the east coast.

848
01:01:49,831 --> 01:01:52,375
-Go with this.
-Stop the construction.

849
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,043
What is this all of a sudden?

850
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:55,503
<i>It wasn't me who said stop.</i>

851
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:56,587
<i>What's wrong?</i>

852
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,881
<i>Maybe if we stay close,</i>

853
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,259
<i>we'll end up seeing things</i>
<i>we didn't want to see.</i>

854
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:06,431
<i>How many more</i>
<i>of the summer secrets are still left?</i>

855
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:09,142
<i>I need to go to the States for a bit.</i>
