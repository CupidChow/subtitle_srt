1
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:39,831
BUT JOHN GREW WEAKER
FROM A MYSTERIOUS ILLNESS.

2
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,292
EVEN THE TREE COULDN'T HEAL JOHN.

3
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,127
JOHN AND HIS TREE

4
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,298
ONE MORNING, JOHN'S ILLNESS WAS GONE.

5
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,258
THE TREE COLLAPSED,
AND ITS ROOTS LAID BARE

6
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:00,060
JOHN WAS SCARED
THE TREE WOULD NEVER TAKE ROOT AGAIN

7
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:03,396
<i>Every tale has its backstory</i>

8
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,441
<i>hidden until the last page.</i>

9
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,907
<i>Sometimes you close the book</i>
<i>'cause you'd rather not know.</i>

10
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,202
<i>How many backstories</i>

11
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,121
<i>have I created that way?</i>

12
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,582
If you know, leave.

13
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:32,884
<i>The doors I closed…</i>

14
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,348
<i>the pages I never opened…</i>

15
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,314
<i>and the cracks I never peeked through.</i>

16
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,159
<i>How many more</i>

17
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,580
<i>of the summer secrets are still left?</i>

18
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:10,463
Yeah, that one.

19
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,094
Let's go with this.

20
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,263
There's enough time, right?

21
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,520
Oh, no. You worked hard.

22
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,150
Because of that.

23
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,113
That's a 30-degree blade.
We use it when making models.

24
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,740
Mr. Baek was cut from it yesterday.

25
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,661
It delayed the schedule by a day,

26
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,122
but I'm glad you like it.

27
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:48,001
Right. I owe this blade one.

28
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,922
It stirred something deep inside me.

29
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,929
Ms. Song stopped by earlier.

30
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:01,723
We confirmed the materials.

31
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,099
-Really?
-Yes.

32
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,436
That's why I didn't see her this morning.

33
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,439
-Okay, got it.
-All right.

34
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:12,817
She stopped by?

35
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,694
Is that so?

36
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,411
-<i>Yes.</i>
-Hey.

37
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,329
Well…

38
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,123
Have you eaten?

39
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,959
-I'm going to.
<i>-Oh, really?</i>

40
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,171
I'm almost done too.
Why don't we--

41
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,422
I'm on the east coast.

42
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,341
-East coast?
-<i>Yes.</i>

43
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,508
Talk to you later.

44
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,093
EAST COAST SASHIMI

45
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,949
We finally made it to the east coast.

46
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,618
It's pretty symbolic.

47
00:04:06,704 --> 00:04:08,873
I don't feel like eating that.

48
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,917
CHOPPED OCTOPUS

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,585
Me neither.

50
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:14,712
So, how about…

51
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,714
boiled octopus?

52
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,632
Sounds good.

53
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:21,386
We'll have boiled octopus. Soju or beer?

54
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,221
It's gonna be a dry week.

55
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,391
Ma'am, could I get some yogurt?

56
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,308
Sure.

57
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,770
I was stood up for two hours yesterday.

58
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,817
My feet just had a mind of their own,

59
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,318
not following my brain.

60
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,029
They didn't obey their master.

61
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,198
They went to Mr. Baek?

62
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,707
I'll get straight to the point
since it's between you and me.

63
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,631
We should break up.

64
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:05,972
You got your memory back.

65
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:07,932
Yes.

66
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,313
Since when did you start
listening to me?

67
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,356
You're so direct and blunt.

68
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:17,567
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,736
I wanted a grown-up romance.

70
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:23,573
So I made the first move,
and the second I did,

71
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,867
we jumped straight to the ending.

72
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,535
We skipped the buildup or twist.

73
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,289
There were so many things

74
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,500
I wanted to do when I got a girlfriend.

75
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:49,599
Like what?

76
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,479
Would you do it for me one last time?

77
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,238
You wanted to do this…

78
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,577
one last time?

79
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:17,460
Going to a theme park with my girlfriend.
It's a classic date.

80
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:22,924
And…

81
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,263
Did you invite your friend
and his girlfriend?

82
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,725
There he is.

83
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,113
You call this a double date?

84
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,614
In our own way.

85
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:51,410
The kidnapper, the ex-boyfriend,
and Ms. A's date.

86
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,787
I'm very excited.

87
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,205
Let's go.

88
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,542
All right. Let's go.

89
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,175
I'll go first.

90
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:07,844
Just follow me.

91
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,432
It's a real ghost!

92
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,474
A real ghost!

93
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,434
For real!

94
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,145
Hey! Attorney Seo!

95
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,855
Attorney Seo!

96
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,700
Why do I keep missing?

97
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,160
Oh, bummer.

98
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,915
I haven't held a gun since the military.

99
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,820
You know you've spent over 50,000 won?

100
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:17,663
PERFECT VICTORY

101
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,375
-Deal?
-Deal!

102
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:35,890
Attorney Seo. He's really good at this.

103
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,225
You'd better give up.

104
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,267
Looks like I'm better.

105
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:41,771
KNOCKDOWN

106
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,776
So? You up for a match?

107
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,863
Take that!

108
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,743
No, block it! Block that.

109
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,995
Kapow!

110
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,580
KNOCKDOWN
WIN

111
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,831
This won't do, Ha-gyeong.

112
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,166
That's the only way.

113
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,417
Come on, final round.

114
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,754
Hey, work harder.

115
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,172
Hey.

116
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,049
Hey!

117
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,718
-Double combo!
-Block him!

118
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,054
KNOCKDOWN
WIN

119
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,061
Seo Su-hyeok, boo.

120
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,115
What? What's with the look?

121
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,409
Just…

122
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,830
I think I get why she dated you.

123
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,837
Thanks for being such a good friend…

124
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,090
she can talk to,

125
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,260
for letting things end here,

126
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,262
and…

127
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,598
for inviting me too.

128
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:06,606
I hope you stay her friend
and hang out

129
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,482
once in a while,

130
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,735
but not very often.

131
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:15,990
To be honest,
I want you out of the picture,

132
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,908
but Ha-gyeong says

133
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,328
you're the friend she can open up to.

134
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,706
I guess I need to deal with

135
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,916
my jealousy and frustration.

136
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,130
As long as she's happy

137
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,299
and smiling,

138
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,718
that's all I need.

139
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,601
You really are mature.

140
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:47,396
You're putting your emotions aside
to see her happy.

141
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,278
I guess I'm part of what makes her happy.

142
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,908
I really can't stand you.

143
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,663
Now,

144
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,997
what's next?

145
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,499
One, two, three.

146
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,250
-Hey!
-What the…

147
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,336
You didn't wait for me?

148
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,671
All right, one, two, three.

149
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,467
I'm sorry,
but we're in the middle of breaking up.

150
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,636
Give us some space.

151
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,263
-One, two…
-Three!

152
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:42,785
You blew 50,000 won and didn't get it.
So I got it for you.

153
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,829
I'm good at the game.

154
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,455
It looks like me.

155
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:52,920
You asked what I put
in the center of a bingo card.

156
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:56,006
Right. I've been curious all along.

157
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,341
I wrote "ash tree."

158
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:03,097
Because I first met you
through that case.

159
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,392
Only the ash tree's stump remained.

160
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:10,104
But you left it untouched
without pulling out.

161
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,023
It had such a special place in your heart.

162
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,110
Mr. Baek planted a new tree next to it.

163
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:18,779
He's so persistent.

164
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,032
I kept asking myself

165
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:26,162
what I should put on the line
to go up against him.

166
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,374
Kidnapping? I can't do that.

167
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,837
Punching Jeon Nam-jin?
I can't do that either.

168
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,550
To be honest, I wanted to keep going.

169
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,636
But part of me wanted to stop.

170
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,307
I obviously had zero chance in this fight

171
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,934
between two 18-year-olds.

172
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:55,024
Still, I'm fine,
since I'm not in love yet.

173
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,029
That crazy way you talk,

174
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:01,739
I liked that.

175
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:06,660
Maybe being a kid is better
than being grown-up.

176
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:10,581
That's how I felt over these seven hours.

177
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,709
I've had a crash course today.

178
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,544
It's time for me to leave

179
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,547
this world of fantasy and adventure.

180
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:20,549
Back to where I was.

181
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,093
Attorney Seo.

182
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:24,970
You know what?

183
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,889
I've never had a breakup like this…

184
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,600
from beginning to end.

185
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,312
My twisted choice

186
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,483
turned out undeniably cool
and sexy all the way through.

187
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:42,738
Breaking up with you
would be yet another twisted choice.

188
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,282
But I can't help

189
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,159
but twist it again.

190
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:52,706
Thanks for everything.

191
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,630
That's a perfect goodbye line.

192
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:03,008
I prefer "thank you" over "sorry."

193
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,436
Today's last parade is…

194
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,146
The timing is funny.

195
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,151
<i>That's our last double date</i>

196
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,154
<i>and that's how we said goodbye.</i>

197
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,076
<i>As crazy as it is,</i>

198
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,371
<i>that was my love story</i>

199
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,291
<i>and my breakup this summer.</i>

200
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,591
Baek Do-ha.

201
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:46,969
We should get going.

202
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,471
Let's stay a little longer.

203
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:08,657
<i>Pretending not to know was my specialty.</i>

204
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,700
Take it.

205
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,328
<i>All this time,</i>

206
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,331
<i>I ignored what my heart was telling me,</i>

207
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,167
<i>burying it under the sound of cicadas.</i>

208
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,294
<i>I kept running away…</i>

209
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,422
<i>from my feelings,</i>

210
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,216
<i>from the thumping in my chest…</i>

211
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:29,887
<i>and from these words.</i>

212
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:31,931
I like you.

213
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,482
I tried so hard to run from it,

214
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,275
but I totally failed.

215
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:51,742
Baek Do-ha.

216
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,744
I hated you

217
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:55,579
all the time.

218
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,541
My strength came

219
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:01,877
from resenting you.

220
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,047
You told me

221
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,342
to hate you while being by your side.

222
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,137
You already knew

223
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,057
where my anger came from.

224
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,854
I hated you because I liked you.

225
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,607
After all that resentment…

226
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,194
I realized I still liked you.

227
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,072
I still do.

228
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,282
I still hate you,

229
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:33,993
but I like you.

230
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,580
I hate you, you drive me crazy,
but I like you.

231
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,166
Since I like you, I hate you even more.

232
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,585
But I only hate you…

233
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:49,591
because I like you.

234
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,557
You and I are all twisted,

235
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,977
I have no idea what kind of mess
we'll end up making.

236
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,479
But I'm going to…

237
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,232
hold…

238
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,317
your hand.

239
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,506
I like you.

240
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:32,843
<i>It took me forever</i>

241
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:36,305
<i>to finally say</i>

242
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:38,891
<i>those three simple words.</i>

243
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,337
Don't you dare leave,

244
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:10,923
or else…

245
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,386
<i>This time, I finally said…</i>

246
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,557
<i>how I really feel.</i>

247
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,209
My summer break is over.

248
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,878
Assign me the Cheongseon Construction

249
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,880
and Hankwang Group
private equity fund case.

250
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,143
A trip is the perfect excuse to go crazy.

251
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,814
SONG HA-GYEONG

252
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,315
What is this bingo card?

253
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,027
I screwed up.

254
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,196
I was cocky about those nine squares.

255
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,825
I learned
some people can't be explained with this.

256
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,121
Next time, I'll make it 16 squares.

257
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:29,042
Anyway, give me
the Goseong inheritance dispute

258
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,420
that I turned down back then.

259
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:34,590
The first trial, right?

260
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,366
I need that tablet.

261
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,700
I need the blueprints.

262
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,138
Looks like we won't be

263
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,558
sleeping tonight, right?

264
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,354
Hey, lower!

265
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,272
-Lower.
-Higher.

266
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,189
Higher.

267
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,777
Hey, stop.

268
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,445
-Take it.
-You!

269
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,284
This should've happened earlier.

270
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,537
Next time, I'll definitely
beat Seo Su-hyeok.

271
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,123
-One more round.
-What?

272
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,457
One more round, now.

273
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,583
Okay.

274
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,674
What? Why're you so good?

275
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,676
Wait. You can't do that.

276
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,177
Stop it.

277
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,722
-Hey.
-Stop.

278
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,081
Jeez.

279
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,960
"I like you." Was it that hard to say it?

280
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:19,880
How could your fever go to 38 degrees?

281
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,050
First breakup, first confession.

282
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,136
Do you know
how hard I pushed myself today?

283
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,058
-It's because I was so nervous.
-Are you dumb?

284
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,936
I was going to say yes.
What's there to be nervous about?

285
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,190
I know.

286
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,484
I should've just texted you.

287
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:44,404
I'll look after you through the night.
Just get some rest.

288
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,080
Are you dumb?

289
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,123
You didn't want to look after me?

290
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,334
How could your fever go to 38 degrees?

291
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:00,003
It's because I was so nervous.

292
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,672
This is unbelievable.

293
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,676
People say the first day
is the most nerve-wracking,

294
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,138
We're shaking all over from chills.

295
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,061
Porridge?

296
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,443
Hey. Take your medicine.

297
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,785
Right. Let's just eat here

298
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,286
instead of going back and forth.

299
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,336
Get through tonight, and we'll be over it.

300
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,171
Get some rest.

301
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,175
Wait.

302
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,764
You know… <i>baesuk?</i>

303
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,351
Your mom used to make it for you

304
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,562
when you had a cold.

305
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,276
With sliced ginger and dried jujubes,
and some cinnamon, right?

306
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,154
Make it for me tomorrow.

307
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:23,211
<i>To me, Baek Do-ha's place</i>
<i>was a world in a 13-inch laptop.</i>

308
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,381
Hi.

309
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:27,424
Have you been well?

310
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,634
<i>Yeah. I've been well.</i>

311
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:34,764
<i>I have a lot of friends at school</i>
<i>and play basketball. I'm well.</i>

312
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,768
Hey.

313
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,646
I know you're holding back your cough.

314
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,400
Go to the doctor. Go tell your mom.

315
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:47,736
<i>What for? I'm not sick at all.</i>

316
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,490
<i>Besides, my mom's busy.</i>

317
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,620
<i>She's busy enough as it is,</i>
<i>I shouldn't make it worse.</i>

318
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:59,456
<i>Wait. Looks like the delivery's here.</i>
<i>Hold on.</i>

319
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,373
Okay.

320
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,717
<i>There was no way in,</i>

321
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,178
<i>so I couldn't open that room.</i>

322
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,037
Promise.

323
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:25,458
<i>How many more summer stories</i>
<i>are waiting to be revealed?</i>

324
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,924
A summer cold? Song Ha-gyeong?

325
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,468
Don't make me laugh.

326
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,388
She didn't even get COVID
while everyone else did.

327
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,391
She sounded terrible.

328
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,268
I almost didn't recognize her voice.

329
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,979
If it's that bad,
she should take a sick day.

330
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:47,355
Why use vacation days?

331
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,108
We don't have enough sick days.

332
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,110
What?

333
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:54,195
STOP THE PATAN HIGH
REMODELING

334
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,282
He's promoting our project

335
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,743
with so much passion.

336
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,370
He must be the one
who files complaints nonstop.

337
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,455
Let's pass by.

338
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,251
<i>A summer cold?</i>

339
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:09,836
<i>Baek Do-ha got a cold?</i>

340
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,464
Yes. His fever is over 38 degrees.

341
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,216
Then let's take it easy, everyone.

342
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,054
No one seems to be worried
even though he's sick.

343
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,891
A miracle happened,
so we should make the most of it.

344
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:24,684
He didn't get sick

345
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,437
even after being in the cold
for 12 hours with no hot pack.

346
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,646
During this rainy season,

347
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:32,192
he did all the waterproofing work
despite the storm.

348
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,486
Come to think of it,

349
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,863
it's the first time I've heard
that Do-ha's sick.

350
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:39,407
Try it.

351
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,667
-Is it good?
-Yes.

352
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:55,006
I never thought I'd taste <i>baesuk</i> you made.

353
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,133
I'm all better now.

354
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:03,723
So gross.

355
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,143
<i>Him all snotty with messy hair was</i>

356
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,605
<i>something I never saw</i>
<i>on the 13-inch laptop.</i>

357
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,567
<i>The side he tried so hard to hide.</i>

358
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,532
<i>This is our eighteenth summer.</i>

359
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,203
<i>This is how we're aching</i>
<i>through the summer.</i>

360
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:39,426
There you go!

361
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,180
Good work.

362
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,103
It's time to wake up from the dream again.

363
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,104
Every time,

364
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,690
I feel pulled back into reality.

365
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:54,941
Tell me about it.

366
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,902
Sometimes, I wish
I could stay at the rink all day.

367
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,948
From a life at 15 km/h
to one at 5 km/h.

368
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,839
I thought you were at home
getting treatment.

369
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,424
You were training instead?

370
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,384
The league prelims are next month.

371
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,220
We have matches coming up
and training.

372
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,681
You promised you'd skip this training.

373
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,850
How can I give up?

374
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,895
Seul, don't you know me?

375
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,481
My nickname.
Oh Seung-taek with two hearts.

376
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,025
They said it could cause muscle damage.

377
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,068
Worst case, it could lead to infection,

378
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,653
complications, or even dialysis.

379
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:41,654
Seul.

380
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,991
That's enough.

381
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:50,663
Fine.

382
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,500
I'll give in this time too.

383
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:54,751
So…

384
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,254
for the wedding prep…

385
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,386
I guess I'll have to work twice as hard.

386
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,184
I already organized everything.

387
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:20,318
I checked out a lot of wedding halls.

388
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:23,112
Look. This one was really pretty.

389
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,824
Not this one.

390
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,200
Oh, this one.

391
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,537
Here, the bride doesn't enter
down the stairs.

392
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,247
It's a ramp.

393
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,915
So we can enter together.

394
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:37,585
Oh, and they'll adjust everything,
even the tables,

395
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,045
to fit your wheelchair height.

396
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,923
Seul, I'm sorry,

397
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,675
but I've got ground training.

398
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,134
I should go now.

399
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,261
Oh.

400
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,222
Okay.

401
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:52,725
I'll probably be done late,
so don't wait and go home.

402
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,229
Okay.

403
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:10,535
Good job, everyone.

404
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:11,452
GO, SEUNG-TAEK

405
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,580
My body feels a little stiff today.

406
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:19,669
-You're up?
-Yes.

407
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,630
Looks like

408
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,133
we're both feeling a little better.

409
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,095
You're right.

410
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:30,722
So, tomorrow…

411
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,973
Wait.

412
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:36,019
Tomorrow, I already have plans.

413
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,158
I'll join you for that plan too.

414
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,541
Let's go.

415
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,717
THE LATE KIM AE-JEONG

416
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,469
REST WITH A SMILE
WE LOVE YOU

417
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,282
Those kids.

418
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:35,870
They didn't forget
to express their thanks to her.

419
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,086
Why did you choose this place for her?

420
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:50,009
They say the tree enjoys the time
the departed missed.

421
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:52,637
I thought that was cool.

422
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,769
Mom will be happy.

423
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:03,773
INSTANT NOODLES

424
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,633
I'm home.

425
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,844
That hits the spot.

426
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,976
Ha-gyeong. Song Ha-gyeong!

427
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:45,982
Here.

428
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,741
Why? Is it bad?

429
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,911
I'm craving instant noodles
with some soju.

430
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:20,183
What's wrong?

431
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,352
Did you see someone you know?

432
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,396
No, it's nothing.

433
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,025
Let's go.

434
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,455
PHOTOSHOOT DRESS SELECTION
HONEYMOON PLANNING

435
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,540
We have to make a decision today.

436
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:45,833
We're running out of time.

437
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:48,377
Take a look.

438
00:34:58,763 --> 00:34:59,680
Don't we look cute?

439
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,060
That was when I became

440
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,979
the second person in Korea
to be scouted for Canada.

441
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,272
In 2017.

442
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,067
We did long-distance for two years.

443
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:16,197
Right. You looked really cool back then.

444
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:20,618
I was so worried you might cry,

445
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,578
try to stop me,

446
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,956
or say you'd come with me.

447
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,291
I'm so happy for you!

448
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,376
SEVEN YEARS AGO

449
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,877
It's been your lifelong dream.

450
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:34,507
You're someone
who can make all your dreams come true.

451
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,468
We made this wish
at the Wishing Rock in Jeju

452
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,303
on our third anniversary, remember?

453
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:41,139
I'm so happy!

454
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,434
Seul.

455
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:47,353
Let's get married.

456
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,357
Give me two years
with the Vancouver team.

457
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,235
After that, let's get married.

458
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:02,702
<i>And that year,</i>
<i>when we promised we'd marry…</i>

459
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,630
<i>Oh Seung-Taek collided hard</i>
<i>with the goal post</i>

460
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:17,884
<i>after being outmatched in a blocking valve</i>
<i>against Derek Lee.</i>

461
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,969
<i>He's currently holding on</i>
<i>to his lower back.</i>

462
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,263
<i>Let's hope the injury isn't serious.</i>

463
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,566
<i>There's serious damage</i>
<i>to the spinal nerves.</i>

464
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,529
<i>The paralysis below the waist</i>

465
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,782
<i>is likely to be permanent.</i>

466
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,549
<i>Even back then, you smiled.</i>

467
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,677
You worried I might be upset,

468
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,222
struggle,

469
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:05,348
or just…

470
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,684
get more hurt.

471
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,395
But, Seul,

472
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:13,147
every time you smile…

473
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:16,442
I end up hurting even more.

474
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:19,904
What's the matter?

475
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:24,784
What I'm saying is,
you can stop smiling in front of me.

476
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,080
Let's end it here.

477
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:34,126
I'm sorry.

478
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,046
I was selfish.

479
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,632
I kept telling myself,

480
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:42,843
"Just this year, just this season,
just this summer…"

481
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,264
It ended up taking too long.

482
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,770
Now, smile only when you want to.

483
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,649
Live with your feet on the ground.

484
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,112
Seung-taek.

485
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:14,083
When we met again after my accident,

486
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,419
remember what we promised?

487
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,422
If either of us wanted to break up,

488
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:22,466
we'd never cry…

489
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,637
or hold the other person back.

490
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:32,935
Thank you for everything.

491
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,063
I should go.

492
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,351
Are you asleep?

493
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:16,854
No.

494
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:29,658
Earlier, did you see the instant noodles

495
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,993
at my mom's pine tree?

496
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,456
I think Dad was there.

497
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,959
-Back in the day--
-I remember.

498
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:43,214
They got busted
eating instant cup noodles.

499
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,800
You lost it, yelling like crazy,

500
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,303
ran to my room, and cried quietly.

501
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,392
You remember all that?

502
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,108
Of course. I've got some…

503
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,443
Actually, a lot of issues.

504
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:05,736
And then…

505
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,408
you didn't leave her side at all,
taking care of her.

506
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,743
That's you.

507
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,789
I'm sure she knows what's in your heart.

508
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:23,671
Maybe if we stay close,

509
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:26,507
we'll end up seeing things
we don't want to see.

510
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,553
Is there more to see?

511
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:32,763
In our first big fight,

512
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:36,142
you got mayo up your nose,
so we rinsed it out with saline.

513
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,603
Besides that, we have more to see?

514
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,771
Shut up.

515
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,232
Right. When you ran off to my room,

516
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,359
your bras were on the floor.

517
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,777
I don't need to see that.

518
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,154
Hey.

519
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,071
I don't know.

520
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,535
Do you want to know my secret?

521
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,457
This is the first time

522
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,626
I've shown anyone I was sick.

523
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:04,753
Thanks

524
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,089
for taking care of me.

525
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,800
I know you've always wanted to do that.

526
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,890
Remember when the breaker shut off?

527
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,934
The blackout that day?

528
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,480
I tripped the breaker on purpose,
so you'd hurry home.

529
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,564
Hey!

530
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,609
You're insane!

531
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,279
My mom's <i>dugyeonju</i> got smashed
because of you.

532
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,447
That was for my wedding.

533
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,452
So what else, got another secret?

534
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,122
I don't know.

535
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,516
Ms. Song.

536
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:41,433
Hey.

537
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:45,271
You took a few days off,
and your skin's glowing.

538
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,480
-Really?
-Yes.

539
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,774
I guess you rested really well.

540
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:52,361
Kind of.
I did take care of an old matter.

541
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:53,988
An old matter?

542
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,491
What is it?

543
00:42:58,951 --> 00:42:59,785
What's this?

544
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:06,375
Please proceed,
leaving no detail out till the end.

545
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,627
-That's it. Thanks.
-Thank you.

546
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,762
The professor called me.

547
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:19,722
Which one?

548
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:20,764
Professor Nam.

549
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,851
She's waiting for your call.

550
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:31,817
You and my mom are surely close.
You even share my private life?

551
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,528
Baek Do-ha.

552
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,239
I heard you got the email too.

553
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:43,746
It's not certain.

554
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:47,249
I've gotten
many messages like that before.

555
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:49,376
I heard the MRA reached out.

556
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:21,116
<i>Stop the construction for the time being.</i>

557
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,912
What is this all of a sudden?

558
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,666
Every site has noise, dust or complaints.

559
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,542
It's not my call.

560
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:35,130
Don't you know the higher-ups decide
whether we move forward or stop?

561
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:38,717
The public architect resigned,
the one in charge was attacked,

562
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,720
someone's protesting against it,
and the banners went up.

563
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,599
The mayor's on edge
with two months until the election.

564
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,227
There's no reason for us to cause issues.

565
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,812
It's just for the time being.

566
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:10,916
What's this for?

567
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,584
Are you going somewhere?

568
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:14,878
Yes.

569
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:24,346
I need to go to the States for a bit.

570
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:29,393
Why? Is something wrong? Is it serious?

571
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,395
No, it's just…

572
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:34,022
I'd requested the site records
and paperwork,

573
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:37,192
and the results just came in.
I need to go handle the admin work.

574
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,070
What is it about? Hermann?

575
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,158
It's more important than that.

576
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:48,036
So when are you leaving?

577
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,834
I need to fly out tomorrow.

578
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:04,678
PACHEON CITY HALL

579
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:14,062
<i>It won't take long.</i>

580
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:17,941
I'll be back before August 31.

581
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,610
And after that…

582
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,572
I won't ever leave your side.

583
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,419
PACHEON OBSERVATORY COMPLETION

584
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,067
JONG-MAN JR.

585
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,389
<i>You keep forgetting.</i>
<i>Watch out for your brain cells.</i>

586
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,231
It looks tasty.

587
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:55,706
<i>If you don't fix this,</i>
<i>it'll hurt your ears and the floor.</i>

588
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:01,461
You're really something, Baek Do-ha.

589
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,464
<i>They say a home is where people live.</i>

590
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,716
Where did he hide it?

591
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,926
<i>But there's no sign</i>
<i>that I've ever lived here.</i>

592
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:10,804
<i>Because I was</i>

593
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,557
<i>always a guest who'd leave soon.</i>

594
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,641
This is it.

595
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,230
Found it.

596
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:25,819
<i>I did some sanding and varnishing</i>
<i>so you wouldn't get splinters.</i>

597
00:48:25,902 --> 00:48:27,195
When did you do all this?

598
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,369
There it is.

599
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,996
<i>I didn't match the colors.</i>

600
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,963
There's no squeaking.

601
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,091
<i>This time it's different.</i>

602
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:51,053
<i>I'm coming back soon.</i>

603
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:00,145
<i>I know you don't believe in these things,</i>

604
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:02,064
<i>but in case</i>
<i>you can't sleep while I'm away.</i>

605
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:13,158
<i>So, don't get rid of it, just wait.</i>

606
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,080
<i>Don't worry.</i>

607
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,458
<i>By the time you find the last note…</i>

608
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,461
<i>I'll have returned.</i>

609
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,634
<i>Baek Do-ha came as a summer guest,</i>

610
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:33,428
<i>planning to stay 80 days,</i>

611
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:37,140
<i>but ended up leaving on day 52.</i>

612
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:47,609
NO ISSUES

613
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:56,034
SEUNG-TAEK

614
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,203
You two broke up?

615
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,293
I figured Seul didn't tell you yet.

616
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:07,546
Seung-taek.

617
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,257
Don't be ridiculous.

618
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,009
You were planning your wedding.

619
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,262
Are you seriously her friend?

620
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,305
If you're her real friend,

621
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,558
you should've told her
to break up with me,

622
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,017
not helping with wedding plans.

623
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,147
Seung-taek.

624
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,816
Seung-taek.

625
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:30,819
Are you serious?

626
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,284
Ha-gyeong.

627
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,661
Do you know what's in her bag?

628
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,165
My catheter.

629
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,541
CATHETER: A MEDICAL TUBE

630
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:47,002
Her calendar is packed with my schedule.

631
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,254
She hardly sees her friends.

632
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,340
Hey, Seul.

633
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:55,302
She hasn't been coming
to our get-togethers for years.

634
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,013
Seung-taek, be good to her.

635
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,931
This isn't easy for her.

636
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,808
You bitch, are you done?

637
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:02,851
-Hey.
-Come on, stop.

638
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:04,102
What's gotten into you?

639
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:09,024
You're doing it right.

640
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,776
-Thanks.
-Also, hydro…

641
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:11,818
This one?

642
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:16,448
That's…

643
00:51:17,574 --> 00:51:20,577
what happens all the time
when she's with me.

644
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,288
But, Seung-taek…

645
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:25,624
So,

646
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,168
you have to talk trash about me

647
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,922
and take her side, no matter what, okay?

648
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:37,177
<i>Every breakup has a backstory.</i>

649
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,475
You're not just breaking up with Seul,

650
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:45,894
but with everyone, right?

651
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,735
<i>And that page leaves a huge void.</i>

652
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:56,696
Seul.

653
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:58,698
Seul.

654
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,327
Hey, Lee Seul.

655
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,843
<i>We can only fill it…</i>

656
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:18,927
<i>Your call has been…</i>

657
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,637
<i>…with our imagination.</i>

658
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,852
VICTORY THANKS TO SEUL!

659
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,353
OUR 7TH YEAR VICTORY

660
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:41,324
<i>We can never find out</i>
<i>what's in there forever…</i>

661
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,420
<i>until that person</i>

662
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:55,881
<i>tells you.</i>

663
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,566
<i>And on August 31,</i>

664
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,403
<i>my page had a blank space.</i>

665
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:24,534
<i>Baek Do-ha didn't come back.</i>

666
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:39,633
<i>Before winter arrives,</i>
<i>winter prep is a must,</i>

667
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,553
<i>so we can get through it safely.</i>

668
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:48,350
You said it would never freeze,
but it's frozen and stopped working.

669
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,310
<i>Where in Patan-myeon are you located?</i>

670
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:52,604
<i>What's the address?</i>

671
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:56,066
Jangsu-ro 101-23.

672
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,735
<i>I'm sorry, but during winter,</i>

673
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,946
<i>we need at least two days' notice</i>
<i>for that area.</i>

674
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,948
<i>Sorry, but today won't be possible.</i>

675
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:06,910
<i>I thought my luck was only bad in summer,</i>
<i>but winter's no exception.</i>

676
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,536
<i>It's just as terrible.</i>

677
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:13,166
<i>Today feels like minus 18 degrees Celsius,</i>

678
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:16,211
<i>with 70% humidity,</i>
<i>and 80% discomfort index.</i>

679
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:19,798
<i>It's so uncomfortable even in winter</i>

680
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:21,967
<i>because of Baek Do-ha.</i>

681
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,512
It's snowing.

682
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:27,222
JONG-MAN JR.

683
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,225
Snow…

684
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:34,854
It's snowing too?

685
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,736
<i>I should get ready for winter too.</i>

686
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:51,371
<i>Drill it each time you think of me.</i>

687
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,456
<i>You might as well make it heart-shaped.</i>

688
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:02,173
Hello?

689
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:03,842
CHICKEN FEET

690
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,469
When is Do-ha coming back?

691
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,346
He'll explain once he's back.

692
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:12,392
He's keeping in touch,
sending emails and all.

693
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,852
Why can't he explain now?

694
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:17,856
If he's being quiet,
he must be hiding something.

695
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:20,734
Maybe it's Hermann.

696
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:22,736
Whatever.

697
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,739
You're unusually calm.

698
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:27,741
Your vibe has changed.

699
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,993
Look who's talking.

700
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,371
You went traveling after your job,
and now your style's global.

701
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,044
First an indie singer style,
then an announcer look.

702
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,337
What now? A biker gang?

703
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:42,630
Is this a job fair?

704
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:44,966
I'm unemployed now.

705
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,927
I quit earlier.

706
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,060
PATAN HIGH SCHOOL

707
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,520
UNDER CONSTRUCTION
DO NOT ENTER

708
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:59,397
CONSTRUCTION PAUSED

709
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,475
Since Do-ha's been gone for so long,
I see you here.

710
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:40,355
I'm not allowed in his space
without your permission.

711
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:42,023
Sorry?

712
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,234
Is he keeping in touch?

713
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:49,989
Well, still,
I have no idea when he'll be back either.

714
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:53,201
Maybe I should've gone easy on him.

715
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:57,622
Want to grab a drink?

716
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,087
Want to toast?

717
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:05,505
Cheers.

718
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:12,512
So nice.

719
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,182
It's been ages
since I drank this comfortably.

720
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,476
It's been ages
since I drank this uncomfortably.

721
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:22,730
How come?
I don't remember anything that awful.

722
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,691
I'm a bit of a twisted person.

723
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:27,819
I do remember feeling complicated.

724
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,280
I was curious about you,

725
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,157
annoyed by you,

726
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:33,992
and liked you.

727
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:35,702
All mixed together.

728
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,081
Every time he came back
after spending summer here,

729
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,250
he acted strange.

730
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,337
Baek Do-ha.

731
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:48,131
Open the door.

732
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,800
Are you stuck in there again?

733
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,344
<i>I could tell what he was thinking</i>

734
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,388
<i>and what he'd been up to…</i>

735
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,145
Baek Do-ha!

736
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,275
<i>…without him saying a word.</i>

737
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,694
<i>He'd left something behind</i>

738
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:14,741
<i>and he was somehow</i>
<i>drawing out that feeling.</i>

739
00:58:17,577 --> 00:58:20,705
Yes, last week,
Do-ha wanted some Korean food.

740
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,540
So we went to Koreatown.

741
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:23,958
Yes.

742
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,837
I do miss home.

743
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,841
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>there's a lot about him I don't know.</i>

744
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:37,639
I'm jealous.

745
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:39,891
Truth is,

746
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,936
I only know Baek Do-ha in summer.

747
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,024
You said before

748
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:50,443
the first step in remodeling
is always demolition.

749
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,653
To fix anything,

750
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,321
you have to know what needs fixing

751
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,365
and start by tearing it down.

752
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:59,827
Whether it's nostalgia,
illusions, delusions,

753
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:01,621
or old memories.

754
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:03,331
Whatever it is.

755
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:06,459
But Do-ha isn't doing that.

756
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:09,587
You know, right?

757
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,507
What does Do-ha need to tear down?

758
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,885
Does it have something to do

759
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,055
with why he hasn't returned?

760
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:34,654
<i>I only saw Baek Do-ha's world</i>
<i>through this 13-inch laptop.</i>

761
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:38,491
<i>I had no idea what was beyond that.</i>

762
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:43,371
<i>Or maybe…</i>

763
00:59:43,454 --> 00:59:44,414
JOHN AND HIS TREE

764
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:46,457
<i>I just chose not to see it.</i>

765
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,917
I'LL WAIT TILL YOU GROW BACK.

766
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:50,044
THE TREE WAS COVERED
IN LUSH GREEN LEAVES

767
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,850
<i>See? Not too bad</i>
<i>once you make it to the end, right?</i>

768
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,465
SEOUL TO NEW YORK
1 ADULT, ECONOMY

769
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:40,928
PAYMENT SUCCESSFUL

770
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:50,730
<i>I waited and waited for you,</i>
<i>and I finally booked a plane ticket.</i>

771
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:52,982
<i>I'm coming to you</i>

772
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,443
<i>before my hands get cold, you punk.</i>

773
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:00,156
<i>I used every single day off I had.</i>

774
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,116
<i>I'm not hiding this time.</i>

775
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,870
<i>I'm coming to you. Wait right there.</i>

776
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:09,832
BAEK DO-HA

777
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:16,172
<i>How many days?</i>

778
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,424
-What?
-<i>Your day off.</i>

779
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:20,551
<i>How many days off did you use?</i>

780
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:21,469
Five days.

781
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:25,264
<i>That's perfect. That's enough.</i>

782
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:27,809
What do you mean?

783
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,896
-I'm at the airport.
<i>-I know.</i>

784
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:33,815
-What?
<i>-Look to your side.</i>

785
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,274
Side?

786
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:56,587
I'm back.

787
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:00,174
Let's go.

788
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:01,801
Where?

789
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:12,395
I brought back…

790
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,151
Baek Do-young.

791
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:04,947
<i>What do you mean?</i>

792
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:08,242
<i>So it took you this long</i>
<i>to come back because…</i>

793
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:11,162
<i>I finally made it.</i>
<i>The amazing Peanut House.</i>

794
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:12,997
<i>You haven't changed either.</i>

795
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,624
Still just as selfish.

796
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:16,375
<i>I hope it's really over.</i>

797
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,336
What do you mean?

798
01:03:18,419 --> 01:03:19,796
Do-ha, what are you doing?

799
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:22,423
<i>You've been acting weird.</i>

800
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:25,384
<i>I usually can't sleep well</i>
<i>in this Peanut House.</i>

801
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,678
<i>How could you meet your ex right away?</i>

802
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:29,847
<i>I'm not supposed to be this happy</i>
<i>to see my ex.</i>

803
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:33,309
<i>Seems like our relationship</i>
<i>could use a little remodeling, right?</i>

804
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:34,685
<i>Why are we here again?</i>

805
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:35,812
<i>I'm kidnapping you.</i>

806
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:38,189
<i>You can call it our last goodbye trip.</i>

807
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:40,483
<i>Is it really a goodbye trip?</i>

808
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,821
<i>Baek Do-ha!</i>
