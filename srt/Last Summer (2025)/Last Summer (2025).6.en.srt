1
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,201
NEW YORK, 1995

2
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:39,831
I was born

3
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:42,667
in the nurse office
at the school my mom went to.

4
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,390
My dad was serving in the military then,
and my mom had to raise us alone

5
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,852
while studying abroad
with very little money.

6
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:04,230
That place became our first home.

7
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,402
Mom's classroom was our study room,
the lab was our playroom,

8
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:12,989
and the empty workshop was our bedroom.

9
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,161
Managing school with two kids,
it was unbelievably difficult.

10
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:21,539
You have no idea how tough it was
while you were away.

11
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:25,960
That's why I keep telling you.
It's too dangerous for the kids.

12
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:29,714
Look, let's move back to Korea.

13
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,592
I've pushed through everything
to get this far.

14
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,719
The tenure is right around the corner.

15
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,721
You want me to just give up?
No chance.

16
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,515
I've had enough!

17
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,683
Then the year the Twin Towers fell,

18
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,770
my twin and I got separated as well.

19
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,622
Mom.

20
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,917
I miss Dad and Do-young.

21
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:07,710
What?

22
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:12,465
Can I visit Korea during summer break?
Just for three weeks.

23
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:19,556
The summer I was 12, I realized
my existence weighed on my mom.

24
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:21,891
I met Song Ha-gyeong there.

25
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,395
Nobody cares about you here,
so just eat your food.

26
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,606
Don't get all nervous for no reason.

27
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,153
Try to look presentable?
You're gonna embarrass me.

28
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,572
Straight-up mean. Brutally so.

29
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,157
What're you looking at, you mooch?

30
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,244
Why do you care if I look or not?

31
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,996
You're mean as hell.

32
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,249
Hey, ignore her. She's always like that.
Just eat.

33
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,126
What? You get over here.

34
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,836
She was twice as mean as me.

35
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,714
No, let me correct that.

36
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,884
She was three times meaner than me,

37
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,304
so I could be more like myself.
Maybe that's why…

38
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,349
that place felt more like home
than any other.

39
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,642
Why are you here again?

40
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,687
Here, I got this from the States.

41
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,857
-Take it.
-I didn't tell you to bring this.

42
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,953
Hey, the heat really got to me.

43
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,289
I ended up sick
dealing with all your nonsense.

44
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,374
So don't come next year.

45
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,377
I almost missed my flight.

46
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,631
-What? Really?
-Hey, move. Out of the way.

47
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,177
Hey, my grades dropped
since I had to take care of your tree.

48
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,803
You owe me money for that.

49
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,972
Why would I…

50
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,436
Su-bak is doing well without you,
so don't worry.

51
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,563
Just send the money for the dog.

52
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,360
And as you can see,

53
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,945
it's rowdy in here again.

54
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,989
Guys, say hi to him.

55
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,742
-Hello.
-Hi, everyone.

56
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,834
My mom's getting remarried.

57
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,672
The four of us living together
is not happening.

58
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,758
You don't have to smile, dumbass.

59
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:24,180
Hey, I'll be kind enough to wait for you
next summer.

60
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:28,017
So don't make that face
like you're about to cry.

61
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,689
I always liked it
when Ha-gyeong said those mean things.

62
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:35,900
Song Ha-gyeong.

63
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,528
Do you really want me…

64
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,115
to disappear from your life?

65
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:44,951
Yes.

66
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,761
It's strange.

67
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,556
When you get angry at me…

68
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,058
I feel relieved.

69
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,979
I'm not normal either, like you.

70
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,904
I can understand

71
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,951
everything about Ha-gyeong,
whatever it is.

72
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,467
Thank you, you two.

73
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,146
I knew you'd do this.

74
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,985
I showed the ticket to Ha-gyeong first.

75
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,863
I told her I'd take you back in a week.

76
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,827
I told her I'd take you to the States
right away

77
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,538
and if she never told you any of that,

78
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,458
and you still didn't know…

79
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,961
then that's your relationship.

80
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,921
So stop wasting time here…

81
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,091
Ms. Yoon.
I'll send the money for the tickets.

82
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:49,135
Fly business and enjoy your trip back.

83
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,558
This isn't easy.

84
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,478
MAKE A VOICE CALL

85
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,104
SONG HA-GYEONG'S
CELL PHONE

86
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:09,155
We had a major home renovation recently.
I think it was really stressful.

87
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,158
The temperature was 39.2 ℃,
within normal range,

88
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,327
but his heart rate shot up to 100.

89
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:16,913
The symptoms aren't severe though.

90
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,042
-Is there any medicine…
-Hi.

91
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,421
-I'm Su-bak's dad. I'll listen too.
-Sure.

92
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,930
Su-bak, why is it so hard to get a taxi?

93
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,056
CALLING A PET TAXI

94
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,140
NO TAXIS AVAILABLE

95
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,193
Just get in my car.

96
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:51,239
Forget it. I just booked a pet taxi.
Su-bak and I'll go separately.

97
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,408
You didn't answer over 20 calls?

98
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:58,162
If I don't answer, you should know.
But you keep at it. You're the same.

99
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,748
Did you forget about our agreement?

100
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:03,167
Article Two, Section Four.
You wrote it yourself.

101
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:07,588
"We share equal responsibility
for Su-bak's health and emergencies."

102
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,049
-That's enough.
-You're one to talk.

103
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,345
Let's go home.

104
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,144
What?

105
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:28,943
Don't you see Su-bak's hot?

106
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,488
No pet taxi's coming.
Stop being stubborn and get in my car.

107
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,832
How did you know we were there?

108
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,252
I was at City Hall for a meeting
and heard you took the day off.

109
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:50,131
I went home, and there was no Su-bak,
no squeaky toy.

110
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:52,758
So I checked the vet app,

111
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,261
saw the appointment today,
so here I am.

112
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,226
So Yoon So-hee stopped by yesterday.

113
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:06,647
That explains why you've been acting cold
all of a sudden.

114
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,358
Gosh, Ha-gyeong. Seriously…

115
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,777
you're such an open book.

116
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,447
Hey, don't overreact.

117
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:18,826
I was just pissed off
because someone you know was treating me

118
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,202
like I was holding you back.

119
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,247
It's not like
I'm here to ruin your career.

120
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:29,378
And if you think that's why I was mad,
you've really got it wrong.

121
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,713
I was just…

122
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,675
feeling crappy, that's all.

123
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:46,937
Open up.

124
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,648
Su-bak, open up.

125
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:49,982
Slip it in.

126
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,027
-There you go.
-Swallow it.

127
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,528
-Good job.
-There you go.

128
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,162
Give me your hand.

129
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:07,875
Hey.

130
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,002
What are you doing?

131
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,924
There you go. Good boy.

132
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,772
-Ha-gyeong.
-What are you doing?

133
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,694
When did you last shampoo?

134
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,705
You--

135
00:11:58,717 --> 00:11:59,552
Song Ha-gyeong.

136
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,138
I'm not leaving.

137
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,723
We promised.

138
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,062
Wait.

139
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:12,523
Up you go.

140
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,862
What are you doing?

141
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,281
Let go.

142
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:22,950
I said let go.

143
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,085
PACHEON CITY HALL

144
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,342
Song Ha-gyeong.

145
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:42,928
I'm not leaving.

146
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,182
We promised.

147
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,656
-Two set meals, please.
-All right, coming right up.

148
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,246
It's just about time for lunch.

149
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,624
I remember you said
you wouldn't eat in Patan.

150
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,043
But this is Cheontan. I hope that's okay.

151
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:18,297
You came all the way from Seoul,
a whole hour away, just for a meal?

152
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,216
It took 45 minutes.

153
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:22,718
You're here to tease me?

154
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:28,307
I said I'd drop the lawsuit,
then changed my mind,

155
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,100
and now I'm living with Baek Do-ha.

156
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:34,438
So I probably seem
completely unhinged to you.

157
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,775
But I had my reasons…

158
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,864
I can't stand myself either.

159
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,159
Just go ahead and make fun of me.

160
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,911
Tease me all you want.

161
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,667
I can joke around later.
I came for something else.

162
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:55,793
Something else?

163
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,379
I want to confess.

164
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,642
Your food's here.

165
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,232
I'll put it on the table.

166
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,243
Confess? He's going to confess?

167
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,417
About what? It can't be…

168
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,714
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

169
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,843
Let's eat.

170
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:55,686
Hold on.

171
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,024
Don't you need to
pick up where you left off first?

172
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,777
I might've misled you.

173
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,326
In fact…

174
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,954
there are things I've kept from you.

175
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,665
I figured I didn't need to tell you,

176
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,419
and I still feel that way.
But that's just from my perspective.

177
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,881
I realized
it might be different from your side.

178
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,175
So it'd be better to tell you.

179
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:27,927
What is it about?

180
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:33,223
You sued Jeon Nam-jin
over the ash tree, didn't you?

181
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,559
Yes, that's right.

182
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,811
How did you--

183
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,231
I was his lawyer.

184
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,819
I want to make it clear.
I didn't mean to deceive you.

185
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,988
I saw it as a separate case,

186
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,699
and like I said,
I didn't think I needed to tell you.

187
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,867
All right, so…

188
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,162
two years ago,
you were Jeon Nam-jin's lawyer,

189
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,540
and now you're representing Baek Do-ha.

190
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,210
Yes, what a small world.

191
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,255
All right, okay, fine.

192
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,633
But why tell me this now?

193
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:13,305
I recently happened to find out
that Jeon Nam-jin, Baek Do-ha, and you

194
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,474
were working on a project together.

195
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,184
But how?

196
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,145
And why?

197
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,272
After a few cases against you,

198
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,734
I could see
how you might misinterpret things.

199
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:31,657
You're the type to doubt,
be suspicious,

200
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,036
jump to conclusions, overthink,
push hard, and be skeptical.

201
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:40,082
So I wanted to clear it up first.

202
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,420
I hope there's no misunderstanding.

203
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:47,923
Let's eat.

204
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,820
You're headed to City Hall, right?
I'll give you a ride.

205
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:15,034
By the way,
I kept thinking about it during lunch.

206
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,326
And I don't get it.

207
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:17,828
What do you mean?

208
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,082
Even if I got the wrong idea,
why does that bother you?

209
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,210
You're not even my lawyer,
so it shouldn't concern you.

210
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,504
That's what I've been wondering.

211
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,965
Two things have been bothering me.

212
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,884
-Two things?
-Yes.

213
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:36,138
Firstly, I don't want you
to misunderstand me.

214
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,098
And secondly,

215
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,267
why can't you remember me?

216
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,896
Am I really that easy to forget?

217
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,857
I even gave plenty of hints.

218
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:48,776
Hints?

219
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,576
I'll look and let you know.
It'll be fun seeing your writing again.

220
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,162
Considering we barely know each other,
I was quite rude.

221
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,163
Barely know?

222
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:05,042
Petition, self-representation
final argument, proof of contents.

223
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:06,335
I've read them many times.

224
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:10,923
Plus,

225
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,634
why does it keep bothering me…

226
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,179
that you don't remember me?

227
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,956
Your Honor…

228
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,917
please ensure the defendant faces

229
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,963
serious consequences
for his irresponsible conduct.

230
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:52,631
I'm Seo Su-hyeok.

231
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,635
You've done plenty of research about me.

232
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,762
Making the defendant look bad
is your forte.

233
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,848
I tried to benchmark that myself.

234
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,394
-Sir, one sake and katsudon.
-One sake and katsudon.

235
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,358
Are you a stalker?

236
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,824
How did you recognize me?

237
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,536
Your final argument
was way too unique to just forget.

238
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,872
Unique? Give me a break.

239
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,083
Hold on.

240
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,212
Can you access those court records

241
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,423
even if you're not involved
in the lawsuit?

242
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:38,302
You can access all records
unless there's a special exception.

243
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,388
So maybe Do-ha saw it too.

244
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,566
FINAL STATEMENT

245
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,193
Your Honor…

246
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:59,156
I ask that the court see
how a person's soul has been shattered

247
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:04,161
and that justice be served
through a firm ruling.

248
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,499
The defendant, Jeon Nam-jin,
falsely claimed to be my boyfriend

249
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,920
and caused irreparable damage
to my friend,

250
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:17,716
my other self,
and the core of my innermost feelings.

251
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,346
After my mother passed away

252
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,515
and my father left,
the ash tree was the only thing

253
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,935
that stayed by my side.

254
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,271
It became my companion

255
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,857
and sometimes gave me warmth

256
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,610
that even my parents couldn't give.

257
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,780
I tended to it with all my heart.

258
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,658
Your Honor…

259
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:47,704
that tree wasn't just mine alone.

260
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,082
With a 13-hour time difference…

261
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:53,919
What was that?

262
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,342
Song Su-bak! What did you just do?

263
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,511
No treats for you today.

264
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,892
Seriously, you make a mess every day.

265
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,853
I'm talking to you here.

266
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,150
Hey.

267
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,653
What the heck?

268
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,239
When did you come?
I didn't see your car.

269
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,742
I took the car
to the shop this morning for repair.

270
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,871
Anyway, why are you peeking at my laptop?

271
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,750
I had to check an email real quick,
and your laptop was on.

272
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,128
Don't tell me…

273
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,342
-Did you…
-What?

274
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,719
About your closing arguments?

275
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,972
-I saw that long ago.
-Hey.

276
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,227
Wait… Why would you see that?

277
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:56,023
I need to know what happened to my tree.

278
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:59,151
-I think I deserve that.
-Who gave you the right?

279
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,986
I raised it all by myself.

280
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,072
Sorry, but I never gave you that right.

281
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,783
Hey, are you mad that I saw it,

282
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:10,370
or because what's in there
shows your feelings?

283
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,206
Show what?

284
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,959
Don't get the wrong idea.

285
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:19,546
I just can't stand it
when you cross my boundaries like this.

286
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,591
Fine, I figured you'd react like this.

287
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:27,971
Why do you become an 18-year-old
when you're with me?

288
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,850
Am I the one making you like this?

289
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,231
-What about you?
-I know.

290
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,193
Why do we always end up like this?

291
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,909
ON OFFICIAL DUTY
PACHEON-SI

292
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:52,704
This person named Yoon So-hee
is joining the meeting today.

293
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,707
Has the PR team heard anything?

294
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:59,252
Wait, Yoon? Architect Yoon So-hee?

295
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:00,879
Do you know her?

296
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,216
Architect Baek Do-ha's official partner.

297
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:07,094
They're both
from an Ivy League school in New York.

298
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:09,554
Coel! They're both Coel alumni.

299
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,765
They've been working together
for ten years.

300
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,475
IB league?

301
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,520
I know "IB" league.

302
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,730
So they're both
from a prestige school like me.

303
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:22,984
Wow, I can't believe
he was in the same league as me.

304
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,237
Well, well. This is interesting, huh?

305
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,032
Take a look.

306
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,912
With the blueprint they created
and the winning design alone,

307
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,997
you could build an entire neighborhood.

308
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:40,085
The newest Gundam gallery entry
was by Hermann.

309
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:44,131
Pacheon has Jeon Nam-jin,
New York has Baek Do-ha.

310
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:48,135
These two are coming together
to make a masterpiece.

311
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,178
This makes a perfect promo slogan.

312
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,389
-Is it her?
-Yes!

313
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:57,352
Based on their qualifications, I thought
having them here was a waste of talent.

314
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:58,478
If they work together,

315
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:03,108
it could be a historic masterpiece
in Korean architecture!

316
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:07,529
The main goal is to
breathe some life into public facilities.

317
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,783
Hey, why'd they build this place
so ridiculously huge?

318
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,160
Could you keep it down?

319
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,331
Please wait about 30 minutes.

320
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,209
The previous team took up a lot of time,

321
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,794
and that delayed all the others.

322
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,130
Geez, I've got a lot on my plate too.

323
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,923
Does he do that many interviews?

324
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:30,510
Yes, after he rejected
the Hermann project.

325
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:32,387
And he's just really popular right now.

326
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,850
An architect with good skills, looks,
speech, that's not common.

327
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,437
Please wait a moment.

328
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,273
We experimented a lot of different,
fun ideas.

329
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:47,194
We incorporated nature to make
the building feel more three-dimensional.

330
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,486
To better…

331
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,156
We look pretty pathetic.

332
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,658
I'd appreciate your support.

333
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,077
What do you mean pathetic?
We're not pathetic.

334
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:00,415
As the backbone of the local government,

335
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:04,544
we're managing
major public policy matters.

336
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,296
I see.

337
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,592
This Deneb Hall features
a grooved exterior design,

338
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,637
giving it a unique visual texture.

339
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,721
For this model,

340
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,599
we went with
a slightly different color scheme.

341
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:21,186
We mixed in some light gray,
instead of plain white,

342
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,605
-for a modern look.
-Sorry to interrupt.

343
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:28,526
Is the grooved exterior of Deneb Hall
structurally sound?

344
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,196
Yes, we set the depth and spacing
of the grooves

345
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,572
after structural evaluation.

346
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,074
STRUCTURAL STABILITY

347
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,660
I see, and you just mentioned

348
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:40,038
that you're planning to use
mostly light-colored materials.

349
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,414
But the City Landscape Code

350
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:44,417
requires public buildings to harmonize
with nearby buildings.

351
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,295
I'd like to review
a few more color options.

352
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,048
I'll finalize and send the options
within this week.

353
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,092
COLOR OPTIONS

354
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,843
Come on, you're acting like amateurs.

355
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,096
We're pros. Let's keep it simple.

356
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,681
Why bother narrowing down options?

357
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:58,598
Mr. Jeon.

358
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,351
There's nothing "simple" about it.

359
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,900
Ms. Song, we've worked together before.
This is a public building.

360
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,861
Let's just be flexible
and get it over with.

361
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,989
A building's exterior
and structural integrity

362
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,825
aren't things you can handle
with flexibility, right?

363
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:20,287
Design features like exterior grooves
can compromise structural integrity,

364
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,497
so precise calculations and reviews
are needed.

365
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,585
Excuse me, miss.

366
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,047
You know, a building

367
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,384
doesn't collapse that easily. Grooves?

368
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,345
Those grooves can't be
deep enough to matter.

369
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,056
If the structure is sound, just move on.

370
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,142
We're wasting our time on useless stuff.

371
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,978
Director Jeon, that's enough.

372
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,775
We'll have another meeting on this
and get back to you.

373
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:54,904
Another meeting? I'm sick of meetings.
It's a waste of time going back and forth.

374
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,824
Let's settle this here.

375
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,785
Minimum time, minimum people,
flexibility, done.

376
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:01,745
Flexibility?

377
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,457
You can be flexible
when deciding on your lunch.

378
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,668
This is an official public project
run by the city.

379
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,503
Please show some responsibility.

380
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,631
Ms. Song, did you just lecture me
on responsibility?

381
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:17,302
Yes. It's ridiculous
hearing you go on about strategy.

382
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,638
-Ms. Song, stop.
-Director Jeon.

383
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,350
Remember the health center
from two years ago?

384
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,603
You rushed it without responsibility
and messed up the measurements,

385
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,563
throwing the entire schedule off.

386
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,900
And what about the bridge pier?

387
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,569
The contractor you brought in
through connections

388
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:37,030
cut corners and drew the plans poorly,

389
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,323
and our team had to study

390
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,617
and redo everything.
Apparently you forgot that.

391
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,534
On top of that--

392
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,120
Seriously.

393
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,330
Hey, Song Ha-gyeong.

394
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,749
-Are you done?
-No.

395
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:48,750
I'm not done yet.

396
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,876
-Stop it.
-You little…

397
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:52,712
I've been going easy on you,
and you've finally lost it.

398
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:53,671
Yes, I'm losing it.

399
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,424
You're embarrassing me so much,
I'm losing it!

400
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,021
Ms. Song, are you okay?

401
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,690
Yes, I'm okay.

402
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,610
Stop lying. You don't look okay.

403
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:18,613
Is it that obvious?

404
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,451
That wasn't like you.
Why did you do that?

405
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,286
I was really shocked.

406
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,249
Back at the township office,
you dealt with even tougher situations,

407
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,834
but you always stayed calm.

408
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,420
Director Jeon…

409
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,589
We've had plenty of meetings
with Director Jeon.

410
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,177
I was so humiliated.

411
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,013
In front of who?

412
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,352
The Pluto team?

413
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,399
I'm sorry,
but could you drop me over there?

414
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,692
I'll go see my friend.

415
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:59,320
Good job, everyone. Drink up.

416
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,407
-Well done!
-Well done!

417
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,829
-Chug it.
-This is great!

418
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,334
What?

419
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,587
Looks like our newbie can stand now.

420
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,838
Yes, just briefly.

421
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,924
I can walk about four steps.

422
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,261
I had a thoracic fracture
and had trouble breathing.

423
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,890
Below this point, I can't…

424
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,602
You had a spinal cord injury, right?

425
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,061
Yes.

426
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,230
He used to be on the national team.

427
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,650
-For real?
-You?

428
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,277
I'm just the typical case.

429
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,489
Is there any good navigation app
you'd recommend?

430
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:45,700
I've tried some apps,
and some guide you to stairs and slopes,

431
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,952
and some only guide you on roads.

432
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,704
We can't get anywhere.

433
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:53,833
It's not an app,
but if you go to the website here

434
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,504
and click the three dots here,
you'll see route options.

435
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,672
If you select "wheelchair accessible,"

436
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:03,426
it gives directions
tailored for wheelchair users.

437
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,346
-You're right. Did you know?
-No, I didn't.

438
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,431
I didn't know about this.

439
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,849
Eat up.

440
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,269
I should start using that now.
It's been so hard.

441
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:16,981
Seul. I was gonna give you
the wedding invite. When are you coming?

442
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,276
Seul. You've been distant from us.

443
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,489
We really need to catch up.
It's been years since I saw you.

444
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,117
I told you I couldn't make it.
It's my grandpa's birthday.

445
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,828
Sorry, send me the mobile one.

446
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,913
-Bye.
-Take care.

447
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,040
-Don't get lost.
-All right!

448
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,584
-I'll get going.
-Bye.

449
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,419
The driver's here.

450
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,213
-I'll go open the door.
-Thanks.

451
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,466
It's hilarious.

452
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,386
I'm sorry.

453
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,558
I'm fine.

454
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:55,228
-Lee Seul?
-Hey, Seul.

455
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:58,356
You said it's your grandpa's birthday.
Why are you here?

456
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:01,860
Seul, are you okay?

457
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,529
-Yes.
-Hi.

458
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:05,780
Hi.

459
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,659
I didn't know you two were still together.

460
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,038
She hasn't been coming
to our get-togethers for years.

461
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,165
I haven't seen you since the accident.

462
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,418
But I get it.

463
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,754
I don't think I could've come
to our get-togethers.

464
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,674
Seul, you must've been through a lot.

465
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,385
Seung-taek, be good to her.

466
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,554
This isn't easy.

467
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,264
-Hey, what are you doing?
-What?

468
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,682
Right.

469
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,145
You don't have to come if you're busy.

470
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,732
Seul, just you, you have to come.

471
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,568
-All right, enough, let's go.
-We'll go have dinner.

472
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,819
What's wrong?

473
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,738
-You bitch, are you done talking?
-Hey!

474
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,323
What are you doing?

475
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:49,824
-You little--
-How dare you?

476
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,367
-You little--
-Seul.

477
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,952
-What's gotten into you?
-Seul.

478
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,913
-Seul.
-What's gotten into you?

479
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,164
Who do you think you are?

480
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:57,999
What the hell?

481
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,667
-Are you done talking?
-Damn it!

482
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,752
-What the!
-Ha-gyeong.

483
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:01,920
-What now?
-Song!

484
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,504
Hey, let go.

485
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,007
Seul. Song. Hey, guys.

486
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,473
Stop drinking.

487
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,445
By the way, what brings you to Seoul
all of a sudden?

488
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,655
Did something happen?

489
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,579
Hey, did you fight with Do-ha again?

490
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,500
Do I look like a kid?
Like I'd go around…

491
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,251
picking fights?

492
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:48,591
Seung-taek.

493
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,345
Do-ha read the closing arguments.

494
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:55,390
Did you tell him?

495
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,142
No, I never told him anything about you.

496
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:04,107
What's going on
with your living situation?

497
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,692
How did Jong-man's case come up?

498
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:07,819
We…

499
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,947
work with Jeon Nam-jin.

500
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:11,906
-What?
-What?

501
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,661
And Yoon So-hee came to fetch Do-ha.

502
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,288
She even booked a plane ticket.

503
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:20,748
What?

504
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,128
Yoon So-hee?

505
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,680
A PERFECT DAY WITH BAEK DO-HA

506
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:38,141
Hey, Kim! Bring two bags of cement!

507
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:43,187
All right.

508
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,940
-Chief, take a look at this.
-Okay, coming!

509
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,400
Chief, over here.

510
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,901
Excuse me.

511
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:51,446
-Is it a "yes"?
-Sorry?

512
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,615
Yes, sure.

513
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,834
-Hi.
-What?

514
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,085
You two started dating?

515
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,879
-Congratulations.
-Looks good.

516
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:10,173
-Go already.
-Good luck.

517
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,466
-Good luck.
-Bye.

518
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,095
Wait, are we dating?

519
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,096
Yesterday…

520
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,099
you said yes.

521
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:23,269
If we're going to install safety posts
along this path,

522
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:26,105
we should widen this spacing
for convenience, right?

523
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,486
Wow, I guess you've been to Hong Kong.

524
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,445
What?

525
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,115
-Yes.
-It looks great on you.

526
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:40,036
I mean,

527
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,622
you should've clarified things properly.

528
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:45,750
When he showed up the next day
with flowers,

529
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,002
rambling about
"It's our second day together,"

530
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,339
you should've drawn the line.

531
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,344
Song, you thought ignoring it
was the best move, right?

532
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,808
I had no idea it'd last this long.

533
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,560
This is all Baek Do-ha's fault!

534
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,445
HERMANN PROJECT

535
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,412
TWO KOREAN ARCHITECTS SHAPE
THE NEW FACE OF NEW YORK

536
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:26,833
THE HERMANN PROJECT, NOW IN THE SPOTLIGHT
IN NEW YORK'S ARCHITECTURE SCENE…

537
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:36,050
After using all the connections,
he just left?

538
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,678
It doesn't make sense, right?
After all that.

539
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,222
Are you sure
Director Jeon left the project?

540
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,265
I don't know.

541
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:46,352
You must have heard Director Jeon
has stepped down due to health issues?

542
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,812
It caused disruptions

543
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:51,274
in the on-site oversight
and resident communications.

544
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,109
We'll need to make some adjustments.

545
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,611
There's been no disruption
in the on-site supervision,

546
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,071
or resident communication.

547
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:02,118
I've never gotten help from him,
nor did I ever allow it.

548
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,499
You're probably aren't familiar
coming from overseas.

549
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:11,669
Local projects have their own rules.

550
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:14,922
Especially in Pacheon,
due to its local context…

551
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:24,849
Sorry. But for some reason,
"due to local context…"

552
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,019
just cracks me up.

553
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:29,645
What?

554
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,148
What's so funny?

555
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,649
That the term "local context"

556
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:38,446
is often used to justify nepotism,
corruption and abuse of power.

557
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,661
Ms. Jeon, when I'm building something,

558
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,456
nothing annoys me more than things
I can't control,

559
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,293
especially nonsense that has
nothing to do with me. I really hate it.

560
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,589
So what are you going to do?

561
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,508
Reinforcing the structure,
installing systems, and the interior…

562
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,677
All that's left now is construction.

563
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,764
If the Public Architecture Department
is out and there's no control,

564
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,474
the same problems can happen again.

565
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,187
I'll revise it.

566
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,691
We've got only three days
before the next stage,

567
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,526
and you'll redo all of them?

568
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,698
Once I revise the plans,

569
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,909
I hope we won't need
these kind of meetings.

570
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,372
Promise me in front of everyone.

571
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:50,685
Did Do-ha draw all the detailed
construction plans here as well?

572
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:57,024
He probably handled
the material cost calculations too, right?

573
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,777
He can't trust anyone
with even a small detail.

574
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,072
Let's figure out
what we can do in this situation.

575
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:07,660
Is it okay if we do whatever we want?

576
00:38:07,743 --> 00:38:11,330
Yes. I know Do-ha's plans
better than he does.

577
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,833
I'm two years his senior.

578
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,627
I was jealous of
and annoyed by Do-ha's work,

579
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:18,713
so I studied and analyzed them.

580
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:22,591
I can instantly spot his habits
and design intentions from his plans.

581
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,969
These exterior walls
that stick out randomly

582
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,013
are meant to bear the weight of signs.

583
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,640
He probably wants
to minimize changes to the exterior walls

584
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,183
to preserve that school vibe.

585
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,690
We need to run BIM
as soon as the design is updated.

586
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,817
-Can you handle that?
-Of course.

587
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,945
With the BIM data,
we should calculate the material--

588
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:43,863
I'll do it.

589
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,117
For some materials,
I even memorize the price per unit.

590
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,120
You might have to stay up all night
since it's real time.

591
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,706
-Are you okay with that?
-Of course.

592
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,459
We often work late, so it's not a problem.

593
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,088
I'm responsible for this project.
I'll do it if it's needed.

594
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,721
Hey, you're back.

595
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,314
Why are you doing that?
That's supposed to be our team's job.

596
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:22,193
We need all hands on deck.
The project's in crisis since Jeon left.

597
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,491
And I feel partly responsible
for him leaving.

598
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,286
He didn't quit because of you.

599
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,708
What's that supposed to mean?
Do you know why he quit?

600
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:41,003
Ms. Jeon explained earlier
that he quit due to health issues.

601
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,548
It's hard to finish it
within your current timeline.

602
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,800
Our team will take over.

603
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:47,885
I said, I can do it.

604
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,222
How will you manage that?

605
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,432
Would you have said that
if it were So-hee?

606
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:57,395
Of course not. You would've trusted her.

607
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,523
You don't trust me, do you?

608
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,610
-That's not it. I'm worried about you.
-Exactly.

609
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,279
Why are you worrying about me?

610
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,410
I'm just working on the project
I'm in charge of.

611
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,593
PACHEON
WHERE NATURE BREATHES

612
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,845
Da-ye, look at this.

613
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,349
MATERIAL QUANTITY SHEET

614
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,809
It all looks correct.

615
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,978
How did you finish all this so quickly?

616
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,521
Look carefully. Don't just skim.

617
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:44,525
We need it sent by 4:00 p.m.,
so go over it three times before then.

618
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,610
Three times?

619
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,696
We can't be embarrassed over a mistake.

620
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,322
Got it.

621
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,452
INCOMING CALL
LEE HA-JU, PUBLIC RELATIONS TEAM

622
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,415
Hello?

623
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:04,128
I was going to delete it on my end
without reporting it,

624
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,922
but I thought you should take a look.

625
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,676
You can check it and then delete it.

626
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,889
Gosh, Song Ha-gyeong's such a pain.

627
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:20,227
I went easy on her since everyone
dotes on her as "Dr. Song" in Patan,

628
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,480
and now she's backstabbing me.

629
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,232
No, that was two years ago.

630
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:28,444
My reputation was in the gutter
because of the lawsuit,

631
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:31,739
so I tried to lure her in
to rebuild my reputation.

632
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,991
How do I make her regret messing with me?

633
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,619
Seriously.

634
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,165
I need to hang up.

635
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,714
Hey, hang on. What's wrong?
Just talk to me.

636
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:05,648
Do you know why
I've put up with scum like you?

637
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:09,109
Because I wanted
to finish this project smoothly.

638
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,612
It matters that much to me.

639
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,531
But I regret it.

640
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:15,699
I should've dealt
with a loser like you first.

641
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:19,703
Then we wouldn't have been in this mess.

642
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:20,829
You're insane.

643
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,832
Do you know who I am?

644
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,293
I do. I know perfectly well.

645
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,255
You'd be shocked
if you knew what I know.

646
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,172
Can you handle it?

647
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:32,841
What do you mean?

648
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,845
You're dressed in designer items
head to toe.

649
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,599
That's a nice watch.

650
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:45,563
I even know the company
and the person who gave you that watch.

651
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,898
I'm not like Ha-gyeong,

652
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,067
I won't stop
at a seven-million won fine.

653
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:52,736
I won't repeat myself.

654
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,781
Quit on your own
and stay away from Ha-gyeong.

655
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,412
If you show up in front of her
one more time…

656
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,082
you'll find out how far I'll go.

657
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:08,085
Director Baek.

658
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,129
Try to calm down and listen.

659
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,813
Have you lost your mind?
I heard you made Director Jeon quit.

660
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:29,607
Is that true?

661
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:34,194
Answer me. I already heard everything.

662
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,613
What's your deal?

663
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,741
Why are you doing the very thing
you can't stand?

664
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:41,410
Why are you bringing personal feelings
into work?

665
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,370
It was a work matter.

666
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:47,416
He's made trouble at every point.

667
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,502
I managed it all professionally.

668
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:52,921
Did you come to Korea for this?

669
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,382
Baek Do-ha.

670
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,510
Do you go totally irrational
whenever Ha-gyeong is around?

671
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:02,056
Every time you're involved with her,
you're at your worst.

672
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,726
You stick together
and tear each other down.

673
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,146
-Is that what keeps you going?
-Hey.

674
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:39,259
As for Jeon Nam-jin… from lending
his license to an unlicensed builder,

675
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,261
to political lobbying and bid-rigging,

676
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,431
he was the main risk in this project.

677
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:47,226
There were signs
the contractor tried to lobby,

678
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:48,894
so I was going to let him go anyway.

679
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,522
It wasn't for you.

680
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,736
And you didn't have to come.

681
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,738
You could've just emailed
the material sheet.

682
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:05,077
There was a camera
the PR team left outside that day.

683
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,622
It caught everything.

684
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,582
I saw the whole footage.

685
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,253
It wasn't because of me?

686
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,589
It is because of me.

687
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:22,803
So what?

688
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,723
-What?
-You expect me to do nothing?

689
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,524
You knew everything.

690
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:38,402
You know why I sued Jeon Nam-jin.

691
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:41,363
Yes.

692
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,243
I saw the lawsuit papers…

693
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,913
while fixing your place.

694
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,000
Yes, I just got here.

695
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,794
Just the external wall and roof?

696
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:57,880
Okay.

697
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,637
CRIMINAL LITIGATION
CIVIL LITIGATION

698
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:15,063
JONG-MAN
PROPERTY DAMAGE CHARGE

699
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,279
FINAL STATEMENT

700
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,335
So, all you've done
since arriving in Korea

701
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,962
is butt heads with that crazy jerk,

702
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:42,674
waste time trying to kick him out,
and give up on your project.

703
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,678
And all of that was for me.

704
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,058
The brilliant architect Baek Do-ha

705
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:53,185
came to this tiny town, Pacheon,
to do that?

706
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,856
Like Yoon So-hee said,
we're toxic to each other.

707
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,774
Song Ha-gyeong.

708
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,323
That's not true.

709
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:12,704
Sir, the inspectors are waiting
for the reinforcement evaluation meeting.

710
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,082
Push it back by 30 minutes.

711
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,041
Sorry?

712
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:18,919
I don't think that's possible
since we have another meeting.

713
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,171
-Then just ten. That should be okay.
-Sure.

714
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,008
-Go ahead.
-No, I can talk with you first.

715
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,553
-Just go!
-Then you're going to run away again!

716
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:28,804
I'm not going anywhere!

717
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:34,393
I don't want you to push back the meeting
because of me.

718
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,190
I'll be waiting at the café downstairs.

719
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,609
We'll talk there after your meeting.

720
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,081
We're set to start the reinforcement work
next week.

721
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:59,293
But the recent rain has weakened
the ground a bit.

722
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:00,669
And take a look at this.

723
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:04,339
This part where the domes meet
carries a lot of weight.

724
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,633
So please take a look here.

725
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:13,098
Behind Ha-gyeong's mean words,
there's always something left unsaid.

726
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,267
I was so over it, so I told him to cut it.

727
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:19,104
Why are you overreacting?
It's just a tree.

728
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,774
I'm sorry.

729
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:28,447
I'm so sorry.

730
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,574
There's nothing precious here to fix.

731
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:40,459
This space is huge.
It's like a condensed version of my life.

732
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,419
I'm so sick of it!

733
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:44,796
Ha-gyeong.

734
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,798
Do you really want me…

735
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,594
to disappear from your life?

736
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,096
Yes.

737
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,140
Your twisted words

738
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,392
and that look

739
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,686
convinced me.

740
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,229
Aren't you sick of this place?

741
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,106
But you never showed up.

742
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,316
She waits for me.

743
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,734
I feel nothing when I see you.

744
00:49:07,569 --> 00:49:08,695
She's been waiting.

745
00:49:11,948 --> 00:49:13,200
Don't ever come back.

746
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:14,910
She likes me.

747
00:49:14,993 --> 00:49:16,119
I want to keep…

748
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,873
blaming you and living the way I have.

749
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:22,793
Without you.

750
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:25,003
She likes me.

751
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:30,217
Mr. Shin, please share the rest.

752
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:31,885
I'll head out now.

753
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,809
Shall we move on?

754
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:09,506
The bus arriving shortly is…

755
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,637
Ha-gyeong!

756
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:36,199
I can't believe
we keep running into each other like this.

757
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:37,951
It's crazy.

758
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:42,330
Though to be exact,
it's not really a coincidence.

759
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,334
You probably came
out of Mr. Baek's office.

760
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,253
His office is less than 150 meters on foot

761
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:50,922
from our law firm.

762
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,469
How can you be so sure
I came from his office?

763
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:00,724
First, the bus stop you were at
was in the direction of his office.

764
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:03,977
And this look on your face clearly shows

765
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:07,606
you just went head-to-head with him.

766
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:14,613
What does that face
actually look like?

767
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:19,534
You look angry, yet bitter,

768
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,203
and strangely…

769
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,288
sad.

770
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:28,502
Does that show?

771
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,629
Yes, it does.

772
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,933
Mind if I ask for some advice?
Are your fees high?

773
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,436
I'm not here as a lawyer.
You can tell me.

774
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:52,526
There's a fool with a solid future…

775
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,403
and a fancy imported car.

776
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,073
But this fool ditched it all

777
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:01,451
and showed up on a tractor
at a Peanut House in Patan-myeon.

778
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,328
The fool.

779
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:05,747
Let's call them "B."

780
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,127
All B does is…

781
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,047
Let's call this "A."

782
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:18,301
He gets involved with A
and deals with some pathetic garbage.

783
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:21,680
Based on the context,
that pathetic garbage is C.

784
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:26,893
Then a fight broke out,
and they ended up in the mud.

785
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,230
So, A falls into the mud
while trying to break it up.

786
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:35,485
But as for A,
A was managing okay.

787
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,280
A was not exactly in serious trouble,

788
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:41,408
but was trudging along a sandy beach.

789
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,702
When A and B met,

790
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,579
both ended up…

791
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,665
in a mess.

792
00:52:49,916 --> 00:52:50,750
That's not good.

793
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,503
What should I do?

794
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:57,382
I'd like your advice
as the lawyer representing B and C.

795
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,929
I'll speak as A's opponent.

796
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:05,932
It's up to A.

797
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:08,602
Want to get out of the mud?

798
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:11,938
Just get out.

799
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:16,401
A, is your leg bothering you?

800
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:25,035
How old do you think

801
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:26,828
I look?

802
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:29,289
To me…

803
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,834
you look like someone

804
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,379
who is persistent and driven enough
to beat a seasoned lawyer

805
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,882
and who is good at
the back-and-forth exchanges.

806
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:41,217
You look like a 29-year-old, Ha-gyeong.

807
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,218
Right?

808
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,890
I think I'm fine
as long as I'm not with Do-ha.

809
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,478
I agree.

810
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:57,901
When you're with Mr. Baek Do-ha,
you look like an 18-year-old.

811
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:03,740
But…

812
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,117
not with me.

813
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:07,994
With me, you can

814
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,789
just be your current self.

815
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:31,226
Your Honor…

816
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:35,438
that tree wasn't just mine alone.

817
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:37,691
It was a symbol of the bond

818
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,568
connecting me and my friend

819
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,737
over a 13-hour time difference

820
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,531
and over 10,000 kilometers between us.

821
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,282
For that reason…

822
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,827
it was very precious to me

823
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,413
in and of itself.

824
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:58,962
That friend, too,
was living a lonely life abroad.

825
00:55:02,924 --> 00:55:06,845
That tree gave us hope that

826
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,055
someday,

827
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:12,142
we too could put down roots like it,

828
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:15,061
even if we hadn't yet.

829
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,816
Looking at the tree,

830
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:22,736
I hoped my friend would someday

831
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,072
be able to put down roots somewhere.

832
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,657
BAEK DO-HA

833
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:29,367
I've tended to the tree

834
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:31,995
holding onto that hope.

835
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,507
Grow strong and tall.

836
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,385
Don't be like Do-ha.

837
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:51,306
I watered it, fed it…

838
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,601
Don't get sick, Jong-man.

839
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:56,478
…and protected it from pests each season,

840
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:58,772
hoping the tree would grow well

841
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:03,651
and that my friend wouldn't be lonely
just like the tree.

842
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,739
All for the 21 days
my friend gets to see the tree

843
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:09,824
when he comes back to Korea,

844
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:12,702
I spent 344 days caring for the tree.

845
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:14,829
JONG-MAN

846
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:18,208
That time was never hard for me.

847
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,167
SHARE PHOTOS
MESSAGE

848
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:20,919
I felt happy.

849
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:24,589
I wanted my friend

850
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,300
to realize that

851
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:31,137
at least one person is waiting for him.

852
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:35,183
The moment the tree was cut,

853
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:37,769
I was scared.

854
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:40,355
You!

855
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:44,984
I was worried that my friend might
never be able to put down roots,

856
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:48,696
that he'd end up trapped alone

857
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,407
in a deep, dark loneliness.

858
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:56,246
Far in the future,
even if I'm not the one waiting,

859
00:56:57,413 --> 00:57:00,291
I thought,
as long as the tree waits for my friend,

860
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:02,877
it will give him

861
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,381
the strength to face the world.

862
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,093
Your Honor…

863
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,262
to the plaintiff,

864
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:14,556
this is not just a tree

865
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:19,602
but the very essence of a heart
built over time.

866
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,771
So please…

867
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,567
hold the defendant accountable

868
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,445
with the weight of the law.

869
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:32,258
What happened?

870
00:58:35,261 --> 00:58:36,638
You said you wouldn't run away.

871
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:39,933
You said you'd wait.

872
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,561
To finish what I was saying earlier,

873
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,355
Jeon Nam-jin…

874
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,402
Never mind. Forget that nonsense.

875
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:53,863
Fine.

876
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:56,616
I'll tell you everything.

877
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,537
I knew it from the beginning.

878
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,207
From the moment I came back.

879
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:08,253
I knew you'd been looking
after our tree alone

880
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,089
and waiting for me.

881
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,467
But I still asked

882
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:17,262
what had happened to our tree.

883
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:20,056
You never told me the truth
till the end.

884
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:25,687
After waiting for me the whole time,
you push me away.

885
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:29,440
But that was okay.

886
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,276
Because I know you.

887
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,611
Because this summer is long.

888
00:59:35,321 --> 00:59:37,156
If I show you more of myself

889
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:38,992
and show you how I feel--

890
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:39,909
No.

891
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:44,205
You don't have to.

892
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:51,212
There's no need to show me
more of yourself or your feelings.

893
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,425
Listen.

894
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,720
We got off to a bad start.
It's too tangled to fix.

895
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,557
This is just how we are.

896
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,559
We keep setting traps,

897
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:06,394
playing games,

898
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,647
and pretending to give in.

899
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,737
All we ever do is fight when we meet.

900
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,450
Without Do-young to mediate,

901
01:00:22,201 --> 01:00:23,578
we can't even make up.

902
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,038
Hey, Song Ha-gyeong, you…

903
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:26,581
But you know what?

904
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,835
When you're with Yoon So-hee…

905
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,213
you look really cool.

906
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,344
She really cares about you and likes you.

907
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:42,597
It's a relief…

908
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:47,560
you have at least one person like that.

909
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:54,067
Go.

910
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,487
Go where you belong.

911
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:04,077
I've decided to date Seo Su-hyeok.

912
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,255
When you're with Mr. Baek Do-ha,

913
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:19,092
you look like an 18-year-old.

914
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:24,138
But…

915
01:01:25,556 --> 01:01:26,891
not with me.

916
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:32,021
With me,
you can just be your current self.

917
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,736
Remember I mentioned
that I had two questions?

918
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:42,240
One.

919
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:46,035
Why does it bother me
to be misunderstood by you?

920
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:48,037
And why am I upset

921
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,332
that you don't remember me?

922
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,757
I think…

923
01:02:01,175 --> 01:02:03,469
I have feelings for you.

924
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,187
Go out with me.

925
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:15,648
Let's try dating…

926
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:19,902
like adults.

927
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:11,162
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

928
01:03:11,245 --> 01:03:14,415
Why did you ask me
to introduce you to Su-hyeok?

929
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:17,126
Things just line up perfectly,
unlike with you and me.

930
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,505
I don't understand what you're thinking.

931
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:24,091
You handled both lawsuits
and now you're with Ha-gyeong.

932
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:25,927
Is this jealousy?

933
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,514
Ha-gyeong?

934
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:33,476
You act like I'm not here at all
and come home late on purpose.

935
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:34,811
Number one, my foot.

936
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:37,104
For summer, I'll make you my number one.

937
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:39,816
-Hey, Baek Do-ha.
-Ha-gyeong.

938
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:40,775
Are you free today?

939
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:42,652
What? Having him over?

940
01:03:43,236 --> 01:03:45,988
I like you.
I've never once stopped liking you.

941
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:47,824
We're not going home today.
