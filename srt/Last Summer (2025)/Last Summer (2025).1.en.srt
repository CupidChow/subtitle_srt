1
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,594
Dear Your Honor.

2
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:53,970
Hello.

3
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,515
I'm Song Ha-gyeong, plaintiff
in the co-owned property case.

4
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,231
Your Honor,
how familiar are you with Pacheon?

5
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,693
You may not be familiar with it at all.

6
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,155
I haven't met anyone in the legal field
who lives here.

7
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,240
Maybe because we're near the DMZ.

8
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:16,201
Hey, Dr. Song.

9
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,411
-Good morning.
-Have a good day.

10
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:36,846
People believe Pacheon

11
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,225
would be the first place to be hit
if a war ever started.

12
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:44,229
But for me,
every single day already feels like a war.

13
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,732
Son of a… 18.

14
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,109
I'm not cursing.

15
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,070
I should probably introduce Bus 18.

16
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:56,741
The bus comes every 40 minutes,
stops at five villages, and has 18 seats.

17
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:07,168
Back when I was 18, 11 years ago,
it was even worse.

18
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,379
Hey, the bus is here!

19
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,134
It only came every 80 minutes
and made stops in ten villages.

20
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:17,095
Sir! Sir!

21
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,474
I had to throw myself onto the road
just to catch the bus.

22
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:22,725
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,228
Come on, get on.

24
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,940
The place where I had to risk my life
every day just to get to school

25
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,234
is Pacheon's northernmost point,

26
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,527
Patan.

27
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,070
Let's get on.

28
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,953
For the past 17 years, Patan…

29
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,497
has slowly…

30
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,545
shaped me into
a pretty wrecked human being.

31
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,297
Say something.

32
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,008
Get lost.

33
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,095
Let's not see each other again.

34
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,266
I really hate Patan.

35
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,268
PATAN WHERE YOUTH ARE HAPPY!

36
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,814
If you help me
get out of this miserable village,

37
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,733
I'll never cause any trouble

38
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:14,485
or file any complaints.
I'll live quietly from now on.

39
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,279
Your Honor.

40
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,117
Please have some compassion
for this wrecked soul.

41
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,685
Oh, Patan

42
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:53,149
You've truly ignored me, Patan

43
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,444
We have no bribes to give
So we cannot reach you

44
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:57,570
NO BUS ROUTE CHANGE!

45
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,364
ADMINISTRATIVE MESS

46
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,908
Oh, Patan

47
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:05,119
Patan's administration is wrecked,
wake up!

48
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,037
Wake up!

49
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,997
GO, PATAN!
STRONG AS EVER

50
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,000
26TH PACHEON SOYBEAN FESTIVAL

51
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,505
Good morning, sir.

52
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,427
TOWN REVITALIZATION TEAM
SONG HA-GYEONG

53
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:26,182
You've truly ignored me, Patan
We have no bribes to give

54
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,268
EXPENSE FORM
SCREEN SAVER PASSWORD

55
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,233
Oh, Patan

56
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,777
-Hey, Ms. Song.
-Yeah?

57
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,447
That elder leader
was your dad's classmate, right?

58
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,077
To be precise,
the seniors' association secretary

59
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,454
went to school with my dad's cousin.

60
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:54,294
Perfect. Go calm them down.
It's so loud, I can't get anything done.

61
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:56,963
Use your own school connections.

62
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,257
-Isn't he your senior too?
-Oh, man!

63
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:05,805
I should be able to handle it
after 2:00 p.m.

64
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:09,475
You told me to submit this
by 2:00 p.m. today.

65
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:13,855
But at exactly 2:00 p.m.,
a reporter from Domin Ilbo is coming.

66
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,898
What's more urgent, the report or that?

67
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:22,280
So… if I get them to leave by 2:00 p.m.,

68
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,615
what would you do for me?

69
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,201
So, it's another deal, huh?

70
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,245
So noisy.

71
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,581
Okay. Anything you want.

72
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:33,958
Deal.

73
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:36,419
Listen! Listen!

74
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:44,260
Wait. We called for the chief.
Why are you here?

75
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,180
-Pass it to them.
-Okay.

76
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,768
Everyone, take one each.
Please pass them around.

77
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:53,561
Share it together.

78
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,771
FILING A COMPLAINT

79
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,274
If you're near-sighted,
check the handouts.

80
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:02,612
If you're far-sighted,
please look at the board.

81
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,698
Just follow these steps. Step one.

82
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,243
Search "Pacheon City Hall"
in your browser.

83
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,328
Step two.

84
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:14,040
Go to the Pacheon City Hall website.
Step three.

85
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,044
Select the "Civil Services" menu
on the top left.

86
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:23,216
Step four. Click "Write" at
the bottom right and lastly step five.

87
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,428
Fill out your complaint,
then click "submit" at the bottom.

88
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,513
Do you understand?

89
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:32,391
Wait. What if the township head
deletes everything?

90
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:36,062
You must think we know nothing
about the Internet.

91
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,023
This goes straight to City Hall,
so he has no control.

92
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,026
The mayor, who is higher, will see it.

93
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,821
The mayor outranks the township head.

94
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,449
Is the mayor going to punish them
for this?

95
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,495
Look at you all dressed up today.

96
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:56,207
And from the tile-roofed house.

97
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,750
Hello, Baduk Director.

98
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,211
Stone-fence house elder,
the crab place owner.

99
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,382
And Mr. Song, who went to middle school
with my distant uncle.

100
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,510
I've lived in this town for 17 years.

101
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,596
Who do you think put up that streetlight?

102
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,308
I did, in seventh grade.

103
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,769
Who bundled up that tree for the winter?

104
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,649
I did, when I was in eighth grade.

105
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:25,319
All of this was accomplished
by filing complaints myself.

106
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:29,157
I'm sure you can make it happen too.

107
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,325
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

108
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,996
All right, shall we go eat now?

109
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,541
Let's go, we need it
to wring the township head's neck.

110
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,376
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

111
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:42,753
The restaurant is that way.

112
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,762
She's an ace, through and through.

113
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,183
They call her "Dr. Song of Patan"
for a reason.

114
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,351
Ha-gyeong, join our team.

115
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,105
Please, take her already.

116
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,358
In our town,
we don't need a smart ace.

117
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,277
What we need is someone

118
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,447
who just does their job
without causing trouble.

119
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,200
Still, you know…

120
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,202
the fence removal project?

121
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,789
-It's down to the final presentation.
-Right.

122
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,752
When did she manage
to submit that application so cleverly?

123
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,255
It needs over 400 million won in funding.

124
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,049
Would City Hall even approve it?

125
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,051
If you manage to land the project--

126
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:31,427
If I do…

127
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,514
you'll definitely back me up this time.

128
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,689
It's almost lunchtime.
Let's head out for lunch.

129
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,525
It's on me.

130
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,985
-How about kimchi stew?
-Sounds good.

131
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,738
Don't you know
Ms. Song never eats out in Patan?

132
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,073
This isn't new.

133
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,742
Enjoy your meal.

134
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,327
I feel sick.

135
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,916
HAPPY REAL ESTATE

136
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,584
Hello?

137
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,795
The air's so clean, right?

138
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,714
You couldn't be luckier.

139
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:13,219
Right next to this house is a stream,
and Mount Patan is right behind.

140
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:16,556
Perfect for staying healthy.
Three generations together?

141
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,642
-Yes.
-This house is perfect for you.

142
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,270
You'll know the second you see it.

143
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,273
Just in time. The owner's here.

144
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,025
-Dr. Song.
-Hi.

145
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,446
Our Dr. Song is the number one
civil servant in our town.

146
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,574
Grade 7 official.

147
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,451
She's young, owns a house,
and is really sharp.

148
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,538
-Let's head inside.
-Let's head inside.

149
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,043
-Come on in.
-So big.

150
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,255
-Right?
-Yes.

151
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,467
Come on in.

152
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,721
It's nice, isn't it?

153
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,434
It's south-facing,
so it gets plenty of sunlight.

154
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:05,146
It's built with wood,
and it's well-insulated. Take a look.

155
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,524
The interior's finished really nicely.

156
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,234
It really is.

157
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,528
The interior is really stylish.

158
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,031
Even though it's old, it's neat.

159
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:20,328
My parents did these themselves,
so they won't fall or break.

160
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,579
I see.

161
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,958
My father was an architect,
so he was really handy.

162
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,045
Next door, Mr. Baek, is also an architect.

163
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:33,633
They're friends, so they built
this fun house to share happy memories.

164
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,719
How long have you lived here?

165
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,471
-About 17 years.
-I see.

166
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,057
How many people are living here now?

167
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:47,730
Right now, it's just me,
but ten people used to live here.

168
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,398
There's plenty of space.

169
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,405
Whose dog is this?

170
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,576
-Take a look.
-This is nice too.

171
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,996
Where are we?

172
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,123
-So cute.
-Isn't it nice?

173
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,833
-What's his name?
-Su-bak.

174
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,087
-Hi, Su-bak.
-Hi, Su-bak, you're so cute.

175
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:15,424
So, this place can be accessed
from both doors,

176
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:18,427
from this house and that house?

177
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,512
That's right.

178
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:23,099
It'd make a great spot
for hanging out and talking.

179
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,142
Who made this?

180
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,021
Sorry, you can't touch this.

181
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,902
You want to check the rest?
I don't have much time.

182
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,405
Please come in.

183
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,659
Let's come inside.

184
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,911
Come in.

185
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:50,418
Great study room for the kids.
The walls are packed with bookshelves.

186
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,963
But this wall seems too thin.

187
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,047
Is that so?

188
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,137
It's thin since it's drywall,
but the insulation is fine.

189
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,638
Heating's no problem.

190
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,766
What is this?

191
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,438
What's this hole?

192
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,566
Here too.

193
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:20,739
Mr. Baek's son I mentioned earlier
lived next door since childhood.

194
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,701
The hole must be from
when they were bickering.

195
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:31,083
It was so rowdy. The whole neighborhood
could hear the racket they made.

196
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,128
May I ask you something?

197
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,758
Are you thinking about any repairs
or renovations?

198
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:45,931
No, it has everything it needs.
I'd like to live here as it is.

199
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,057
Right.

200
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,768
You intend to live here, right?

201
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:53,564
You won't turn it into a rental
or a second home?

202
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:57,526
No, we're looking for a house
our family can live in long-term.

203
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,362
I see.

204
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,156
VISIT LIST
ACTUAL RESIDENCE

205
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:04,366
-Get back soon. Thank you.
-Sure.

206
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,452
Don't wait too long, or it will be taken.

207
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,371
Bye.

208
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:16,462
It's empty next door. I told you
to hand me the key if you're busy.

209
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,548
NOTHING UNUSUAL, THE BEST FIT

210
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,842
Who's supposed to be happy with whom?

211
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,304
-Things sorted out with Mr. Baek?
-Of course.

212
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,389
THEY'LL DECIDE IN THREE DAYS

213
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:28,557
HOUSE VISIT LIST

214
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,631
Do-ha, you're not going to
let her sell the house, are you?

215
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,927
What's your next move?

216
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:09,557
You wouldn't have come back
without a plan.

217
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,650
PACHEON CITY HALL

218
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:22,152
On the left is Patan town,

219
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:26,031
on the right is Taehwa city.
Do you see the difference?

220
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,158
-No fence?
-That's correct.

221
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,244
On the right, there's no fence.

222
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,412
Taehwa city

223
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:35,374
tore down the fences, creating green space
the size of 55 soccer fields.

224
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,711
They fixed parking issues,
improving alleys,

225
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,713
revitalizing local businesses.

226
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,173
If we remove the fences in Patan,

227
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,635
we could fix parking problems
and boost the local economy.

228
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,721
I'll take questions.

229
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,514
As Traffic Department,

230
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:54,894
if parking is the issue,
a different solution might be better.

231
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,564
As you know,
Patan isn't allowed a parking tower

232
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,524
as it would ruin the scenery.

233
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,027
Also, removing the fence costs less

234
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,363
than building a parking tower,
so it's more efficient.

235
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,366
Speaking of budget,
this costs 400 million won.

236
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,953
Isn't it too big a project
for the office to manage?

237
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:17,082
It might be a big project for the office,

238
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:22,129
but not for me.
It's the smallest one I've ever handled.

239
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:27,217
As you know,
Yeonjin had to stop their fence project

240
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:31,513
because they couldn't
get the residents to agree.

241
00:15:32,222 --> 00:15:36,185
Even if the fence is public,
the land's private, right?

242
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,357
Thank you for the question I expected,
Ms. Jeon from Architecture.

243
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,320
I'll get all the residents' consent
within a week.

244
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,534
It's not that hard.

245
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,997
I managed this all the time
when I worked at the city office.

246
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,920
-Yes?
-Why do you want this project?

247
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:06,966
I've…

248
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:11,929
lived in Patan for 17 years.
I've wanted to fix this.

249
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,349
I've filed complaints for 17 years,

250
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,101
but nothing's been done.

251
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,814
I've had enough,
so I'm going to make a change.

252
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:28,237
It's right before the reshuffle,
no one's going to help. Can you manage?

253
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,030
Yes, I can.

254
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:33,742
That settles it.
I'll give the final approval.

255
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,708
-Was it Officer Song Ha-gyeong?
-Yes, that's right.

256
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,336
I've got high hopes.
See you at the office again.

257
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,130
Thank you.

258
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,886
Yes!

259
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:54,680
Yeah.

260
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,308
Really? They're accepting all conditions?

261
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,813
Sounds great. I'm on my way now.

262
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,899
REAL ESTATE

263
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,029
-Hi.
-Come on in.

264
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:12,031
Dr. Song, come over here.

265
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,366
Just a second.

266
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,078
I thought your talk
with Mr. Baek went well.

267
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,166
It did, he gave me full authority
over all the sales. Why?

268
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,835
Did you get Mr. Baek's seal?

269
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:29,465
Sure, I've got the power of attorney,
the seal, and seal certificate.

270
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,177
-Let me see.
-The power of attorney.

271
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,303
The seal certificate.

272
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,434
Baek Gi-ho,
that's Mr. Baek's full name, right?

273
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,145
-Baek Gi-ho?
-That's right, Baek Gi-ho.

274
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,489
CO-OWNER
BAEK DO-HA

275
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,493
Baek Do-ha?

276
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:01,246
Mr. Baek, what's going on?
Do-ha's in Seoul now?

277
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,873
Since when?

278
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:06,043
No, that's not important.

279
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,379
You put me in charge for the sale.

280
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,548
Why is it suddenly under Do-ha?

281
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:17,179
He asked for a birthday gift and wanted
the ownership changed. How could I say no?

282
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,264
A gift?

283
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:22,726
He pestered me to buy him that ash tree.

284
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,313
That was the only thing.
He's never asked for anything.

285
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,941
How could I say no when he did?

286
00:18:29,024 --> 00:18:30,025
Mr. Baek!

287
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:36,073
Mr. Choi, don't forget your safety helmet.

288
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:39,827
Ha-gyeong, I'm a little busy.
Call Do-ha. We'll talk later.

289
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,328
Hello? Mr. Baek?

290
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,168
Yeah, right.

291
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,546
No wonder it was easy.

292
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,802
For a moment, I forgot

293
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:01,557
that my summers
are always ridiculously unlucky.

294
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,395
CO-OWNER
BAEK DO-HA, HALF SHARE

295
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,320
Do-ha hasn't changed his number.

296
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,740
He always does what you say.
Call him.

297
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,118
BAEK DO-HA

298
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,963
It's been so uneventful,
I'd completely forgotten

299
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,384
this miserable, brutal summer.

300
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,178
17 YEARS AGO

301
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:44,057
Right, that's when it started. In June,
I suddenly broke out in hives all over.

302
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,185
-Did you find out?
-A peanut allergy.

303
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,857
I thought it was food poisoning,
but it turned out to be a peanut allergy.

304
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,319
We should go somewhere once you're better.

305
00:19:55,402 --> 00:20:00,657
I started living in this insane place,
where it hit 37°C from early June,

306
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,160
when I was 12. It was summer.

307
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,870
-Peanut house?
-Yeah.

308
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:09,750
Didn't you hear I have a peanut allergy?

309
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,213
Peanut house, where two become one.

310
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:20,010
Isn't that adorable? It's meaningful.
So you'll be living with…

311
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:28,810
Ever since then,
my streak of bad luck

312
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,021
has been unbelievable.

313
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,106
4 YEARS AGO

314
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,901
Come on, save me here.

315
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,445
Listen while I'm being nice!

316
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:40,948
So hot.

317
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,117
3 YEARS AGO

318
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,626
Are you okay?

319
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:53,835
2 YEARS AGO

320
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,382
Why?

321
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,346
A YEAR AGO

322
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,474
JANGDAN SOYBEAN MEJU

323
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:26,201
Meeting a buyer who agrees to everything,
that's pure luck.

324
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,913
You've been hoping to leave.
Are you going to pass this up?

325
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,797
Hey, I heard you're back in Korea.

326
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:41,883
DAEGUK BANK

327
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,846
Hey.

328
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,768
Dang it.

329
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,478
What is it?

330
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,734
Baek Do-ha sent 500,000 won.

331
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:05,532
I went to the market,
and they already have pigweed.

332
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,994
I made it while chatting with Ha-gyeong,
and it's salty.

333
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,413
Still, Grandpa,

334
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,416
just take one bite
and two spoonfuls of rice.

335
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,918
Jeong Kyung-tae, this year he's 63.

336
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,880
His hands may be clumsy, but…

337
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:24,051
This time, I brought black rice,
mixed grain rice,

338
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,220
and even gondeure rice.

339
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:31,933
I brought a ton of things you like.
Heat them up and enjoy.

340
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,402
I'm sweating trying to talk to you.

341
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,780
Really? You'll keep ignoring me?

342
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,747
Isn't my grandpa too dramatic?

343
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,583
It's not like
I did something unforgivable.

344
00:22:56,666 --> 00:23:01,088
He's almost 80, but sometimes,
he acts like a moody teenager.

345
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:04,925
He cut ties
with his best friend of 60 years.

346
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,886
Ignoring me for five years
would be nothing.

347
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,930
Song, you know what I'm good at.

348
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,099
I don't give up.

349
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:21,149
Darn it, you talk now.
I want to eat something.

350
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:24,402
I've been rambling,
trying to get you to open up

351
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,530
for the whole 30 minutes.

352
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,741
This isn't small talk anymore.
Say something already.

353
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,493
What's with the suspense?

354
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:35,539
Hey. The ingredients are really fresh.
It's good. Go on, eat.

355
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,668
I'm past being surprised by your life.

356
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:43,046
I wasn't shocked when you got fired,

357
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:47,217
or when you went wild with
that sleek city hall guy two years back.

358
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,344
-I wasn't surprised--
-I contacted Do-ha.

359
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,643
He's been back in Korea for months.

360
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,314
I'm sure you knew.

361
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,277
There's no way
Seung-taek wouldn't meet him.

362
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,571
Well… Yeah…

363
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,031
Baek Do did come to Seoul.

364
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:14,953
Baek Do? Baek… You're really sweet.

365
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,498
You've secretly been keeping in touch?

366
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:24,921
Hey! I've only seen him a few times
in Seoul because of Seung-taek.

367
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:28,717
Of course. You'd stay close to Seung-taek.

368
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,887
What, you three got together

369
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,347
and bonded over gossiping about me?

370
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,809
We didn't talk behind your back.

371
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,478
Forget it. Tell me everything.

372
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:43,857
When did he come back?

373
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:46,735
He's taken over his dad's atelier.

374
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:49,738
He really is something,
he's not 30 yet.

375
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:54,701
You know the Seongsu Museum
from that article? He designed that.

376
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:58,788
He was on a whole different level.

377
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,795
It's not that I'm proud of Baek Do.

378
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,173
I just heard from Seung-taek.

379
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,884
Sometimes I see the familiar face
in the news.

380
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,387
Hey, let's be real. Baek Do's killing it.

381
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:18,099
Last year, in Korea,
he won the architecture award.

382
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,561
This year for the Pritzker Prize,
architecture's Nobel?

383
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:25,523
Why did that big shot come back?

384
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,527
It's summer.
Summer basically means Baek Do-ha.

385
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:33,406
By the way, he has no feelings for you.

386
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:37,869
You're the one
who hates even hearing his name.

387
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,496
He never talks about you.

388
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:42,958
Really?

389
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:44,834
Yeah.

390
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,545
-He doesn't seem to have feelings?
-Yeah.

391
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,840
Then why is there no reply from him?

392
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,678
I sent something
he was supposed to respond to.

393
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:57,555
What did you send?

394
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:06,523
That stubborn Song
got in touch with Do-ha at last.

395
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:10,110
When she said two years ago
that she was done with Do-ha,

396
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,279
I didn't expect she'd see him.

397
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:15,949
What do you think she said to him?
I'm dying to know.

398
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:18,451
Send the money first.

399
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,829
Did you forget our bet?

400
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,623
Who's going to reach out,
Ha-gyeong or Do-ha?

401
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,585
She always makes my life harder.

402
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,965
I sent you 100,000 won.

403
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,509
Wait, why only 100,000 won?
Should be double.

404
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:40,098
Seung-taek, the stocks are down by half,
I sent it taking that into account.

405
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,393
I'm smart, right?

406
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,897
I'm worried. I have this uneasy feeling.

407
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,610
Did Baek Do say anything to you?

408
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:56,281
He came back to Korea
because of Song, right?

409
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,158
You know something, don't you?

410
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:03,913
Having trouble sleeping tonight?

411
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,541
Do you know why?

412
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,919
It's because your brain is still at work.

413
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,965
So how does the brain work?

414
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:19,679
It stores memories by using your senses.

415
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:24,476
Smells, textures, sounds,

416
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,644
those powerful memories

417
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:30,148
leave deep traces in our minds.

418
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,570
To help you forget memories,
we've got ASMR to help you sleep.

419
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:40,617
Cicadas chirping, it's noisy, it's so hot.

420
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:44,162
It's annoying, I get annoyed by Baek Do…

421
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,548
Why can't these mosquitoes just disappear?

422
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,886
Right, I still have that storm warning
to deal with.

423
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,974
Stupid monsoon. I'm on duty tomorrow.

424
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:10,730
When will summer end?
Why did Do-ha come back?

425
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,441
What's with memories?

426
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:19,864
This jerk hasn't responded.

427
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,952
Why Baek Do-ha again?

428
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,303
BAEK DO-HA JUST SENT AN EMAIL

429
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,691
Meet at Star Cafe on June 5th at 7:00 p.m.

430
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:32,497
-You're Baek Do-ha's lawyer?
-I'm Seo Su-hyeok.

431
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,543
-Were you disappointed that I came?
-No, not at all.

432
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:40,338
I was just surprised.
I wasn't expecting his lawyer.

433
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,883
If you didn't want to see a lawyer,

434
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:46,219
why'd you send three notices in a week?

435
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:49,639
Including scary lines like,
"I'll enforce this by law"

436
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,724
and "I'll sue for emotional damages."

437
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:57,814
On second thought, it might be easier.

438
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:02,861
As you saw in the documents,
I handled everything according to the law.

439
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:06,114
With the power of attorney
I tried to sell the house,

440
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,784
but your client interfered illegally,
on the closing day.

441
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:14,038
It's caused me serious time
and financial losses.

442
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:18,376
I intend to act on everything
I mentioned in the notices.

443
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:21,629
I can't keep the buyers
waiting any longer. Bye.

444
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,218
Did you check the property records
on the day of the deal?

445
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:32,932
With a contract of this size,
you should have been more prepared.

446
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:36,811
You were a little underprepared.

447
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:42,734
Who actually checks the property records
every day?

448
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:47,113
If you did check,
you would've prevented such huge damage.

449
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,660
For now, I'll relay it that way.
Anything else?

450
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,919
I took out my favorite hammer drill.

451
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,465
He'll know what it means.

452
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:08,551
It's a limited model
he's been wanting for a while.

453
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,428
I'm going to use it today.

454
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:15,934
Also, tell him that the bench press
and hockey sticks will be sold.

455
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,144
There's not enough space.

456
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,943
And tell him to send more
for child support.

457
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:29,614
-He'll know what it means.
-Did you two have kids?

458
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,117
Not just the kids.

459
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:35,954
That's what she said.

460
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,538
CLIENT BAEK DO-HA

461
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,167
Hello? Mr. Baek? Can you hear me?

462
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:45,004
Yes, I'm listening.

463
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,132
I'd better go before she makes holes.

464
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,801
She does what she says.

465
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,136
-On top of that--
-After that…

466
00:32:55,932 --> 00:33:00,061
I guess she said she'd sell all my stuff,
like the hockey sticks.

467
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,397
Yes, that's exactly what she said.

468
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,901
She told you to send an extra 200,000 won
for child support.

469
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,570
She really hasn't changed.

470
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,990
All right, I'll call you back later.

471
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,209
PATAN,
WHERE PEOPLE AND NATURE COME TOGETHER

472
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,796
Where are you going?

473
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,423
-To the community center.
-Why?

474
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:31,342
Everyone's gathered there
to sign the consent forms.

475
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,762
That's what you're handling on your own.

476
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,932
Shouldn't our work come first?

477
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,435
Let's go catch some visitors.

478
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,151
Why isn't it coming out?

479
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,614
Oh, no! My eyes!

480
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:07,670
Way to go.

481
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:11,257
Mom!

482
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:17,597
Mom, Dad! What do I do?

483
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:20,475
Just go home. Get off work.

484
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,444
I really want to go home.

485
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,206
So noisy.

486
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:48,920
What?

487
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,343
Su-bak.

488
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,223
I'm home, Su-bak.

489
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,102
SU-BAK

490
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,605
Song Su-bak!

491
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,332
Su-bak?

492
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:41,681
-Hello?
-Seul, did you come to my place?

493
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,724
-Su-bak's not here.
-No.

494
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,434
Did you look everywhere?

495
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:50,690
-Oh, no. Should we go look together?
-Let me hang up.

496
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,024
Su-bak!

497
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,032
Su-bak!

498
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,453
-Ma'am, did you see Su-bak?
-No, what's going on?

499
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,913
I don't know. He's missing.

500
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:07,999
Su-bak!

501
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:09,667
Su-bak!

502
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,837
Song Su-bak!

503
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:17,550
Su-bak!

504
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,511
Su-bak.

505
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,629
Hey, Su-bak.

506
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,137
-Did you get a pay cut again?
-What?

507
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:49,517
I've been sending child support
every month, why's Su-bak so skinny?

508
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,025
Hey, Song Su-bak!

509
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,403
As always, stupid summer is no luck.

510
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,582
Come here.

511
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,253
Hey, you…

512
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:50,161
Here's a treat.

513
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,751
I'll give you two.

514
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,503
Let's go.

515
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,692
Seriously.

516
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:25,071
There's no treat. I tricked you.

517
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:28,991
We're even now. You betrayed me. Foot up.

518
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:33,913
Why did you follow him?
You should've bitten him.

519
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,706
You traitor.

520
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,507
I can't believe you. Hey!

521
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,219
-Hey!
-Good boy.

522
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,720
Come here, Su-bak!

523
00:39:55,893 --> 00:40:00,189
Hey, if you make it so obvious,
someone's going to get jealous.

524
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,566
Don't you know your mom holds grudges?

525
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,612
Ha-gyeong.

526
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:12,159
Send me the receipts. I've sent
500,000 won each month. What more?

527
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,244
Hey.

528
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,039
You know how picky Su-bak is?

529
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,458
The treat prices keep going up.

530
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:23,337
For grooming an old dog,
they charge extra.

531
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,339
There's an extra fee for an old dog.

532
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,219
You think you know childcare?
500,000 won isn't enough.

533
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,554
You wipe his feet.

534
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,976
Hey, why 500,000 won? What about you?

535
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:40,646
I take care of him 24/7.
I walk him two hours daily.

536
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:43,732
I buy supplements regularly
and take him to the vet.

537
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:46,318
My labor is more than 500,000 won, okay?

538
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,534
You haven't changed.

539
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,704
What are you looking at?

540
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,838
Song Ha-gyeong.

541
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,258
It's been a while.

542
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,970
It's been two years, right?

543
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:17,850
Stop.

544
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,021
I don't feel like making small talk.

545
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,027
Have a seat.
You came here to say something.

546
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:38,329
-You hired a lawyer.
-Someone sent notices.

547
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:40,122
Your dad gave me the POA.

548
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,582
He gave it back to me.

549
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,504
With your comfy life in the States,

550
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,464
you have no idea

551
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:51,467
how much real estate has changed,
even in Patan.

552
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,514
If we miss this chance,
who knows when it'll sell.

553
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,890
Maybe it won't sell.

554
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:02,686
Three generations under one roof.
They seem nice, I want to sell it.

555
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,066
So?

556
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:11,779
I know you're busy.

557
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:16,659
Hand me your seal and the consent form,
and I'll handle the rest.

558
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:21,914
Why are you so eager to sell?

559
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,125
You would know the reason best.

560
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:34,426
You might not realize it,
but if this doesn't sell now,

561
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,179
I might be stuck
for five or 10 more years.

562
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,848
-Aren't you sick of this place?
-No.

563
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,433
But you never showed up?

564
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,776
You told me not to.

565
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,572
You said you'd kill me if I showed up.

566
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,450
Then why bother coming?

567
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,540
You're driving me nuts.

568
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,128
You said you'd drill a hole.

569
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,589
You know I love that hockey stick,

570
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,383
and you said you'd sell it.

571
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:18,178
I'm so soft-hearted.
I do whatever you tell me.

572
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,931
If you say so, I leave, then I'm here.

573
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:24,518
We haven't changed at all, right?

574
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,315
-You're excited.
-I just got my own place recently.

575
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:34,486
It's nice that you're actually
talking to me after two years.

576
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,658
I need to wash up,
I came straight from the site.

577
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,410
What?

578
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:43,245
Hey.

579
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,664
Hey.

580
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:48,292
What gives you the right to shower here?

581
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,419
Why not? It's my house, I can wash up.

582
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:54,757
I'm being nice,
either go to Seoul or get out of my face.

583
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,970
Don't you realize you keep following me?

584
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,932
-Hey, Baek Do-ha.
-Song Ha-gyeong.

585
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:11,106
-You started something ridiculous again.
-What?

586
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,817
I heard you're pushing
for a fence removal project.

587
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,778
You think that works architecturally?

588
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:20,115
How'd you know? Are you stalking me?

589
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,910
Hey, everyone's talking about you here.

590
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:27,373
Dr. Song, master of complaints, gutsy nut
who crossed the boss and got demoted.

591
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,418
-Just as I thought, Ha-gyeong.
-Hey.

592
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:36,090
You got a death wish?
You really want to get beat up?

593
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:39,468
I thought you'd be different.
But just as I expected.

594
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:42,137
You said, "Just as I expected"

595
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,516
more than a few times now.
Say it one more time.

596
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,017
What then?

597
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,852
You want this to get bloody?

598
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,063
As if that is new between us.

599
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,691
You've gotten better at your banter.

600
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:55,943
Not just that.

601
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,069
What else?

602
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:01,031
Everything you can imagine.

603
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,329
I'm glad nothing's changed.

604
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:11,041
The neighborhood, this house…

605
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,586
and you, who has been living here.

606
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,590
I've changed a little.

607
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,802
Let's get along, Ha-gyeong.

608
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,905
What was that?
I just got completely beaten, right?

609
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,741
I nearly got knocked out.

610
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:48,328
What happened to him?

611
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:07,264
Haven't you changed a bit, you pervert?

612
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:50,265
You should put the waterproofing
up to the wall.

613
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,935
You shouldn't be so sloppy all the time.

614
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:57,481
Everyone here's a pro.
This amount is safe for the waterproofing.

615
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:01,652
It's burning out here.
When are we supposed to go over the plans?

616
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:04,696
What if I draw it?

617
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:13,288
Hi there.

618
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:17,292
From what I hear,

619
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:21,838
if you do the roof waterproofing
that sloppily, it'll ruin the whole layer.

620
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:26,927
Floor area.

621
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,933
150… The protruding part…

622
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:47,573
Here, use this as a guide.

623
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:53,495
And if you're a pro, you should've been
familiar with all the site plans.

624
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,248
Am I supposed to follow you around
and draw it for you?

625
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,376
Fine, you punk.

626
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:02,754
You know what a pain you are on the job?

627
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,508
Guys, let's follow this.

628
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:09,344
If we don't stick to this,
he'll draw a hundred more.

629
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:10,804
So scary.

630
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:14,099
Let's go.

631
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,893
-You got this.
-You punk.

632
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,816
-When did you come?
-Just now.

633
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:28,905
I get more calls from Ha-gyeong
than those loan calls.

634
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,909
-What will you do about the house?
-I have a plan.

635
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:36,663
Are you not going to sell the house?
That's why you wanted the title?

636
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:40,250
Without that house,
would she have called me?

637
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,504
What do I do about you guys?

638
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:49,134
By the way, Dad,
did you check out my contest draft?

639
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:51,011
-That's why I came today.
-Right.

640
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:54,890
-What was that? You're really doing that?
-Yeah, I'm trying to.

641
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,601
As a pro, do you think it'll work?

642
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:09,154
This fence-removal project
is a real headache.

643
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:12,741
We can get going
once we get the residents' consent forms.

644
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:15,160
The problem is the upcoming heavy rain.

645
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,954
People are all scared of flooding.

646
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,381
Ms. Song?

647
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,633
Yes.

648
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,010
All right.

649
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:37,057
As you know, the drainage system
was completed two years ago.

650
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,310
Everything will be fine
unless they alter the dam's discharge.

651
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:43,980
Even if we take down the fence,
there won't be flooding.

652
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:47,526
How exactly are we supposed
to get the consent forms?

653
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,612
We'll have to go around door to door.

654
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,953
Sir, why did you
suddenly change your mind?

655
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:01,581
Last time I went over it, you liked it
since the street would be widened.

656
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:04,084
The rainy season is coming soon.

657
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:07,629
The fence stops the flood damage.
Remember three years ago?

658
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:09,965
That's not because of the fence.

659
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:13,677
If it rained that hard,
even Seoul wouldn't be safe.

660
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,846
I drew a blank.

661
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,223
You're thrilled.

662
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:21,101
If we tear down the fence,

663
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:25,439
when the dam breaks,
all our chickens will get washed away.

664
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:30,110
Who said that?
The drainage systems are so solid.

665
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,071
Mr. Baek said that. Go ahead.

666
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,448
-Mr. Baek?
-Yeah.

667
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,950
What are you talking about?
Mr. Baek is in Namhae.

668
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:40,537
Right, his son said so, right?

669
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,372
Right.

670
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,082
His son told us.

671
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:46,668
His son did?

672
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:54,259
You're great at prepping bean sprouts.
Looks like you've done it a lot.

673
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:59,306
You must've had plenty of experience.

674
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:05,061
Ladies, how's the village these days?
No floods, I assume?

675
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:07,939
Yeah, it's been a while.

676
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:11,318
That's all because the fences
were repaired ten years ago.

677
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:16,698
Right, those architects
living in the twin house

678
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:19,451
-did something for us.
-Right.

679
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:23,497
All the fences were replaced back then,
which is why there's less flooding.

680
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:28,960
Really? Then we shouldn't tear it down.
Why break something built so well?

681
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,797
Why destroy something they built so well?
We shouldn't.

682
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,049
-We can't. I had no idea.
-We shouldn't.

683
00:51:34,132 --> 00:51:36,051
My goodness.

684
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:42,599
So, it was you spreading nonsense to them.

685
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:44,810
You know this area sits low.

686
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:49,272
So? It's below the dam,
so heavy rain could cause flooding?

687
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:50,315
You know it well.

688
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,983
That's why my dad

689
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,820
and your parents
fixed all the fences in this area.

690
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,782
These fences help the rainwater drain,
reducing flooding.

691
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,160
Stop it. The project is a bad idea.

692
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:06,164
That's your hypothesis
since you consider architecture as art.

693
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:09,251
As a civil servant in architecture,
my take differs.

694
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:12,796
The ones I'm planning to tear down
are the outer fences along the road.

695
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,631
Taking it down won't cause flooding.

696
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,843
I'll prove it to you.

697
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:19,970
How can you prove it?

698
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,856
Now what? Tear it down some more?

699
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:33,483
Sure, keep smashing.
Don't hold anything back.

700
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:35,944
Okay, more!

701
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:50,584
What are you doing?

702
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,086
So cool.

703
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:07,309
Once it's gone…

704
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,563
this summer will be over.

705
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,861
Not there!

706
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,114
-Not there, stop!
-Stop.

707
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:22,616
-Just the outer fence!
-Stop!

708
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,034
Stop! Enough!

709
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,119
Outer fence…

710
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:27,245
Wait.

711
00:53:31,082 --> 00:53:34,044
Ms. Song, what do we do about this?

712
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,843
I thought we were smashing
all the fences.

713
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:45,055
His hearing is bad. I'm so sorry.

714
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,976
All right, let's discuss
how to deal with this.

715
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:55,357
Sir, you can't just
tear everything down like this.

716
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,860
Especially when
we're in heavy-rain warning season.

717
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:02,113
You should've stopped
when everyone told you no.

718
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:07,494
Why's the most rational person
at the office acting like this?

719
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:11,289
-I'll take full responsibility.
-And how are you going to do that?

720
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:16,127
The inner fence collapsed, so your house
won't hold up through the rainy season.

721
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:20,423
You know that'll affect the houses below
and the one next to it too.

722
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,677
People here are already traumatized
by flooding.

723
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,011
We might get complaints--

724
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,514
There's no heavy rain advisory yet.

725
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,182
I'll take care of it before that.

726
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:32,477
Okay, then how?
How are you going to go about it?

727
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:38,149
I'll get the spare flood barriers
and borrow a pump.

728
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,402
How are you going to handle it
by yourself?

729
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:41,987
-I'll help.
-My goodness.

730
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:49,244
Hold it.

731
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:57,627
Here.

732
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,466
Hey, I'll do it myself. You should go.

733
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,594
This is already enough. Thanks.

734
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:11,558
That's enough, just go.

735
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,978
I'm not helping you.

736
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:18,398
I'm fixing my house
that got damaged because of you.

737
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:26,364
Hey.

738
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:29,492
You're mocking me right now, aren't you?

739
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,419
No. I really feel bad.

740
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,049
Song Ha-gyeong.

741
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:46,384
I really can't do it.

742
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,346
I can't sell the house.

743
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:56,394
You want to say that right now?

744
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:58,021
Because of this situation.

745
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,026
If so…

746
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,113
-I guess I have no choice but sue.
-Go on.

747
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:09,365
If that's the only option.

748
00:56:14,996 --> 00:56:17,582
I knew this would happen.

749
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:24,756
Summer is always
the absolute worst for me.

750
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:30,095
This is full cement,
so it'll take a while to dry.

751
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,888
Still, let's give it a try.

752
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:35,600
-Thanks, I'm counting on you, sir.
-But it won't be easy.

753
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:42,398
Where did it all go wrong with my summer?

754
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,318
In fact,

755
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:47,904
I know the answer.

756
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:50,824
It's all…

757
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,993
Baek Do-ha's fault.

758
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,183
You're always here, Ha-gyeong.

759
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,645
You're always dangling like this
when you're upset.

760
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,485
I somehow expected it.

761
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:31,531
Every time he shows up in my life…

762
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:35,910
everything always turns into a mess.

763
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:37,328
JONG-MAN

764
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:48,131
I'll let the ash tree grow really big
and build a tree house on top.

765
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:53,303
Hey, it'll take more than ten years.
Who's going to climb that?

766
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:54,387
You and me.

767
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:57,807
What the…

768
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:06,649
In 2007, that summer brought a rainbow
even though it wasn't rainy season.

769
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:13,740
Yay, I won.

770
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:18,578
Summer of 2011, the rain poured so hard,

771
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:21,039
I couldn't hear anything else.

772
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,584
Let me see.

773
00:58:24,667 --> 00:58:26,961
-My goodness.
-Let's go home first.

774
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:30,798
Summer of 2012,
we faced the monsoon rains head-on.

775
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:33,218
One, two, three!

776
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,722
Summer of 2013,

777
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:41,392
even the starlight
felt too strong to bear.

778
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,937
JONG-MAN

779
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:53,321
In 2014, the summer drove us mad
with heatstroke.

780
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:54,572
MAIN BUDDHA HALL

781
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:58,076
Say something.
Just say something, Baek Do-ha.

782
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,787
Say something.

783
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,164
Make some excuse, at least!

784
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:11,798
Get lost.

785
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,594
Let's not see each other again.

786
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:19,889
You son of a bitch.

787
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:21,808
And in 2022,

788
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:27,981
that summer left my body and mind drained
even without rain.

789
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:32,819
Okay.

790
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:35,655
The memories just came flooding back.

791
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:38,866
It was completely frozen in the freezer,

792
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:42,787
but the summer heat melted it away.

793
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:50,420
I hated summer so much
that I wanted to run away from it.

794
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:58,219
My summers have been full of Baek Do-ha,

795
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,598
and in those summers, nothing went right.

796
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:10,732
Song Ha-gyeong.

797
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:15,445
Do you still hate me so much?

798
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:28,082
I was always unlucky in summer.

799
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:32,920
Because every summer,
Baek Do-ha came back.

800
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:36,382
And…

801
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:38,885
looks like my summer…

802
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,263
is doomed again.

803
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,711
-Why did you come back?
-You finally want to know?

804
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,964
What did Do-ha say when he hired you?

805
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:19,092
What are the conditions and purpose?

806
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:22,136
Looks like Mr. Baek
knows everything about you, Ms. Song.

807
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,180
Should I give you the whole house?

808
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:26,307
Get out! Don't come in.

809
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:31,145
You should've been put in jail for fraud
two years ago.

810
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:34,357
Can selling the house erase
17 years of our memories?

811
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,069
Why are you two
so obsessed with the peanut house?

812
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:40,029
I can't stand it anymore!

813
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,698
I'm so sick of it!

814
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:43,491
Stop lying.

815
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:47,704
You won't win this time.
I'm not letting you win.

816
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,289
Let's see this through,
right into the mud.

817
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,458
That's the ending that suits us.
