00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,390
Rice cake.

195
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,630
Yes, your favorite.

196
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,510
Yes.

197
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,150
It takes a lot of time to make this.

198
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,850
Chewy. Delicious.

199
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:41,960
Glad you like it.

200
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,460
Eat more.

201
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,910
Mom, I just finished breakfast.

202
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,540
I'm not hungry.

203
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,670
Can I eat it later?

204
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,700
I got up at four this morning.

205
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,210
More than 10 steps.

206
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,510
It took me the whole morning.

207
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:52,950
You know?

208
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:53,410
If you don't…

209
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:54,440
It's very delicious.

210
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,720
I'm just full now.

211
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,190
Can I eat it later?

212
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:57,950
I…

213
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,480
Okay.

214
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,850
Very delicious.

215
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,720
We need fifty

216
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:08,610
cloud servers.

217
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,470
They don't need high specifications.

218
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:11,550
A quad-core CPU

219
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,100
and 8GB of RAM will suffice.

220
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,270
All of these are to ensure

221
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,950
the responsiveness of the API.

222
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,790
At the same time,

223
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,350
we'll choose a 128GB

224
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,150
message queue

225
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,670
to guarantee each machine's

226
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,870
service efficiency.

227
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,560
Moreover,

228
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,830
we will also use container technology

229
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,910
to dynamically add fifty containers

230
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,830
as a precaution against unexpected requests.

231
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,710
Does anyone have anything to say?

232
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,360
Two questions.

233
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,150
Sorry.

234
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,690
If on the day of the promotion,

235
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,310
our competitors hire hackers to attack us,

236
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,370
do you have a plan B?

237
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,990
I, uh, if...

238
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,810
You didn't consider it, did you?

239
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:48,820
The second question.

240
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,710
You're talking about 400,000

241
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,870
queries per second

242
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:52,870
with 50 machines.

243
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,270
Have you thought about

244
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,670
the strain this could put on the ports

245
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,060
when they're in use?

246
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,190
No again.

247
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,630
You haven't considered them?

248
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,550
I have no further questions.

249
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,000
Any other comments?

250
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,960
I don't think

251
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,230
you're writing code.

252
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,710
This is a code outline.

253
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,200
A schoolchild's writing.

254
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
We're quite close.

255
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,570
Don't take it personally.

256
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:17,240
You can't

257
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,010
come up with such crap

258
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:18,610
and expect us

259
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,580
to clean up your mess.

260
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,350
Do you know how big

261
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:20,870
the losses will be?

262
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,670
All right.

263
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:25,840
Since everyone thinks it's problematic,

264
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,270
then have it revised.

265
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,390
But I need to see

266
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,130
the new proposal ASAP.

267
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,160
Ever since I got into this field,

268
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,650
my motto has been

269
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,270
"To live and learn."

270
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,090
The early bird gets the worm.

271
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:43,950
We should…

272
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,350
No, I…

273
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,430
There's a pin on my chair.

274
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,550
Someone left it here.

275
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:49,880
It's sticking up, look.

276
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,360
No pin here, right?

277
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,470
Don't be so jumpy.

278
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,350
Sorry, sorry.

279
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,310
Where was I?

280
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:01,530
The early bird.

281
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,070
Yeah. Bird…

282
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,910
The early bird gets the worm.

283
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:08,280
We should all work hard.

284
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,600
I hope everyone

285
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,710
can have this spirit in the future.

286
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,570
Can you do that?

287
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,430
Yes.

288
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,810
Okay. Then we'll work overtime today

289
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,670
to solve that problem.

290
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,990
To write this proposal,

291
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,910
I didn't sleep for days.

292
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,250
He just turned it down.

293
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,400
Don't get worked up.

294
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,440
You put a lot of effort into it,

295
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,800
but in the meeting,

296
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,000
you missed the point,

297
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,490
didn't you?

298
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,030
Quan was not wrong.

299
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,020
Quan embarrassed

300
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,470
Mr. Lyu so much.

301
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,950
He missed the point too.

302
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,630
Eat your candy.

303
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,230
Chubby.

304
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,980
Don't be mad.

305
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,550
I apologize.

306
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,650
It's okay. No need to apologize.

307
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,270
I was too harsh in the meeting.

308
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,430
Don't take it to heart.

309
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,930
It was not personal.

310
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,520
Alright.

311
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,790
My mom brought me pancakes

312
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,650
from Shandong.

313
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,210
Let's share this one.

314
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,320
I put a new one

315
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,140
on your desk.

316
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,160
Let's go. I'm starving.

317
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,950
Here. Let's go.

318
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,080
Time to eat.

319
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,520
This is an antique, isn't it?

320
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,950
I've always wanted to ask you.

321
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,010
Where did you buy it? I really like it.

322
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,370
You can't buy one.

323
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,940
It belonged to my father's

324
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,890
grandfather.

325
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,290
An antique it is.

326
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,710
It chimes at midnight.

327
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,550
When Zhou Quan just married me,

328
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,030
he was always startled awake by it.

329
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:42,680
But now,

330
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,150
without the chime,

331
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,310
he can't sleep well.

332
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,340
Aren't you curious

333
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:46,990
why I came to you

334
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:47,790
at this hour?

335
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,720
Not really.

336
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,320
You're always so whimsical.

337
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:53,140
I did a read.

338
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,310
You're about to go viral.

339
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:56,920
Since you've been so supportive

340
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,420
all this time,

341
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,430
if I go viral,

342
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,650
I'll provide for you.

343
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,090
I'm not kidding.

344
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,330
If I say you're about to go viral,

345
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,600
you definitely will.

346
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,430
Why?

347
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,370
Think about it.

348
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,500
Originally, your book won't come out until next month.

349
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,720
But the release of the publisher's new book

350
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
has been delayed.

351
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,240
In this half a month,

352
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,350
no other good books

353
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,210
are coming out.

354
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,110
So tell me,

355
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,820
isn't this a good chance for you?

356
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,690
What kind of chance is this?

357
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,630
As you said,

358
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,170
these days, people who read paper books

359
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,490
are fewer and fewer.

360
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,540
I'm an author

361
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,120
whom nobody knows about.

362
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:31,680
Even if the publishing house

363
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,630
prints a few thousand copies,

364
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,890
who knows how many will actually be sold?

365
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,590
I'm not ambitious.

366
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,090
Nor do I have such luck.

367
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:42,230
-Can't you be a little more confident?
-It's my son's teacher.

368
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,160
It's my son's teacher. One moment.

369
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,930
Hello, Ms. Tian.

370
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:50,980
Zhou Aiwen got into a fight

371
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,620
with a girl in his class?

372
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,180
How could you make a rookie mistake like this?

373
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,760
Wait. What's wrong?

374
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,560
It's clear on the schedule that

375
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,620
it needs to go live today.

376
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,220
Why delay it until tomorrow?

377
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,290
Mr. Lyu.

378
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,430
Yesterday,

379
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,000
I noticed a bug

380
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,930
in the database.

381
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,520
So I needed to debug it

382
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,850
to ensure it's foolproof.

383
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,630
You fixed it?

384
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:13,510
Well,

385
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,990
Yu and I fixed it together.

386
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,840
You two, right?

387
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:18,650
Where were you?

388
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,960
It was my day off.

389
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,320
So I didn't come to work.

390
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,510
Steve Jobs once said,

391
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,140
don't rely on anyone

392
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,650
but your own hard work.

393
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,210
I'm so angry that my accent

394
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:29,880
comes out.

395
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,540
Zhou Quan.

396
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,350
Sorry.

397
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,730
As the head of the group,

398
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,680
the one in charge of this project,

399
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,980
and a senior employee,

400
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,820
you didn't come to work?

401
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,200
Mr. Lyu, here's the thing.

402
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,400
I've done a lot.

403
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,990
Yesterday was my day off.

404
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:44,710
I think…

405
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,340
Yeah, Steve Jobs is right.

406
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,910
I find it very inspirational.

407
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,110
Are you imitating me?

408
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:50,630
No.

409
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:52,580
I'm just trying to understand you.

410
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
Please continue.

411
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,090
Work overtime!

412
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,470
Bossy Jobs.

413
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:04,800
Zhou, I'm sorry.

414
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,930
I meant to help you explain,

415
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,980
but I messed it up.

416
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:10,390
Buy me supper tonight.

417
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:17,350
Honey.

418
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:17,700
Honey.

419
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,230
Why didn't you answer my call?

420
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:19,710
Well,

421
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,990
I-I was...

422
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,920
My superior was dissing me.

423
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,900
Ms. Tian just called me.

424
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,450
She said our son got into a fight.

425
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,710
She also called the other kid's parents.

426
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:29,910
I want you to come with me.

427
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:30,350
I'm afraid

428
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,670
it's gonna be tricky.

429
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,990
M-My work…

430
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,250
Fine. Go back to work.

431
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,100
We'll talk when you're home.

432
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,150
I'm hanging up.

433
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,430
Ms. Tian.

434
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:50,270
Mrs. Zhou.

435
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:52,370
I'm very sorry.

436
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,500
Zhou Aiwen.

437
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,340
What happened?

438
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,780
What did Mommy tell you?

439
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,830
You can't hit people,

440
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,160
especially not girls.

441
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,150
You forgot it?

442
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,470
Lift your head. Come on.

443
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,450
Ms. Tian.

444
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,550
Who bullied my baby girl?

445
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,390
What happened, Ms. Tian?

446
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,080
Do you think

447
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,140
we'll work overtime this week?

448
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,170
It's hard to say.

449
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,050
Look at the guy over there.

450
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:41,150
He thinks we're overpaid

451
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,610
if we don't work overtime.

452
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,850
When he's satisfied,

453
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:44,730
we're miserable.

454
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:46,260
Seeing us happy annoys him.

455
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,820
A psychopath.

456
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,760
I'd say he's in menopause.

457
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,390
Besides,

458
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,630
every IT technician

459
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,960
works overtime, right?

460
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,590
But not like this.

461
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,350
We work overtime almost every day.

462
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,070
After getting home,

463
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,070
we have to stay by the phone

464
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,070
around the clock.

465
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,900
This is killing me.

466
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,349
Who cares about the overtime pay?

467
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,190
I want to live.

468
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,099
My son complains to his mom every day,

469
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:10,160
requiring a new dad.

470
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,560
If this goes on, I'm done.

471
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,710
Who'd have known

472
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,450
Aiwen was so weak and fragile?

473
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,270
My girl just pushed him a little.

474
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,109
Mrs. Zhou, you should

475
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,200
sign him up

476
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,550
for a fitness class.

477
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,540
After all, he's a boy.

478
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:24,790
He has to toughen up.

479
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:25,630
Don't you agree?

480
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,190
Yes.

481
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,069
My son is not as good

482
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:29,730
at fighting as your daughter.

483
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:30,990
Because I keep

484
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:31,880
telling him

485
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,100
to have good manners.

486
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,100
Fighting

487
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:34,930
is the most foolish way

488
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,010
to solve problems.

489
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:36,990
Right, Aiwen?

490
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,540
Of course, I'm not saying

491
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,990
your daughter is not ladylike.

492
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,520
I respect her personality.

493
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,270
That's not what I mean.

494
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,390
We both know very well

495
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,470
what you mean.

496
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:46,980
Before anything else,

497
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,310
as a parent, shouldn't you

498
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,480
tell your daughter

499
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,240
to apologize to my son?

500
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,500
What a petty boy.

501
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,160
Fine. As you wish.

502
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,150
Siyi.

503
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,350
Sorry.

504
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,300
It's okay.

505
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:02,460
Aiwen, you're great.

506
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,790
Mommy is proud of you.

507
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,470
You have such a big heart.

508
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:06,700
Siyi is great too.

509
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:08,070
It's alright, Siyi.

510
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,570
Ms. Tian,

511
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,740
could you please

512
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,890
write me a note?

513
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,050
We're going to the hospital

514
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,190
for a checkup.

515
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:16,450
I need to know if he's injured

516
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,320
anywhere else.

517
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,910
Zhou Aiwen.

518
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,490
I take good care of you

519
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:31,020
and feed you well.

520
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,510
You're not malnourished.

521
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,690
How could you let a girl

522
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,420
beat you up?

523
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:35,800
Look at your face.

524
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,830
Mommy,

525
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,190
you told me

526
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,750
I can't hit other kids in the kindergarten.

527
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,030
I'd be a bad boy if I did.

528
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,360
You must not

529
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,190
start a fight.

530
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,110
That's right.

531
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,310
But when someone hits you,

532
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,000
you should…

533
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,590
You can't just let them hit you.

534
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,430
Are you a fool?

535
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,180
No.

536
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,360
You told me

537
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,560
boys can't fight girls.

538
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:03,870
Besides,

539
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,960
she didn't mean it.

540
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,470
Mommy, latching onto it like this

541
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,280
is not ladylike.

542
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:12,670
You…

543
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,990
Your face is scratched.

544
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,050
I feel bad for you,

545
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,870
yet you think it's not ladylike?

546
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
I didn't teach you manners

547
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,600
so you can talk back to me.

548
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,030
So eloquent.

549
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,880
Alright then, little gentleman.

550
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,050
Let's go home.

551
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,730
We're not going to the hospital?

552
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:28,430
No.

553
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,490
You just got a scratch.

554
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:30,790
No need to go to the hospital.

555
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,530
I just said that

556
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:32,280
to upset her.

557
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,310
Why did you want

558
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,810
to upset Siyi's mom?

559
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,190
Because she was rude.

560
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,470
I upset her

561
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,360
to teach her a lesson

562
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,700
so that she won't be so rude

563
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,030
to others in the future.

564
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,010
She doesn't even

565
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,270
have your good manners.

566
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,130
Am I right, son?

567
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,710
How is he? Let me see.

568
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,730
Nothing serious.

569
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,590
Did he bleed?

570
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,510
No.

571
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:38,980
His face is so red.

572
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,090
Like a crab.

573
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,880
It's a bit swollen.

574
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,550
Let me carry him to his bed.

575
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:49,150
A boy

576
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,460
got beaten up by a girl.

577
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,540
I can't believe it.

578
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,680
I've been thinking about it all night.

579
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,640
Why

580
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,200
is he so weak?

581
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,230
He let a little girl

582
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,110
beat him up.

583
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,980
Anyway, he doesn't get it from me.

584
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,900
I think your mom spoiled him.

585
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,150
I think it's your fault.

586
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,880
Do you know that as a boy,

587
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:19,840
he really needs

588
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,030
his father's company at this time?

589
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,960
You spent too little time with him.

590
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,770
At this point,

591
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:25,550
blaming each other

592
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,890
is totally meaningless.

593
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:27,950
We need a solution.

594
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:30,130
What solution do you have in mind?

595
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,660
I think maybe

596
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,910
we should just

597
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,820
give him

598
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:35,590
a fierce little sister

599
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,720
who can protect him.

600
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,150
Honey.

601
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:48,190
What is this?

602
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,430
My mom is absurd.

603
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,570
When did she put it there?

604
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:53,230
I told her it's not necessary.

605
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,880
She said…

606
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,350
Aiwen often wets his bed, right?

607
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,030
I found a folk remedy for it.

608
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,310
First, I bought a big rooster.

609
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,490
Then I took its intestines out

610
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:02,650
and dried them on a tile.

611
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,540
At last, I ground them into fine powder

612
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,090
and mixed it with flour

613
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,870
to make this pancake.

614
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,830
You need to put it on his bed.

615
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:09,980
Where?

616
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,270
Under the mattress.

617
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,300
So he won't wet his bed anymore.

618
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,430
Oh my god. How could this happen?

619
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,510
She's so ignorant.

620
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,300
Gosh.

621
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,360
That little girl is learning taekwondo.

622
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,650
Should I sign Aiwen up for

623
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,350
some kind of

624
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:24,480
martial arts class?

625
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:26,470
"It's a stupid idea…"

626
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,720
Watch your mouth.

627
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,830
"It's a stupid idea"

628
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,950
is what your mom would say.

629
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,070
You should hear me out.

630
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,750
You did it on purpose.

631
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,550
No.

632
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:35,100
The pancake is not a big deal.

633
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,910
Forget about my mom.

634
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,840
I'll talk to her.

635
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,560
Let's talk about you.

636
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,990
You come home so late every day.

637
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,000
It's because of

638
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,320
the new bossy boss.

639
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,240
It would kill him

640
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,850
if he didn't make us

641
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,840
work overtime.

642
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,830
I don't care

643
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,740
about your new boss.

644
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,790
You can't

645
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:53,250
break your promise again.

646
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:54,590
I won't.

647
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,470
I'll make time for it.

648
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:56,410
I'm not kidding.

649
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,570
Aiwen has waited for two years.

650
00:22:57,570 --> 00:22:59,000
Either we go travel or your son goes crazy.

651
00:22:59,000 --> 00:22:59,780
I know.

652
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,040
He let a girl

653
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,870
beat him up like that.

654
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,070
How can I let him down?

655
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,940
No. You have to swear.

656
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,050
I swear.

657
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:09,720
Honey,

658
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,480
I shouldn't brush my teeth yet.

659
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,780
You're hungry?

660
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:13,870
Get me something to eat?

661
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,550
Okay.

662
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,210
Make tomato and egg noodles

663
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,010
or something.

664
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:23,550
Honey, can you make do with something simple?

665
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:24,190
Sure.

666
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,340
Come on. We're home.

667
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,870
Wash your hands.

668
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:56,710
Hey, Mom.

669
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,760
Do you have homework today?

670
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,390
Yes.

671
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,280
Go to your room and do your homework.

672
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,530
Not now. He needs to rest.

673
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,180
Come. Go do your homework. Hurry up.

674
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,020
No!

675
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,250
Zhou Aiwen.

676
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,060
Sweetie, don't be afraid.

677
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,470
I wasn't yelling at you.

678
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,540
Dear boy.

679
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,060
I'll never yell at you.

680
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,720
Here.

681
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:21,940
Have some candy.

682
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,380
I've told you before.

683
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,220
He can't eat sweets.

684
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,350
His teeth are bad. He'll get cavities.

685
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,140
He really can't eat candy.

686
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,800
What's wrong with you?

687
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:34,870
You tell me.

688
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:35,990
You tell me.

689
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,610
I didn't want to go to dance

690
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,900
yet you

691
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,070
forced me to dance.

692
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,940
Look at his face.

693
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:42,990
This is the result of

694
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,590
letting you take care of him.

695
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,890
Good boy. You must be thirsty.

696
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,050
Here. Have some water.

697
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:52,540
Here.

698
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,420
I got killed. It's all your fault.

699
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,970
My bad.

700
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,110
Here. Have some water.

701
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,230
Zhou Aiwen.

702
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,000
Go back to your room and do your homework.

703
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,810
Grandma said I don't need to do homework.

704
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,380
Yes.

705
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,240
This round is not over yet.

706
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,030
Give me the pad.

707
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,990
This round is not over yet!

708
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:11,700
Stand up.

709
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:14,900
What are the rules I set for you?

710
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,650
Tell me.

711
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,530
After I get home, I need to wash my hands and then do my homework.

712
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:22,130
Have you done your homework?

713
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:23,710
What else?

714
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,560
Help Daddy and Mommy

715
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,080
with chores I can do.

716
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,140
What does that mean?

717
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,650
You want such a little kid

718
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,050
to do chores for you?

719
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:34,600
Fine.

720
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:35,790
-Mom, you can scold me later.
-Let me do chores.

721
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:36,270
OK?

722
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,360
Tell me.

723
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:37,850
What chores?

724
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:38,890
-Get your schoolbag.
-Let me do them.

725
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:39,880
-Go to your room and do your homework.
-I'll do them for you.

726
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,990
-Don't look at Grandma.
-Give the kid a break.

727
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,640
-Take your schoolbag.
-Okay?

728
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,710
-Take your schoolbag.
-He's tired. He just got home.

729
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,860
-Let him have a rest.
-Do your homework. Quick.

730
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,220
Mom, don't be like this, okay?

731
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,170
Scold me later.

732
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,710
-Take your schoolbag.
-Wait.

733
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,040
Go do your homework.

734
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,130
He's very tired.

735
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:54,020
Don't push him so hard.

736
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,300
Let him take a rest.

737
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,910
Mom, he needs to do his homework.

738
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,450
You…

739
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:01,660
You…

740
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,550
Open the door!

741
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,420
This is my company's

742
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,810
project report and client feedback

743
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,070
from the last quarter.

744
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,450
What took you so long?

745
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,510
Mr. Lyu, sorry.

746
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:18,830
I'm late.

747
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,280
Mr. Liu, take your time to read them.

748
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,040
Come to my office.

749
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,220
I told you to be back by 4 o'clock.

750
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:36,180
You were

751
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:37,870
5 minutes and 47 seconds late.

752
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,370
48, 49…

753
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,440
Let's round it up to six minutes.

754
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,160
Do you know how many things

755
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,290
can happen in the world in six minutes?

756
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,700
The Earth rotates 27.8 kilometers

757
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,780
in one minute.

758
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,590
That's more than 100 kilometers

759
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:51,630
in six minutes.

760
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,690
If this were a war,

761
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:53,950
it wouldn't even take six minutes.

762
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,950
Fire!

763
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,420
Then it's over.

764
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,970
They are all

765
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,060
important clients.

766
00:26:59,060 --> 00:26:59,860
If they refuse

767
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:00,820
to sign with us

768
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:01,780
because you were

769
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,870
six minutes late,

770
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,820
can you bear that responsibility?

771
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,090
Who's there?

772
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:07,480
It's me.

773
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,030
Come in.

774
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,400
Zhou Quan, what are you doing here?

775
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,720
I overheard you talking about

776
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,050
5 minutes and 47 seconds

777
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,020
and the importance of punctuality.

778
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,150
I completely agree.

779
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,590
But the way you calculated it

780
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,610
is a bit unfair.

781
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,180
He was 5 minutes

782
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,070
and 47 seconds late.

783
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,050
But our overtime hours

784
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:23,790
should be

785
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:24,490
countless times

786
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:25,350
more than that.

787
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,230
You want trouble?

788
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:28,990
No, no.

789
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,420
I'm also responsible for it.

790
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:32,460
My car went with him.

791
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,700
I lent him my car.

792
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:34,610
Zhou Quan.

793
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:37,210
What's our corporate culture?

794
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,110
Diligence.

795
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,150
Teamwork.

796
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,310
Gratitude.

797
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,040
Just remember the last word.

798
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,140
Go back to work!

799
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,780
Mom, let's talk.

800
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,950
Okay. Let's talk.

801
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:13,760
I know you're worried

802
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,320
because Aiwen got hurt.

803
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,640
But it's really not a big deal.

804
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,790
Just a little quarrel

805
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,580
between two kids.

806
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,040
They pushed each other a bit.

807
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,160
Isn't it normal?

808
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,860
Aiwen.

809
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,740
Listen to me.

810
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,140
In the future,

811
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,170
if someone wants to hit you,

812
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,770
run away immediately.

813
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:34,590
Mom.

814
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,840
Run as far as you can.

815
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,060
I know you love him, but he's a boy.

816
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,210
Can he run away from all difficulties?

817
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,120
If he does that,

818
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,640
won't he become a coward?

819
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,970
When something happens, you have to run away.

820
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:44,920
Don't take it head-on.

821
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,650
Understand?

822
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,800
If it weren't for me,

823
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,740
could Aiwen have grown into such a great boy?

824
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,460
Is he great?

825
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:51,470
Of course.

826
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:52,250
-Can't you see
-I'm great after all.

827
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,780
all his problems?

828
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,910
You hope you can tie his shoelaces,

829
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:56,970
dress him,

830
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,070
and even carry him on your back

831
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,550
if you can, right?

832
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,640
When he was three,

833
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,580
you chased after him with a bottle for him to pee.

834
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,330
If I hadn't interfered,

835
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:04,740
he wouldn't be able to pee by himself now.

836
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,830
Do you think that's good?

837
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:06,960
After he grows up,

838
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,910
can he overcome any difficulties?

839
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,740
Aiwen is just a little boy.

840
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,660
Sweetie, you must be hungry.

841
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,730
Mom, let me finish.

842
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:15,300
Okay?

843
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,480
Go ahead. I'm listening.

844
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,340
How many times have I told you?

845
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,230
At mealtime,

846
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,470
don't let him eat without us.

847
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,230
It'll make him think

848
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,510
he's more important than us.

849
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,520
Don't feed him.

850
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,480
He won't learn to share that way.

851
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,220
You know

852
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,970
I'm doing the right thing, Mom.

853
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,500
He ignores all the rules I set for him

854
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,940
as soon as you come.

855
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,530
When you're not here, he behaves well.

856
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:35,930
If you spoil him like this, he'll be ruined.

857
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,070
The soup is ready.

858
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,090
I'll go get Aiwen some soup.

859
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,110
Sweetie.

860
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,650
The soup is ready.

861
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,030
Careful. It's hot.

862
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,430
Come again.

863
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,030
Yan.

864
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,920
Two bowls of wontons.

865
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,220
Okay. Just got off work?

866
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:02,710
Yes.

867
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,250
You get off work

868
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,010
quite late.

869
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,570
Indeed.

870
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,490
One for your wife?

871
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:11,350
Then one with cilantro

872
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,780
and one without it.

873
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,210
Both without cilantro.

874
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,610
She doesn't like that smell in my mouth.

875
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,250
What's wrong with you?

876
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,210
Did I scare you?

877
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,560
What are you doing here?

878
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,670
I just sent a streamer

879
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,570
at my company home.

880
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,550
I sent you a message.

881
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:45,180
You didn't reply.

882
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,350
Didn't you check your phone?

883
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:46,970
What are you busy with?

884
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,850
I was driving. How could I reply to you?

885
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:50,030
Look at you.

886
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,400
Which building does she live in?

887
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,410
You really want to know?

888
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:53,280
Drink with me.

889
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,380
No, no.

890
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,260
I'm going home.

891
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,340
I bought wontons for my wife.

892
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,120
We'll eat it together.

893
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,850
Just take it up and come with me.

894
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:00,350
When I was with your sister,

895
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,750
would you ask me out like this?

896
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:02,690
Didn't you do it a lot

897
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,570
when you were with her?

898
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,230
Who do you think improved my alcohol tolerance?

899
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,920
Alright. We were both young once.

900
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,380
-Come on.
-No, no.

901
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,860
It's too late.

902
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:12,480
Were you waiting here

903
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,390
for me or…

904
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,440
I saw you drive back.

905
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,500
So I waited for you.

906
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,460
Can't you spend some time alone?

907
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,260
You want my company right after the streamer left.

908
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,650
Another day. Okay?

909
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:23,280
It's a deal then.

910
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:23,960
Okay.

911
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:24,720
I'm leaving then.

912
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,920
Alright. Drive safe.

913
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,670
I knew you'd do this.

914
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,160
-Okay.
-I'm leaving. Bye.

915
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:36,380
[Raise a sheep or a wolf]

916
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,440
You're back.

917
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,720
I ran into Yuan Yi downstairs.

918
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,490
He's dating a girl in our neighborhood.

919
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:53,840
He said he just sent

920
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,850
a female colleague home.

921
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,130
He must be interested in her.

922
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,720
I know him

923
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:58,740
too well.

924
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,170
Single and free.

925
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:02,330
Have some wontons.

926
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,970
That's not what I mean.

927
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,290
I don't have an appetite.

928
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:14,940
What's wrong?

929
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,110
Why the long face?

930
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:18,330
I'm mad at my mom.

931
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,500
What happened?

932
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:20,710
Honey,

933
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,000
I really regret it now.

934
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,690
All these years, I've let my mom

935
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:25,930
help me take care of Aiwen.

936
00:32:25,930 --> 00:32:26,750
No, no.

937
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,060
That sounds a bit ungrateful.

938
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,390
I know she's done a lot for me.

939
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,520
I'm grateful to her.

940
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:31,310
But

941
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,640
the way she's educating my son

942
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,680
will ruin him, you know?

943
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,170
Let's have a second child.

944
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,700
We'll take Aiwen back

945
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,090
and give her the second child.

946
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,200
Alright, she's old.

947
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,120
Talk to her about it.

948
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:48,530
You talk to her if you want.

949
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,160
She's not reasonable.

950
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,660
Okay. I'll talk to her.

951
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,170
Eat some wontons.

952
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,890
No cilantro

953
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,400
in case you think my breath smells.

954
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,230
Have one.

955
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,010
Did you see the message I sent you?

956
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:10,910
Yes.

957
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:13,230
Are we driving there?

958
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,270
Yeah.

959
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,090
You can't come back

960
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,260
so late like tonight.

961
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,780
Do we have to leave so early?

962
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:23,200
The hotel charges less for two nights

963
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,650
than one.

964
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,890
Besides, after we get there,

965
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,240
Aiwen can start playing once he wakes up.

966
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,510
It means he'll have two days

967
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:28,990
to play.

968
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,120
It's the most

969
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,140
economical plan.

970
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,910
Beautiful and good at planning.

971
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,840
What did I do to deserve

972
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,080
such a smart wife?

973
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,630
Stop flattering me.

974
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,570
No, no. I mean it.

975
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:40,120
Don't come back

976
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,110
so late tomorrow.

977
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,970
You must be home by eight o'clock.

978
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,910
Mom.

979
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:56,590
It's just a two-night trip.

980
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,240
The hotel is pretty good. You're packing…

981
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,940
A quilt, seriously?

982
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:01,030
Yes.

983
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,720
How do you know if the hotel

984
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,130
has good quilts?

985
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,680
What if my grandson has an allergic reaction?

986
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:08,969
Then what's with the winter coat?

987
00:34:08,969 --> 00:34:10,480
Two coats for just two days?

988
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,739
Have you forgotten it?

989
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,440
Last time, his coat got wet

990
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,320
from the soda.

991
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,980
It's so cold now.

992
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,520
What if

993
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,719
he catches a cold?

994
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:22,949
What are you doing?

995
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,679
I want to bring these toys.

996
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,199
You're not helping.

997
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,520
Why bring toys?

998
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:28,590
I want to bring them.

999
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:29,110
No.

1000
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:29,560
Okay.

1001
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,380
I want to bring them.

1002
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,699
-Mom, don't spoil him.
-No problem.

1003
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:33,330
The suitcase is already full.

1004
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,630
There's still room. Look.

1005
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,510
Give them to me.

1006
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,500
We're going traveling,

1007
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,739
not moving somewhere else.

1008
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,060
He wants to bring them.

1009
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,909
I don't mind carrying them for him.

1010
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:41,510
Here.

1011
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,550
They fit. Look.

1012
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:46,820
I doubt you can close the suitcase.

1013
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,330
Instead of helping me, you're being sarcastic.

1014
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,460
You know what?

1015
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,340
We can just get another suitcase.

1016
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,719
Sweetie, come. Get on it.

1017
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,810
Don't worry, Honey.

1018
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,260
I told Yang

1019
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,630
to keep an eye on things for me.

1020
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,540
I'll take off in a bit.

1021
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,730
Do you know what time it is?

1022
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,900
We were supposed

1023
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,110
to leave at eight o'clock.

1024
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:13,980
My mom has been waiting.

1025
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,710
She'll be mad again in a moment.

1026
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,540
Don't you trust

1027
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,740
my control over time?

1028
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,060
Hurry up.

1029
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,790
Everyone!

1030
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,300
The system of a client

1031
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,630
in North America is down.

1032
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,490
It's not functioning.

1033
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,610
It's very serious.

1034
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,140
You all know what to do, right?

1035
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,260
Work overtime.

1036
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,590
Yes. Work overtime.

1037
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:39,190
Today and tomorrow,

1038
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,450
get this issue resolved.

1039
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:41,750
Nothing can go wrong.

1040
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:43,410
Any questions?

1041
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,330
No.

1042
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,070
No, no.

1043
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,500
Alright. Get to work.

1044
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,650
[8:26 p.m.]

1045
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:11,550
Ding.

1046
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,060
I got to take off in a bit.

1047
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,550
Where are you going?

1048
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,810
Got something urgent.

1049
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,480
Don't let Mr. Lyu see you leave.

1050
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,790
Come early tomorrow.

1051
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,020
I can't come tomorrow.

1052
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,320
The day after either.

1053
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:29,770
I promised my wife

1054
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,120
to take our son on a trip.

1055
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,920
Help me keep an eye on things.

1056
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,650
Don't worry.

1057
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,800
I can handle it.

1058
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,030
Leave. Hurry.

1059
00:36:57,210 --> 00:36:58,940
You must be tired. Let me drive.

1060
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,150
It's fine.

1061
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,480
Sixty kilometers left.

1062
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:09,750
You said when you left,

1063
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:10,690
everyone else was working overtime.

1064
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,020
You just left like this.

1065
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,750
Are you worried?

1066
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,030
No. Why would I?

1067
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,650
Those young men are worried.

1068
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,470
Bossy Lyu criticizes

1069
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,640
them every day.

1070
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,130
They can all handle pressure well.

1071
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,130
All still upbeat.

1072
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,440
I think they're more tolerant than me.

1073
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,250
Bossy Lyu

1074
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,530
tortures us every day.

1075
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,090
He seems to be enjoying it.

1076
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,010
Honey, look at this tomato.

1077
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,610
It looks like a belly button.

1078
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:37,870
Honey,

1079
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:39,630
I really love how your mind jumps around.

1080
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,960
You can take me to outer space.

1081
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,710
Sorry, sorry.

1082
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:42,670
I interrupted you.

1083
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,590
It's okay.

1084
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,950
They're sleeping so soundly.

1085
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,030
You have no idea

1086
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,040
what she stuffed into the suitcase.

1087
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,700
It's unbelievable. Like she was moving.

1088
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,550
If I fall asleep,

1089
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,280
will you be disappointed?

1090
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:18,990
Mommy.

1091
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:21,010
I want to sing and dance.

1092
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,260
Then shout out loud.

1093
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,030
Shout what?

1094
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,670
Whatever you want.

1095
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,600
I'll go first.

1096
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,070
Zhou Aiwen,

1097
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:33,250
stop wetting your bed!

1098
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:34,330
You can't say that!

1099
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:35,680
What are you doing?

1100
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,730
Mommy, you're too fat!

1101
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,560
Nonsense!

1102
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,490
You can't say that!

1103
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,060
You should say,

1104
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:40,660
"Mommy,

1105
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,290
you're the most beautiful woman in the world."

1106
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,890
No, I came here first.

1107
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,870
You're cutting in line.

1108
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,290
Can't you see that?

1109
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,880
Why are you still filming here?

1110
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,220
Aiwen is timid.

1111
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,320
I see it, Mom.

1112
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:57,960
Both kids

1113
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,720
want to ride that wooden horse.

1114
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,460
I want to see how he'll deal with it

1115
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,120
and whether he knows to share.

1116
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:04,710
Okay. Let's watch.

1117
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,990
Nuomi, what's going on?

1118
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,380
You should take turns to use it, right?

1119
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:09,950
Right?

1120
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,040
You should take turns to use it.

1121
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:11,620
I came here first.

1122
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,400
Are you the little girl's mother?

1123
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,360
Grandma, I was playing,

1124
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,450
and she tried to snatch it from me.

1125
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:16,930
Well,

1126
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,110
you need to discipline your daughter.

1127
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,070
She can't be so rude

1128
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:19,810
and snatch other kids' toys.

1129
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,570
She… She didn't…

1130
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:21,430
Mom, you can't talk like that.

1131
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,210
She's just a little girl, okay?

1132
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,300
-A little girl…
-Aiwen.

1133
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,440
Don't you want to play on that?

1134
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,770
Let Grandma take you to play on the slide,

1135
00:41:26,770 --> 00:41:27,390
okay?

1136
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,030
-You really need to discipline her.
-Mom, stop it.

1137
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:29,760
Understand?

1138
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:30,590
I'm sorry.

1139
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:31,800
My mom is too protective

1140
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,840
of her grandson.

1141
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,000
Nuomi is a good girl.

1142
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,480
I know.

1143
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,260
I was watching them over there.

1144
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,590
Everything was alright.

1145
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:36,920
Yeah.

1146
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,560
I wanted to let the kids

1147
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,630
deal with it themselves.

1148
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,960
Yeah, I think so too.

1149
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,060
Sorry, little girl.

1150
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,480
It's okay.

1151
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,880
Tell her you did something wrong too.

1152
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,940
You shouldn't have...

1153
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,850
Don't cry.

1154
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:46,990
Sorry.

1155
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,670
It's fine.

1156
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,090
It's okay.

1157
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,660
Alright. Mommy understands.

1158
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:52,410
You want to play with it too.

1159
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:53,480
I'm really sorry.

1160
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,540
It's fine.

1161
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:55,920
You can't do that.

1162
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,650
You need to wait for your turn.

1163
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:59,250
Understand? It's alright now.

1164
00:41:59,250 --> 00:41:59,960
Sorry.

1165
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:00,620
It's okay.

1166
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,550
It's alright.

1167
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:05,720
Sorry.

1168
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,580
The user you dialed

1169
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,110
is unavailable now.

1170
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:10,880
Please try again later.

1171
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,110
My gosh,

1172
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,420
you finally picked up.

1173
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,720
Can you hear me?

1174
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,030
The signal is bad.

1175
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,280
The bad signal

1176
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,880
doesn't mean you can avoid work.

1177
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,480
Your new book will be released early.

1178
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,410
Write something

1179
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:50,490
for its promotion.

1180
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,380
I told you,

1181
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:53,840
I'm on vacation.

1182
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,850
I haven't had one in a long time.

1183
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,540
I don't care. Tomorrow…

1184
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,500
The day after tomorrow at the latest,

1185
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,640
I need to see the article.
