[Episode 5]

4
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:39,479
If he grows up

5
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:40,450
without an independent personality,

6
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,190
he will become very incompetent.

7
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,920
He... Fine, you are competent.

8
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:44,870
You don't even go to work now.

9
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,110
My daughter is supporting you,

10
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,910
right? You...

11
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,390
Aiwen, go inside and sleep.

12
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,710
Zhou Aiwen, go inside and sleep.

13
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,110
Right now. Immediately.

14
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:03,910
Honey.

15
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,630
Mom, do you know

16
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,070
what you were saying?

17
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:19,520
What did I say?

18
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:20,710
No.

19
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,680
I don't understand. What did I say?

20
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,390
Wasn't it just one thing leading to another?

21
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:26,930
That's why I mentioned it.

22
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,670
Even if it was one thing leading to another,

23
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,230
how could you say that?

24
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:33,130
Don't look at me like that.

25
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:34,480
As for the current situation,

26
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,270
it's the best arrangement

27
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,040
in accordance with

28
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,770
our family's actual situation.

29
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,840
It's also what the two of us

30
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,820
have decided.

31
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,630
If you're going to be like this,

32
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:40,300
we don't need you

33
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,490
to assess us.

34
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,829
Because firstly,

35
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,829
you get upset when you see it.

36
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:44,960
It will tire you out.

37
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:45,870
Secondly,

38
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,230
your educational philosophy

39
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,130
indeed has issues.

40
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:48,950
It will have a bad influence on the child.

41
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:49,480
Thirdly,

42
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,350
you will ruin my marital relationship.

43
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,270
What are you saying?

44
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,630
I'm your mom.

45
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,440
What are you saying about me?

46
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,910
I'm ruining your marital relationship?

47
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,470
You may not want to,

48
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,340
but what you said

49
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,250
is indeed ruining

50
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,510
my marital relationship.

51
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:04,990
Fine.

52
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,250
Alright, my daughter.

53
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,580
Okay.

54
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,470
So you're saying everything I did before

55
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,870
was all wrong, is that it?

56
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:14,830
I was wrong.

57
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,310
I admit to you that I was wrong.

58
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,650
I was always eager to intervene before.

59
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,560
I was wrong.

60
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,310
From now on,

61
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,300
do as you please.

62
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:21,860
I won't interfere anymore.

63
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,510
I'm not in a position to do it.

64
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,280
Mom, mom.

65
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,730
She criticized me.

66
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:41,640
I was prepared for that.

67
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,000
But she wasn't ready

68
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,710
for your criticism.

69
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,710
Put on a coat

70
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,150
and apologize to her right away

71
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:48,790
to bring her back.

72
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,150
I don't think I did anything wrong.

73
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,310
You're not wrong,

74
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,560
but your words were too harsh.

75
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,580
Have some water to moisten your throat.

76
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,200
You've talked so much today.

77
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,630
I talked too much?

78
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,250
Really? Did I talk too much?

79
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,930
Who am I doing this for?

80
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,630
Isn't it all for you?

81
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:58,650
Hold on.

82
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,880
Leaving my grandson to Zhou Quan.

83
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,270
Let me tell you, my head

84
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,090
is sweating, you know?

85
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,000
Mom, you've watched the Animal World, right?

86
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,350
Why do wolves drive their pups away

87
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,670
when the time comes?

88
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,030
Zhou Quan was right.

89
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,050
To cultivate an independent personality,

90
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:21,830
we need to wean ourselves mentally.

91
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,870
Aiwen needs to do that, and so do we.

92
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,500
You can't be like this,

93
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,840
micromanaging us in every little thing.

94
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,190
If you keep taking care of us,

95
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,090
we'll never grow up.

96
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:31,710
In that

97
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,950
cruel jungle world,

98
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,000
we won't be able to survive.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,760
We have to grow up on our own.

100
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,980
So when the time comes,

101
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,380
you'll have to drive the wolf pups away.

102
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,320
You guys have to understand me too.

103
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,260
Aiwen is my own grandson.

104
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:47,200
He is Zhou Quan's biological son.

105
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:47,490
I...

106
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,550
I swear he is his biological son.

107
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,830
You naughty child.

108
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,570
Listen,

109
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,360
you'll be the death of me.

110
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:58,480
You laughed.

111
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,030
You finally laughed.

112
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,050
It wasn't easy.

113
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,710
Mom, now I really need you

114
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,230
to trust us,

115
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,390
encourage us

116
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,600
and say,

117
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,950
"Okay, I'm backing off.

118
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,070
Looking forward to your performance."

119
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,750
We need your encouragement.

120
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,260
I will teach Zhou Quan.

121
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,880
Even if he doesn't know, he can learn.

122
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,450
He's not an idiot.

123
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:23,960
Don't try to

124
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,470
insult my husband again.

125
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,360
Mom, that's not good.

126
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,000
Alright.

127
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,670
Go.

128
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:36,880
Just go back.

129
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,020
Hurry up and go back.

130
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,310
The big wolf pup is watching over the little wolf pup.

131
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,440
I don't feel at ease.

132
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,390
Now that you put it that way,

133
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,670
I really think so too.

134
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,390
It's no big deal.

135
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,120
Aiwen

136
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,100
must be sleeping soundly now.

137
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,030
Alright, I'm leaving. Don't be angry anymore.

138
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,300
I'm leaving.

139
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,530
Be careful.

140
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,640
Is your persuasion done?

141
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,630
I've finished coaxing her.

142
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,690
Did it go smoothly?

143
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,730
Anyway, I guess she's not angry now.

144
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,310
Come here.

145
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,230
What's up?

146
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:48,490
Take a look at the real high-tech.

147
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,909
It's so clear.

148
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,900
You can even see the little mustache above his top lip.

149
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:53,890
Honey, you set this up,

150
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,380
it must be invincible.

151
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,150
Why did he get up from bed?

152
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,070
Mommy, I want to sleep with you tonight.

153
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,750
Just once, for the last time.

154
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,480
Mommy, I want to sleep with you.

155
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,750
Just once.

156
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,880
What did Daddy tell you?

157
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,560
-You're a man now.
-I want to sleep with you.

158
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,160
You should be like Ultraman,

159
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,550
be independent.

160
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,270
Wouldn't Ultraman

161
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,230
sleep with his parents?

162
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,880
Ultraman definitely wouldn't.

163
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:23,950
He was so young

164
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,530
when he left his hometown alone

165
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,080
to come to Earth to make a living.

166
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,410
Don't you want to become

167
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,790
a superhero like him?

168
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,750
Shouldn't you

169
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,950
be as independent as him?

170
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,110
Sun Wukong doesn't sleep with his mom either,

171
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,030
do you know that?

172
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,159
Come and see, come here.

173
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,460
Sun Wukong was born from a stone.

174
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:37,900
That's right.

175
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,230
You even know about this.

176
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:39,630
Look,

177
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,669
Daddy installed a magical eye

178
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,710
in your room.

179
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,280
It can zoom in a lot.

180
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,080
So if you have any problems

181
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,390
in this room,

182
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:50,590
Daddy will see it

183
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,400
and rush over

184
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,030
to accompany you right away.

185
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,930
So don't be afraid.

186
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,690
Your daddy has a third eye.

187
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,230
Go on.

188
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,310
Sleep by yourself then.

189
00:08:59,310 --> 00:08:59,710
Okay?

190
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,070
-Be good.
-Okay.

191
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:05,360
Why are you walking with your toes pointing outward?

192
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,040
His little back view looks quite lonely.

193
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,440
It looks rather pitiful.

194
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,150
You'll be even lonelier.

195
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,630
Tonight,

196
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,630
you'll have to rush the manuscript by yourself again.

197
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,090
No worries, leave it to me.

198
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,350
I'm like Ultraman too.

199
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,190
He usually wakes up around 3 a.m.

200
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,320
Don't forget to set an alarm.

201
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,580
-It's already set. Don't worry.
-Great.

202
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,250
Then I'll go tidy up.

203
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,110
How come my son

204
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,630
is so good-looking?

205
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,810
♫ For many years the two of us have been together ♫

♫ Moving forward in an uneventful way ♫

208
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,070
Hello?

209
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,350
So how's Quan adapting?

210
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:52,190
It started out quite well.

211
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,270
♫ But every time I look at you ♫

212
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,660
But my dear mother,

213
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,790
as expected,

214
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,860
started a battle.

215
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,210
♫ There's still a little bit of youth in your face ♫

216
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,830
Neither of them gave in to the other.

217
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:02,430
They fought a fierce battle.

218
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,510
But my mom always puts Zhou Quan down.

219
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,410
She looks down on this

220
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,810
and disapproves of that.

221
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,480
♫ I've suffered a lot by myself ♫

222
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,640
I'm afraid if she keeps doing this,

223
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,710
the self-confidence that Zhou Quan just built up

224
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,990
will be gone.

225
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,250
It won't happen that way.

226
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:18,950
♫ And there's nothing worth remembering ♫

227
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,750
I think Quan actually has

228
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:16,970
a strong inner self.

229
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,510
You

230
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,750
have never been in a serious relationship,

231
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,390
let alone married life.

♫ But every day when I see you ♫

233
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,190
You don't understand.

The person by your side,

235
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,920

237
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,420
He just lost his job.

00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,270
No matter how strong he pretends to be,

239
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,390
he is still vulnerable.

240
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,240
If the family

241
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,680
has no confidence in him,

242
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,450
nitpicking this and that,

243
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,550
he will feel very upset.

244
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,730

I keep thinking if there's any way

248
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,870
to help him.

you talk to your mom?

252
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,790
She's your mom after all.

♫ The moonlight and the stars make me restless ♫

258
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,590
is quite difficult to deal with.

259
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,060
Of course it's all because she loves us.

261
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,240

and worked very hard.

263
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,030

you know?

265
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,750
I can't criticize her too.

266
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,110
If I criticize her, she'll cry.

267
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,610
I'm afraid of hurting her feelings.

268
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,050
I can only take it slowly. Listen,

Really.

294

Don't cry, be good.

296

It's been difficult for you.

297
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,530
Zhou Aiwen.

298
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,150
Stop crying.

299
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,000
It's been difficult for you, be good.

300
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,020
Mom, why are you crying too?

301
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,440
Don't hold him.

302
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,330
The more you hold him, the louder he cries.

303
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,130
That's right.

304
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,250
Why are you joining in the fuss?

305
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,140
This has something to do with me.

306
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,050
My alarm didn't go off.

307
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,510
So I accidentally overslept.

308
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,170
You accidentally overslept.

309
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,190
Then my grandson suffered from it.

310
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:34,900
Now he knows shame.

311
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,530
He wet the bed and he's upset.

312
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,240
What's with you two?

313
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,990
Don't cry, be good.

314
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,280
Look at you two.

315
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,500
Is this necessary?

316
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,590
I haven't started on at you yet.

317
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,630
What's the point of you

318
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,110
setting up the camera?

319
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:51,640
Can it do housework?

320
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,610
Or can it wake the child up?

321
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,380
It's completely useless.

322
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,000
Why did you set this thing up?

323
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,500
Tell me.

324
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,790
Mom, it's just wetting the bed.

325
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:00,610
When we took care of him,

326
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,880
didn't he wet the bed?

327
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,930
How come it's a big deal

328
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:03,900
with Zhou Quan?

329
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:04,360
Exactly.

330
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,750
Who didn't wet the bed when they were little?

331
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,830
A five-year-old child.

332
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,240
Do I have to set an alarm for him every day

333
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,470
to wake him up at night?

334
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,310
Li, listen.

335
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,610
Listen to what he said.

336
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,510
He's just thinking about himself.

337
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,170
He wants to have a good night's sleep.

338
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,240
He's not considering the child's health at all.

339
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,240
I heard it, Mom.

340
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,100
But I think he's right.

341
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,030
Shouldn't we develop his

342
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,430
healthy lifestyle?

343
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,850
He'll be in junior high school soon.

344
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:25,630
Are we still going to be beside him,

345
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:26,470
setting an alarm clock for him

346
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,790
and asking him to get up at night?

347
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,430
Then when he's eighteen,

348
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:30,360
are we still going to wipe his butt?

349
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,910
Okay, I was wrong.

350
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,230
I'm not good at arguing as you.

351
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,510
Be good, don't cry.

352
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,710
Come on, live with Grandma.

353
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,230
Your daddy and mommy

354
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:40,630
think you're a bother.

355
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:43,430
Mom, you can't say that.

356
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,590
This is not a joke.

357
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,880
Those words will

358
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:46,930
cause great harm to his psyche.

359
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:47,440
Do you know that?

360
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,100
It can lead to mental illness.

361
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,090
I've hurt the child, haven't I?

362
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,860
I've hurt the child, right?

363
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,400
Okay, you're good.

364
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,170
I was wrong. Can't I just leave?

365
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,410
Okay, okay, alright.

366
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,610
Why are you taking it so seriously?

367
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:00,670
Don't stop me.

368
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,550
No, I was wrong.

369
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,050
I was wrong, okay?

370
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,250
Zhou Aiwen, I'm going to count to three.

371
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,530
If you keep crying,

372
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,340
you won't be allowed to go out and play anymore.

373
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,400
You can't go to play tomorrow either.

374
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,130
What's the matter?

375
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,160
Grandma, I don't want to cry anymore.

376
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,530
I want to go out and play.

377
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,670
Why are you watching it?

378
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,930
It's fully automatic.

379
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,070
Then someone has to take it out

380
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,310
after it's done washing.

381
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,910
So before it's done washing,

382
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,110
you're going to stand here and watch it?

383
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:35,370
Where else should I go?

384
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,120
You're in a mood.

385
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,740
Just a little bit.

386
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,880
A little bit of what?

387
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,790
Feeling frustrated?

388
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,710
How could that be?

389
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,250
The alarm clock,

390
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,440
I didn't even set it.

391
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,230
I wanted to take a gamble, but I lost.

392
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,230
It's not a defeat.

393
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,450
It's good to let go appropriately

394
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:01,230
to let Aiwen learn

395
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,350
to be responsible for himself.

396
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,500
After a period of time,

397
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,670
it might just work.

398
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,190
I wanted to do that before too.

399
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:09,030
But I didn't dare. I was afraid of my mom.

400
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,290
You're braver than me.

401
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,830
So you support me, right?

402
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:12,990
Of course I support you.

403
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,710
But answer me

404
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,870
one question honestly.

405
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,200
Okay.

406
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,480
Do you really want to build

407
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,840
Aiwen's independence,

408
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,900
or do you also not want to get up

409
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,310
because you're lazy?

410
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:23,630
Both.

411
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,670
I knew you

412
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,030
found a bunch of excuses for yourself.

413
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:29,870
Listen,

414
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,870
don't let my mom look down on you, okay?

415
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:33,870
I know.

416
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,190
You're so ugly.

417
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,410
Don't give my mom any leverage.

418
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,360
I'm telling you.

419
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,430
Say it again.

420
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,630
Say what?

421
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,589
Right.

422
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:09,079
Otherwise, the wind will blow it away.

423
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:14,300
Give it to me.

424
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,680
What do you mean?

425
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:24,790
I want to wait for the bed sheet to dry.

426
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:27,740
In this way, my inferiority complex will be washed away.

427
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,200
Okay, I'll accompany you.

428
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,150
Come on, Son.

429
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,010
Do you know

430
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:45,670
where all the moisture goes

431
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,130
after the bed sheet dries?

432
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,630
It gets dried by the sun.

433
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,420
Yes, after being sun-dried,

434
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,660
what does it turn into?

435
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,940
From a physicochemical perspective,

436
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,620
it should turn into gas

437
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,060
or clouds.

438
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,520
Water vapor turns into clouds.

439
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,120
You're so smart.

440
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,100
Did Mommy teach you that?

441
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:07,690
The clouds

442
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:09,320
are the largest

443
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,630
visible result of the water cycle

444
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,790
in this world.

445
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,140
Theoretically, that's how it is.

446
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,240
They are also paintings in the sky.

447
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,210
Each cloud

448
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,900
is an individual pattern.

449
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,950
What does that cloud look like to you?

450
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,630
Ultraman.

451
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,590
That one looks like a carrot.

452
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:26,070
That one resembles a sword.

453
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,270
Are there any other patterns

454
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,390
you don't think you'd like?

455
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,090
I think

456
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,470
the one I dislike the most is that one.

457
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:31,960
Why?

458
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,190
It looks like a stinky sock.

459
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,370
Daddy happens to know this cloud.

460
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,320
Yesterday, in my dream,

461
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,790
it told me its story.

462
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,690
Do you want to hear it?

463
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,060
Yes.

464
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:45,910
Okay.

465
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,240
In the past,

466
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,590
it was mocked by clouds that were shaped like swords,

467
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,870
dinosaurs,

468
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:54,830
lions,

469
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,120
tigers,

470
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,080
and all of which were well-shaped.

471
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,230
It was so sad

472
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,630
that it cried.

473
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,080
The tears turned into rainwater

474
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,500
and fell to the ground.

475
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,910
People then held up

476
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,110
colorful umbrellas.

477
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,110
Those colorful umbrellas

478
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,820
formed patterns again.

479
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,440
Some looked like lions,

480
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,170
some looked like carrots,

481
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,460
and some looked just like it,

482
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,520
like a smelly sock.

483
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,720
When it saw those patterns,

484
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,850
it became thrilled.

485
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,250
It laughed again,

486
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,590
laughing and laughing,

487
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,280
until it laughed itself open.

488
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,600
It then turned into a big bed,

489
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,870
a comfortable big bed.

490
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,740
At night,

491
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,580
Grandma Moon leaned against it

492
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,190
and also thanked it,

493
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,880
saying, "Thank you.

494
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,110
You give me something to rely on

495
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,030
to light up the night sky."

496
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,390
Beautiful, isn't it?

497
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,590
Why did Daddy tell you

498
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,590
this story?

499
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,070
It's because I want to tell you that

500
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,470
bedwetting is a natural phenomenon.

501
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:58,190
Wetting the bed now

502
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,790
doesn't mean you will still wet the bed in the future.

503
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,680
Each of us

504
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,690
is like a cloud,

505
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,300
always changing.

506
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:05,540
Daddy,

507
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,350
but why did this cloud

508
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:10,030
turn into a smelly sock again?

509
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:13,230
Because it wanted me to

510
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,390
tell you this story.

511
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:17,430
Then why did it want you

512
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,650
to tell me this story?

513
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,210
It wanted me to tell you

514
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,420
not to feel inferior because of bedwetting,

515
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,170
and especially not to feel inferior

516
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,370
because of anything.

517
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:27,750
Because the process of growing up

518
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,080
is about making mistakes.

519
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,940
Don't be afraid to make mistakes.

520
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:33,400
Daddy,

521
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,080
if you could use clouds

522
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,280
to make a game,

523
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,770
you would truly become a genius in the world.

524
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,350
Daddy

525
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,550
doesn't want to become a genius in the world.

526
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,150
I only want to be your genius.

527
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,100
Two documents for Ding Hui and Chen Jian.

528
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,420
Here's a parcel for Zhou Quan.

529
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,210
Zhou Quan?

530
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,630
Yes.

531
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,410
Whose is it?

532
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,650
Zhou Quan's parcel.

533
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,430
What is it?

534
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:32,950
Food.

535
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,980
He has left the company. Take it back.

536
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,060
This one is Liu Gang's.

537
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,790
Zhou,

538
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,630
answer the phone.

539
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:48,730
It's yours.

540
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,220
Can you answer it for me?

541
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,030
I'm busy right now.

542
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,160
Answer it yourself.

543
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,470
Do you not want to eat?

544
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:58,850
Do I have to answer the phone myself?

545
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,270
Hello?

546
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,810
Yes, I sent a box of...

547
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:09,470
What?

548
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,630
Resigned?

549
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,390
Who...

550
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,420
Who resigned?

551
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,280
Who is it?

552
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,880
Whose call is it?

553
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:17,750
Who resigned?

554
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,410
You scared me to death.

555
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,290
I'm stir-frying, Mom.

556
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,150
Close the door.

557
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,990
This naughty kid.

558
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,070
What are you laughing at?

559
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,750
Just one dish.

560
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,320
How long has it been?

561
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,880
It's been over an hour.

562
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,670
How bothersome it is.

563
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,220
We are not in a hurry.

564
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,390
Just let him take his time.

565
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,860
As long as it tastes good, that's all that matters.

566
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,440
You are too hard to please, Mom.

567
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,130
Alright, enough talking.

568
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,700
You keep defending him.

569
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,630
He is my husband.

570
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:06,360
If I don't defend him, who will?

571
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,170
Your mother-in-law is calling.

572
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,110
Zhou Quan.

573
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:15,630
Zhou Quan.

574
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,440
Your mom is calling.

575
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:17,950
What?

576
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,270
He can't hear you.

577
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:19,330
I'll get it for him.

578
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:21,650
Your mom is calling.

579
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,950
I'll get it for him, stop shouting.

580
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:23,430
I know.

581
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,350
Mom's calling.

582
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:27,610
Video call.

583
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,220
Video call?

584
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,480
Let's not answer it.

585
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,020
Let's not answer it for now.

586
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,380
Okay.

587
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:42,630
What's wrong?

588
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,030
He said there's no rush.

589
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:44,670
He's stir-frying.

590
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:45,930
He'll answer it later.

591
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,810
It smells good.

592
00:23:59,150 --> 00:23:59,800
Zhou Quan.

593
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,170
Come on. Come out for a bit.

594
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,830
Coming! Just a sec.

595
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,940
What's the matter?

596
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,450
She said it's urgent.

597
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,510
I feel like we can't avoid it anymore.

598
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:16,930
Here it goes again.

599
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,030
No more hiding, then.

600
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:19,630
That's it.

601
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:20,670
Apron.

602
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,430
Fix your hair.

603
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:28,040
What are they doing, being all secretive?

604
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,490
Hello, Mom.

605
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,160
Where are you?

606
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,110
It doesn't look like your company.

607
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,790
I'm at home. I took the day off today.

608
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:49,930
How are things going?

609
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:51,530
How's your work been lately?

610
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,800
Any changes or updates?

611
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,500
No, everything is okay.

612
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,630
It's all going well.

613
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,590
Nonsense!

614
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,110
-It's none of your business.
-Let me talk to him.

615
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,110
Let me talk to him!

616
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,240
Quan, tell me the truth.

617
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,940
Did you quit your job,

618
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,560
or did the company fire you?

619
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,490
Here's the thing, Dad.

620
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,640
I changed jobs.

621
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,730
I switched to a better company.

622
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,550
The benefits here are better than before.

623
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,950
That sounds pretty good.

624
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,510
What's so good about it?

625
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,700
You're not down-to-earth.

626
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,630
Do you know that?

627
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,290
What are you doing?

628
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,340
Say,

629
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,310
you've been at your previous company

630
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,030
for ten years, right?

631
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,550
And now, for a little bit of

632
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,510
petty gain,

633
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,210
you quit your job and switched companies.

634
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:29,120
You may think

635
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,410
that you got the better end of the deal,

636
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:30,950
but in reality,

637
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:33,110
you've lost the opportunity for promotion.

638
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,570
You're not young anymore.

639
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,270
How many decades can a person live?

640
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:36,710
Dad.

641
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:39,880
The video call is a bit choppy, Dad.

642
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:40,710
Dad...

643
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:47,880
Enough already.

644
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,560
What are you doing?

645
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,830
Our son hasn't even started the new job yet,

646
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,070
and you're already giving him a hard time.

647
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,440
Didn't our son say

648
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,000
that he'd found a new job

649
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,190
and felt pretty good about it?

650
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,030
He's already under a lot of pressure in life,

651
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:58,410
right?

652
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,310
He has to support the family.

653
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,840
Why do you have to scold him?

654
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,530
I'm educating him. That's what it is.

655
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,820
Who are you educating?

656
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:05,990
Who asked for your education?

657
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,050
I'm educating him.

658
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,350
A grown man should handle things

659
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,640
steadily and solidly.

660
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,510
He should not be reckless and rash.

661
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:12,910
You...

662
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,660
Forget it. I'm done talking to you.

663
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,390
You wouldn't understand even if I explained.

664
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:17,190
It's almost time to eat.

665
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,070
Where are you going?

666
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,550
I'm not eating! I'm too mad.

667
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,350
What are you mad at?

668
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:21,750
Don't sneak off to drink.

669
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,870
Mom, what's wrong again?

670
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,330
I'm a little worried about you.

671
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:39,110
I want to give you some advice.

672
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:42,230
Your dad is always like that.

673
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,000
He doesn't speak nicely.

674
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,500
He's had a sharp tongue but a soft heart all his life.

675
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,760
Don't take it to heart.

676
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,690
He really cares about you.

677
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,470
I don't care. It doesn't matter.

678
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,110
I'm used to being scolded already.

679
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,670
Son,

680
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,060
tell Mom the truth privately.

681
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,400
Why

682
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:00,490
did you leave your previous company?

683
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:01,190
Didn't you say

684
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,040
the benefits at that company were pretty good?

685
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,240
And you were about to get promoted soon.

686
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,030
Well, the company…

687
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:07,400
I...

688
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,200
Well, now,

689
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,830
don't judge things in this era

690
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,690
by your generation's standards.

691
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,670
If the company's good, I'll stay there.

692
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,470
If not, I'll just change, right?

693
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,030
The new company has better benefits.

694
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,270
As for the previous company,

695
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,670
there were many interpersonal relationship issues

696
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,350
that I didn't really like.

697
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,100
That's it.

698
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,080
Really?

699
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:25,680
You have always been

700
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,080
one to share only good news but not worries.

701
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,430
But Mom just wants to tell you

702
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,790
now that you're going to a new company,

703
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,790
you'll have to start all over again.

704
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,520
It's really tough.

705
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:37,710
Also,

706
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,510
why don't you send Aiwen

707
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:40,350
back to me?

708
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:42,650
Let me take care of him for a while for you.

709
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,930
Or shall I go to Suzhou?

710
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,350
No.

711
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,210
No, no, no.

712
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,620
Absolutely not, Mom.

713
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,580
Everything is going well.

714
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,330
Everything is going smoothly.

715
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,120
You have to

716
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,260
take so much trouble, coming all this way.

717
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,860
You should accompany my dad.

718
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,110
Okay. Mom believes in you.

719
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,590
Work hard.

720
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:57,670
Keep it up!

721
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:58,750
Okay.

722
00:27:58,950 --> 00:27:59,270
Bye.

723
00:27:59,420 --> 00:27:59,890
Bye.

724
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,360
He rode a bicycle

725
00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:13,330
and went shopping with Robin.

726
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,130
Every night, Robin

727
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,740
said goodnight to the moon.

728
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,550
He would

729
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:20,780
blow a kiss

730
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,250
to the brightest star.

731
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,150
Benjamin was guarding the whole family.

732
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,790
His candle

733
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,910
kept burning on the mantelpiece.

734
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:30,330
Robin's family

735
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,630
was immersed in happiness again,

736
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,480
forever.

737
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:39,590
Daddy,

738
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,200
this story is so touching.

739
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:41,970
Daddy,

740
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,630
can you tell me one more?

741
00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:44,750
Didn't we agree

742
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,210
to only read one book a day?

743
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,700
Daddy, please, Daddy.

744
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:49,390
Why

745
00:28:49,390 --> 00:28:51,450
do you always want to break the rules?

746
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,110
Daddy.

747
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:53,840
Alright.

748
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,440
I want this one.

749
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,660
You Are My Friend.

750
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,660
You Are My Friend.

751
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,840
Little Mole really…

752
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,660
likes his cozy burrow.

753
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,880
Daddy, keep reading.

754
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,920
Daddy, keep reading.

755
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:31,270
Daddy.

756
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,430
Daddy, keep reading.

757
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,210
Sorry, I'm out of power.

758
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,560
I need to go back to my planet.

759
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,670
Okay.

760
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,840
But for me to stand up,

761
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,700
I need to charge a little bit more.

762
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,500
Good night.

763
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,350
Is he asleep?

764
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,230
What are you reading?

765
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,280
The comments on my blog.

766
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,030
I used to think that the followers

767
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,870
of my blog

768
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,320
were mainly post-80s.

769
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,810
I didn't expect there to be so many young girls

770
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:36,370
who were post-95s or post-00s.

771
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,710
Sometimes, the things they say

772
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,230
are so funny.

773
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:39,090
Let me show you.

774
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,910
Aiwen is so cute!

775
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,830
Any aunties want to team up

776
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,900
to kidnap the baby? Count me in!

777
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,070
Today, I, as his cloud mother,

778
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,380
am here to raise Aiwen online again.

779
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,750
Update! Update!

780
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,430
Aiwen is too charming.

781
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,910
He has a bunch of mom fans.

782
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:04,930
These young girls…

783
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,090
They are everywhere, huh?

784
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:08,030
What?

785
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,470
You need to keep up with the trend.

786
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,490
When you're free, you should also surf the internet.

787
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:11,250
Your wife is doing this,

788
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,650
yet you don't care at all.

789
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:14,830
By the way,

790
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:16,790
how was your chat with your parents

791
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,110
this afternoon?

792
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,230
I don't know

793
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:20,890
how they found out

794
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,150
about my resignation,

795
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:23,890
but I didn't tell them.

796
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,350
I just said I changed jobs.

797
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,350
My dad

798
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:27,580
scolded me harshly.

799
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,490
Say,

800
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,340
are we going to keep

801
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,670
lying to them like this?

802
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,160
One lie

803
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,870
needs many more lies to cover up.

804
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,270
It's so tiring, honey.

805
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,370
We can't hide this forever.

806
00:31:41,370 --> 00:31:43,110
It will be exposed sooner or later.

807
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:45,370
Shall we just tell them?

808
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,410
Anyway, we're both okay with it.

809
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:49,150
We're doing pretty well.

810
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,320
Just try to persuade them.

811
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,720
What can they do about it?

812
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,810
Honey, have you thought about me?

813
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,450
At home, there's your mom.

814
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,090
Her two eyes examine me, and her mouth judges me.

815
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,650
I'm already uncoordinated.

816
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,850
If my parents came too,

817
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:01,270
that'd be six eyes and three mouths.

818
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,040
Then, I'll be like a crab with eight claws,

819
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:03,630
pointy on both ends,

820
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,550
and this big in size.

821
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,150
Indeed.

822
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,180
But honey, I think it's such a waste of talent

823
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,310
that you didn't go perform crosstalk.

824
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:13,500
Oh right,

825
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,830
there's something else I need to send you.

826
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,050
Just look at this.

827
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,850
Check it out on your phone later.

828
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,270
Anyway,

829
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:24,900
it's some of my experience and feelings.

This supply is very timely.

833
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,370
That's so great, honey.

834
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,770
Absolutely fantastic.

835
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,170
How can you be so amazing?

836
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,480
Alright, I'm going to write my article now.

837
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,090
Before that,

838
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:38,650
can we

839
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,210
do the real business first?

840
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,160
That is the real business.

841
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,110
Didn't you see people

842
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:43,970
urge me to update?

843
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:45,350
What could be more important

844
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,750
than our own business?

845
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,470
It's just a matter of two or three hours.

846
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:51,970
Honey,

847
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,570
I don't like it when you brag.

848
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,230
Go ahead. Go ahead.

849
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,680
You look so disappointed.

850
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,210
I'll try to finish writing and come back ASAP.

851
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:06,520

[2:30 a.m.]

854
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,120
Aiwen.

855
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,550
Okay.

856
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,710
Baby, come to pee.

857
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,440
Nuomi's mom.

858
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:13,889
Nuomi's personality

859
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:14,760
is really great.

860
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,610
You just moved here a few days ago,

861
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,370
and she's already getting along well

862
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:17,300
with other kids.

863
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,090
Yes, she's quite gentle.

864
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,239
She can play with anyone.

865
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,170
I guess she takes after you in temperament.

866
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,969
I suppose she does take after me.

867
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,010
That clothing store for kids

868
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,110

870
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,639
Buy three items and get 30% off.

Buy five items and get 50% off.

872

I think we should go quickly.

873
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,590

00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:33,989
Hello.

876
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,469
Aiwen's dad.

877
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:37,650
Let me introduce you.

878
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,780
This is Aiwen's dad.

879
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:40,909
This is Ran's mom.

880
00:34:40,909 --> 00:34:41,780
Hello. Hello.

881
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,830
Yue's mom.

882
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,719
Fanqie's mom.

883
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,840
And Qi's mom.

884
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,420
Right.

885
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:45,889
Hello.

886
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,790
Where's Aiwen's mom?

887
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:49,260
She's busy with something.

888
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,429
So, I'm here to take care of the kid.

889
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:52,110
Aiwen's dad is such a good husband

890
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:52,739
and a good father.

891
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:53,230
Indeed.

892
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:53,969
It's not that big of a deal.

893
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:54,830
All I do is just take care of the kid. How come…

894
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,040
Oh, don't be so modest.

895
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,350
You're already doing great.

896
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,550
My husband

897
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,690
runs a small, lousy company

898
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:00,810
and is busy from morning to night.

899
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:01,690
I barely even see him.

900
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,400
At least your husband can make money.

901
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,430
If he stayed home doing laundry and cooking,

902
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,210
how would your family of three

903
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:06,950
survive on nothing?

904
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,370
You have a point there.

905
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,770
I have an uncle…

906
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,440
Aiwen, let's go.

907
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:12,710
I don't want to.

908
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:13,310
I want to play a little longer.

909
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:14,870
My aunt is the only one who works.

910
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,870
She is supporting the whole family.

911
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:19,350
Aiwen's dad, I wasn't talking about you.

912
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,610
Don't take it to heart.

913
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:21,240
No, no, no.

914
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:21,950
It's fine.

915
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,310
Aiwen's dad

916
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,970
is different from your uncle.

917
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,950
He has a job.

918
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:26,770
He works in IT.

919
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,110
He's an elite in a big company.

920
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:29,420
Mr. Zhou, am I right?

921
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,840
An elite in a big company!

922
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,250
I wouldn't say "elite."

923
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,000
I happened to

924
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,290
be thinking about changing jobs.

925
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,910
After I quit,

926
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,750
I can take care of the kid at home.

927
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:38,960
IT is such a lucrative field.

928
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,470
Why did you just quit and stay at home?

929
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,410
It's not really quitting.

930
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,400
Anyway, I was kind of passive.

931
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,130
By the way, Yue's mom,

932
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:46,670
the movie you mentioned yesterday

933
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,530
was quite good.

934
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,790
My husband is about to get off work.

935
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,420
I need to go back and make dinner.

936
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,940
Okay, I'll leave with you then.

937
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,270
Okay, let's go together.

938
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,300
Let's go together. I'm leaving, too.

939
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,560
Fanqie, let's go home.

940
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,190
-Yue.
-Ran.

941
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,890
Aiwen, let's go, too.

942
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,390
I want to play a little longer.

943
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,110
Nuomi.

944
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,790
Let's go home too, Nuomi.

945
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,320
I want to play with Aiwen a little longer.

946
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,000
The two kids get along well.

947
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:11,990
Mr. Zhou,

948
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,600
these moms

949
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,750
are not bad people.

950
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:16,790
They just like to gossip.

951
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:17,720
Don't take

952
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,860
what they say too seriously.

953
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,870
No, no, not at all.

954
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,260
I didn't know

955
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,030
about your current situation.

956
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,710
I spoke out of turn just now.

957
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,680
No, no, no.

958
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,560
Sorry about that.

959
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,820
It's completely fine. No worries at all.

960
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,560
The two of them seem to

961
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:31,820
be the closest

962
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,680
in the community.

963
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,880
Yes, they've played together before.

964
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:35,430
Right.

965
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,230
Qiao.

966
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,540
Honey, you're so early today.

967
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,030
Hello.

968
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:39,760
Hello, hello.

969
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,530
This is Aiwen's dad.

970
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,050
We had a meal together

971
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:42,720
at that resort before,

972
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,470
remember?

973
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:44,640
Yes, I remember.

974
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,890
Isn't this the elite in the big company?

975
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:46,860
No, no, no.

976
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:47,550
Not really.

977
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,750
Aren't you going home to cook?

978
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,620
No, we just happened to run into each other.

979
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,510
Recently, Aiwen's dad

980
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,170
has been taking care of the kid at home.

981
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,300
It's a good opportunity for us to chat.

982
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,270
Yes, I temporarily...

983
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,670
I recently changed jobs.

984
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:01,920
An elite like you

985
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:04,010
should find it very easy to find a job.

986
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:04,910
Not really.

987
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,930
I'm still searching.

988
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,730
I can take care of the kid in the meantime.

989
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:11,650
Taking care of the kid is great.

990
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,070
Everyone says your job is tough,

991
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,930
having a 996 or 007 work schedule.

992
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:16,290
Staying at home with the kid

993
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,150
suits you well.

994
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,060
Nuomi, let's go home.

995
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:20,430
Stop playing.

996
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:21,360
Nuomi, let's go.

997
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,240
We'll get going then.

998
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,920
Okay.

999
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,450
Bye.

1000
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:24,840
Bye.

1001
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,200
Aiwen. Bye, Aiwen.

1002
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:27,750
Bye.

1003
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:28,750
Say goodbye to Aiwen.

1004
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,340
Bye.

1005
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,640
Let's go, Aiwen.

1006
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,780
Just a video?

1007
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,880
I'll discuss it with my husband later

1008
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,140
and see what he thinks.

1009
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:39,620
Okay.

1010
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,870
Well, bye.

1011
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,470
How was the play?

1012
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:47,710
Not bad.

1013
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,650
Did you have fun?

1014
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,270
I had a lot of fun!

1015
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,910
I wasn't talking to you, sweetie.

1016
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:52,730
Change your shoes now.

1017
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,240
Take everything off and go shower.

1018
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,740
Daddy is going to change clothes, too.

1019
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,250
Okay.

1020
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,780
Is the scrubbing comfortable this time?

1021
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,540
Yes.

1022
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,030
Right?

1023
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:02,780
Daddy,

1024
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,310
today, the other kids

1025
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,830
were all very envious of me

1026
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,750
because I was the only one

1027
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,230
taken out to play by Daddy.

1028
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,350
The other kids were all taken out by their moms

1029
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:13,230
or grandmas.

1030
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:14,790
Is it so?

1031
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:17,870
Daddy,

1032
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,350
they said you're a stay-at-home dad.

1033
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,650
What does "stay-at-home dad" mean?

1034
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,650
A stay-at-home dad

1035
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,060
doesn't have to go to work

1036
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,570
and stays at home to take care of the kids and do housework.

1037
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,810
That's so great.

1038
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,430
Daddy, can you always

1039
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,720
be a stay-at-home dad?

1040
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,640
This way, you don't have to work.

1041
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:38,130
You don't have to do anything.

1042
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:40,190
You can stay home with me all the time.

1043
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,210
Is he asleep?

1044
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:30,790
Honey.

1045
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,080
Let's make up for those two or three hours yesterday,

1046
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:34,950
shall we?

1047
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,920
I purposely finished

1048
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:41,070
all my drafts early today.

1049
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,190
Honey, I really am

1050
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,080
willing but unable to do so today.

1051
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:51,470
What's wrong?

1052
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,500
When you came in today,

1053
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,100
I noticed you weren't happy.

1054
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,550
It's not that I'm unhappy.

1055
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,500
Shall we talk?

1056
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,790
I just don't quite understand

1057
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,400
why the moms in this community

1058
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,830
look down on

1059
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,410
what they do.

1060
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:23,120
Because now,

1061
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,370
most of the voices out there

1062
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,330
are still unfriendly

1063
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,930
towards stay-at-home parents.

1064
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,610
This is just the current reality.

1065
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,810
But I really

1066
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,820
never felt that way.

1067
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,600
When I was a stay-at-home mom,

1068
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,200
I was actually pretty happy.

1069
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:44,330
Before I became

1070
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:45,870
a stay-at-home dad,

1071
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:48,010
I was mentally prepared for these things.

1072
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,700
We discussed it thoroughly.

1073
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,840
But I still didn't expect

1074
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,320
that the outside world

1075
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,310
would give me

1076
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:56,940
such…

1077
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,910
such a hard time.

1078
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,500
It's not that I can't handle it.

1079
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,230
It just feels a little awkward.

1080
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:03,830
When I communicate with

1081
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:05,310
the moms in the community,

1082
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:07,000
I feel like

1083
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,260
their husbands,

1084
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,160
especially one of them,

1085
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,270
look at me in a way,

1086
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:16,250
to put it nicely, like looking at a second-class citizen,

1087
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,230
to put it bluntly, like

1088
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:19,890
a pervert sneaking into the women's bathhouse.

1089
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,520
Who is so annoying?

1090
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:22,700
It's Nuomi's dad.

1091
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,230
That man…

1092
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,750
Anyway, the first time

1093
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,470
we were out playing

1094
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,270
and ran into him,

1095
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:29,630
I really disliked him.

1096
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,710
Yeah, I don't like him, either.

1097
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,300
If you encounter people like him in the future,

1098
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:34,570
like, if they say nasty things to you

1099
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,310
or eye you

1100
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:37,090
unfriendly,

1101
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,090
you tell them off.

1102
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,720
Actually, the most important thing is

1103
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,010
that I'm afraid Aiwen will think

1104
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:42,120
his dad is a loser

1105
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,070
and that I stay at home

1106
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,070
because I failed.

1107
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,380
This is what I'm most worried about.

1108
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,040
You don't have to worry at all.

1109
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:48,800
This can be clearly explained

1110
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,870
to him.

1111
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,070
This is Daddy's choice,

1112
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:54,270
not that Daddy has no other options.

1113
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,100
Daddy chooses to stay at home to accompany him

1114
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:57,860
and take care of him.

1115
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,650
Look how happy he was

1116
00:41:58,650 --> 00:41:59,980
when he came back today.

1117
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:01,750
Right?

1118
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:04,510
You don't have to worry about that at all.

1119
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:07,830
And honey,

1120
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:09,510
not only

1121
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,090
are you valuable at home,

1122
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:12,830
I also need you guys

1123
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,160
to make money out there.

1124
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,020
I took a…

1125
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:17,630
what do you call it,

1126
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:19,230
an advertising video today.

1127
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,230
The other party…

1128
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,690
It is a learning machine.

1129
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,650
The other party hopes Aiwen and you

1130
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:24,530
can also appear in the video.

1131
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,390
How much money?

1132
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:27,990
A hundred thousand.

1133
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,670
Did you hear the bell?

1134
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,030
So I just think,

1135
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:36,090
let's not care what

1136
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,540
those people outside think.

1137
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,640
Let's just live

1138
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,640
our own little life.

1139
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,640
That's right.

1140
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:42,970
Honey,

1141
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,770
I seem to be perked up again.

1142
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:45,950
Go away.

1143
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,190
I can make up

1144
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:47,880
the two or three hours now.

1145
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,390
Get lost!

1146
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,460
-Let's go.
-Cut it out.

1147
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,070
We agreed on it.

1148
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:50,880
What did we agree on?

1149
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,310
You refused it yourself.

1150
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,070
You said you were willing but unable.

1151
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,470
Okay, let's just take out an hour

1152
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,240
because we chatted,

1153
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,710
but there are still two hours left, right?

1154
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,770
What are you doing?

1155
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,670
One, two, three, four.
