[Episode 9]

4
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,430
Hello, Ms. Meng.

5
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:40,789
Hi.

6
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,729
President.

7
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,280
What's going on?

8
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,320
Meng, you're finally here.

9
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:48,930
Didn't we agree

10
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,880
to invite the press

11
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,880
after I talked to Cherry?

12
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,430
Yeah. I don't know what's going on either.

13
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,910
Why don't you go and take a look first?

14
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:54,910
Let's talk later.

15
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,479
Okay.

16
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:57,840
Go ahead.

17
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:02,990
So,

18
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,550
Cherry couldn't have made such achievements

19
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,230
without the publishing house's

20
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,350
painstaking efforts to train her.

21
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,460
The publishing house

22
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,960
was established in 2000.

23
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:17,110
20 years have passed.

24
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,940
In these 20 years,

25
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,760
out of their pursuit and passion

26
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,960
for the publishing industry,

27
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,150
our staff

28
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,590
have fully utilized their initiative

29
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,600
and creativity.

30
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,329
We've won numerous honors,

31
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:31,140
including being named

32
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,710
one of the "Top 10 Publishing Houses."

33
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,370
-In the future...
-Excuse me.

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,620
Excuse me, Ms. Liu.

35
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,950
Could you please

36
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,240
contact Cherry for us

37
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,230
first?

38
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,410
You said you are

39
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,620
Cherry's executive editor.

40
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,650
But we actually would prefer

41
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:46,850
to interview her

42
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,210
and her family members.

43
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:50,180
The development of the publishing house

44
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,190
is not within the scope of our interview...

45
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,340
Girl,

46
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,630
what's wrong with you?

47
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,640
How could you interrupt

48
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,630
an interviewee's train of thought?

49
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,610
Sorry, Ms. Liu.

50
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,150
Please don't be angry.

51
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,890
Li

52
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,270
just joined our team.

53
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,930
She's indeed inexperienced.

54
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,310
Please forgive her.

55
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,290
Li,

56
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,520
apologize to Ms. Liu.

57
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,000
Ms. Liu...

58
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,470
Sorry, I'm late.

59
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,630
Hello, everyone.

60
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,570
I'm Cherry's executive editor,

61
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,280
Meng Fei.

62
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,550
-Director Liu.
-Hello.

63
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,110
We communicated over the phone before.

64
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,550
Yes.

65
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,410
If there's anything,

66
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,280
just talk to me.

67
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:27,950
Okay.

68
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,640
What are you talking about?

69
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,190
You should focus on the big picture.

70
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,200
You want

71
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,710
to interview Cherry, right?

72
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,350
Yes.

73
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,870
Then let's go find her

74
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,510
and chat with her face-to-face, okay?

75
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,640
That would be great!

76
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,130
I...

77
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,440
I only have a couple of words left.

78
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,610
I'll be done in a second.

79
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,400
Don't go. Why are you leaving?

80
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,400
Don't go!

81
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,600
D-Don't delete my part!

82
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,190
Ms. Liu is a professional!

83
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:53,760
Let me see the part

84
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,880
you recorded on your phone just now.

85
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:55,829
I failed to record it.

86
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:57,270
I forgot to switch to the video mode.

87
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,730
-I only took a few photos.
-Then why were you

88
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,350
moving your phone

89
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,360
-pretending to shoot a video?
-That is unprofessional.

90
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,690
Nuomi, have some water.

91
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,400
Come here.

92
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,960
What are you laughing about?

93
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,390
I'm watching a video.

94
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,400
Isn't she Aiwen's mom,

95
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,370
who lives in our apartment complex?

96
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,100
Let me see.

97
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,590
Is this Aiwen's mom?

98
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,720
She's Cherry.

99
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,910
She's Cherry?

100
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,180
She's been very popular recently.

101
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,140
Qiaoqiao, you know each other well.

102
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,850
Introduce her to us sometime.

103
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,390
Why don't you ask Aiwen's dad

104
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:28,220
to introduce her to you?

105
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:28,960
That's right.

106
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,650
Right?

107
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,390
When Aiwen's dad

108
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,480
takes Aiwen out next time,

109
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,560
let's go add him on WeChat.

110
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,680
I haven't seen him

111
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,659
for a while.

112
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,990
Did he find a job?

113
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,280
Your previous speech

114
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,790
on stay-at-home dads

115
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,350
has spread widely

116
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,500
and sparked heated discussions on the Internet.

117
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,220
We've always wanted

118
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,270
to dig deep into

119
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,220
and know about stay-at-home dads.

120
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,190
A representative family like yours

121
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,350
is hard to find.

122
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,340
So, we want

123
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,140
to shoot

124
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:55,710
some real-life scenes of you and your husband

125
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,170
taking care of your child,

126
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,650
especially your husband

127
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,020
as a stay-at-home dad.

128
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,310
Then, we'll make it into a program

129
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,370
and release it on various platforms.

130
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,750
What do you think?

131
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,640
Actually, he's looking for a job.

132
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,910
I'm a bit worried

133
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,460
that he'll have difficulty

134
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,550
finding a job

135
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,980
if the program comes out.

136
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,310
Don't worry, Ms. Che.

137
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,920
We'll let you go over

138
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,630
all the videos we shoot

139
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,690
and all the edited versions

140
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,130
in advance.

141
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,760
Yes.

142
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:22,920
I do trust

143
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,270
your professional ability and attitude.

144
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,860
But I don't trust my husband.

145
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,670
You're being modest.

146
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,350
Because he

147
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,020
doesn't have

148
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,820
any related experience.

149
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,650
I understand.

150
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,390
Yeah.

151
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,350
So...

152
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,120
Ms. Che.

153
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,230
This is the garment

154
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,390
your mom made

155
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,070
for Aiwen's Ultraman, right?

156
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:41,100
Yes. How do you know?

157
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,120
It's so cute.

158
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,270
In

159
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,810
"Survival Guide for Middle-Aged Women",

160
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:45,380
you mentioned

161
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,420
the red flower stamp competition in which Aiwen's dad and grandma

162
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,600
tried their best to win red flower stamps.

163
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,690
This is one of the things

164
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,570
left from that.

165
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,230
Yes. I did write about it.

166
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,180
And later, my son

167
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,580
removed the garment,

168
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,310
saying it'd slow his Ultraman down

169
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,150
when he transformed to save the planet.

170
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,420
My mom was quite upset.

171
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,350
It seems you read my article quite carefully.

172
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,880
Besides this one,

173
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:05,830
I've also read the other articles

174
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:06,790
in your published books

175
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,750
and those posted on your official account.

176
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,480
These warm, real,

177
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,750
yet sharp stories you wrote

178
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,810
touched me deeply.

179
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,370
So, I really hope

180
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,070
by shooting videos,

181
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,180
I can get more people to know about

182
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,720
an amazing writer like you

183
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,420
and inspire more families.

184
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,610
I don't deserve

185
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,370
to be called an amazing writer.

186
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,310
I started writing

187
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,510
just to record

188
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,710
my family life.

189
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,480
Later on,

190
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,330
my stories gradually attracted some readers.

191
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,170
I also hope

192
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,150
to share my stories with them

193
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:37,990
and bring them

194
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,140
some warm strength.

195
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:40,790
But...

196
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,070
About shooting videos... I...

197
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,470
Come with me. Let's talk.

198
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,550
Please stay here.

199
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,620
You did a good job.

200
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,990
Ms. Liu

201
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,860
is indeed a jealous woman.

202
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:59,090
She hates to see others succeed.

203
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,750
She's so annoying.

204
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:01,790
Right?

205
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,310
Shouldn't you help me

206
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:03,950
win this time?

207
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,590
Of course.

208
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,050
And you know what?

209
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:07,610
What the girl said

210
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:08,450
just now

211
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,690
made me a bit proud.

212
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,950
It touched me.

213
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,000
She's really something.

214
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,510
She was the one

215
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,470
who interrupted Ms. Liu

216
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:18,890
at the publishing house.

217
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,920
She has some guts.

218
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,990
And she's smart.

219
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,630
But I...

220
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,920
I know Zhou Quan too well.

221
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,680
As you know,

222
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,780
he used to be a programmer.

223
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,330
He has never

224
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,860
tried these things before.

225
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,860
Besides, it hasn't been long

226
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:34,890
since he became a stay-at-home dad.

227
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,720
He's looking for a job now.

228
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,450
So, I...

229
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,220
I'm not sure

230
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,980
if he's willing

231
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,890
to do this.

232
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:43,750
Here's

233
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,720
what I think.

234
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,110
Firstly,

235
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,360
we want to open a studio.

236
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:51,010
This is a great chance

237
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:52,010
for advertising.

238
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:53,620
Right?

239
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,820
Secondly,

240
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,380
they want to take videos

241
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,380
of not only Zhou Quan but also Aiwen.

242
00:07:58,590 --> 00:07:59,550
Just think of it

243
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,100
as an extracurricular activity

244
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,950
or an extension program in his spare time.

245
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,200
It's a rare opportunity.

246
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,480
This will be

247
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:07,310
a special experience for Aiwen.

248
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:09,310
Just consider it a way to broaden his horizons.

249
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,240
Isn't that good?

250
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,000
That's true.

251
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:12,660
This

252
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,850
must be

253
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,480
an outstanding experience.

254
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:18,870
From this perspective,

255
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:20,910
you're right.

256
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,640
Fine.

257
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,810
I'll do it for my son.

258
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,370
I'll call Zhou Quan.

259
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:28,930
Okay.

260
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:30,770
I can't do it.

261
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,620
Once the camera is on,

262
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,710
I get nervous

263
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,210
and flush from head to toe.

264
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,710
I can only play a carrot.

265
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,669
I started

266
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,750
taking care of Aiwen at home not long ago.

267
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,150
I...

268
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,600
How can I be called a stay-at-home dad?

269
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,760
That's impossible.

270
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,520
There's nothing interesting

271
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,510
to shoot about me.

272
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,360
I-I will be very nervous.

273
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,270
Sorry.

274
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,810
Are you the television crew?

275
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,630
You are Mr. Zhou, right?

276
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,070
Yes, I am.

277
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:01,670
Nice to meet you.

278
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,080
Nice to meet you.

279
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,390
So...

280
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,090
Sorry. I'm late.

281
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:04,020
I got stuck in a traffic jam.

282
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:04,880
It's alright. Thank you for coming.

283
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,150
I'm the head of the crew.

284
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:06,620
My surname is Liu.

285
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,490
Nice to meet you.

286
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,350
This is our writer.

287
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,020
Nice to meet you.

288
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,550
Yeah.

289
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,950
This is our cameraman.

290
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:11,540
Nice to meet you.

291
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,310
This is our reporter.

292
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,240
Nice to meet you.

293
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,510
So, what are we...

294
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,360
W-What should I do?

295
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,550
You can tell me what to do.

296
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,230
It's like this.

297
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,230
Please relax.

298
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,920
Just pretend the camera doesn't exist.

299
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,140
We don't have

300
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,560
a script.

301
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,630
We just want

302
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,390
to record your daily life

303
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,170
as a stay-at-home dad.

304
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,100
Okay.

305
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,890
The more real it is, the better.

306
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,690
The more relaxed you are, the better.

307
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,980
Okay. I'll try my best.

308
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,540
So, when I speak,

309
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,360
I should face the camera, right?

310
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm still a bit nervous.

311
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,590
Sorry.

312
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:50,590
It's okay. Relax.

313
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,460
It's almost time for school to end.

314
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:55,810
Usually, my son

315
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,290
is the last one to come out.

316
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:58,710
He doesn't like

317
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,090
to be in the crowd

318
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,050
with other kids.

319
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,940
It's not because he's unpopular.

320
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,100
It's because he likes to think.

321
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,780
Daddy.

322
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,170
Sometimes...

323
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:12,720
This is an accident.

324
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,880
Are you Aiwen's dad, Mr. Zhou?

325
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,470
Yes, I am.

326
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,330
Mr. Zhou,

327
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,380
you are amazing.

328
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,980
Can you teach my dad

329
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,160
how to camp at home?

330
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,950
Mr. Zhou,

331
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,820
I heard you made many game sets

332
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:26,890
for Aiwen.

333
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:27,990
Can you make some

334
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,210
for us, too?

335
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,750
Did you teach Aiwen

336
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:32,890
how to ride a motorcycle?

337
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,600
Are you

338
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,300
a great race car driver?

339
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,710
Mr. Zhou,

340
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,790
I envy you

341
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,110
because you can stay at home with Aiwen every day.

342
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,990
My dad said

343
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,810
if he stayed with me instead of working,

344
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:45,070
my whole family would have to live on air.

345
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,140
Are you living on air?

346
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,340
You can't live on air.

347
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,380
If you live only on air,

348
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,160
you'll burp.

349
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,190
Alright. Let's leave them alone.

350
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:51,990
Let's go.

351
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,350
Okay. Bye.

352
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,030
Bye.

353
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:54,370
Bye.

354
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,040
Bye.

355
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,530
Bye.

356
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,230
Bye.

357
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:00,610
Bye.

358
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,870
You're very popular now.

359
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,970
Because they don't have a dad

360
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,770
who plays with them every day.

361
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,330
The wound on my forehead hasn't healed yet.

362
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,700
I thought

363
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,080
they would laugh at me.

364
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,850
But unexpectedly, all my classmates

365
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,410
thought it was super cool.

366
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,270
There are so many stories

367
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,670
I haven't told them.

368
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,510
That's right.

369
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:20,220
A scar is supposed to be

370
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,620
a badge of honor for a man.

371
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:23,090
Let me introduce them.

372
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:23,770
They are

373
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,000
the television crew.

374
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,150
Hello, sirs and madams.

375
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:27,990
Good boy.

376
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,610
Then...

377
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,350
Why don't we head back?

378
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,150
Okay.

379
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:33,640
By the way, if you don't mind,

380
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,060
our intern reporter Li Ziliu

381
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,060
will ride with you

382
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,230
to record some footage.

383
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,290
I don't mind at all.

384
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,070
Okay.

385
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:40,570
-Then let's go.
-Okay.

386
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,760
Let's go, Aiwen.

387
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,490
Aiwen, in your daily life,

388
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,580
who do you like more,

389
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,710
your mom or your dad?

390
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,480
I think

391
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,460
this question is a bit tacky.

392
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,050
Aiwen,

393
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,390
don't be so rude.

394
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,430
It's alright.

395
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,720
Aiwen, do you

396
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,300
find this tacky, too?

397
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,920
This is my favorite cheese lollipop.

398
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,790
Daddy,

399
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,780
can I eat it?

400
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,270
Of course.

401
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,300
Cheese lollipops are his favorite.

402
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,070
What a coincidence!

403
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,170
Yeah, Mr. Zhou,

404
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,170
to be honest with you,

405
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,090
besides being a fan of Ms. Cherry,

406
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,090
I also like Aiwen and consider him my nephew.

407
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,350
I know

408
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,530
what he likes and doesn't like

409
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:33,810
to eat.

410
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:37,940
Well, you...

411
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,240
Sorry, I... I...

412
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,320
I don't know what to say.

413
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,510
It's alright.

414
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,900
Why don't we

415
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,810
take a break?

416
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,190
Okay.

417
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,400
Cherry writes about

418
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,550
everything that happens in our family

419
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,880
and posts them on the Internet.

420
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,440
It really makes me feel embarrassed.

421
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,250
It doesn't matter.

422
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,950
I understand.

423
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,250
Besides, I really envy

424
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,010
the atmosphere in your family.

425
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,860
I'm not a local.

426
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,550
I came to Suzhou two years ago.

427
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,340
I don't have an officially budgeted position.

428
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,380
It seems unlikely I'll become a regular employee soon.

429
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,110
Actually,

430
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,690
when I read the articles

431
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,970
posted on Ms. Cherry's official account,

432
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,790
I feel like I'm looking at the life

433
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,360
I yearn for.

434
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:17,920
Unfortunately,

435
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,960
this kind of life is out of my reach.

436
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,670
I don't even know

437
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,520
when my life will change.

438
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,720
Don't think that way.

439
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,460
After all, you're still young.

440
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,310
You have plenty of time.

441
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,750
I think as long as you work hard,

442
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,280
it will definitely pay off.

443
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,700
Thank you, Mr. Zhou.

444
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,380
No problem.

445
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,110
Is it yummy, Aiwen?

446
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:40,990
Yes.

447
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:47,430
Hello, everyone.

448
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,510
Welcome.

449
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,150
They are the television crew.

450
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,240
Nice to meet you.

451
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,060
They are here?

452
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:53,430
Let me introduce myself

453
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,070
formally.

454
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,790
This is my daughter, Che Li.

455
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,250
This is my son-in-law, Zhou Quan.

456
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,510
This is my grandson.

457
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,150
Grandma, you look so beautiful today.

458
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:01,650
Really?

459
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,450
Hello, madam.

460
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,380
Hello.

461
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,150
You are the director?

462
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,200
Yes. My surname is Liu.

463
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,150
Hello, Director Liu.

464
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,590
Mom.

465
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,010
Why don't we let them come in first?

466
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,060
The camera is quite heavy.

467
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,170
Okay. Please come in.

468
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:11,450
Please come in.

469
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:12,530
Please come in.

470
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:13,150
We don't need to change our shoes, right?

471
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:13,670
No.

472
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:15,110
Mom, don't block the doorway.

473
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,240
You're in their way.

474
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,670
No need to change your shoes.

475
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:18,350
Come in.

476
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:21,270
This is...

477
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,350
our living room.

478
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,460
Yes.

479
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:25,730
If there's anything

480
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,610
you want us to do,

481
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:27,530
just tell us.

482
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,660
Ms. Cherry,

483
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,230
sorry to bother you today.

484
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,310
No problem. It's our pleasure.

485
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,310
Here's the thing.

486
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:32,830
Please make yourself comfortable.

487
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,150
We're making a documentary.

488
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,380
The main purpose

489
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,530
is to record the everyday life

490
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,740
of your family.

491
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,790
The more real it is, the better.

492
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,390
Let me

493
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,440
brief you on what to do.

494
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,510
Young man, I see.

495
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,350
Come with me.

496
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,870
Take a look at our yard.

497
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,990
Look over here, Director.

498
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,410
Look

499
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,540
at these flowers.

500
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,120
I moved them here

501
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:51,860
pot by pot.

502
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,920
I do the cleaning every day.

503
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,150
They never do it.

504
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,860
They don't have time.

505
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,180
-Go away.
-Let me take you there.

506
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,320
Hey, you.

507
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,710
Wait.

508
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,230
You missed me.

509
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,030
Is...

510
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,160
Is it okay?

511
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,030
Let me press it one more time.

512
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:38,800
Home.

513
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,840
You're amazing!

514
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,720
The first word.

515
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,700
Reach… Monkey…

516
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,050
Monkeys reach for…

517
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,730
Monkeys reach for the moon.

518
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:48,590
This is

519
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,080
how I act out the word "moon."

520
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,330
That's a new moon.

521
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,620
I can't tell what it is.

522
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,600
Wait a second.

523
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,910
Thank you all

524
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,270
for your hard work today.

525
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,430
Sorry for the trouble.

526
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,790
It's our pleasure.

527
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:00,710
See

528
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:01,990
if there's anything unsatisfactory.

529
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,560
We're very satisfied.

530
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,650
If there's anything unsatisfactory,

531
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,430
feel free to contact us anytime.

532
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,490
By the way, Ms. Che,

533
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,510
I'll send you a message

534
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,670
after we finish editing and release the program.

535
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,360
Okay.

536
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,000
Thank you.

537
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,230
I won't see you out then.

538
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,310
I'll just stand by the door. My son is at home.

539
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:13,910
Take care.

540
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,400
Alright. Thank you.

541
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,210
Did you have a good time?

542
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,470
-Yes.
-Ms. Che, I'm your fan.

543
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,930
Can I add you on WeChat?

544
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,230
Sure. Wait a minute.

545
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,310
Let me get my phone.

546
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:27,670
-Thank you, baby.
-Here.

547
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,500
Ms. Che, let me scan your QR code.

548
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,870
Okay. Wait a second.

549
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:33,810
Here.

550
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:38,630
Thank you, Ms. Che.

551
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,770
I like you so much.

552
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,470
Thank you for liking my articles.

553
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,800
I hope we'll meet again.

554
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,510
Okay.

555
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,230
-Bye.
-Bye.

556
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:46,190
Bye, Aiwen.

557
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:46,850
Bye.

558
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,970
Honey, I'm so tired.

559
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,960
But why?

560
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,180
I didn't do anything.

561
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,690
You gave all your attention to the shooting.

562
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:10,150
You kept thinking about avoiding mistakes.

563
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,290
Shooting is a hard job.

564
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,190
I really admire those actors.

565
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:17,329
It's not easy for them.

566
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,420
Li.

567
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,829
Li, let me ask you.

568
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,550
Was I wearing my scarf

569
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,770
during the shooting?

570
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,040
Why are you laughing? I don't look good?

571
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,930
The shooting has finished. Why are you still wearing the hat?

572
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:31,830
You look like you're on vacation

573
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,760
in Hawaii.

574
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,690
Come on. Stop laughing.

575
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:34,660
Was I

576
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,750
wearing my scarf

577
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,930
during the shooting?

578
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,500
-I don't remember.
-But your scarf

579
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,670
doesn't match this dress.

580
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,550
I...

581
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,810
That's too bad.

582
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,000
I thought

583
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,020
about wearing the scarf

584
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,030
all night.

585
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,020
Well. Tell me.

586
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,320
Was I wearing it or not?

587
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,480
Let me tell you,

588
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,060
no.

589
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,190
I...

590
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,240
Oh no.

591
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,650
I thought about it all night.

592
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,230
I thought I'd look better with the scarf on.

593
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:55,830
Gosh.

594
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,350
Where did I put

595
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:58,130
the scarf?

596
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,190
That's strange.

597
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,910
What's wrong?

598
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,880
We're tired.

599
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,350
Aren't you tired?

600
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,310
No.

601
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,310
We didn't film them.

602
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,910
They filmed us.

603
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,950
Good for you.

604
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,340
You have a talent.

605
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,280
Why did they want to film us?

606
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,040
Because your mom is famous.

607
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:18,270
I'm very famous now, you know?

608
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,470
Oh no.

609
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,380
Will my parents

610
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,870
see this program?

611
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,450
No way. I'm not that famous.

612
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,950
It won't spread so widely.

613
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,710
Besides, your parents

614
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,890
only use their phones to read news.

615
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:38,190
Our program won't be on the news.

616
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:38,950
It won't.

617
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,480
Wait. Will it be on the news?

618
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,830
Even if it will, it doesn't matter.

619
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,510
Next month,

620
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,310
I'm starting my new job.

621
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,000
That's great!

622
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:55,640
We need to celebrate!

623
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,470
Sure.

624
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,310
Doesn't that mean

625
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,770
you'll take me out to play?

626
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,590
Not this time.

627
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,080
This time, we're celebrating for your dad.

628
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,510
We should take him out to play.

629
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:04,670
Because he found a new job.

630
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,440
What's wrong?

631
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,760
Daddy, I don't want you to go to work.

632
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,970
I want you to stay at home with me.

633
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,350
Daddy, don't go.

634
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,570
I also want to stay at home with you.

635
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,630
But work is…

636
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,860
Daddy, don't go.

637
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:33,910
It's almost time for school to end.

638
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,570
Look. He looks so funny

639
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,370
when he pretends to be serious.

640
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,080
Didn't you see he was at a loss

641
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:40,620
just now?

642
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:42,240
No wonder

643
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,330
he practiced so seriously

644
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,670
the night before the shooting.

645
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,750
It's so lively.

646
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,290
You can't write a script like this.

647
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,690
It's a real documentary.

648
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,260
Very well.

649
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,130
I'm impressed by Zhou.

650
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:52,570
He did a good job.

651
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,160
Alright, I feel relieved now.

652
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,190
He looks good on camera.

653
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,110
-Yeah.
-Not bad.

654
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,430
Alright.

655
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,750
You've completely established

656
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,950
yourself

657
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,540
as an unconventional elite woman.

658
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,720
After watching the program,

659
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,190
others will find my family unreliable.

660
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:08,230
They won't think of me as an elite woman.

661
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:08,790
So,

662
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,740
for your future development,

663
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,960
will you choose me

664
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,030
or me?

665
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,760
Are you that confident?

666
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,750
Haven't you ever thought

667
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,670
that I might choose Yuan Yi?

668
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,500
After all, I'm very popular now.

669
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,700
To be honest, I'm really worried.

670
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,280
Although I don't like Yuan Yi,

671
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,950
he is indeed

672
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:29,910
competitive.

673
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,270
He has a platform ready.

674
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,480
I'm worried.

675
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,110
I plan

676
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,250
to take your advice.

677
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,120
I'm going to start a company

678
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,560
and manage my official account well.

679
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,960
I'm going to give it a shot.

680
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,530
I knew you would choose me.

681
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,600
I didn't choose you.

682
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,550
Of course, I won't choose Yuan Yi either.

683
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,470
What I mean

684
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,140
is I want to start my own company.

685
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,760
What do you mean?

686
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,420
Don't get me wrong.

687
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,820
It's not because

688
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,610
I don't trust you

689
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,430
or something like that.

690
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,010
It's definitely not

691
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,670
because of a reason like that.

692
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,710
I know

693
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,040
you are very capable,

694
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:07,970
and you really want to help me.

695
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,430
Actually, I really need you.

696
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,190
But to be honest,

697
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,440
I still haven't figured out

698
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,670
how my official account

699
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,110
became popular.

700
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,400
Really. I'm not lying to you.

701
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,190
I don't think

702
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,920
I'm a gifted writer.

703
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,950
I don't know

704
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,110
when my talent will be exhausted

705
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,120
and I'll lose the ability to write.

706
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,310
I don't know how far

707
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,560
my account can go

708
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,460
and how long its popularity can stay.

709
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,520
But it will be a pity

710
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,590
if I don't give it a try.

711
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,030
So, I decided to do it by myself.

712
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,480
I'm not afraid of failure.

713
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:34,970
Right?

714
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,340
Because I won't lose anything.

715
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,350
If I fail, I'll just continue

716
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,180
to write my articles.

717
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,670
I'll earn as much money as I can.

718
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,530
But your situation is different.

719
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,060
Although you don't like

720
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,510
your job

721
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,410
at the publishing house very much,

722
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,650
it's a stable job

723
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,050
in the eyes of most people.

724
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,480
And it's hard to get an officially budgeted position.

725
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,950
If you start a company with me,

726
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,040
and I cause the company to fail,

727
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,320
you'll become jobless because of me.

728
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,030
Listen, Li.

729
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:57,460
I'm not doing this for you

730
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,890
but for myself.

731
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,490
There are so many people starting their own businesses.

732
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:05,910
Everyone's taking risks. Everyone's afraid.

733
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:06,610
Have I ever got

734
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,410
cold feet?

735
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,410
Besides, Li,

736
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,320
I'm not alone.

737
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,240
Don't I have you?

738
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,030
What?

739
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,750
Then, today is our

740
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,620
startup anniversary.

741
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,620
Lower your voice.

742
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,850
We're in public.

743
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:34,180
Are you that happy?

744
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:35,750
I'm so happy.

745
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:36,750
Perhaps

746
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,530
our startup will soon fail.

747
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,190
It doesn't matter. You know what?

748
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,110
I wouldn't dare to do it without you.

749
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,100
I'm a wimp.

750
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,070
You're making me

751
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,960
feel a bit proud.

752
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,480
Alright.

753
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,320
Let's work hard together.

754
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:55,630
Cheers.

755
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,300
Come in.

756
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,550
Why did you give me this?

757
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,440
Clivia is a good match for a gentleman.

758
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,860
My dad loves clivia very much.

759
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:36,800
Clivia.

760
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:39,870
The flowers are beautiful,

761
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,030
but they need

762
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,990
the right temperature, humidity,

763
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,750
and soil.

764
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,850
They are difficult to cultivate.

765
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,490
Thanks for your cultivation.

766
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,830
You gave me such a big gift.

767
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,030
You must want me to do something for you.

768
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,400
Have a seat.

769
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,190
President.

770
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,780
After I returned to China,

771
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,130
you gave me my first job.

772
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:11,620
I was really nervous

773
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,880
during the interview.

774
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,490
It was obvious

775
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,080
the job was unrelated to my major.

776
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,070
But you still

777
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:17,750
let me stay.

778
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,600
You allowed me, a newcomer,

779
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,710
to select topics and make plans independently

780
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,310
and made me gradually become

781
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:24,210
who I am today.

782
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:26,950
My bad temper

783
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:28,500
caused you a lot of trouble.

784
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,450
I learned a lot

785
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:30,450
from you.

786
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,840
You were my mentor.

787
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,330
I'm sincerely grateful to you.

788
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,270
I know

789
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,530
our industry doesn't have much growth potential.

790
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:42,330
You young people are ambitious.

791
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,520
In the future,

792
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,590
you'll face

793
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,710
more challenges and pressure.

794
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,820
Are you ready?

795
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,590
Didn't you say

796
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:55,860
there's the right soil

797
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,290
for every pot of flowers

798
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:58,900
and there's

799
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,220
the right environment for everyone?

800
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,070
But we need to learn

801
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:06,230
to adapt to the environment, right?

802
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,560
I want to live happily

803
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,690
at this age.

804
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,070
I've found

805
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,830
the environment that suits me.

806
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,870
Tell me about your new environment.

807
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,870
I'm starting a business with my friend.

808
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,070
Starting a business?

809
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,980
You must think twice.

810
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,890
Starting a business

811
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:20,690
is not easy.

812
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:22,390
You know me.

813
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,920
With my personality,

814
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,300
once I choose my path,

815
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,430
I'll finish it no matter what it takes.

816
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,290
Have you made up your mind?

817
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,150
Yes.

818
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,620
Take it out.

819
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,950
Good.

820
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,890
You have dreams and courage.

821
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,560
Young people are fearless.

822
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:17,500
Follow your heart.

823
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,080
Let me see

824
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,170
how you'll work happily

825
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:24,300
and grow freely.

826
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,350
President.

827
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:30,990
You're like my dad.

828
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,570
You nag at me a lot.

829
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,170
Come back to see me when you have time.

830
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,070
Good luck.

831
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,550
After all, I just resigned.

832
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,020
Although it was my own choice,

833
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,310
in the end,

834
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,270
I still feel a bit upset.

835
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,710
You're making me feel pressured.

836
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,050
Alright. It's okay.

837
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:30,740
I made the choice. It's okay.

838
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,320
No need to comfort me.

839
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:34,530
Let me tell you.

840
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,950
For someone like me

841
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,080
who just left their job,

842
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,330
getting the company started

843
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,990
is better than anything else.

844
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,030
So, have you looked for an office?

845
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,820
Have I looked for an office?

846
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:55,860
Take a look.

847
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,790
Choose one

848
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,410
from these two sides.

849
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,270
At least

850
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,710
we're starting a proper company, aren't we?

851
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,240
Although

852
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,170
we're not planning

853
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,630
to ring the bell at Nasdaq,

854
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,100
y-you can't just

855
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,510
make this room

856
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,730
our office.

857
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,620
Come on.

858
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,450
Your job is to go out to find advertisers

859
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,650
and negotiate business deals.

860
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:25,880
If there's anything, we'll discuss it.

861
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,410
Otherwise, we'll do our own thing.

862
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,780
I'll be at home writing.

863
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,270
We'll settle accounts at year end.

864
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,510
Isn't this

865
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,590
good?

866
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,180
You are indeed my dear friend.

867
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:34,910
I was

868
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,100
in a very bad mood,

869
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:37,820
but you made me laugh.

870
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,160
Why are you laughing? I'm serious.

871
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,490
By your logic,

872
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,660
why did you choose me as your partner?

873
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,070
I need you to find advertisers, negotiate business deals,

874
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,320
discuss the content of my articles

875
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,280
with me,

876
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,970
and have meals with me at home.

877
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,310
Alright.

878
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,570
Let's go.

879
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,760
Go get changed.

880
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,930
I'll show you how difficult

881
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,190
entrepreneurship is.

882
00:29:00,650 --> 00:29:01,980
Is it that complicated?

883
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,130
Advertise our products

884
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,370
to your friends and relatives.

885
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,430
All our products are of high quality.

886
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,430
The raw materials are environmentally-friendly.

887
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,310
Surely our products are different

888
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,440
from ordinary ones.

889
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,950
Once you sell three sets,

890
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,830
you'll become an investor of the company.

891
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,450
You can get the products directly from our factory

892
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,240
without any middlemen making a profit.

893
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,330
Where does your rebate

894
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:24,930
come from?

895
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,310
It's the money we save

896
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,490
by cutting out those middlemen.

897
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,030
Mr. Zhang, our project

898
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,360
is absolutely worth investing in.

899
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,350
The management team members

900
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,880
all hold a master's degree from Cambridge.

901
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,650
Our programmers

902
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,080
all graduated from the top 5 universities in China.

903
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,000
Ordinary teams are nothing compared to us.

904
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,110
We're still in the angel investment round.

905
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,930
The return on investment will be very high.

906
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:41,570
Our goal

907
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,170
is to make the best social media app

908
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,390
in China.

909
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,480
When we launch

910
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,240
our product,

911
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,640
no one will use Weibo or WeChat

912
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,950
anymore.

913
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,400
He's exaggerating.

914
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,550
That's why they say

915
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,590
if the coffee shops here collapse,

916
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,990
half of the entrepreneurs will be crushed.

917
00:29:58,610 --> 00:29:59,440
I don't want you

918
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,270
to listen to their sales pitches.

919
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,480
I want you to learn from their attitude.

920
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,140
Cherry.

921
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,200
Cherry.

922
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,150
She is a writer

923
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,440
who has been very popular recently.

924
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,950
Her account is the best one offering emotional support in China.

925
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,350
She has great influence.

926
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,450
You're a cosmetics maker, right?

927
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,170
Then you must

928
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,830
collaborate with our Cherry.

929
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:14,930
We're in the era of new media.

930
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:15,790
Do you know him?

931
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,910
He kept saying "our Cherry,"

932
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,590
yet you're asking me?

933
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:24,420
The business world is so complicated.

934
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,110
Where are you going?

935
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,580
Sir, let's chat.

936
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:40,780
Have a seat.

937
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,780
The competition is so fierce.

938
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,100
Baking,

939
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,850
programming,

940
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:49,930
and even ballet.

941
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,960
I heard that after a ballet dancer

942
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:53,960
practices for a long time,

943
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,420
their toenails may fall off.

944
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,950
That only happens to professional dancers.

945
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,750
Your son is a beginner. His toenails won't fall off.

946
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,480
That's true.

947
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,810
But dancing is good for children.

948
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,710
It can

949
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,000
improve

950
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,090
their coordination

951
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:06,330
and reflexes.

952
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,330
Yes. Anyway,

953
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:09,960
you can't make the decision now.

954
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,720
Go back and discuss it with Li,

955
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,200
then let me know your decision.

956
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
I'll ask them to give you a discount.

957
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,280
Do you enjoy dancing ballet?

958
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:16,880
No.

959
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,080
Well done.

960
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,100
I haven't asked you.

961
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,590
How's it going with Li's studio?

962
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:24,050
Is everything going well?

963
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:24,750
She's been busy.

964
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,370
She rushes around every day.

965
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,980
She's like a ball.

966
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,450
Suppose this is a bowl,

967
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,480
and she's here.

968
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,910
She goes everywhere.

969
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:36,030
Just like a squash ball, right?

970
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,100
Yes, a squash ball.

971
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,710
That's pretty accurate.

972
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,370
A squash ball.

973
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,710
Anyway,

974
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:44,560
I really admire you two.

975
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,470
Taking care of a child is tiring enough.

976
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,100
But

977
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,310
one of you is starting a business,

978
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,370
and the other is working on a project.

979
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,470
Which one of us is working on a project?

980
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,350
You.

981
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,770
What project am I working on?

982
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,430
Isn't Aiwen your new project?

983
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,010
It's a key project.

984
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,070
Yes, a key project.

985
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,420
If we need to

986
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,100
start our business like that,

987
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,350
I don't think I can do it.

988
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,110
We don't need to do it their way.

989
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,320
We produce content.

990
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,480
We don't need to raise funds like that.

991
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:15,460
But we can't just

992
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,790
work in this small room.

993
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,030
We must have

994
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,310
a proper studio.

995
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,490
We must register our company and hire employees,

996
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,600
including an accountant and a cashier.

997
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,310
We must

998
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,650
get everything done.

999
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,940
So, you're clear

1000
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,290
about what to do, right?

1001
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,760
I said I want to start a business with you.

1002
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,960
I'm ambitious.

1003
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,230
I'm not playing games.

1004
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,750
Your job is to produce content.

1005
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,800
I'll be in charge of operations.

1006
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:41,470
I've listed the things we need to do.

1007
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,470
Take a look first.

1008
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,750
Oh my God.

1009
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,840
I don't think I deserve

1010
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:58,130
your hard work.

1011
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,110
Come on, Ms. Che.

1012
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,680
Pick a few company names first.

1013
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,880
I wrote a few options.

1014
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:05,840
Let's pick three and send them for review.

1015
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,950
If none of them gets approved,

1016
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,520
we'll have to pick another one.

1017
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,850
[Biling Studio] [Rainy March Studio]

1018
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,850
[Shiqing Studio] [Spring Blossoms Studio]

1019
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,850
[May Your Dreams Come True Studio] [Shuye Studio]

1020
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,450
In the past, when I went to work every day,

1021
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,510
no matter how upset

1022
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,460
or tired I felt,

1023
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,590
I was in my comfort zone.

1024
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,970
So, this time, since Li decided

1025
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,180
to start her own business,

1026
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,180
I must support her

1027
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,760
no matter how unsure we are.

1028
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,560
It's not easy

1029
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:28,510
for middle-aged people to make a new choice.

1030
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:29,330
Right.

1031
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,890
Starting a business

1032
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,800
is not easy.

1033
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:33,390
It's highly risky.

1034
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,670
Although Li

1035
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:36,040
is a good writer,

1036
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,820
I still have to warn you

1037
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,660
that failure

1038
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,610
is inevitable.

1039
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,620
I know.

1040
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,190
So, when she fails,

1041
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,740
you should help her with me.

1042
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,090
Don't worry.

1043
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:24,380
Be careful.

1044
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:24,690
It's hot.

1045
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,639
Thank you.

1046
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,949
You look like an old granny

1047
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,600
in a fairy tale,

1048
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,600
rocking back and forth in the chair.

1049
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:34,150
Old granny?

1050
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:36,790
You have a lot on your mind, right?

1051
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,150
Sort of.

1052
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,760
Well.

1053
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,280
After those articles became popular,

1054
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,320
I didn't know the reason

1055
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,520
and thought it just happened by chance.

1056
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:50,989
I have no idea

1057
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:52,739
how to continue.

1058
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,820
Now, I'm opening a studio.

1059
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:57,540
I've never worked

1060
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,940
in a company before.

1061
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,300
Why are there so many things to do?

1062
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,540
We need to rent an office,

1063
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,470
find an assistant,

1064
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:04,950
and buy equipment.

1065
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,380
Everything costs money.

1066
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,010
I have to compare prices to find the best deal.

1067
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,410
That was why I advised you

1068
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,140
to sign a contract with Yuan Yi.

1069
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,620
If you had signed a contract with him,

1070
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,480
he could save you a lot of trouble.

1071
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,270
I don't agree.

1072
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,610
Meng Fei and I have worked well together

1073
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:21,680
over the years.

1074
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,470
I think

1075
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,260
she's quite reliable.

1076
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,370
I've already said yes.

1077
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,770
I should keep my promise.

1078
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,290
Honey, stop what you're doing.

1079
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:46,990
Let's

1080
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,190
discuss something.

1081
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:50,640
Go ahead.

1082
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,200
You're changing your equipment.

1083
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,310
That means

1084
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,670
you're going to be busy.

1085
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,540
It's the same

1086
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:58,310
with me.

1087
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,450
What should we do

1088
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,010
about Aiwen?

1089
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,790
We can look for a nanny.

1090
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,430
I saw the information

1091
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,210
about a nanny agency.

1092
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:07,330
I think it's reliable.

1093
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,910
Their nannies are all advanced nannies

1094
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,170
who can work as tutors.

1095
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,230
I've thought about it, too.

1096
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,440
Firstly,

1097
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,450
I don't know if we can find

1098
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,330
a suitable nanny.

1099
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:16,930
Secondly,

1100
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,340
I don't know if my mom

1101
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,220
will agree.

1102
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,490
That doesn't matter.

1103
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,230
We need to

1104
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,020
solve the real problem first,

1105
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:28,100
which is neither of us will have time to take care of Aiwen.

1106
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,620
We must

1107
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,490
find someone reliable

1108
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:30,770
who can replace us.

1109
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:31,890
We can

1110
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:33,830
put your mom's educational philosophy aside first.

1111
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:35,430
But she's not in good health.

1112
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,720
She's got bad knees.

1113
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,840
Aiwen has grown up.

1114
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,370
If he runs fast and disappears in a second,

1115
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,720
she can't even catch up with him.

1116
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,320
She can't take care of Aiwen.

1117
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,990
So, we should look for a nanny?

1118
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:47,670
Yes.

1119
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:48,820
No.

1120
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,370
No.

1121
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,330
Absolutely not!

1122
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,210
Hiring a nanny

1123
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,390
won't solve your problem once and for all.

1124
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:55,940
I know.

1125
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,890
The other day, I saw the nanny

1126
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,930
hired by Mrs. Li,

1127
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,310
who lives upstairs.

1128
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,970
She crossed the street

1129
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,220
with the child

1130
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,050
on a red light.

1131
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,440
It scared me.

1132
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,580
What if you find

1133
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,460
a nanny like her?

1134
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:07,870
Mom,

1135
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,560
you don't need to tell me that.

1136
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,020
We are also nervous.

1137
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,750
So, I want you to know

1138
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,700
that we'll be very cautious

1139
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,900
when selecting

1140
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:18,090
a nanny.

1141
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:19,220
Do you know

1142
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,730
what kind of nanny we want?

1143
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:21,770
What kind of nanny do you want?

1144
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,450
She must be well-educated,

1145
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,170
high-caliber,

1146
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,620
and kind.

1147
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,350
Because Aiwen will spend a lot of time with her

1148
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,390
and be influenced by her.

1149
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,030
Right?

1150
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:30,310
Right.

1151
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,310
So, we think it doesn't matter

1152
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:32,620
whether she's good

1153
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,210
at cooking and laundry.

1154
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,390
What matters

1155
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,290
is she should be able to help Aiwen with his homework

1156
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,620
and tutor him.

1157
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,210
And she must be upright.

1158
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,730
Aiwen

1159
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,410
is about to start primary school.

1160
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,470
Helping him with his homework

1161
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,950
is a very important thing.

1162
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,070
You can't do it.

1163
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,640
Mom, don't point at yourself.

1164
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,320
I...

1165
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,220
We can't joke about it, right?

1166
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:52,930
We must be serious

1167
00:37:52,930 --> 00:37:54,260
about Aiwen's homework.

1168
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:54,780
Right?

1169
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,330
You have to hire a nanny?

1170
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,220
We can have a try.

1171
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:01,980
F-Fine.

1172
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:03,550
Anyway, you must let me

1173
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,770
choose Aiwen's nanny.

1174
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:06,710
She can enter our home

1175
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,840
only after I say yes.

1176
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:09,430
Otherwise, I won't let her come in.

1177
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,160
Okay.

1178
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,000
I'll let you decide.

1179
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:14,760
Hello, madams.

1180
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,080
There are

1181
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,390
five résumés.

1182
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,000
And these are

1183
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:19,760
the five nannies.

1184
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,550
You can have them

1185
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,610
introduce themselves first.

1186
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,860
Let them sit down.

1187
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,030
Talking like this

1188
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,170
feels strange.

1189
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:25,870
It's alright.

1190
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:26,560
We usually

1191
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,510
have a group interview

1192
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,630
when there are many candidates.

1193
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,010
They'll remain standing as you interview them.

1194
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,870
After you find a suitable one,

1195
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:32,600
she'll sit down

1196
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
and talk with you.

1197
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,000
That's how we do it.

1198
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,240
It's your rule, right?

1199
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,560
Yes, it's our rule.

1200
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:38,590
Okay.

1201
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:39,590
Alright.

1202
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,130
Alright.

1203
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,600
Let's get started.

1204
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,590
Okay.

1205
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,280
Candidate number one,

1206
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,210
please introduce yourself.

1207
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:44,650
Hello.

1208
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,540
I'm candidate number one,

1209
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,190
Niu Yaoju.

1210
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,690
I'm 48 years old.

1211
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,920
I've been a domestic worker

1212
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,940
for 10 years.

1213
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,270
I'm from Hunan.

1214
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,210
I am particularly good at cooking Hunan cuisine

1215
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,410
and Sichuan cuisine.

1216
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:55,430
You're from Hunan

1217
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,790
and good at cooking Hunan cuisine.

1218
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:57,530
I'm really sorry.

1219
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,530
We

1220
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,620
prefer

1221
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,850
bland food.

1222
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,320
Your cooking doesn't suit us.

1223
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,380
The dishes I cook are very delicious.

1224
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,160
I know.

1225
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,010
I'm really sorry.

1226
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:05,960
Sorry.

1227
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:06,610
It's okay.

1228
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,780
Please

1229
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:08,760
step back.

1230
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,550
Let's take a look at the second candidate.

1231
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:11,160
Okay.

1232
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,000
-Candidate number two.
-Hello.

1233
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,840
Hello.

1234
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,070
My name is Li Kexin.

1235
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,320
I am 50 years old.

1236
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,110
I'm from northern Jiangsu.

1237
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,160
I happen to cook bland dishes.

1238
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,720
I'm from the Jiangsu-Zhejiang region.

1239
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,610
I'm

1240
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,770
quite experienced.

1241
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,470
I've been working as a housekeeper

1242
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,330
for nine years.

1243
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:26,360
Ms. Li, right?

1244
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,840
What did you say about your cooking?

1245
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,440
Bland.

1246
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:30,490
Didn't you say you prefer bland food?

1247
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,610
I'm really sorry.

1248
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,110
Your cooking is okay,

1249
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,020
but your accent

1250
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:34,960
is not okay.

1251
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,110
You're not the right nanny for us.

1252
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:36,950
Thank you. I'm sorry.

1253
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:37,590
Thank you.

1254
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,050
I wonder if there's anyone

1255
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,610
who speaks English.

1256
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,140
Hello.

1257
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,020
I'm candidate number three.

1258
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,420
I speak a little English.

1259
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,270
Really?

1260
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,800
I can speak English.

1261
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:52,090
How old are you?

1262
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,730
I'm 42 years old.

1263
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,430
I think her pronunciation

1264
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:58,330
is not very good.

1265
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,630
Mom, if you speak more English,

1266
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:00,470
you'll expose

1267
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,760
your weakness.

1268
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,890
Alright. You interview her.

1269
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,470
I look forward to serving you.

1270
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,900
Have you taken care

1271
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,590
of a five or six-year-old child before?

1272
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,440
I may need you

1273
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,050
to help my son with his homework

1274
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:11,910
or be his partner

1275
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:14,200
when he practices his talents.

1276
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,190
Do you have experience in this?

1277
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,510
Yes.

1278
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:17,890
The kids

1279
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,330
liked me very much.

1280
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,410
You seem to have a very good...

1281
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,330
I'm sorry.

1282
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,310
My mom

1283
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,000
has high standards.

1284
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,890
I understand.

1285
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,300
Candidates,

1286
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,080
please go upstairs and have a rest.

1287
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,310
Perhaps the clients

1288
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:35,030
have other requirements.

1289
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,190
I'll talk to you later.

1290
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,370
Please go upstairs first.

1291
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,010
Thank you.

1292
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,510
Thank you.

1293
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,230
It's alright.

1294
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,830
The third candidate is good.

1295
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:42,320
I think her pronunciation

1296
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:42,980
is not good.

1297
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:44,140
Can you tell?

1298
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:45,220
Of course.

1299
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,690
Mom, you're so funny.

1300
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:47,330
You really are...

1301
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,690
I learned English

1302
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,110
when I was young.

1303
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,160
Her pronunciation is terrible.

1304
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:53,320
None of the candidates

1305
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,240
meets your requirements.

1306
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:54,710
There's

1307
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,910
a better nanny.

1308
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:57,790
She obtained a master's degree from an overseas university.

1309
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,250
Her English is very good.

1310
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,900
Please take a look at her résumé.

1311
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,110
She plays the piano

1312
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,590
and can provide first aid.

1313
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,620
I think

1314
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,640
she's good.

1315
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,300
Let me ask you.

1316
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,850
How much does she cost

1317
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,620
per month?

1318
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,440
20,000 yuan for 26 days.

1319
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:16,350
What?

1320
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,240
20,000 yuan for 26 days.

1321
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,290
That's too expensive.

1322
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:22,310
She obtained a master's degree

1323
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:23,800
from an overseas university.

1324
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,720
She wouldn't do this job

1325
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,910
for a low salary.

1326
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:29,550
-That's too expensive.
-She meets your requirements.

1327
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,320
Why don't you just let me take care of Aiwen?

1328
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,520
She was born in the 1990s.

1329
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,360
Does she have experience in taking care of children?

1330
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,850
She has taken care of children

1331
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:39,880
the same age as your son before.

1332
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,740
You can rest assured about that.

1333
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:41,790
Did she mention

1334
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:42,850
why she chose to be a domestic worker

1335
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:44,400
after studying abroad?

1336
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:45,640
Nowadays, people have high standards

1337
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,460
for domestic workers.

1338
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,270
Also, they

1339
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,250
receive free room and board

1340
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,260
and make

1341
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:50,830
a handsome salary.

1342
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,960
Many college graduates

1343
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,190
are choosing this industry.

1344
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:54,160
That's what she said,

1345
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:54,560
right?

1346
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,200
Yes.

1347
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,030
Well, she's quite honest.

1348
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:05,400
Honey.

1349
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,190
Well,

1350
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,050
what kind of nanny

1351
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:09,440
did you choose today?

1352
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:09,870
Let me take a look.

1353
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:10,800
I took a photo for you.

1354
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,350
I knew you'd want to take a look.

1355
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:13,480
You have her résumé.

1356
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,480
Is she a nanny?

1357
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:23,550
She's so young.

1358
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:25,560
And she holds a master's degree.

1359
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,610
She was born in 1991.

1360
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,010
Yeah.

1361
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:27,920
Didn't you say

1362
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:29,200
we need to find someone

1363
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,430
high-caliber,

1364
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,640
well-educated,

1365
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:32,440
and cultured

1366
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,840
so we could entrust Aiwen to her?

1367
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,520
She meets our requirements.

1368
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,860
She doesn't have any children.

1369
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,730
This is...

1370
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:40,710
She

1371
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,620
has class,

1372
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:44,700
-right?
-Class.

1373
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:47,720
How much is her class worth?

1374
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,820
She

1375
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,720
costs too much.

1376
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:53,120
Is there so much housework?

1377
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,980
Why do you have to spend so much on a nanny?

1378
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,260
Mom,

1379
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:56,720
I've told you many times.

1380
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,240
We don't want the nanny to do housework

1381
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:58,830
but

1382
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,180
to help Aiwen study.
