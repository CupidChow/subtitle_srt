Mom.

00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,870
Don't spray it on his head.

00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,789
I know. I know.

8
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,680
This is to ward off bad luck.

9
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,410
I soaked pomelo leaves in the water.

10
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,040
Our family has had too much misfortune lately.

11
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,120
Come. Good boy.

12
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,750
Come to me.

13
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,720
Good boy.

14
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,789
Today,

15
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,750
I got up early in the morning and went to the temple.

16
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,370
I asked for a little red string for you

17
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,820
to keep you safe.

18
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,800
Come. Good boy.

Good boy. Come.

20
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,970
Take off your coat first. Good boy.

21
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,910
Okay.

22
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,550
Look.

00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,190
Come in.

26
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,640
I bought you a pair of earphones.

27
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,329
This was picked for Aiwen.

28
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,310
I was going to ask you to give it to him

29
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,440
to earn red flowers.

30
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,190
It seems

31
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,160
useless now.

32
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,870
Honey.

33
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,800
Can we talk for a minute?

34
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,530
I still need to

35
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,550
apologize to you.

00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,400

37
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,510
I spoke to you

38
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,340
was terrible.

39
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:14,160
I... I was really scared out of my wits.

40
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,070
No.

41
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,280
I... I know you were very frightened.

42
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,510
I was also very emotional that day

43
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,990
and didn't speak properly.

44
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:29,190
Many things I said weren't what I meant.

45
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,110
I...

46
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,350
I shouldn't shirk my responsibility.

47
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,990

There's no shirking of responsibility.

50

I think I bear a lot of responsibility.

51
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,540
Because during this time,

52
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,640
I've been hands-off.

53
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,010

54

That wasn't right either.

What you said

56
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,170
made me feel guiltier.

When you were taking care of the child,

58
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,410
nothing like this ever happened.

59

By the way,

this is what Aiwen asked me to give to you.

Honey, don't be like this.

65
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,560

Besides, it's at the root of his hair.

72

My grandson

156

got a big cut on his head

157
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,350
and had 11 stitches.

158
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,020
He lost quite a lot of blood.

159
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,630
So, my daughter

160
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,550
can't leave this child now.

161
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:07,560
Mom. I'll tell her myself.

162
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,760
I'm talking to her.

00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,510
It's like this.

164
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,310
My daughter is different from you.

165
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,660
She has a family.

166
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,030
You can't take her

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,560

168
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,240
That's all. Bye.

What are you doing?

170
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,150
You also want to

171
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,800
direct my work?

172
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,680
Let me tell you.

173
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,890
Actually, I've long been dissatisfied

174
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:31,370

175
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,240
I saw you

176
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,419
sitting here every day.

177
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,409
Day and night,

178
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:35,909
you're writing.

179
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
What is she doing?

180
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:38,890
She just makes money, right?

181
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,190
You don't know our work.

182
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,429
You just know I'm writing.

183
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,450
She's busy with her work.

184
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:44,790
She's working hard too.

185
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,190
She can't treat you as a rainmaker.

186
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,870
Come on.

187
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:48,150
What are you talking about, Mom?

188
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,080
Let's not talk about these things.

189
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,950
I just want to ask you a question.

190
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,910
What you're facing now is

191
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,540
that Zhou Quan is going out to look for a job.

192
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,770

193
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,440
and go everywhere, right?

194
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,870
You don't trust me to take care of this child.

195
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,900
What about my grandson?

196
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,470
Compared to that woman,

197
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,870
I'm simply too kind to you.

198
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,620
I'm thinking if I had

199
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,770
asked you to do this earlier,

200
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,590
would you have both

201
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:24,820
family and career

202
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,420
like Cherry now?

203
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,920
Impossible.

204
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,870
Absolutely impossible.

205
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:29,550
No, no, no.

206
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,810
Let me tell you.

207
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,800
Cherry's situation

208
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,800
is a special case.

209
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:35,110
First of all, she does have talent.

210
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,140
Besides, she's lucky.

211
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,910
And she was able to meet me,

212
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,530
a responsible editor.

213
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,390
Right?

214
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,030
Not everyone

215
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,030
has such luck.

216
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,830
Most

217
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,370
stay-at-home mothers

218
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,380
sacrificed everything

219
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,290
for their families.

220
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,110
You've nurtured me for so many years.

221
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:50,070
Do you expect me

222
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,180
to be like them?

223
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,250
Can't I make my own way in the world?

224
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,630
No, I don't.

225
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,730
But I'm worried about you.

226
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,720
Your dad and I

227
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,190
can't be with you when you're old.

228
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,310
When you're old,

229
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,170
if you get sick or something,

230
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,120
with no man

231
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,980
and children by your side,

232
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,910
what will you do?

233
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,720
You've really

234
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,190
told me this many times.

235
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,990
I just want to ask you.

236
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,410
If I have a husband

237
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,430
and children,

238
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,990
can I live forever

239
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,750
without any pain or illness?

240
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:18,710
Let me tell you.

241
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,230
Maybe the one who will remove my breathing tube in the end

242
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,870
will be my good-for-nothing husband.

243
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:23,070
Don't talk nonsense.

244
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,790
Don't anger me.

245
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,590
Mom, don't sigh all the time.

246
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,180
Sighing will make your good luck go away.

247
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,260
I know.

248
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:47,790
[Sister-in-law, Feifei and the man you introduced to her hasn't move on.]

249
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,030
[If you really think it's good, help me push it.]

250
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,630
Mr. Yuan,

251
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,260
I have high hopes for

252
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,090
your company.

253
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,820
Let's have more cooperation in the future.

254
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,550
Okay. Let's have more cooperation in the future.

255
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,750
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

256
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,150
I'm leaving.

257
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,190
Okay. Bye-bye.

258
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:06,810
Take care.

259
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,750
Take care.

260
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,350
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

261
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,070
Let me drive you home.

262
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:24,510
Okay.

263
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,850
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

264
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,270
[Take the friend you introduced to Feifei last time with you next Wednesday. Make them meet again.]

265
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,960
By the way, Yuan,

266
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,250
do you have any plans for next Wednesday?

267
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,010
What? You want to make plans for me?

268
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,670
Okay.

269
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,640
Come with me to a gathering.

270
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,230
What kind of gathering?

271
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:51,240
Just a dinner.

272
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,660
We'll talk about projects after it.

273
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,110
Talking about projects is okay for me.

274
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,550
Okay. It's settled.

275
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:57,790
Do you need me to pick you up?

276
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,270
No need.

277
00:11:58,910 --> 00:11:59,990
We're almost there.

278
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:00,850
Just drop me off.

279
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:01,190
Okay.

280
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,070
Drive slowly.

281
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:08,600
Okay.

282
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,600
I'm not going on blind dates for any other reasons.

283
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,440
I just want to find true love.

284
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,120
Can't I find

285
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,380
someone to be in a relationship with?

286
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,060
No.

287
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,790
But I really

288
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,510
must wait until

289
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:32,050
the right person comes.

290
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,070
I just want to find true love.

291
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:34,870
Is that too much to ask?

292
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,330
I agree. It's not too much.

293
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,670
Here's to true love.

294
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,750
Here's to the White Dragon Horse,

295
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,810
Sun Wukong, and Zhu Bajie.

296
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:47,030
♫The White Dragon Horse is heading west♫

297
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,470
♫Carrying Tang Sanzang♫

298
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,830
♫Followed by his three disciples♫

299
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:55,070
♫The journey to the west to take the Buddhist sutras♫

300
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:58,190
♫Is tens of thousands of miles♫

301
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,250
Let me do it myself.

302
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,930
I'm almost done.

303
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:31,870
I've ironed

304
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,200
your suit and casual clothes.

305
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,320
See which one

306
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,190
you prefer to wear tomorrow.

307
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,070
Don't you need to write?

308
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,850
It doesn't take much time.

309
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,650
Thank you, Honey.

310
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,140
Then I'll have to trouble you

311
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,870
to take care of Aiwen tomorrow.

312
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,010
He doesn't like to eat bread

313
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:50,940
for breakfast now.

314
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,070
He prefers steamed buns.

315
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,830
One with meat and one with vegetables.

316
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,620
And

317
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,780
he doesn't like fried eggs anymore.

318
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,390
He likes soft-boiled eggs.

319
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:58,780
He likes to dip them in soy sauce.

320
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,460
So don't

321
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,560
boil them too long.

322
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,110
As for the online courses,

323
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,910
he's on lesson eight

324
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,510
of the Chinese literature course.

325
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,840
One lesson per session.

326
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,500
You must keep a close eye on him during the lesson,

327
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,100
or he'll watch short videos.

328
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,990
Honey.

329
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,950
You're even more long-winded than I used to be.

330
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,070
Did you realize it?

331
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,300
Yes, I did.

332
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,510
Don't worry.

333
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,480
Just focus on your work

334
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,270
tomorrow.

335
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,240
Do your best.

336
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,410
I'm sure there won't be any problems.

337
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,570
President.

338
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,000
Is it really appropriate for us to do this?

339
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,040
What's going on?

340
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,910
He spoke high-sounding words

341
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,170
in a righteous manner.

342
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,460
In fact, he just wants to make money.

343
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,140
What's wrong?

344
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,150
You're so angry after answering the phone.

345
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,480
He just told me on the phone

346
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,880
that your previous books

347
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,220
are no longer in print.

348
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,080
What does that mean?

349
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,010
Because they want to make a new book

350
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,520
which is a collection

351
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,630
of all the articles

352
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:57,870
from your blog.

353
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,070
It'll be called the Commemorative Collector's Edition.

354
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,400
To put it plainly, it's just a hodgepodge.

355
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,780
But it also proves

356
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,840
that you really became popular.

357
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,140
Even though I became popular, we can't do this, right?

358
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,730
What does this mean?

359
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,160
It's using the excuse of publishing a new book

360
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,470
to make the contents I've previously made public

361
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:13,290
a collection

362
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,030
and sell it to the fans?

363
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,250
Isn't this milking the fans?

364
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,330
Exactly. I said that too.

365
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:19,800
But they said

366
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,290
that it's not the first time that the publishing house

367
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:22,300
has made this kind of collection.

368
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,070
And we're not the first to do it either.

369
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:24,910
They also said

370
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,310
that fans spending money

371
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,910
to buy articles from their favorite authors

372
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,230
is to support the authors.

373
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,690
It's not milking the fans.

374
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,310
I don't care how others do it.

375
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,760
I definitely can't do it this way.

376
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,870
I think it's a bit unethical.

377
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,310
Yes.

378
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:35,890
Besides,

379
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,340
I have a collaborative relationship with them.

380
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,660
The contents of my book

381
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:39,520
shouldn't be decided

382
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
by them alone.

383
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,370
This is definitely not okay.

384
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,420
I need to go talk to them about it.

385
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,080
No problem.

386
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,320
Let's talk it over first

387
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,320
before we go fight with them.

388
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,500
I'll add some water.

389
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:51,990
But I think

390
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,260
at this time,

391
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,710
they're actually right.

392
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,240
As for this approach,

393
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,350
it's really a bit...

394
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,390
Too shoddy.

395
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,550
If you think their idea

396
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,480
is okay,

397
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,980
I think at least

398
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,400
I can take some of my previous articles

399
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,670
that are indeed brilliant

400
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,830
and very popular

401
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,560
and put them in it.

402
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,840
And I've written a few new articles

403
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,450
recently.

404
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:16,690
I haven't had a chance to show you yet.

405
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,360
If you think they're okay after reading them,

406
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
let's put them in.

407
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,590
Milking fans this way

408
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,990
won't make me feel so bad.

409
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,390
I was just worried

410
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,700
that you've had a lot going on at home recently

411
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,940
and didn't have time to write articles.

412
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,460
You've already written them.

413
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,170
That's great.

414
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:29,950
Okay.

415
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,030
If you think it's okay,

416
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,030
I can give it a try.

417
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:32,510
When I finish writing,

418
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,710
I'll show them to you.

419
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,170
Actually, the reason why I came to see you today

420
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,630
is that there's something

421
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,210
I want to discuss with you.

422
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:40,870
That day in the hospital,

423
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:44,070
I got into a fight with Zhou Quan.

424
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,510
And I was like a shrew,

425
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,550
yelling at him.

426
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:48,910
He didn't say

427
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,230
anything nice anyway.

428
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,250
We haven't had such a big fight in many years.

429
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,470
Anyway, the words we said

430
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,270
were harsh.

431
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,740
But there's one thing.

432
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,190
Although he blurted it out,

433
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,100
I think he

434
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,850
might really think that way.

435
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:00,830
That is,

436
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,910
he still wants to go back to work.

437
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:04,619
This is the first point.

438
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,750
As for the second point,

439
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,440
you know my mom.

440
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,750
She,

441
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,380
at my insistence,

442
00:17:10,869 --> 00:17:12,450
finally retreated to the second line.

443
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,849
Now, she jumps out again.

444
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,829
She has a stick to beat me with.

445
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:17,190
So our family is now

446
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,520
in this situation.

447
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,349
I understood.

448
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,089
I'll cancel the following events

449
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:22,960
for you.

450
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:26,630
Maybe it's not just about

451
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:27,670
those few events.

452
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:30,160
What do you mean?

453
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,000
Don't tell me

454
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,820
you're going to back to your old life

455
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,620
and go back to become a stay-at-home mother again.

456
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,660
I haven't made up my mind yet,

457
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,530
but I really

458
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:44,090
have thought about it.

459
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,050
Seriously.

460
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,390
Because given the current situation,

461
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,990
Aiwen is about to go to elementary school.

462
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,730
It's not that I don't have any time at all.

463
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,790
Can I spare the time

464
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:51,580
to write my blogs

465
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,030
like before?

466
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:54,070
And

467
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,980
I'll still take care of the child.

468
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,110
Because I feel they're both tiring.

469
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:57,630
But that

470
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,910
didn't make me stressed like today.

471
00:17:58,910 --> 00:17:59,830
Do you know?

472
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:01,940
I really don't know

473
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,880
how to deal with the mess

474
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,870
at home.

475
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,160
That's not the case.

476
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:07,310
You're already a hit now.

477
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:09,720
When you're a hit, you have to keep moving forward.

478
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,210
You definitely have to go meet your fans.

479
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:13,020
You definitely have to attend events.

480
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,550
There's no turning back.

481
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,770
You have to strike while the iron is hot.

482
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,710
If you take a break,

483
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,840
you'll be canceled.

484
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,130
I don't want to either.

485
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:20,900
I quite enjoy it,

486
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:21,960
to be honest.

487
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,290
And I think

488
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,590
this also makes me feel

489
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,350
I'm more valuable.

490
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,640
But what should I do

491
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,870
with the mess at home?

492
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,400
I have to go back.

493
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,590
As for the publishing house,

494
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,520
let's think it through another day

495
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,360
and go talk to them.

496
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,730
No problem. President is reasonable.

497
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,550
I can persuade him.

498
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,750
-Okay.
-Don't worry.

499
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,670
I'm leaving.

500
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:40,400
Okay. Take care.

501
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,350
Another day. I'll treat you to a meal another day.

502
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,490
Okay.

503
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,090
Why hasn't it started yet?

504
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:50,620
Big companies are all like this.

505
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,150
They just keep you waiting.

506
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,990
What's your background?

507
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,980
I heard this company

508
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,110
has high standards.

509
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,430
I just graduated.

510
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,470
Last week, I resigned from my job without a backup plan.

511
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,160
Why?

512
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:02,990
The salary was so-so.

513
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,600
And the boss was quite annoying.

514
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,480
If I had stayed there,

515
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,210
wouldn't I have wasted my life?

516
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,740
I studied abroad.

517
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,670
I did my bachelor's and master's degrees consecutively.

518
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:13,330
I used to intern at Microsoft.

519
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:16,070
I came back this time because I want to find a company

520
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,070
for transition

521
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,480
and experience.

522
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,690
The chili peppers are growing well.

523
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,950
I have a pot at home too.

524
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,740
Yours are growing

525
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,980
better than mine.

526
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,280
Did you put anything inside?

527
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,740
I just put some fertilizer.

528
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,480
What kind of fertilizer did you put?

529
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,280
You're here for the interview?

530
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:47,480
What salary are you expecting?

531
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,230
I used to be paid 20,000.

532
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:50,940
At this place,

533
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,380
I should be paid at least 20,000 too, right?

534
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,280
At your age, you still want 20,000?

535
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,510
Bro, you can't talk like that.

536
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,590
You can't look down on people like this.

537
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,560
I don't look down on you.

538
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,840
You're a janitor, right?

539
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,320
Sorry. I'm not a janitor.

540
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,530
I'm a floral designer.

541
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,840
Is your boss good-tempered?

542
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,030
Do you want him to be good-tempered

543
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:10,790
or not?

544
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:12,500
Your question...

545
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,730
Who wants

546
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,070
a bad-tempered boss?

547
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,770
What if his temper is really bad?

548
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,850
Then it depends on whether his words make sense.

549
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,990
If they don't make sense, I'll argue with him.

550
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:23,390
You can't hit him, right?

551
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,840
If it's serious, hitting him is also okay.

552
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,590
What?

553
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,550
My previous boss was really annoying.

554
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,180
I regret that I didn't hit him.

555
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,430
The earth can still rotate without anyone,

556
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:31,950
right?

557
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,770
They think they're so great just because they're the boss, right?

558
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,670
I think people

559
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,950
should respect each other.

560
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:36,550
It can't be like this.

561
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,080
Mr. Guan.

562
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:38,990
We're ready.

563
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,650
Please go in.

564
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,090
Okay.

565
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,430
Go.

566
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,140
I said go.

567
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,320
Hurry up and go.

568
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,560
They're still waiting over there.

569
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,620
Where are we going?

570
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:40,310
Quan.

571
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,300
You... You're here to apply for a job?

572
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,760
We're here for a proposal.

573
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,530
Well, Quan, you...

574
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,920
Do you work here?

575
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:51,490
I...

576
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,080
Mr. Zhou.

577
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,740
Do you still need your resume?

578
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:12,420
Aiwen.

579
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,100
Aiwen.

580
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,740
Aiwen.

581
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,490
Where did he go?

582
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,590
Zhou Aiwen.

583
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:47,270
Aiwen.

584
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,880
Why did you fall asleep here?

585
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,340
Get up. Get up, Baby.

586
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,550
You'd catch a cold.

587
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:53,910
You're wearing so little.

588
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,580
Hurry up. Let's sleep inside.

589
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,950
Are you sleepy?

590
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:01,580
-You're sleepy.
-Mommy.

591
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,220
Hurry up and go inside.

592
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:05,830
What were you thinking?

593
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,190
You went there to sleep.

594
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,440
Are you cold?

595
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,430
Yes.

596
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:13,200
Then why did you sleep there?

597
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,350
I wanted to hide in the tent.

598
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,800
This way,

599
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,460
Daddy can come into the tent and play with me

600
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,620
when he comes back.

601
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,850
You miss your daddy?

602
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,250
Why do you like your daddy

603
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,780
being here with you so much?

604
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,210
Son, how about this?

605
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,180
Now, be a good boy.

606
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,900
Go wash your face and brush your teeth.

607
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,590
Then I'll read with you for a while.

608
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,650
Maybe your daddy will be back by then.

609
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,110
Okay?

610
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:46,700
Okay.

611
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,570
Then go.

612
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,350
Honey.

613
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,510
You're back.

614
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:12,930
Is he asleep?

615
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:13,440
Yes.

616
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,190
Why are you so late?

617
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,610
It's a bit late.

618
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,110
How was your day? Did everything go smoothly?

619
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,570
I got the little one to sleep

620
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:21,280
and managed to send the old one away.

621
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,440
I finally have some time

622
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,440
to write some drafts now.

623
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,230
I haven't updated them for several days.

624
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,830
A new book is about to be released.

625
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,050
So I want to get the drafts written

626
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:28,910
to create buzz.

627
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,790
What about you? How did it go?

628
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:33,870
It went very smoothly too.

629
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,470
Some are from the lvy League.

630
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,450
Some have studied abroad.

631
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,140
They were all my competitors.

632
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:39,910
After I got there,

633
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:40,910
I threw my resume.

634
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,250
They were all shocked.

635
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,140
Being capable is...

636
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,830
So

637
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,880
you ran away?

638
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,090
What else could I do?

639
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,420
It was so embarrassing.

640
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,160
What's there to be embarrassed about?

641
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,060
That Ding

642
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,610
isn't a good person either.

643
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:14,390
Just pretend that you didn't want to talk to him.

644
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,450
Even if you talked to him,

645
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,190
I guess he wouldn't have anything nice to say.

646
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:16,720
He and you

647
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,730
are from different world.

648
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:18,170
Honey,

649
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,500
I think you did the right thing by leaving.

650
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,070
I don't really care about him.

651
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,670
The important thing is, I was too stupid today.

652
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,300
I only noticed the boss's face

653
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,030
and apron.

654
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:28,950
Under his apron,

655
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,650
he was wearing a shirt and trousers.

656
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,340
I didn't notice

657
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,330
these details at all.

658
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:32,770
It was

659
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:34,620
stupid to say those things.

660
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:35,680
Well, I think

661
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,900
the boss is narrow-minded too.

662
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,810
Because of such a small matter,

663
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,380
he didn't even know you.

664
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,180
Does he know you're a talent?

665
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:44,350
He lost a talent.

666
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:45,470
It's okay.

667
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,960
It's better not to follow this kind of boss.

668
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,430
The competition among middle-aged people

669
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,310
is really intense now.

670
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,870
I used to think that with my skills,

671
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,430
finding a job would be quite easy.

672
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:58,490
Once I showed them my resume,

673
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,190
there would definitely be no problem.

674
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:01,520
But that's not the case.

675
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,090
So on the way back,

676
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,430
I've been thinking.

677
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,630
When you took care of the child at home,

678
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,110
you did an excellent job.

679
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,950
Moreover, you were quite positive.

680
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,210
You never complained.

681
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,590
When you went to work,

682
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,000
you also did it so well.

683
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,990
From nothing to something,

684
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,480
how did you

685
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,370
get through the process?

686
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:21,110
Did you... Did you keep bearing it all along

687
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,240
without telling me?

688
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,440
I'm flattered.

689
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,540
I'm not that good.

690
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:27,970
Did you forget how clumsy I was

691
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:30,080
when I started taking care of the child?

692
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,750
Everything was out of control.

693
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,820
As for the work,

694
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:34,910
it's just because of my luck.

695
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:36,470
Before,

696
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,040
it really helped me

697
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,140
pass the time.

698
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,740
I'm quite grateful to Meng Fei for this.

699
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:44,030
It was her who persuaded me to do this blog.

700
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:44,520
And

701
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,010
sometimes it makes me feel

702
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,740
that besides being Zhou Quan's wife

703
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,800
and Aiwen's mommy,

704
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,680
I'm also Che Li.

705
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,090
This really does help.

706
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:55,770
You're different.

707
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:57,020
You have skills.

708
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,500
I've told you this before.

709
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,110
No rush.

710
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,610
It's just the first day.

711
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:03,750
That's right.

712
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,290
I'm not

713
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,560
so easily defeated.

714
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,310
Exactly.

715
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,150
Besides,

716
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,340
there's still work at home.

717
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,800
If it really doesn't work, you can come back.

718
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:15,750

719

00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,900
♫Between a moment and an eternity♫

757
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,580
is it possible to cut it a bit?

758
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,990
Mr. Zhou, this position

759
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,060
♫It's the constant of a lifetime♫

760
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,350
requires long-term residency in another province.

761
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,190
Could you please tell us

762
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,850
about your previous company?

763
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,790
Our company

764
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:05,070
♫Two people chatting over three meals in four seasons♫

765
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:01,260
mainly recruits students fresh from college.

766
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,070
I'm sorry.

767
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,110
Mr. Zhou.

768
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,910
Our company may not be suitable for you.

769
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:05,950
Why isn't it suitable for me?

770
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:12,660
♫Different cravings for each season♫

771
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,250
Actually, our company

772
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,810
needs young people.

773
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,620
Thank you.

774
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:16,700
♫The sunset is passing by♫

775
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,700
Sorry, I'm late.

776
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:16,410
Sorry, the interview is over.

777
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:17,110
Sorry.

778
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:20,790
♫The moonlight and the stars make me restless♫

Sorry.

781
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,830
Sorry.

♫And you're right next to me♫

783

[Happy Birthday]

784

Sister.

785
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,510
We've talked to Feifei.

786
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:54,440
Her attitude

787
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,240
has changed.

788
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,490
It seems promising.

789
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:57,520
We'll introduce

790
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,780
a few more to her later.

791
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:59,570
Okay.

792
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,770
Yes. Don't worry.

793
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,200
As for me, I'll also ask my husband

794
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,460
to pay more attention.

795
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,670
You...

796
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:05,970
Don't treat Feifei

797
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,630
as an unsalable product.

798
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,090
Isn't this for Feifei's own good?

799
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:11,760
Exactly.

800
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,720
Yes.

801
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:13,950
Feifei.

802
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:15,750
Feifei.

803
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:17,540
Feifei.

804
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:19,790
Feifei!

805
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:22,970
Why didn't you answer when I called you?

806
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,190
You ate so many sweets.

807
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,430
Dad. Mom.

808
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,550
What are they?

809
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,160
Look. Earplugs.

810
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,060
You've been wearing earplugs?

811
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,580
What's wrong?

812
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,750
With earplugs,

813
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,430
I can't hear

814
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,370
Second Aunt and the others talking.

815
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,330
If I can't hear them talking,

816
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,450
I won't argue with them.

817
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,820
Isn't it Grandma's birthday today?

818
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,880
It's such a good atmosphere.

819
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,590
If I argue with them,

820
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,370
everyone will be unhappy.

821
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:48,670
I want everyone to be happy.

822
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,150
I want to

823
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,720
express my filial piety.

824
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,870
You should praise me.

825
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,550
And look,

826
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:53,710
I specially picked

827
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,510
red earplugs.

828
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,750
It's really suitable for today's atmosphere.

829
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,480
Praise me.

830
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,950
They're good things.

831
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,410
I need them too.

832
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,200
What are you doing here?

833
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:03,910
You also want it?

834
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,170
I'll give you new ones.

835
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,840
You really gave them to him?

836
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:08,150
I see

837
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,350
many kids came today.

838
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,970
Their parents

839
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,830
are younger than you.

840
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,230
But you

841
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,350
don't even have a boyfriend,

842
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,310
not to mention children.

843
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,110
Hurry up.

844
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,730
Our Feifei is so outstanding.

845
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:20,750
There must be a good man

846
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,510
waiting for her.

847
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,260
Where is this good man?

848
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,630
Good things are worth waiting for.

849
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:25,360
Exactly. Are you eating or not?

850
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,650
Here.

851
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:29,350
Alright.

852
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:29,960
Alright.

853
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,750
Before you came here,

854
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,220
you didn't even do your hair.

855
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,880
So many people are looking at you.

856
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,620
Take off your coat.

857
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:36,750
Show that red outfit.

858
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:39,030
-I've already put it on.
-Look how good it looks.

859
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:40,070
It looks good.

860
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:40,750
What I'm wearing is good enough.

861
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,150
Honey, I've been waiting for you for a long time.

862
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,430
Hello. Hello. Hello.

863
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,490
Sorry, I'm late.

864
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,150
Feifei.

865
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,360
Come here quickly.

866
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,300
You've met before.

867
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:48,870
Yuan.

868
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:51,940
This...

869
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:56,990
That's him? He's really handsome.

870
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,310
You're Yuan?

871
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,070
Yes.

872
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,440
Why is it different from what you said?

873
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,650
You said he was dolled up.

874
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:03,250
Mom.

875
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,160
Well, Yuan.

876
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,270
Last time,

877
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,670
you met our Feifei.

878
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,810
What was your impression of her?

879
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,790
Meng Fei is quite good.

880
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,870
She's beautiful.

881
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,910
And she's elegant.

882
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:21,400
She has a good personality and is well-educated.

883
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,460
She's really good.

884
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,610
What did Meng Fei say about me?

885
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:31,750
Feifei said

886
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,060
that you're tall, handsome, and capable.

887
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,030
You're well-educated and has a successful career.

888
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,830
You two are really well matched.

889
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:38,600
Mom.

890
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,070
I didn't say that.

891
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,530
Don't make it up for me.

892
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,270
I clearly told you

893
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:45,350
that he was all dolled up.

894
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:45,990
He paid too much attention to

895
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,030
his image.

896
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:47,630
No, no.

897
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:48,460
He used too much hair gel.

898
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,510
His lip gloss was too thick.

899
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,110
He started brainwashing me as soon as we met.

900
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:51,930
The most important thing

901
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,550
is that before he went on a blind date with me,

902
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:53,910
he also had a blind date

903
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,110
with another girl.

904
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:56,420
He's a great

905
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,680
master of time management.

906
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,050
We just had one meal together.

907
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,260
Then

908
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,480
I blacked out and don't remember anything.

909
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,410
You blacked out?

910
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:05,390
You blacked out.

911
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,590
I can help you recall.

912
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:07,310
Here's the thing.

913
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:08,510
That day, the two of us

914
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:09,460
had a meal together

915
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,120
and then went to another place

916
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,340
to have a in-depth

917
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,380
conversation.

918
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,550
No. Wait a minute.

919
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,540
What do you mean by a in-depth conversation?

920
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,410
What in-depth conversation?

921
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,610
Don't talk nonsense.

922
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,020
We just went to another place

923
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,030
to go dancing.

924
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:23,360
Meng Fei was really good at dancing.

925
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,030
Shut up!

926
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,000
Let him speak.

927
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:25,830
Shut up!

928
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,680
Her overseas study experience

929
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,430
was really useful.

930
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,400
When Meng Fei was drunk...

931
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,670
Don't talk nonsense. Shut up.

932
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,070
Red wine, white wine, beer,

933
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,450
and even foreign liquor.

934
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:32,680
Feifei.

935
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,270
You have to seize the opportunity this time.

936
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,400
Look at you, so smug.

937
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,610
Today is Grandma's birthday.

938
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:37,970
All the relatives are here.

939
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:38,650
You deliberately

940
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:39,880
embarrassed me.

941
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:41,150
It's your grandma's birthday.

942
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,480
How would I know, right?

943
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:43,880
Grandma.

944
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,990
Tell me, did you do it on purpose?

945
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,270
So do you remember now?

946
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,630
Remember what?

947
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,260
Do I remember

948
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:55,970
that you owe me a lighter

949
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:56,650
or

950
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,610
that you cut the steak

951
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:58,990
of the person you went on a blind date with?

952
00:33:58,990 --> 00:34:00,270
It's okay. Come.

953
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,560
Hear your memories.

954
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,150
Here's to true love.

955
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,280
Here's to

956
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,810
the White Dragon Horse...

957
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,260
I...

958
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:09,690
Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie.

959
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:10,870
Give it to me.

960
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:13,440
♫The White Dragon Horse is heading west♫

961
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,150
Wait a minute.

962
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:20,989
What else

963
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,679
do you have?

964
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:31,219
Which girl

965
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,239
left this for you?

966
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,389
Done.

967
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,739
Leave now. You hear me?

968
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,550
You hear me?

969
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,429
Got it.

970
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,460
Bro,

971
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,630
can Aiwen's band-aids

972
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,870
have a different pattern next time?

973
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,070
Maintaining this kind of app

974
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,040
doesn't require complex codes

975
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,580
or computation.

976
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,380
This isn't my area of expertise.

977
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:22,990
Mr. Zhou,

978
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,470
I know you came from a big Internet company.

979
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:26,350
Seeing these projects,

980
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,950
you may feel overqualified.

981
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,280
But to be honest,

982
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,440
at our age,

983
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,360
we work to support our families.

984
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,560
It doesn't matter where we make money.

985
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,150
We developed this app

986
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,650
because we want to create our own product

987
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,710
and sell it online.

988
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:40,760
What product?

989
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:41,950
Wigs.

990
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,390
Weasel hair wigs.

991
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:45,390
Sorry.

992
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,800
This job isn't suitable for me.

993
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,550
Mr. Wang.

994
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,330
You're kidding.

995
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:57,660
How about this?

996
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,120
Let me add a small premise.

997
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,580
If your distribution volume and channels

998
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,730
can reach 120%

999
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,810
of other suppliers',

1000
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:04,940
then I'll give you some

1001
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,740
other rewards

1002
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,740
such as

1003
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,170
Cherry's autograph

1004
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,920
and some offline book signing.

1005
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,380
Forget about having dinner together.

1006
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:15,870
You...

1007
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,050
Look, it's so late.

1008
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,510
But I'm still working overtime in the company.

1009
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,480
How about this?

1010
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,630
When we celebrate,

1011
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,130
I'll invite you to dinner then.

1012
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,790
I'll ask our president to accompany you.

1013
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,520
Is that okay?

1014
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,120
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1015
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,100
Good night.

1016
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,920
Dear, good night.

1017
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:39,490
Rest in peace.

1018
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,040
My head is about to explode. Oh my god.

1019
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,940
My feet.

1020
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,690
When did he get it?

1021
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:02,950
When did it fall?

1022
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:07,130
What does it have?

1023
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,110
Here's to Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie.

1024
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,440
Here's to Tang Seng.

1025
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:23,320
Oh my god.

1026
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:25,080
Why did I talk so much nonsense?

1027
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,190
Yu.

1028
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:28,270
I went for a job interview today.

1029
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:30,970
I think it's quite suitable for you.

1030
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,390
This company originally

1031
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:35,060
engaged in the development of wigs,

1032
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,360
but they want to make PowerPoint slides.

1033
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,740
My wife and I are selling seafood in our hometown,

1034
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,270
and it's doing pretty well.

1035
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,470
Why are you so hard to please?

1036
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:44,540
Don't sell seafood.

1037
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,100
Seafood is smelly.

1038
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:50,950
Fine. Let's talk about it later.

1039
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:51,390
Okay.

1040
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,450
You two go back first.

1041
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,530
I'll drive Mr. Guan home.

1042
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,060
I have a car. I didn't drink.

1043
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,180
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1044
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,150
Go.

1045
00:37:57,290 --> 00:37:58,220
Let's go, Jun.

1046
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:07,910
Dong.

1047
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,030
Quan.

1048
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,710
Why are you here?

1049
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,890
What's going on?

1050
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:15,550
Mr. Guan.

1051
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:16,990
You two know each other?

1052
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:17,790
I previously

1053
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,390
went to Mr. Guan's company for an interview.

1054
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,390
My senior.

1055
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,820
Your senior?

1056
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,310
Yes.

1057
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,990
We were both in the same major.

1058
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,440
I didn't interview him.

1059
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:30,500
-There was a little misunderstanding.
-Quan is really outstanding.

1060
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,470
Quan, I'm driving Mr. Guan home.

1061
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:32,950
Okay.

1062
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,220
Let's contact each other on WeChat later.

1063
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:34,820
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1064
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,580
Okay.

1065
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,600
Can you sing?

1066
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:41,450
Yes, I can.

1067
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:46,280
This...

1068
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,720
The GPS shows that we're going to a residential area.

1069
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,320
Aren't we going for karaoke?

1070
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:51,600
Yes, Quan.

1071
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,190
What karaoke?

1072
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,190
Your wife don't let me go.

1073
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,840
No, my wife...

1074
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,430
My wife don't let me go.

1075
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:01,510
Dong.

1076
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,350
Understood, Jun.

1077
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,920
Play a song I'm good at.

1078
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,550
Sing your favorite song.

1079
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,880
Let's see if you sing it.

1080
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,800
Listen.

1081
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,910
After you drink wine,

1082
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,340
singing can help you shout it out.

1083
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,470
You'll stop being drunk immediately.

1084
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,330
Jun's after-dinner pastime.

1085
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:32,580
♫The birds in the tree are in pairs♫

1086
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,430
Quan, can you do it?

1087
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,510
I'm not very familiar with this song.

in that company?

1092
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,400
Why did you quit?

1093
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,510
I was fired by them.

1094
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:56,010

planning to do next?

1098
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,150
Take it one step at a time.

1099
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,690

if you need any help,

1104

feel free to contact me anytime.

1105
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,840
Okay. I'm very grateful

1106

Mommy.

1112
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,860
Grandma just changed my dressing.

1113
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,490
I didn't cry out in pain at all.

1114
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,160
Aiwen is so great.

1115
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,030
You're a strong and brave

1116
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,900
little man, right?

1117
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:49,910
Great.

1118
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,570
It's late.

1119
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,520
Why hasn't Zhou Quan come back yet?

1120
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,820
He's been out all day.

1121
00:40:55,850 --> 00:40:57,980
He can't take care of anything at home.

1122
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,240
When he was at home,

1123
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,810
you complained that he was idle

1124
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:02,410
and didn't have a proper job.

1125
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:03,800
When he's trying to find a job,

1126
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,880
you complained that he doesn't care about the family.

1127
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,800
Mom, recently you've been

1128
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,950
finding Zhou Quan's faults

1129
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,500
no matter what, right?

1130
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:12,150
It's not that I've been finding his faults.

1131
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,430
He can't take good care

1132
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:14,510
of the child.

1133
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,550
And he can't find a job either.

1134
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,120
How can I stand him?

1135
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,880
How can I be satisfied with him?

1136
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:21,780
What I want to say

1137
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,840
is that you spend your whole day

1138
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,410
typing on the computer.

1139
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,950
I'm worried about you.

1140
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:28,940
In this world,

1141
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,560
the person who treats me the best is only my mom.

1142
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:35,350
You.

1143
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:37,890
You only know how to bully me.

1144
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:38,760
Is that bullying?

1145
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,020
That's relying on you.

1146
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,270
Alright, I'm leaving.

1147
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:42,750
Okay.

1148
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,690
-Bye-bye, Grandma.
-Take care.

1149
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:45,970
Okay. By the way,

1150
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,150
tell Zhou Quan

1151
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,810
to come home quickly if he can't find a job.

1152
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:50,440
It's so late.

1153
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,870
Why is he wandering outside?

1154
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:52,690
I'll tell him

1155
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,410
that his mother-in-law is very concerned about him.

1156
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:55,690
Go away. I'm leaving.

1157
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:57,150
Take care.

1158
00:41:57,450 --> 00:41:58,020
Okay.

1159
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,100
Bye-bye, Grandma.

1160
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,440
Bye-bye.

1161
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,480
Mommy, why did you

1162
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,180
put so many books here?

1163
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:06,990
Is this the homework

1164
00:42:06,990 --> 00:42:08,700
given by your teacher?

1165
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,430
Yes. Meng Fei.

1166
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:11,390
Ms. Meng gave me

1167
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,760
the homework.

1168
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:15,030
Son,

1169
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,350
can you help me?

1170
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,260
Just like how

1171
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:17,980
I help you

1172
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,460
when you do your homework.

1173
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,260
Help me think

1174
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:22,820
of a four-word

1175
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,730
wish.

1176
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:25,460
For example, what do you

1177
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:26,630
want to do the most right now?

1178
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:28,840
What wish do you want to fulfill the most?

1179
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,370
Do not bedwetting anymore.

1180
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,040
Okay, that's great.

1181
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:33,470
Think of another one.

1182
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,200
I want to eat cheese sticks every day.

1183
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,470
Eat candy every day.

1184
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,930
Eat candy every day.

1185
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,780
Son, this one is so great.

1186
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:44,750
Help me think of one more.

1187
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,820
I want to have a strong body

1188
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,470
like Ultraman.

1189
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:52,920
Have a strong body. This is also great.

1190
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:57,180
Have a strong body. Yes.

1191
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,580
It's much better than having a healthy body.
