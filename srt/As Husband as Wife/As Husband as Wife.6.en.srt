[Episode 6]

4
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,770
Zhou Quan, I'm telling you,

5
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:40,509
as a father,

6
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,600
honestly,

7
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,030
you are so irresponsible to your child.

8
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,770
How am I being irresponsible?

9
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,950
Aren't you being irresponsible?

10
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,570
We all agreed to let me help him with his study.

11
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,210
I'm in charge of the education part.

12
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,170
I promised to help him learn 20 new words every day.

13
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:48,990
You agreed with it at that time, right?

14
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,960
I did.

15
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:50,610
We've set up rules.

16
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,430
Why do you have to break them?

17
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,210
How am I breaking the rules?

18
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:52,910
What kind of rules are those?

19
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:53,530
Aren't you breaking the rules now?

20
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,060
Listen, the kid needs rest.

21
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,870
-He needs enough sleep.
-A two-hour nap.

22
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,600
And you think he's really taking a rest?

23
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,370
Look how sleepy he is.

24
00:01:58,370 --> 00:01:59,030
It means he hasn't gotten enough sleep. You know?

25
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,650
You wonder why he looks sleepy?

26
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,510
He's obviously avoiding study.

27
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,370
How could you say he's avoiding study?

28
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:02,770
He's just trying to get out of his duty

29
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,300
of memorizing 20 new words.

30
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:04,950
If now...

31
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:05,840
We've set up certain rules.

32
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,370
If he...

33
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,870
Mom, you're attacking me

34
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,949
and that is unreasonable. Honey...

35
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:10,810
You think I enjoy that?

36
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:12,470
What kind of person would do this?

37
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,510
I'm trying to speak my mind

38
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,740
but you wouldn't let me.

39
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,570
You're being unreasonable.

40
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,860
How am I being unreasonable?

41
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,230
My grandson is sleepy

42
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,400
and he needs to sleep.

43
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,600
You can't deprive him of his sleep!

44
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,030
Taking a two-hour nap

45
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,030
is just his way to avoid study.

46
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,250
If we don't abide by the rules

47
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,250
that we have set up,

48
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:25,890
then what's the point

49
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,840
-of making them?
-Listen to me...

50
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,910
He needs to sleep for two hours...

51
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,310
Mommy.

52
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,160
Look, a red flower stamp.

53
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,510
Let me get you one too.

54
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,030
Okay.

55
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,770
What about his sleep at night?

56
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,890
You make him stay up late at night.

57
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,440
Exactly because

58
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,240
you hold him back from his sleep at night,

59
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,430
he gets dozy in the daytime.

60
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,060
Mommy,

61
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,570
what are Grandma and Daddy arguing about?

62
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,050
They're not arguing.

63
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,980
They're just having a discussion.

64
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,280
Could you let me borrow the stamp

65
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,160
for a while?

66
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,770
Go back to your room.

67
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,660
When their discussion is over,

68
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,590
you can come out.

69
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,600
Go. Do some reading.

70
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,840
We gotta make it clear.

71
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,610
We must make it clear.

72
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,550
We need to clear things up, of course.

73
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:53,870
Then let's talk about

74
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,430
the rules.

75
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,310
Listen up, you can't be like this!

76
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:56,990
When you raise your voice

77
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:57,870
and point a finger at me,

78
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,490
you're being very rude.

79
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,720
You're the one who's pointing a finger at me!

80
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,990
I'm senior to you,

81
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,010
so I get to scold you and point a finger at you.

82
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:02,770
This is so unfair.

83
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,720
You pointed a finger at me first, right?

84
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,380
I-I didn't. I'm senior to you.

85
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,080
You're junior to...

86
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:08,850
What are you doing?

87
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,110
What am I sitting here for?

88
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,080
You mean for me

89
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,990
to be the judge of this argument, right?

90
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,850
Do I even have a chance to chime in?

91
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,760
Can I say a few words?

92
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:22,550
Sure.

93
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,220
Whatever you've done,

94
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,410
you both mean well.

95
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,110
You admit it's true, don't you?

96
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,430
You just want the best for the child.

97
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,490
This long discussion has taken you nowhere.

98
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,670
I've come up with an idea.

99
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,000
Okay.

100
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,510
Here is a little stamp

101
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,270
with a red flower pattern.

102
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,190
Usually, adults give stamps

103
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,450
to children.

104
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,590
This time, we'll ask the child

105
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,050
to give stamps, all right?

106
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,600
We'll let Aiwen decide for himself

107
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,000
which of your approaches

108
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,910
he prefers and suits him better.

109
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:48,920
Is that okay?

110
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,550
I'm fine with it.

111
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,230
Shall we go with it?

112
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,190
Just go with it!

113
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,070
He's just a kid, right?

114
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,310
He doesn't know...

115
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:57,910
Aiwen!

116
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,670
Aiwen, come here.

117
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,410
Grandma and Daddy are done discussing.

118
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,500
Grandma, Daddy and Mommy

119
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,010
are giving you

120
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,460
a sacred mission today.

121
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,510
-What is it?
-Will you take it?

122
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,000
Yes.

123
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,190
One vote for Ms. Liu.

124
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,310
One vote for Ms. Liu.

125
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,430
Another vote for Ms. Liu.

126
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,210
Come on.

127
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:24,510
Let's give a big round of applause to Ms. Liu.

128
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,990
Congratulations on her being approved unanimously!

129
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:27,650
Applaud!

130
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,310
You weren't there

131
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,210
at the scene today.

132
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,140
My goodness. It was unbelievable.

133
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,390
I mean it.

134
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,270
We're now living in the era of the Internet,

135
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,430
but those people would rather

136
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,690
write about anything than the Internet.

137
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:03,990
However, many emerging industries

138
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,000
seem to be doing differently.

139
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,990
I've asked many friends.

140
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:07,950
Whether they run online shops

141
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,110
or write blogs,

142
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,230
they all adopt one simple principle.

143
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,050
That is, jobs are only reserved

144
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,580
for qualified candidates.

145
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,600
But our publishing house is never like that.

146
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,860
Everything is complicated, seriously.

147
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,190
All right. Enough said about me.

148
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,380
How's that argument between your mom

149
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,710
and your husband going?

150
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,120
My mom

151
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,840
always thinks her biggest advantage

152
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,930
is that Aiwen relies on her,

153
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,030
and that Aiwen likes her.

154
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:34,870
That's for sure,

155
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,270
given how she spoils him.

156
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,130
To settle the dispute,

157
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,050
I started a red flower stamp competition.

158
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,090
I let Aiwen decide for himself

159
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,670
who would be a better caregiver for him.

160
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,630
Aiwen will give a red flower stamp to the person

161
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,000
who does something he finds pleasant.

162
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,320
In the end, the one who gets more stamps wins.

163
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,480
That won't work.

164
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:53,790
Quan is done for.

165
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,150
He'll definitely lose.

166
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,290
Don't underestimate my husband.

167
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,570
After a few days' observation,

168
00:05:59,570 --> 00:05:59,950
I've found

169
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:02,350
that he actually has a talent for taking care of children.

170
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,270
Aiwen has changed a lot, really.

171
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,670
He's much more reasonable than before.

172
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,200
He is more independent now.

173
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,390
I want to use this period of time

174
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,980
to convince my mom

175
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,120
to completely

176
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,020
back off from how we parent

177
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:16,690
our child.

178
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,240
What's your plan?

179
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,420
I have years of experience

180
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,640
of being a stay-at-home mother.

181
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,430
I'll help Zhou Quan in secret.

182
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,030
I don't believe

183
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,270
the two of us

184
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,560
can't defeat my mom.

185
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,640
In fact, treating my mom this way

186
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,700
makes me feel like I'm a catty person.

187
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:34,040
But I have no choice.

188
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,010
Do you remember

189
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,909
what I said?

190
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,630
Yes.

191
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,120
Yes.

192
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,630
I will give red flower stamps

193
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:45,210
to the person who behaves well.

194
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,630
I will be fair and just.

195
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,270
Got it?

196
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,320
-Got it.
-Got it.

197
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,909
Then repeat what I said.

198
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:52,190
You will give red flower stamps

199
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,909
to the person who behaves well.

200
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:54,970
You will be fair...

201
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:56,200
And just.

202
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,230
Mommy, am I using the right tone now?

203
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,640
You're doing a great job.

204
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,340
You were a bit sloppy though, son.

205
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:06,400
You should've been

206
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,650
more serious in some parts.

207
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:10,200
T-There was a time that you wanted to laugh.

208
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,630
You see, a real general

209
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,670
would look very powerful.

210
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,410
When he's giving a speech,

211
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,210
he would be very stern.

212
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,340
Aiwen is doing okay.

213
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:16,820
You know what, son,

214
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,790
when you give red flower stamps,

215
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,350
you need to look authoritative.

216
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,430
Now, you're just a bit...

217
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,030
Come on, stand here.

218
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:21,690
I'll show you how to do it.

219
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,690
You're kind of...

220
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,350
Aiwen is doing great.

221
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,720
Come here, sweetheart.

222
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,030
Go to bed!

223
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,250
That was scary!

224
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,650
How annoying!

225
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,500
You weren't scared, were you?

226
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,260
All the authority was lost in a second!

227
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,230
Needless to doubt,

228
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,430
Grandma is gonna win.

229
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,010
I bet a pack of turtle feed

230
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,409
on Quan winning the game.

231
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:54,390
Mom,

232
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:56,159
why are you knitting a sweater?

233
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,460
Who is it for? Aiwen?

234
00:07:59,310 --> 00:07:59,909
No.

235
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,650
Can it be for me?

236
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,880
You wish! It's not for you.

237
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,300
Then who are you knitting this for?

238
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,360
It's pretty small.

239
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:10,790
What is it?

240
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,250
You wanna know?

241
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:20,510
What is it?

242
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,950
Impressive, Mom.

243
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,810
Lovely, huh?

244
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:33,130
Excellent craftsmanship.

245
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:34,720
The key is,

246
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,890
you do have some tricks up your sleeve.

247
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,760
I have to.

248
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,360
You came up with the idea

249
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,600
of holding a red flower stamp competition.

250
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,960
I have to do something.

251
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,010
If I lose to Zhou Quan,

252
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:48,070
that'll be a huge embarrassment.

253
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,080
I need to ask you a question.

254
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,270
Whose side are you on,

255
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,480
mine or Zhou Quan's?

256
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,140
Zhou Quan's side, certainly.

257
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:56,620
Well...

258
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,470
-My stance...
-Say it again.

259
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,970
My stance has always been clear on this,

260
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:59,710
right, Mom?

261
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,540
But I do find your wisdom

262
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,960
very admirable.

263
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,710
I'm supportive of you winning

264
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,630
more red flower stamps with your capabilities.

265
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,160
Go for it.

266
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,390
Mom, you've got this.

267
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,230
Quan can't outperform you.

268
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,430
He's not that bright.

269
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,310
You're much cleverer, aren't you?

270
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,840
Go for it.

271
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:17,790
You...

272
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,310
This is driving me mad.

273
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,310
Honey,

274
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,350
what's on your mind?

275
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,190
My mom

276
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,090
is knitting a sweater for that Ultraman toy.

277
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,710
You're up against a strong rival, you know?

278
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,350
Well,

279
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,460
I can order a suit for that toy.

280
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,960
I'm being serious.

281
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,930
Try thinking of a solution.

282
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,360
Or you might lose to her.

283
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,310
That's impossible, honey.

284
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:48,860
She'll suffer a massive defeat.

285
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,640
No matter how hard she tries,

286
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,840
she can't move Aiwen.

287
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,400
What's your plan then?

288
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,750
Look.

289
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,430
A motorcycle?

290
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,350
Is this thing safe?

291
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,340
Absolutely.

292
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:05,130
Plus, it's expensive.

293
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,910
If it’s safe,

294
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,460
I'm sure Aiwen will like it.

295
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:09,660
The price doesn't matter.

296
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,120
We're raking in money now.

297
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,030
Honey,

298
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,010
I'm going to pull off

299
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:14,790
a landslide victory over your mom.

300
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,670
I won't

301
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,990
cost the family a penny.

302
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:17,590
Well...

303
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:20,910
Yuan Yi once worked as a promoter for the manufacturer.

304
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,990
Yuan Yi, I will

305
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:27,860
send you a photo

306
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,460
of a motorcycle.

307
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,100
I'd like to buy

308
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,430
a motorcycle for Aiwen,

309
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,600
but it's out of stock now.

310
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,590
I know you once worked as a promoter for the manufacturer.

311
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:34,420
Would you ask them

312
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,950
if they can spare one for me?

313
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,590
I'll cover the cost.

314
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:39,190
You don't need to pay for it.

315
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,270
I'm not asking for a present.

316
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,710
I'm really not.

317
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:44,630
Look at you,

318
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,750
telling a lie without feeling ashamed.

319
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,280
"Not asking for a present."

320
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,200
"Old punk," he replied.

321
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,030
Look,

322
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,490
he knows what you're up to.

323
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,780
Leave the word "old" out, would you?

324
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,140
Your mom's gonna lose.

325
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:10,120
[The Charm of Red Flower Stamps]

326
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,360
Mom.

327
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,500
we agreed to compete in a fair manner.

328
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,570
I am being fair!

329
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,940
Am I not?

330
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,270
Aiwen,

331
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,440
I'll let you win this game,

332
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:33,950
but you gotta give me a stamp.

333
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,830
I can even reward you

334
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,490
with two cheese snacks.

335
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,070
Bravo.

336
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,390
I lost. I lost!

337
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,590
Shameless.

338
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,080
Utterly shameless.

339
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,740
W-W-What are you doing here?

340
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,590
I-I'm mopping the floor.

341
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,580
Hurry up. Come here.

342
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:03,130
Come up.

343
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,330
How exhausting.

344
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,310
Be a good boy and close your eyes.

345
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,430
Give me a red flower stamp!

346
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,490
Aren't you also despicable?

347
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,160
What are you doing here?

348
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,190
Taking a walk.

349
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,430
So creepy.

350
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,120
Li, Zhou Quan cheated!

351
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,740
The red flower stamp he just got doesn't count!

352
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,460
[Daddy]

353
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,540
Daddy, you lied!

354
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,750
This isn't watermelon juice at all.

355
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,750
It's just water.

356
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,230
How is that possible?

357
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,470
It's clearly water.

358
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,480
It really is.

359
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,720
Aiwen, go put on your shoes.

360
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,320
Mom, you...

361
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,660
Watermelon juice must be consumed

362
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,440
within ten minutes after it's made.

363
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,740
What made you so sure that I wouldn't let him

364
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,540
drink it all within ten minutes?

365
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,420
The water has been here

366
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,820
for the whole afternoon.

367
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:11,160
Wouldn't it be a waste to throw the juice away?

368
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
I drank it.

369
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,430
You fell for my trick.

370
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,070
Aiwen,

371
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,650
Grandma drank your watermelon juice.

372
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,250
I...

373
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,100
Grandma, I'm going to take back

374
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,020
one of your red flower stamps.

375
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,370
[Grandma]

376
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,830
Mom, you can't do this.

377
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,850
You should be reasonable.

378
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,510
How am I not being reasonable?

379
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,150
You resorted

380
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,630
to a dirty trick!

381
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,470
Aiwen made his own choice

382
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,270
of taking one of your stamps back.

383
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,020
I didn't do it!

384
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,220
Mommy, come here now!

385
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,780
"The charm of red flower stamps."

386
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,770
Another article that gets over 100 thousand views.

387
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,630
Your posts have basically

388
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:55,840
gotten a stable number of views now.

389
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,170
Roughly speaking, you're as influential

390
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,930
as a medium-sized medium now.

391
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,310
What's wrong?

392
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,400
Even achievements can't impress you now?

393
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,670
Here's one more piece

394
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,390
of big news.

395
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,150
Because your book

396
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,600
has never been taken out

397
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,380
from all the best-selling lists,

398
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,780
the publishing house has decided to print more copies again.

399
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,950
Great!

400
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,990
A forum in Nanjing

401
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,430
will be holding an event about women.

402
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,000
You are invited to make a speech

403
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,930
to share with people

404
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,500
a nowadays' elite woman's inner thoughts.

405
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,090
Elite woman? Who?

406
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:28,770
Me?

407
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,390
I'd rather say I'm

408
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,380
an "irritated" woman now.

409
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,660
You're already irritated?

410
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,070
Now isn't the summer vacation yet.

411
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,690
You have no idea how my mom and Zhou Quan

412
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,040
are like at home.

413
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,990
They've come up

414
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,830
with all sorts of sneaky plans

415
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,760
to win over a kid.

416
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,280
Only when I'm writing articles

417
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,520
in a cafe

418
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,310
can I have some quiet time.

419
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,530
Congratulations.

420
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,960
Now, you're living

421
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,150
a traditional man's

422
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,530
traditional family life.

423
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,310
You don't go home when you're off work.

424
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,910
You say you're working late when you're asked.

425
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,920
The only difference is that men sit in their cars,

426
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,980
while you sit in a cafe.

427
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,170
Can you stop making fun of me?

428
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,030
Why don't you give me some advice?

429
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,350
You're asking the right person for help.

430
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,100
Yeah, right.

431
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,750
The downsides of being an irritated woman are showing now.

432
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,630
You've got a great idea

433
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,440
of asking me for ideas.

434
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:10,770
Yeah.

435
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,720
I put myself through terrible suffering

436
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,190
in exchange for this article

437
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,390
that's been viewed 100 thousand times.

438
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,270
Well, why don't you suffer a bit more

439
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:21,850
and write a speech?

440
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,630
Ms. Meng,

441
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,110
can't you show a bit

442
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,620
of your human side to me?

443
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,520
I can't. Just write it.

444
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,280
Let me turn on

445
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,370
the laptop for you.

446
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,290
Hurry up and get it done.

447
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,540
Tired, aren't you?

448
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,110
During these days,

449
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,650
the red flower stamp competition

450
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,540
has worn me and your mom out.

451
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,430
At first,

452
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,010
I thought it was just a game,

453
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,510
but your mom got more and more serious about it.

454
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,630
Seeing her like that,

455
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,200
I started taking it seriously too.

456
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,830
I want it

457
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,010
to be more than a game.

458
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,350
I hope this game

459
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,510
can prove my abilities.

460
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,080
When I'm doing my work

461
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,900
at my job,

462
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,320
I can be

463
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,340
an excellent employee.

464
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,190
When I get home,

465
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,510
I can also be an excellent

466
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,570
stay-at-home dad.

467
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:10,990
I wanna show that to your mom.

468
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,110
Besides, during this period of time,

469
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,510
through my observation of Aiwen,

470
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,600
I've found that he actually

471
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,970
has a lot of good traits,

472
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,200
in addition to some weaknesses.

473
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,080
I'll do what I can

474
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,570
to make the best of the good part,

475
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,230
and help him lose the bad part.

476
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,030
That's all.

477
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,360
I thought my idea

478
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,790
was bad.

479
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,760
I was going to ask you

480
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,830
if we should call the competition off

481
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,190
and tell mom about it.

482
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,510
No, no, no. The game must go on.

483
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,750
Honey, you're a great woman.

484
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,220
Really? Are you sure you can deal with the competition?

485
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:41,810
Yes.

486
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,270
Your mom and I can take the heat.

487
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,190
You must not collapse.

488
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,270
If you do, the whole family

489
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,830
will get in a financial crisis.

490
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,390
Why would I collapse?

491
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,900
I'm going on a business trip in a few days

492
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,030
for a forum's event.

493
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,040
You'll have to stay home

494
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,040
with my mom alone.

495
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,930
It won't be a problem, will it?

496
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,950
You are amazing.

497
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:00,990
I'm so tired.

498
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,830
Would you give me a head massage?

499
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,470
It feels good.

500
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,480
Mommy, here's a gift for you.

501
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,950
A little red flower?

502
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,560
I made this

503
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,060
with Daddy.

504
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:18,869
This is

505
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,760
for my wife, the greatest woman of all.

506
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:22,430
And also,

507
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:26,030
it's for my hardworking mommy.

508
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,750
Thank you, son.

509
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:29,650
What about me?

510
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,980
No one's gonna thank me?

511
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:31,910
Come on, let's show our gratitude to Daddy.

512
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:32,510
Together.

513
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:34,050
Perfect.

514
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,100
This is very beautiful.

515
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:53,950
Yes.

516
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:56,030
The left side of my face looks better on camera.

517
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,560
Put on more contour powder.

518
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,030
Ms. Che,

519
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,350
you're wearing light makeup today.

520
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,300
Look at the other people's makeup.

521
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,490
It's heavy.

522
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:14,800
How about I put

523
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,200
more lipstick on you?

524
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,000
What shade?

525
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,730
A redder one.

526
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,150
This is a bit too much.

527
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,250
No need for it.

528
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,270
I think the one I'm wearing is pretty.

529
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,450
Okay. Have a look then.

530
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:28,400
What else can I help with?

531
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,460
Nothing. All is fine.

532
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,060
Thank you.

533
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,040
You're welcome.

534
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,660
Can you make the hair on the top

535
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,540
puffier

536
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,820
to better suit the shape of my face?

537
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,440
Sure.

538
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,390
Get me my water.

539
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:08,490
Honey,

540
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,590
shouldn't you be giving a speech now?

541
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,590
Is it already over?

542
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,110
It hasn't started yet.

543
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,510
I'm so nervous.

544
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,630
You shouldn't be.

545
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,800
My wife is the best.

546
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,720
Pretty, too.

547
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:18,430
Show me our son.

548
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,590
Mommy, look.

549
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,470
What's that about?

550
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:33,350
Isn't it too much for our place?

551
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:34,950
Aiwen wants to go camping.

552
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,680
This is just a little practice.

553
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,520
What do you think?

554
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,340
This is the smallest model.

555
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,140
It looks good.

556
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,380
Ms. Che,

557
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,270
you need to be in the waiting area now.

558
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,850
Let me take you there.

559
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,050
Okay. I need to go now.

560
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:45,830
Bye bye.

561
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,460
Bye bye.

562
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,510
Bye bye.

563
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,790
Ms. Che, this way.

564
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:49,350
Okay.

565
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,300
If it rains, this window

566
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,400
will cause trouble.

567
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,750
The rain will get through it, right?

568
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,310
Yes.

569
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,640
Shall we have fried squid

570
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,070
for dinner?

571
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:58,470
Okay.

572
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,150
Here it is.

573
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,020
Hello?

574
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:02,740
Fried squid is ready.

575
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,470
I'm home.

576
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,150
Aiwen is home too.

577
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,390
You're right outside my home?

578
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,090
I knew you'd get it done.

579
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,550
I love it. Thank you!

580
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,790
Aiwen, thank Uncle

581
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,080
for buying you a present.

582
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:17,770
Thank you.

583
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:18,190
What?

584
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:18,950
Didn't you promise to reimburse me?

585
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:19,670
And you believed it?

586
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,600
You're a rich man

587
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,820
while I'm just a stay-at-home dad.

588
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,480
You wanna be mean to me or what?

589
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,420
It took me a great effort to get you this.

590
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,310
I had to snatch it

591
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,440
from the boss's son.

592
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:28,090
Is that true?

593
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:28,680
You bet it is.

594
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,940
You're so aggressive.

595
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,590
Turn around and ride over there.

596
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:31,990
Give it a try.

597
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,710
Ride to that side.

598
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:34,070
But don't go any farther.

599
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,670
Okay.

600
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,650
Nice.

601
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,580
He's quickly adapting to it.

602
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,180
Very good.

603
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,720
Amazing.

604
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,750
Come back when you hit that side.

605
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,470
Okay.

606
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,190
How have you been?

607
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,070
Miserable.

608
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,150
Miserable?

609
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,770
Tell me about it.

610
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:53,770
I want to know how miserable you are.

611
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:54,970
I have finally realized

612
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,190
how difficult it was

613
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:56,920
for my wife and mother-in-law.

614
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,630
One has to mind a lot of trivial stuff when taking care of a child.

615
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,150
It's fine.

616
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,670
Aren't you good at solving challenges?

617
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,670
But this is a whole different field.

618
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,950
I'm not sure if I can handle it.

619
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:05,880
It beats me, but I have to continue.

620
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,750
My wife makes more money than I do.

621
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:08,830
For the time being,

622
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,390
I can't find a suitable job.

623
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,190
Be careful! Turn around and come back!

624
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,320
Come back! Or you'll be facing stairs!

625
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:16,970
It's just hard.

626
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,050
I think your wife got that big break

627
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,270
just because she had good luck.

628
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,000
She's lucky.

629
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,890
You shouldn't take it seriously.

630
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,910
It's not like that. She's really good.

631
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,570
Plus, sometimes,

632
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,540
having good luck is more important than being capable.

633
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,510
Aren't you also lucky?

634
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:29,630
You have me as a friend.

635
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,270
Yes, that's right.

636
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:30,990
You also got me that motorcycle.

637
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:32,070
Yeah.

638
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,910
Many thanks for the wonderful speech

639
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,260
brought by the queen of air conditioners.

640
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:38,830
Next up,

641
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:39,970
we'll be joined by

642
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,030
another brilliant speaker.

643
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,870
She has attracted a lot of attention

644
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,150
[Spotlight: Women with Sophistication and Charm]

645
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,550
as a best-selling author,

646
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,790
a blog writer,

647
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:49,290
and an elite woman who excels in

648
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,750
balancing home life and career.

649
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,680
Now, let's give a round of applause

650
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,680
to Ms. Cherry

651
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,890
and invite her to share her thoughts.

652
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,520
Good afternoon, everyone.

653
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,290
I am Cherry.

654
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,450
I...

655
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,750
I'm really nervous right now.

656
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:12,670
I-I actually wrote a script

657
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:13,330
for this speech.

658
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,330
I put a lot of effort into it

659
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:16,260
and wrote several thousand words.

660
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,150
But now I-I-I...

661
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,070
I can't remember a single word.

662
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,280
Well, if you would kindly lend an ear,

663
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,230
I'll share with you

664
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,090
a recent story in my life.

665
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,000
A couple of months ago,

666
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,740
I was a stay-at-home mother

667
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,360
and an online writer.

668
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,090
My husband was a programmer.

669
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,470
He was busy at work.

670
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,950
But now,

671
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:40,830
he is a stay-at-home dad,

672
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,150
while I've started building a business.

673
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,470
So, for now,

674
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,280
I have to leave him in charge

675
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,750
of the whole housekeeping and parenting stuff.

676
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,890
Of course, I embraced myself

677
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,130
for his complaints.

678
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,790
What I didn't expect was,

679
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,120
some time ago, he told me

680
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:57,990
that he didn't regret making

681
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,590
this decision with me.

682
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,120
He isn't worried or nervous

683
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:01,960
because

684
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,670
he still has chances to make money in the future

685
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:05,710
and he feels the need

686
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,110
to spend time with our son

687
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,320
before the little guy grows up.

688
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,280
Mothers tend to

689
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,950
tell their children

690
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,320
not to do this or that,

691
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,980
while fathers might

692
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,160
communicate with the children

693
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,280
in a different way.

694
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,590
Not long ago, my son

695
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:22,270
saw my husband drinking coffee

696
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,670
and he insisted on having some.

697
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,430
Being faced with that,

698
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,180
I would tell my son

699
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:25,970
that he couldn't drink it,

700
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,060
and then I'd reason with him,

701
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,170
explaining why he couldn't.

702
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,570
He could cry all he wanted

703
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:30,610
but there's no way I would

704
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,070
let him drink black coffee.

705
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:32,950
But here's

706
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,490
how my husband dealt with it.

707
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,150
He looked at our son and asked,

708
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,710
"Do you really want to drink it?

709
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,550
I'm telling you,

710
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,230
this doesn't taste good.

711
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,960
You still wanna try it, right?"

712
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,070
Our son nodded.

713
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,750
Then he took a big sip.

714
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,340
He pursed his lips and cried,

715
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,940
saying, "This is so bitter!"

716
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,800
From then on,

717
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,190
he has never made the same request

718
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:50,430
to my husband again.

719
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:53,600
Also, thanks to what my husband did, our son didn't cry.

720
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:54,870
Anyway,

721
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,550
today,

722
00:23:56,850 --> 00:23:58,800
what I most want to share with you

723
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,830
is my respect for my husband,

724
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,500
and my deepest gratitude

725
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,680
for what he has done for me in recent days.

726
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,670
I think of it

727
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,670
as the most useful and wonderful gift I've received

728
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,160
in this year.

729
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,730
Certainly,

730
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,200
I won't just leave him

731
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,830
with all the responsibilities.

732
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,120
A child's growth

733
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,400
requires the participation

734
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,350
of both parents.

735
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,710
I've decided, after this talk,

736
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,170
I'll go home

737
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,870
and spend some quality time with my son.

738
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:26,860
Thank you.

739
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:38,900
Honey,

740
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,540
why aren't you returning my calls?

741
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,030
I want a video chat with our son.

742
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,290
What are you doing now?

743
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:50,230
Hello, Meng Feifei.

744
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,140
Judging from your tone,

745
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,230
you must've done a good job, right?

746
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,310
Not really.

747
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,850
I forgot my speech when I got on the stage.

748
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,800
T-Then what happened?

749
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,490
The whole thing fell apart?

750
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:02,670
As I was on the stage,

751
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:03,350
I saw

752
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,000
so many eyes staring at me.

753
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:05,960
I was so worried.

754
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:08,020
Out of sheer desperation,

755
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,210
I could do nothing but tell them

756
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:10,670
a story about how Zhou Quan

757
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,070
takes care of our son.

758
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,190
I haven't

759
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,720
talked to Zhou Quan yet.

760
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,460
That's all you shared with them?

761
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,830
The audience liked it, I guess,

762
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,490
because when I got off the stage,

763
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,390
a crowd surrounded me and asked for autographs

764
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,710
or to take photos with me.

765
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,550
A staff member

766
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,970
stood between me and the crowd

767
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,230
as if I was a super star.

768
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,240
That's great!

769
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:33,110
Gosh!

770
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:34,990
Never have I felt

771
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,240
as grateful to Zhou Quan

772
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,720
as I do now.

773
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,970
There's something funnier.

774
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,430
That staff member even said,

775
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,110
"Ms. Che,

776
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,010
you're a celebrity now.

777
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,030
You should ask your company

778
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,610
to assign an assistant to you."

779
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:45,240
I thought to myself,

780
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,950
"what company?"

781
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:49,270
You shouldn't think it that way.

782
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,360
Now, you are

783
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,500
a popular writer.

784
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,360
It's only a matter of time

785
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,450
before you have a company and an assistant.

786
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:56,240
What are you talking about?

787
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,300
Are you suggesting

788
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,410
that I start my own company?

789
00:25:58,410 --> 00:25:59,480
Give me a break.

790
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,060
Having what I have now,

791
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,590
I think I've already hit the jackpot.

792
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,990
Starting a company is  complicated.

793
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,520
Do you think I can handle it?

794
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,410
When I first encouraged you to write novels

795
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:08,690
and blogs,

796
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,980
you also thought you couldn't handle it.

797
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,110
Now, have you changed your mind?

798
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,910
Son, look at this.

799
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,600
Your mom and your grandma

800
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,150
would never let you touch this.

801
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:27,710
But today,

802
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,440
it's time for you to be a man

803
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,370
and give it a try.

804
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,910
Here's a brief introduction.

805
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,460
Electricity

806
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,870
is transmitted through iron.

807
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:34,590
If you plug it in with your hand touching

808
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,430
this part,

809
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:36,800
you'll definitely get electrocuted.

810
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,450
Once it happens, you'll be stuck to this thing.

811
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:39,510
No one can save you.

812
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,020
Are you afraid of danger?

813
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,830
So, to avoid danger,

814
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:43,800
you should only hold this part

815
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,870
covered with plastic.

816
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:45,350
Okay?

817
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,410
When you plug it in,

818
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:46,880
do not...

819
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,720
When you feel something's blocking the plug,

820
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,660
do not put your hands

821
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,020
on this iron part.

822
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:50,850
Understood?

823
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,210
Okay. Try plugging it in.

824
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:52,920
C-Can you hold this part?

825
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,650
Are you done?

826
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:56,980
Aiwen, put it down.

827
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:58,210
Put it down now.

828
00:26:58,210 --> 00:26:59,540
Stay away from the plug,

829
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,190
got it?

830
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,790
Got it.

831
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:01,900
It's too dangerous.

832
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,400
Kids aren't supposed to touch it.

833
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,750
Mom, I'm training him

834
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,380
to

835
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,800
safely

836
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,670
use plugs.

837
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:08,310
We need to tell him

838
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,510
how these things work

839
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,510
so he won't get in danger.

840
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:11,350
Zhou Quan,

841
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,130
I'm telling you,

842
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,920
kids have no idea

843
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,180
what danger is.

844
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,500
You're letting him

845
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,760
play with the plug now.

846
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,590
What if

847
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,470
he electrocutes himself one day?

848
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,870
I'm not letting him play with the plug.

849
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:23,670
I just want him

850
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,990
to put it in the socket.

851
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,270
This way, in the future, he...

852
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,390
I've told him not to touch this part.

853
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,990
I'm gonna repeat this again.

854
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,890
Kids have no idea what danger is.

855
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,790
You are not supposed to tell him this now.

856
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,310
You...

857
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,390
To be honest, Zhou Quan,

858
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,320
since you started taking care of Aiwen,

859
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,920
you've taken him to shoot guns

860
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,430
and arrows.

861
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,250
All of those are dangerous activities.

862
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:43,050
You've even let him

863
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:44,170
ride a motorcycle.

864
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,080
Aiwen doesn't want to do any of those,

865
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,040
but you do!

866
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,070
Listen,

867
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,150
at this rate,

868
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,090
if Aiwen gets in danger,

869
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:53,200
I'll make you pay for it!

870
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,060
Okay. All done.

871
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,680
All right. Let's go.

872
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,650
Last night, Zhou Quan

873
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,160
had the kid hold a plug

874
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,380
and put it in a socket.

875
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,310
Children

876
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,260
know nothing about danger, right?

877
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,350
What if Aiwen got electrocuted?

878
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,630
Mom, everyone takes care of their children

879
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,670
in their own way.

880
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:24,440
Aiwen is a boy.

881
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,430
Zhou Quan has been

882
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,820
doing a good job taking care of him, hasn't he?

883
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,840
I'm sure he's up for it.

884
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,560
Just don't be so worried, okay?

885
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,670
Little motorcycle, my little motorcycle.

886
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:32,930
My little motorcycle.

887
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,090
My little motorcycle.

888
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:35,350
My little motorcycle.

889
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,830
Go around the circle here,

890
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,630
as if it's a cross-country ride.

891
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:43,270
Stay away from people, Aiwen.

892
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,300
Okay, Mom.

893
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,690
I'll call him later

894
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,640
and give him a reminder, all right?

895
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,510
You will soon

896
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,960
see your daughter.

897
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,430
Bye.

898
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,080
Honey,

899
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,220
you've taken Aiwen

900
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,040
to play in the courtyard, right?

901
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:03,850
What is he playing with, his motorcycle?

902
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,550
Little motorcycle, my little motorcycle.

903
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:07,030
My tiny teeny motorcycle.

904
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,570
Oh, there's one thing

905
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,960
I need to tell you about.

906
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,480
During my speech,

907
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,840
I got so nervous

908
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:14,870
that I spilled out

909
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,270
a story about our family.

910
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,860
I'm sorry that I didn't consult you

911
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,400
beforehand.

912
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:22,590
Please don't be mad.

913
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:23,790
Love you.

914
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,180
I'll be back soon.

915
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,300
Love you too, honey.

916
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,540
Keep it up, honey.

917
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,430
We'll be waiting for your return.

918
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,270
Hello?

919
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,230
Yes, I am.

920
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,430
Yeah.

921
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,070
Daddy!

922
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,250
Aiwen!

923
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,960
Are you okay?

924
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,710
Are you okay? Don't cry.

925
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,630
There, there.

926
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,350
Mom, don't...

927
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,190
Don't touch his wound.

928
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,470
Don't cry.

929
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,240
You're a grown-up!

930
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,200
Is this how you take care of a child?

931
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:24,430
Look at him!

932
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,970
How could you fail so badly?

933
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:28,950
Aiwen, Aiwen.

934
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,350
I opposed the idea of you taking care of him.

935
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,350
But who listened?

936
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,100
You were supposed

937
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,330
to focus on the kid.

938
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:37,070
Why did you have to look at your phone?

939
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:39,240
I stepped up to look after him,

940
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,250
but you guys didn't trust me!

941
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:42,950
All right. All right.

942
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:43,750
Stop yelling.

943
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,130
All this shouting

944
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,130
is bad for the kid.

945
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,760
I'm really sorry, doctor.

946
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,400
I'm sorry.

947
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,200
Just don't worry.

948
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,290
Nothing happened

949
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,770
to the kid's bones.

950
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,310
However,

951
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,750
due to his deep wound,

952
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,410
I had to give him 11 stitches.

953
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:58,490
It's normal

954
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,090
that he's crying now.

955
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,090
11 stitches?

956
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,010
Aiwen got 11 stitches!

957
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:02,770
All right. It's fine.

958
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,010
What if his face

959
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,210
is disfigured by a scar?

960
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:05,990
Keep quiet. Quiet.

961
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,600
Doctor...

962
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,890
Mom, what did the doctor say?

963
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,210
Aiwen got a big wound that required 11 stitches.

964
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,300
It will definitely leave a scar.

965
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,510
He lost so much blood.

966
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,790
My heart ached for him.

967
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,630
I wish I were the one

968
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:40,930
to suffer the pain.

969
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,360
When I was his caregiver...

970
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,590
When I took care of him,

971
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:47,460
did I ever let him

972
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,300
lose a single drop of blood?

973
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,130
Aiwen got injured

974
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,800
right after he took over!

975
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,750
Mom,

976
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,290
stop with the complaints.

977
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,260
I-I know I did wrong.

978
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:02,830
Look,

979
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,330
you don't trust me, right?

980
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:07,170
Then you come home to take care of the kid tomorrow.

981
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,210
You can't leave him

982
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,170
with Zhou Quan anymore.

983
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:10,920
Mom, can you please stop talking?

984
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,730
Just be quiet.

985
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,270
We can handle this ourselves.

986
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,400
My mind is a mess now.

987
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,770
I'm begging you to stop talking.

988
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,560
Mommy is here.

989
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,140
Mommy is here.

990
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,560
Don't move. Don't move.

991
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:52,420
Honey, I know

992
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,910
you must be feeling terrible and guilty now,

993
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:57,740
but we still

994
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:58,830
need to have a talk.

995
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,340
Let's discuss how to stop

996
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,910
such a thing from happening again.

997
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:02,590
Okay?

998
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,140
It's inevitable.

999
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,790
What should happen will happen.

1000
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:18,810
What do you mean

1001
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,980
by "what should happen"?

1002
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,570
Why is it inevitable?

1003
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:27,790
If you had kept an eye on him,

1004
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,390
he wouldn't have rushed out.

1005
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,320
Then tell me how to avoid this.

1006
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,760
Just try to be more careful.

1007
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,750
He's only five years old.

1008
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,810
How could I be possibly more careful?

1009
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,950
I've made apologies.

1010
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,460
I shouldn't have picked up the phone

1011
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,900
when the kid was playing.

1012
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,730
I was being negligent.

1013
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,550
Mom already lashed out at me.

1014
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:06,670
But do you think the kid wouldn't have fallen

1015
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,429
if I hadn't picked up the phone?

1016
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,360
He was riding a motorcycle.

1017
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,320
Was I supposed

1018
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,909
to run along with him instead of picking up a phone?

1019
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:14,310
You could've brought him to somewhere safe.

1020
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,239
A forest is safe. Is there a forest?

1021
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:16,790
Many other kids...

1022
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,409
Then just don't let him play

1023
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:18,739
such a dangerous thing.

1024
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,489
Aren't you afraid

1025
00:34:19,489 --> 00:34:20,909
that he'll become a sissy?

1026
00:34:20,909 --> 00:34:22,630
Do you have to be so unreasonable?

1027
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,929
What's dangerous about a motorcycle?

1028
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:24,469
Many kids

1029
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:24,989
play with those, don't they?

1030
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:26,120
Our son got hurt, didn't he?

1031
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,150
Yes. That's an accident.

1032
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:27,850
His forehead got injured, fine.

1033
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,110
What if it was his eyes?

1034
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:31,860
By that logic,

1035
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:32,530
chances are that a person who's sleeping at home

1036
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,380
could be run over and killed

1037
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,100
by a truck.

1038
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
How to avoid that?

1039
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,960
What else could I do?

1040
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,340
He is a boy.

1041
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,190
I admit this is a terrible outcome

1042
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,010
that has upset you and your mom.

1043
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,090
I feel scared too.

1044
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,130
But it already happened.

1045
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:46,960
Why do you have to

1046
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,440
blame me non-stop?

1047
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:49,460
Am I blaming you?

1048
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:50,060
Aren't you?

1049
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:50,989
I said in the very beginning

1050
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:51,730
that we should talk about

1051
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,880
how to avoid such a problem.

1052
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,770
Have I ever blamed you?

1053
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:54,480
That's just what you said.

1054
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,190
Yeah, but how to avoid it?

1055
00:34:56,210 --> 00:34:57,190
Tell me how to avoid it.

1056
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,320
I'm also trying hard to control

1057
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:58,990
my own emotions.

1058
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,570
Don't you just want me to

1059
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,330
admit I was wrong?

1060
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,130
I've admitted it. Isn't it enough?

1061
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,380
I'm not asking you to admit your mistake.

1062
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,020
Can it help with anything?

1063
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,410
-What's the point of that?
-Then how to avoid such things?

1064
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:06,630
Tell me how to avoid such a problem.

1065
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:08,230
Just keep a closer eye on him!

1066
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,150
But how?

1067
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:10,070
Am I gonna chain him

1068
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:10,830
to my waist?

1069
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,690
When you were taking care of him,

1070
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:12,670
didn't he get hurt as well?

1071
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,510
Did he ever get so severely injured?

1072
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:15,340
No. That's because you didn't...

1073
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:16,590
And I'm just a woman!

1074
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,980
I could keep him safe

1075
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,140
but you can't?

1076
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,390
I can't.

1077
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,490
So I'm not suited

1078
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,320
for this job.

1079
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,220
That's what you're saying now, huh?

1080
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:28,870
We made this decision

1081
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:29,630
together after discussion.

1082
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:29,910
Yes.

1083
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,070
We did agree on that.

1084
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:31,940
But in the past,

1085
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,890
when something happened to the kid

1086
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,190
under your watch,

1087
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,180
I never blamed you like this.

1088
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,450
Did I blame you?

1089
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,880
Che Li, half of the reason

1090
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,040
that I took this job stems from my support for your work.

1091
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,970
I like it when you

1092
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,300
happily

1093
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,080
prove your personal value in the society.

1094
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,350
But if you...

1095
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,050
Hello.

1096
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,510
Yes, I am.

1097
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,030
Okay. Sure.

1098
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:58,610
Well,

1099
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,780
please send me the address then.

1100
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,730
Hang it up!

1101
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:02,310
Okay, okay.

1102
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:03,740
Sorry.

1103
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,970
I'm in the middle of something.

1104
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,090
Just send me the address.

1105
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,770
Okay, thank you.

1106
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,260
What do you mean by supporting me?

1107
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,190
You were sacked from your job, weren't you?

1108
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,910
We're playing different roles in the family now.

1109
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:15,910
I go out to work,

1110
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:16,790
while you stay home with the kid.

1111
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,520
You call that "supporting me"?

1112
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,430
What else are we supposed to do?

1113
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,360
Whatever you say is justified.

1114
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,560
You are always right.

1115
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,650
I'll have to stay behind you forever,

1116
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:28,920
following and serving you.

1117
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,490
Really?

1118
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,830
I spent five years

1119
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:32,670
being a stay-at-home mother.

1120
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,200
Wasn't I also supporting you?

1121
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,470
Was I unable to find a job?

1122
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,870
Was I born with that duty?

1123
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,950
Could you have found a job?

1124
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:38,610
Couldn't I?

1125
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,050
Didn't I have a job in the past?

1126
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:42,070
What nonsense are you talking about?

1127
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:42,990
I didn't have a job?

1128
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:43,860
Tell me about it.

1129
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,830
Did you resign?

1130
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:45,610
At least I didn't

1131
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:46,610
get fired.

1132
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,770
I quit it myself.

1133
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,080
Good for you!

1134
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,310
I will prove to you

1135
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:56,310
that I can find a better job.

1136
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:57,990
Che Li,

1137
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,360
the kid will be your responsibility from now on.

1138
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,400
Why?

1139
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:34,250
[Outpatient Dept.]

1140
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,680
You're awake, son.

1141
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:55,640
Does it hurt?

1142
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,620
I can cope with it.

1143
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:01,120
Aiwen, you're amazing.

1144
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:02,600
You're so tough.

1145
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,910
If you feel pain

1146
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,220
and want to cry, just cry. It's okay.

1147
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,360
Daddy said

1148
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:12,590
men should never cry easily.

1149
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,410
You're just a little boy now.

1150
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:17,850
If you feel pain,

1151
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,190
you can cry in front of Mommy.

1152
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,910
It's okay.

1153
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,630
I'm not a little boy.

1154
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,030
I'm a man.

1155
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:26,750
Daddy said so.

1156
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,700
Yeah. That's what Daddy said.

1157
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,360
Mommy is so sorry.

1158
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,870
It's not your fault that I fell.

1159
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,450
But still, I failed

1160
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:40,780
to take good care of you.

1161
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,670
Daddy takes care of me now, right?

1162
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,540
Then it's Daddy's fault.

1163
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,260
He failed to take good care of you.

1164
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,260
He has been doing great.

1165
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,130
Where is Daddy?

1166
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,260
He went home to get something.

1167
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,920
He'll be back in a moment.

1168
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:01,990
Do you really think

1169
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,120
Daddy has been taking good care of you?

1170
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:04,710
Yes.

1171
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,030
Daddy and I have had so much fun.

1172
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,920
All we've played is men's games.

1173
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,030
I'm so happy.

1174
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,330
Mommy, I think

1175
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,970
you should praise Daddy.

1176
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,940
I should praise Daddy.

1177
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:37,080
I have a question.

1178
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,630
I'm sorry to bother you.

1179
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,820
This ointment

1180
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,490
is for the wound, right?

1181
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:44,030
I-If I put a bit more

1182
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,270
on the wound every day,

1183
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:47,270
will it prevent scars from forming?

1184
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,920
You should ask the doctor

1185
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,630
if there will be a scar.

1186
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,860
Okay. Sorry for bothering you.

1187
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:55,530
Thank you.

1188
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,250
Thank you.

1189
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,060
Mommy is my favorite.

1190
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,710
Daddy comes second.

1191
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,310
He's followed by Grandma.

1192
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,050
Didn't Grandma use to be

1193
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,190
your second favorite?

1194
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:10,910
Why is she

1195
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,370
in the third place now?

1196
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:15,430
I've been having so much fun with Daddy lately.

1197
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,800
Plus, now I can eat

1198
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,880
and sleep on my own

1199
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,930
without Grandma's help.

1200
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,110
Aiwen, listen,

1201
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,840
Mommy is happy

1202
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,000
to be your favorite,

1203
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:28,550
but

1204
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,310
what you said is wrong.

1205
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,390
You can't like someone

1206
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,830
just because they'd do certain things

1207
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:36,710
for you.

1208
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:39,050
That will make you a utilitarian.

1209
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,360
Do you know what "utilitarian" means?

1210
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,520
You don't. It's okay.

1211
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,390
You'll understand when you get older.

1212
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,030
Mommy just wants to tell you

1213
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,760
that I, your daddy

1214
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:48,730
and your grandparents

1215
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,210
all love you dearly

1216
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,400
because we are family.

1217
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,740
You should love them too.

1218
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,310
Do not try to

1219
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,640
rank them,

1220
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,060
okay?

1221
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,190
Okay.

1222
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,540
But I still like

1223
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,550
you and Daddy the best.

1224
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,740
Grandma always tells me not to

1225
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,730
do this or that.

1226
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,380
That's the way

1227
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,930
Grandma shows care for you.

1228
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:13,920
If you don't like it,

1229
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,650
you should talk to her about it.

1230
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,290
Just don't say

1231
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,750
you dislike her

1232
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,440
because she wouldn't do certain things for you.

1233
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,760
That is absolutely wrong.

1234
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,370
Right?

1235
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,230
Right.

1236
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,690
Great. Good boy.

1237
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,550
Today, Aiwen said to me,

1238
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:41,470
"Mommy,

1239
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:43,970
you should praise Daddy."
