[Episode 2]

4
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,479
I told you.

5
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm on vacation.

6
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:43,020
I haven't had one in a long time.

7
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,680
I don't care. Tomorrow…

8
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,590
The day after tomorrow at the latest,

9
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,050
I want to see that article.

10
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,680
I didn't bring my computer.

11
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,300
Are you a bossy boss too?

12
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,220
You can write

13
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,020
on your phone.

14
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:56,110
I need to spend the whole day playing with my kid.

15
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,150
Can you let me quietly

16
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,300
take a vacation?

17
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,090
I'm telling you,

18
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:00,630
you can play with your kid anytime,

19
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,200
but you don't

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,130
get chances like this all the time.

21
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,990
Post it half a month

22
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,750
before the release date, okay?

23
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,190
Fine. Stop nagging.

24
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,550
I got it.

25
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,240
Hello, Aiwen. I'm Nuomi.

26
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,820
You're friends now.

27
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,870
Alright. Let's play a game.

28
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:26,850
Come on.

29
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,700
Let's play a game.

30
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,010
One, two, three, stop.

31
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,630
One, two, three, stop.

32
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:36,460
One, two, three, stop.

33
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,600
One, two. Run!

34
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,400
You're really good with kids.

35
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,060
My son

36
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,880
has been spoiled by his grandma.

37
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,210
I don't know your name.

38
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:50,970
Che Li.

39
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,150
I'm Yu Qiaoqiao.

40
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,870
You and your mom

41
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,030
took your son here?

42
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,350
My husband came too.

43
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,220
He's sleeping.

44
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,590
Tired from the long drive yesterday.

45
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,510
My husband came too.

46
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,820
He's been working the whole morning

47
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,360
and won't

48
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,390
come out with me.

49
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,670
But it's better this way.

50
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,120
One less person to take care of.

51
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,580
Take care of him?

52
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
It's very tiring.

53
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,660
Moms can take better care

54
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,980
-of children than dads.
-Yeah.

55
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:15,480
Are you a stay-at-home mother too?

56
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,270
Yeah. You too?

57
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,430
Me too.

58
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:19,700
What a coincidence.

59
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,579
Indeed.

60
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,740
Mom.

61
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,060
Zhou Aiwen has hands.

62
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,310
I know he does.

63
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,680
But he's tired.

64
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,640
So are his hands.

65
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,740
Opening his mouth is tiring too.

66
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,780
You might as well chop it up.

67
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,790
Chewing is also tiring.

68
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,520
Yeah.

69
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,780
Mrs. Zhou.

70
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,430
Hello.

71
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,590
You came too.

72
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,510
Yeah.

73
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,030
Where's Nuomi's dad?

74
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,480
Still working.

75
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,280
He hasn't left the room all day.

76
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,910
Then why don't you join us?

77
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,000
No. We don't want to disturb you.

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,530
It's okay.

79
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,750
This is my husband, Zhou Quan.

80
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,550
This is my mom.

81
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,680
Hello.

82
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,930
Say hi

83
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:55,900
to them.

84
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,670
Hi.

85
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,220
Hello.

86
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,290
Come on. Join us.

87
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,590
Honey, go get a chair.

88
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:00,940
Okay.

89
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,030
Thank you.

90
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:02,780
It's nothing.

91
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,380
Excuse me.

92
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,390
Thank you.

93
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:05,870
Sit.

94
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,100
Come on. Sit here.

95
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,830
-What if she beats him?
-Waiter.

96
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:09,590
Please give me

97
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:11,060
another set of children's cutlery.

98
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,060
-Okay. Please wait a moment.
-Okay.

99
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,950
She's a bit tired from playing for so long.

100
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,380
Yeah.

101
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,720
She looks tired.

102
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,610
Nuomi is great.

103
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,860
Look at Nuomi.

104
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,810
She's eating by herself.

105
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:26,270
He can eat by himself.

106
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,110
What are you doing?

107
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,680
Come on. Open your mouth.

108
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,450
Hey.

109
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,750
This is my husband, Li Jian.

110
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,810
Hello.

111
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:37,430
Hello.

112
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,640
Che Li, Zhou Quan.

113
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,020
Aiwen's grandma.

114
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,000
Nice to see you.

115
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,100
Hello.

116
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,670
Join us.

117
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,550
Yeah, join us.

118
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,640
They've joined us.

119
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:45,900
That seems such an imposition.

120
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,790
Not at all.

121
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,510
It's fine. Come on.

122
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,520
We wanted to try everything and ordered

123
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,180
many dishes.

124
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,740
We can't finish them anyway.

125
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,760
Come on. Have a seat.

126
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,280
Come on.

127
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,900
Sorry for disturbing you.

128
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,460
Not at all.

129
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,120
It's okay.

130
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,159
My whole family is here to freeload.

131
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,690
It's okay.

132
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,910
Help yourself.

133
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:03,870
Mr. Zhou,

134
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:04,890
what do you do for work?

135
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,090
I'm an IT technician.

136
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,340
The IT industry is great.

137
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,140
It's booming.

138
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,950
He's an elite at a big company.

139
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,870
Very capable.

140
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,110
Honey, can you take this for me?

141
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,100
Hello?

142
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,700
Zhou Quan!

143
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,240
The whole company is working overtime,

144
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,260
yet you're on vacation!

145
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,660
Do you know what teamwork means?

146
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,580
It means to work hard together!

147
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,070
We don't need a bad apple

148
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,470
on our team!

149
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,190
The schedule is so tight,

150
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,340
yet you're taking a vacation.

151
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,960
Zhou Quan, I'm warning you.

152
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,730
Get your damn self

153
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,170
back to work now!

154
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,180
Watch your mouth!

155
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,190
I can't go back!

156
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,020
Hello?

157
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,030
I don't accept your apology!

158
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,250
Not ever!

159
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,310
Sorry.

160
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,760
Well, I'll go pay the bill.

161
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:05,150
Okay.

162
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,520
Let me pay.

163
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,990
Sit down. Sit down.

164
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,670
They've been working together for a long time.

165
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,430
Very close.

166
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,930
So sometimes they…

167
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:16,810
It's alright.

168
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,430
Sorry.

169
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,130
No worries.

170
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,870
Yeah. Aiwen, eat.

171
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,550
Open your mouth and eat.

172
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:24,330
I finally got to take a vacation

173
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,260
with my husband and kid.

174
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,320
Do you have to push me so hard?

175
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,050
You're a hit now!

176
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,280
It happened

177
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,220
just like I said.

178
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,409
Some of your posts

179
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,090
have more than 100,000 views.

180
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,390
I just talked to the president.

181
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,460
We'll focus our resources

182
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,090
on you from now on.

183
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,420
We'll make a big deal

184
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,880
out of your book signings.

185
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,540
Really?

186
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,620
Then, what should I do now?

187
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,750
Just wait.

188
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,030
We've arranged a book signing

189
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:48,650
tomorrow.

190
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,940
I'll pick you up in the morning.

191
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,740
Wait a second.

192
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,960
Tomorrow?

193
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:52,990
Aren't you coming back

194
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:53,790
tonight?

195
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,820
Yes, but I need time

196
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,500
to get prepared,

197
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,060
don't I?

198
00:07:58,090 --> 00:07:59,350
It's so rushed.

199
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,730
You still have more than ten hours

200
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,800
to get prepared.

201
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,380
Buck up, okay?

202
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:04,470
See you tomorrow.

203
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,130
Quick. Aiwen is not around.

204
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:15,970
Take a bite.

205
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,510
Honey.

206
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:22,140
Meng Fei called me and said…

207
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,920
I'm probably a hit now.

208
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:27,980
Your blog?

209
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,429
You guys really made it back

210
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:35,500
last night.

211
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:36,970
How was your vacation?

212
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:38,230
Not bad.

213
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,380
How do I look?

214
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:44,960
Not good enough.

215
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,500
Gosh.

216
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,560
Just a book signing.

217
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,190
I think I look alright.

218
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,610
Cherry,

219
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,720
you're no longer the person you used to be.

220
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,590
You're probably

221
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,990
reaching the peak of your career.

222
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:56,580
Can you

223
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,820
stop being so calm?

224
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,650
Well,

225
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,250
get pumped!

226
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,440
Why are you so excited?

227
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:04,510
Just one post with over 100,000 views.

228
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:06,120
How much impact can I make?

229
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,100
My god.

230
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,730
That's an understatement.

231
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,460
Do you know how hard

232
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,660
it is to write a viral post like that now?

233
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,660
My bad.

234
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,270
I should've reminded you

235
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,670
to dress up a bit more formally.

236
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,130
There will be press later.

237
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,200
Press?

238
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,140
More than ten media outlets.

239
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,640
You mean,

240
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,550
besides signing my name,

241
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,750
I have to talk, right?

242
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,390
Yes.

243
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,140
What do you mean?

244
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,630
Signing is okay,

245
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,240
but talking will make me nervous.

246
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,800
Just talk normally.

247
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,620
Normally…

248
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,610
So should I keep

249
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,200
a smile on my face?

250
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:39,970
What kind of state

251
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,330
should I be in?

252
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,430
You're making me

253
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,500
nervous, really.

254
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,840
Calm down. It's okay.

255
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:45,940
You got it.

256
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,430
Yang.

257
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,330
I'm sorry, but I need you

258
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:53,590
to cover for me a little longer.

259
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,470
The thing is, my mother-in-law

260
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,950
and my son both have a fever.

261
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:57,510
My wife

262
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,310
has a very important meeting today.

263
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,570
So I can't come to work.

264
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,660
Quan, what's wrong with you?

265
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,040
Let me tell you.

266
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,280
Lyu has talked

267
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,630
to me several times today.

268
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:07,620
Come back soon.

269
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,210
I'm barely holding on.

270
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:10,230
Yang.

271
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,160
To think you called him obedient, capable,

272
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:14,620
and enthusiastic about work.

273
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,350
He was in charge

274
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,150
of several

275
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,680
big projects before.

276
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,750
He did a good job.

277
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,420
He was about to get promoted.

278
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,960
Promote someone like him?

279
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,520
Have you considered

280
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,210
how his behavior

281
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,230
will influence the young employees?

282
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,070
Don't worry.

283
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,060
I've told Ding

284
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,210
how to solve

285
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,610
all the potential problems.

286
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,150
He can handle them.

287
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,680
My presence

288
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,270
is not necessary.

289
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,100
With so much going on at home,

290
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,340
my family really needs me.

291
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,600
Do me a favor, will you?

292
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,650
I know

293
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,010
you'd come if you could.

294
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,330
But I have to

295
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:46,550
make it clear to you.

296
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:47,950
Lyu

297
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,790
wants to hit the ground running.

298
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,960
Don't bring trouble on yourself.

299
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,280
Let him run.

300
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:53,920
I won't

301
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,010
stand in his way.

302
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,740
Mom, drink some water.

303
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,620
Just put it there.

304
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,060
The antipyretics are here too.

305
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,030
Zhou Quan.

306
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,110
You'll be fine.

307
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:25,290
What's my temp?

308
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,300
38.5°C.

309
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,850
His is the same.

310
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,200
His temp is also 38.5°C.

311
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:33,870
Well…

312
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,580
Don't worry, Mom.

313
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,630
I'm not going to work today.

314
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,720
I'll stay at home,

315
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,770
cooking for you.

316
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,520
You have to go to work.

317
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,200
It's okay.

318
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,910
I've asked for leave.

319
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,640
Don't worry.

320
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,890
I-I'll cook.

321
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,550
No, Mom. Just lie in bed.

322
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,240
I'll cook.

323
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,420
You have a fever now

324
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,270
and don't want a big meal, right?

325
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,510
But you can't cook at all.

326
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,350
Yeah, I can't.

327
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,780
But porridge is simple.

328
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,600
Don't worry.

329
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,020
Medicine is here.

330
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,000
So is the water.

331
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,480
Remember to drink it.

332
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,380
-I'll go cook.
-Okay.

333
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,780
-Ms. Che.
-Ms. Che.

334
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,460
Why did you use this photo?

335
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,120
I look so sentimental.

336
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,410
It's a great photo.

337
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,740
Not sentimental at all.

338
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,540
[Book Signing]

339
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:26,710
If you don't like it,

340
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,510
find a photographer

341
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,170
to take some pictures for you.

342
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:30,850
How are things inside?

343
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,700
Ms. Meng.

344
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,780
It's all set up.

345
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:33,660
Okay.

346
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,950
Let's go.

347
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,060
Let's go.

348
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,550
Pinch me.

349
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,440
Not so hard. It hurts.

350
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,330
Believe it now?

351
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:07,140
You paid

352
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,100
so many people to come.

353
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,170
How much did it cost?

354
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:12,300
The publishing house is not that rich.

355
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,560
They're all real fans.

356
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,220
They're here for you.

357
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,750
Gosh.

358
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,350
It's so sudden.

359
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,880
I told you

360
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:24,080
so many times

361
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,910
this would happen

362
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,870
to prepare you.

363
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:26,910
But I didn't expect

364
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,310
to see so many people.

365
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,450
That post of yours

366
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,570
got more than

367
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,860
100,000 views overnight.

368
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,150
Your blog has gone viral,

369
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,150
and your book

370
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,390
is selling very well on all platforms.

371
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,500
I've said it many times,

372
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,190
haven't I?

373
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,100
Are you hot?

374
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,380
Why am I feeling so hot?

375
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,460
You should feel hot.

376
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,660
You should've gotten excited long ago.

377
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,660
Then what…

378
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,190
what should I do now?

379
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:51,880
Go on stage.

380
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,510
Now?

381
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,210
Go on stage.

382
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,340
What should I say?

383
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,710
Wait. I…

384
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,230
Ms. Cherry.

385
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,180
Did the things in your book

386
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,040
really happen?

389

Yes, my son is very naughty.

395
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,670
I received an email last night.

396
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,610
The client needed

397
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:19,340
a last-minute feature change.

398
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,510
I've updated the data structure

399
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,550
and interfaces

400
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,110
and uploaded the documentation and code.

401

402
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:28,970
Ms. Cherry, I want to know

to write things.

405
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,570
My son is the same age as your son.

You need to refine

408
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:38,570
the business logic a bit more.

409
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:39,000
Keep it up.

410
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,190
We're in the final sprint.

Tell the boys to do their best.

412
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,380
I'll buy everyone dinner after it.

How much did you pay them to come?

442
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:06,940
I also thought

-Don't be late.

509
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,110
Great. It just ended.

00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,030
I need to ask her.

511
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:02,070

00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,100
Why go through all this trouble?

536
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,910

Yes.

00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,220
Come on. Take a seat.

560

Come on.

Can I sit here?

565
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,240
You must sit here.

566
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,300
-It is your seat.
-Okay. Then I'll take it.

567
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,080
Just take it.

Okay. Everyone, sit down.

Here's the thing.

571

To celebrate

572
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,830
your achievement,

573
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,720
I specially designed

574
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,950
three dishes for you.

575
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,140
Take a look.

576
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,520

Up the Ladder.

578
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,160
It means

579
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,890
your blog will get

580
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,280
more and more readers

581
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,560
and reach a higher level.

582
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,280
Great! Great!

583
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,870
Thank you.

584
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,980
Look at the second dish.

585
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,910
The second dish:

586
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,420
Harvest.

587
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,710
It means that every book

588
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,970
you write in the future

589
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,720
will be a bestseller!

590
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:44,730
Great!

591
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,110
Amazing!

592
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,370
This last dish

593
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,260
has the deepest meaning.

594
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,580
It's bright red.

595
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,740
It's called On Fire.

596
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,150
Think about it.

597
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,110
In our publishing house,

598
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:57,030
you've cut

599
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,430
a stunning figure.

600
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,150
We all firmly believe that

601
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,450
with you on our team,

602
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:02,840
our publishing house

603
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:04,900
will thrive

604
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,990
and become the top in the industry.

605
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,550
Ms. Liu is so thoughtful.

606
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,210
It's so meaningful, isn't it?

607
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,120
Dear colleagues,

608
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,390
fill your glasses.

609
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,220
Come on. Let us

610
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,250
raise a toast to Ms. Che.

611
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,260
Congratulations on her bestselling book.

612
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,730
Bestseller!

613
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,940
Bestseller!

614
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:29,190
Thank you very much.

615
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,350
Bestseller.

616
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,100
Sit down.

617
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:41,370
Che.

618
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,270
Let's have a drink.

619
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,940
Okay.

620
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,430
I want to

621
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,440
formally apologize to you.

622
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,780
I want to apologize to you on behalf of Meng.

623
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,170
Everyone here knows that

624
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,270
Meng

625
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,430
just came back from abroad

626
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,780
and signed you

627
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:02,150
when she was still a rookie.

628
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,680
She's so inexperienced,

629
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:04,870
making you waste

630
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,290
two years.

631
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,880
I'm really sorry.

632
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,190
But luckily,

633
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:11,420
the cream always rises to the top.

634
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,890
Look at you now.

635
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,910
You're shining brightly, aren't you?

636
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,120
Yes.

637
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,360
I really feel happy

638
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,270
for you.

639
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,690
But at the same time,

640
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:25,200
I have some regrets.

641
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,510
If back then, I…

642
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:29,360
Right?

643
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,500
Forget it.

644
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,060
Here's to you.

645
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,310
Regrets?

646
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,350
What regrets?

647
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,340
Are you feeling sorry for me?

648
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:42,180
I don't have any regrets.

649
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,420
Actually, I feel very lucky.

650
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,030
Really.

651
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:46,900
Some of you

652
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,110
may not know

653
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:49,350
what I did for work

654
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,210
before I started writing, right?

655
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:52,390
For years,

656
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,880
I've been a stay-at-home mother.

657
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,080
I write

658
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,240
because I love writing.

659
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,230
After my kid got older,

660
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,960
I wrote

661
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,100
to kill time.

662
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,310
I just randomly wrote stuff

663
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,500
and posted it online.

664
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,180
Then Meng Fei noticed me.

665
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,700
What do you think, Ms. Che?

666
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,750
This publishing house

667
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,500
is not bad.

668
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,030
I used to work at a newspaper.

669
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,370
I know this publishing house.

670
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:12,970
Thank you.

671
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,340
Actually, I'm here today

672
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,410
to thank you.

673
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:18,850
You called me so many times

674
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,910
and like what I wrote so much.

675
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:21,880
I'm really glad.

676
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,070
Also, I want to ask you.

677
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,590
The things I wrote

678
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,020
just have several hundred views.

679
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:29,910
Sometimes the comments

680
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:30,980
are less than ten.

681
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,720
Why do you think I have potential?

682
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,020
Ms. Che, I'm single.

683
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,440
But I find

684
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,900
your articles about married life

685
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,960
very heartwarming

686
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:41,810
and touching.

687
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,510
I'm even a bit curious

688
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,150
about marriage now.

689
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:45,920
Really?

690
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:46,620
Yes.

691
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,380
Such good articles

692
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,840
should have more readers.

693
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,350
The reason why they don't have

694
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,680
many views and comments

695
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,370
is that you don't know

696
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,680
how to promote.

697
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:57,320
I never thought about that.

698
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:59,040
That's what I can do for you.

699
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,300
In this publishing house,

700
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,960
I'm just an assistant editor,

701
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,590
a rookie,

702
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,590
a novice.

703
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,380
I hope you can trust me.

704
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:06,760
If you're willing,

705
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,030
you'll be

706
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:08,920
my first author

707
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,050
and also my most important

708
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:10,920
author.

709
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,110
Let's work hard together.

710
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,940
-I hope more people…
-Sorry.

711
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,740
Hello, Mom.

712
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,140
I heard it.

713
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,640
I've only been out for an hour.

714
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,900
I need to meet someone.

715
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:27,920
I know he wants me back.

716
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:28,940
Stop yelling.

717
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,480
I'll be right back.

718
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,590
You're single and don't have kids,

719
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:34,550
so you don't know

720
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,480
that being a mom

721
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:36,590
means focusing all your energy

722
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,530
on your kid. I have no choice.

723
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,440
I understand.

724
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:41,400
So thank you very much,

725
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:43,630
but let me think about it.

726
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,470
Think it over.

727
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,570
Thank you, Meng.

728
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,330
You really need to believe in

729
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,050
your own talent.

730
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:48,850
Your articles

731
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,160
-are all well-written.
-I have talent,

732
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,370
but I may not have time.

733
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,950
Your writing is delicate

734
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,350
and very sharp.

735
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,230
Let's talk another time.

736
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:56,350
I really have to go.

737
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:56,820
Okay.

738
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,350
I won't keep you.

739
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,280
Thank you, Meng.

740
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:00,590
Bye.

741
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,500
Bye.

742
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,550
At first, I didn't believe at all

743
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,790
that I could do this.

744
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,140
It's been three years, right?

745
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,160
For three years,

746
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,600
she's encouraged me

747
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:11,430
and helped me.

748
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,390
We work together a lot

749
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,010
and are close friends now.

750
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,170
We rarely say

751
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,440
sentimental things to each other.

752
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,730
It feels pretentious.

753
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:21,620
But today,

754
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,680
at the celebration Ms. Liu prepared

755
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,410
and with the president's wine,

756
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,240
I want to

757
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,530
propose a toast to you.

758
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,060
Come on.

759
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,900
Here's to you.

760
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,460
Thank you.

761
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:34,680
Without you,

762
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,490
I wouldn't be where I am today.

763
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,030
To me, you're

764
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,260
irreplaceable.

765
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:40,590
Thank you.

766
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:42,970
I'll finish it.

767
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,090
It's okay.

768
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,250
I don't drink often.

769
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,380
Ms. Che.

770
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,040
Let me

771
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,910
drink to you.

772
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:05,920
Mr…

773
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,300
You don't need to drink.

774
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,190
Thank you.

775
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,110
Thank you.

776
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,510
Dear colleagues,

777
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,510
I have two announcements.

778
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,220
First,

779
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,470
we've decided

780
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,900
to print 100,000 more copies.

781
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,990
Second,

782
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,200
we've reached an agreement

783
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,120
with Ms. Che.

784
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,430
We'll buy the copyright of her next book

785
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,520
at a high price.

786
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,510
The pressure is immense.

787
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,390
Great!

788
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,820
Mr. Yuan, where are you going?

789
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,540
Hurry back!

790
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,850
I need some fresh air.

791
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,730
We'll wait for you.

792
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,060
Okay. I'll be back soon.

793
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,700
Did you see

794
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,810
the look on her face?

795
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:13,450
Oh my god.

796
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,010
So smug.

797
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:17,720
She's just riding on Che's coattails.

798
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,650
Does she really think

799
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,960
Ms. Liu wants to steal her author?

800
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,290
She's overthinking it.

801
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:22,990
Yeah.

802
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:23,700
Che

803
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,180
is just an amateur writer.

804
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,220
She's no match for

805
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,740
our full-time writer Ruomeng.

806
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,220
She thinks too highly of herself.

807
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,020
You're right.

808
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,090
Meng Fei is too conceited

809
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,690
to know her place.

810
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,050
She didn't write the book.

811
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,130
Why is she so proud?

812
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:37,910
Exactly.

813
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,360
You saw her condescending face?

814
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:41,580
So annoying.

815
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,800
Can't believe

816
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,470
she's such a person.

817
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,780
Yeah.

818
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,430
Hey, can I use your lighter?

819
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:53,980
Thank you.

820
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,460
Ms. Liu,

821
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,080
just ignore her.

822
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:03,640
Let's see who has the last laugh.

823
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,520
Exactly. Look at the big picture.

824
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,550
At a business dinner at this hour,

825
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,510
you've either landed the deal

826
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,560
or you've failed.

827
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,970
I guess you're the former.

828
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,030
Not necessarily.

829
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,250
Maybe I'm just boring.

830
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,360
I was overhearing gossip.

831
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:38,890
What do you think?

832
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,900
What do I think?

833
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,600
I think…

834
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:51,070
In my experience,

835
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,100
when a group of people disparages someone,

836
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,890
either this person is a jerk,

837
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:59,420
or it's out of jealousy.

838
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,550
I can tell

839
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,140
they were talking about

840
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,710
a woman,

841
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:05,840
who's very likely

842
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,170
more capable than them.

843
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,500
Judging from their tone,

844
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,100
she should be good-looking.

845
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,530
So I think

846
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,820
she has every right to be proud

847
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,860
and is strong enough to handle such criticism.

848
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,100
You're a good judge of character.

849
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,340
What do you do?

850
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:28,150
I have my own business.

851
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:31,350
Tell your friend

852
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,910
to ignore their crap.

853
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,380
After all, where there's a beautiful woman,

854
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,640
there's controversy.

855
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,620
I believe

856
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,540
you know that very well.

857
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,340
Your lighter.

858
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,100
Keep it.

859
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,720
Take it as a thank-you gift

860
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,960
for your compliment.

861
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,160
I was supportive today, wasn't I?

862
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,690
Let me tell you.

863
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:11,950
I haven't drunk so much

864
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,120
in a long time.

865
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,110
Thank you.

867
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,160

868
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,200
are all

869
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,230
so tricky.

870
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,280
Now you know.

871
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,790
Most of them are just muddling along.

872
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:26,940
Working hard

873
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,420
has made me the odd one out.

874
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,430
I can't go home

875
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,790
and have to go straight to the airport, right?

876
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,310
Yes. We're out of time.

877
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,400
Oh right.

878
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,760
They added

879
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,000
Guangzhou and Wuhan.

880
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,180
Wasn't it just Beijing and Shenzhen?

881
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,740
It was so.

882
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:47,110
But you're too popular now.

883
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:48,030
Brace yourself.

884
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,090
We'll spend the next few days

885
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,690
in airports and bookstores.

886
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,240
Then how many days will we be away?

887
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,500
Two or three days more.

888
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:55,800
No way.

889
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,090
You can't do this.

890
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,510
I'm not single like you.

891
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,340
I can't just leave.

892
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,700
I have a family to take care of.

893
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,450
I know, I know.

894
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,460
Just two or three days.

895
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,050
Nothing will happen

896
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,220
in two or three days.

897
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:05,170
Okay?

898
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:06,880
I have no choice.

899
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:07,880

900

901

902

Honey, have a safe trip.

00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,060
Which one do you want to eat?

965
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,520
Here.

966
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,880
Slow down.

967
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,470
Mom, slow down.

968
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,710
Don't choke.

969
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,590
If I had known you two were sick,

970
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,500
I wouldn't have agreed

971
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,990
to be away for so long.

972
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,120
Honey, how could you?

973
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,370
You didn't say a thing about it.

974
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,430
How did you get through it?

975
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:17,760
I'm a man.

976
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,970
I had to hold on.

977
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,460
You were away for three days.

978
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,650
You know what?

979
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,990
Aiwen and I suffered for three days.

980
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,830
Zhou Quan

981
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,360
ordered takeout for us every day.

982
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:30,880
He can't cook.

983
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:31,820
Let me tell you.

984
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,650
He used the microwave oven to cook eggs

985
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,850
and ended up with eggs all over his face.

986
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,390
When he made porridge,

987
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:38,730
he almost burned a hole

988
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,500
in the pot.

989
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,060
Mom, you promised me

990
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,070
not to tell Li.

991
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,000
You promised.

992
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,490
I don't keep secrets from my daughter.

993
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,270
We tell each other everything.

994
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,880
You're total traitor material.

995
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,210
I'm living in a good era.

996
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,120
Do you expect me

997
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,240
to scold him?

998
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,350
I won't, Mom.

999
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,620
Do you know

1000
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,390
how much risk he took

1001
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,910
to ask for so many days off?

1002
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,480
His superior is tough.

1003
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:08,290
When we were at the resort,

1004
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:09,000
he called.

1005
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:09,900
You heard it.

1006
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,320
By the way,

1007
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,930
two days at the resort and now another three days.

1008
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:18,390
Will he give you a hard time after you go back?

1009
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,480
Ding keeps in touch with me.

1010
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,110
I've been

1011
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,890
helping him solve major problems.

1012
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,050
They should all know

1013
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,930
that I don't need to go to the office at all.

1014
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,700
Going to the office

1015
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,430
just to punch in

1016
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,430
and sign in

1017
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:31,750
is ridiculous.

1018
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,350
He's a modern-day Zhou Bapi.

1019
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,790
Is that your boss' name?

1020
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:37,750
Zhou Bapi

1021
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:39,850
has the same surname as us, right?

1022
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,840
We're all from the Zhou family.

1023
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,070
People surnamed Zhou

1024
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:45,670
are not necessarily family,

1025
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:46,420
Son.

1026
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,480
Anyway, I don't think

1027
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,390
men can do chores.

1028
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,230
Whether he can or not,

1029
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,590
he's taken care of you two

1030
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:55,830
for three days.

1031
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:56,510
Right, Mom?

1032
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,080
He thought

1033
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,550
it was a good opportunity for me

1034
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,980
and didn't want me to miss it

1035
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,480
because of family affairs.

1036
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,230
Can't you

1037
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,180
give him a compliment?

1038
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,300
Okay.

1039
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,920
No problem.

1040
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,590
Go ahead.

1041
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,700
Zhou Quan is really great,

1042
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,980
taking care of everything.

1043
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,410
It doesn't rhyme.

1044
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:16,410
It doesn't rhyme.

1045
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,110
You're amazing, honey.

1046
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,300
I can't believe it.

1047
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,170
You didn't tell me

1048
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,600
both of them were sick.

1049
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:33,690
Now that you're back,

1050
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,430
I can finally breathe a sigh of relief.

1051
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,120
Hurry up.

1052
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:36,880
I'm going to sleep.

1053
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,440
Tomorrow,

1054
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,900
I'm going to see Bossy Lyu.

1055
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,800
Will he

1056
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,190
give you a hard time?

1057
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,060
Of course.

1058
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,050
-It's okay.
-He's so mean.

1059
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,430
It's fine. I can just

1060
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,430
kneel down to him.

1061
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,820
I can lose my dignity

1062
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,680
to provide for my family,

1063
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,160
buy my wife designer bags,

1064
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,910
and give my child a comfortable life.

1065
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:53,710
It's alright.

1066
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:55,080
Lose your dignity

1067
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,550
for a designer bag?

1068
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,240
I won't allow it.

1069
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:57,900
Besides,

1070
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,880
I can buy designer bags myself.

1071
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,160
They paid me for what I wrote.

1072
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,060
Just a little money.

1073
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,010
Use it as pocket change.

1074
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:03,470
Buy some snacks for the kid

1075
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,390
or some cosmetics for yourself.

1076
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:07,300
If you put it that way,

1077
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:09,950
there's something

1078
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:11,100
I need to show you.

1079
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,930
Turn to the third page.

1080
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,260
I planned

1081
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:33,380
to sign it and make it official

1082
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,530
before telling you.

1083
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,720
The publishing house is willing to pay 300,000 yuan

1084
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,720
for the copyright of my book.

1085
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,310
Do you think this is just pocket change?

1086
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:43,320
300,000…

1087
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,220
Yuan?

1088
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,440
What else could it be?

1089
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,070
What?

1090
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:53,130
What's that face?

1091
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,110
My contract!

1092
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:54,940
Don't crumple it.

1093
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,340
It's money.

1094
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,240
What's wrong? Aren't you happy?

1095
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:00,470
I can't face it.

1096
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:01,330
Tell me I'm amazing.

1097
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,050
Am I amazing?

1098
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:02,930
Amazing.

1099
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:03,930
What's wrong with you?

1100
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,560
Aren't you happy?

1101
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,990
-I'm happy.
-You're jealous of me.

1102
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,460
You're jealous of me, aren't you?

1103
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,140
Yes.

1104
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,560
Yes.

1105
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,060
Am I amazing?

1106
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,370
Give me a compliment.

1107
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,330
You're amazing.

1108
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:16,110
So amazing.

1109
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,360
Yang.

1110
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:27,900
Hey.

1111
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,780
Why is it so quiet today?

1112
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,240
They're having a meeting.

1113
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:33,490
Ding is speaking?

1114
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,240
Ding is running the meeting today.

1115
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,790
He runs meetings now?

1116
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:44,180
I went on vacation.

1117
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,910
How did Lyu find it out?

1118
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:47,030
You told him?

1119
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:48,630
Gosh.

1120
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,470
What are you

1121
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,630
thinking?

1122
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,050
I'm thinking about work.

1123
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:53,250
Enough. Cut the crap.

1124
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:54,820
You've been absent for 5 days.

1125
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,680
Shouldn't you explain yourself?

1126
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:07,500
What are you doing?

1127
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,670
Sorry.

1128
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:10,220
I didn't want to wake you up.

1129
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,480
I was not sleeping.

1130
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,110
How can I sleep at work?

1131
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,060
I was thinking.

1132
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,230
Sorry that I interrupted your thought.

1133
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:19,910
Zhou Quan.

1134
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,400
Aren't you quite tough?

1135
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:24,170
No, no.

1136
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,000
Sorry that I talked back.

1137
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,830
It was a reflex.

1138
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:28,650
I wasn't thinking

1139
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:29,570
about you at that time.

1140
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,410
You know what?

1141
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,150
In just a few days,

1142
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,890
we finished a big project.

1143
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,350
It has nothing to do with you.

1144
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,630
Why are you here now?

1145
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,280
I came to apologize.

1146
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,110
You came empty-handed?

1147
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,090
I bought something online.

1148
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,420
It'll arrive tomorrow.

1149
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:45,740
Zhou Quan!

1150
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,140
You abandoned your post

1151
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,330
and want to bribe your superior.

1152
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,310
If you dare to do that,

1153
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,710
I'll fire you right away.

1154
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,210
First of all, it's not a bribe.

1155
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,230
I just think maybe

1156
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:56,920
I hurt your feelings,

1157
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,390
so I bought you gifts to make it up to you.

1158
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,500
Just some snacks.

1159
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,220
I didn't abandon my post.

1160
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,090
I was supposed to take a few days off.

1161
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:03,920
You asked us to work overtime

1162
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,820
at the last minute.

1163
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:05,820
I have my own life.

1164
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,200
The way you put it

1165
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,500
makes me feel guilty.

1166
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,440
How about this, Zhou Quan?

1167
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:21,850
Go back to work.

1168
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,960
I'll reflect on my mistake.

1169
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,630
Don't be guilty. I…

1170
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,410
I shouldn't have said that.

1171
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,790
My bad.

1172
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,570
My bad.

1173
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,750
My bad, my bad.

1174
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,600
My bad, my bad.

1175
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,020
Quan.

1176
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,310
How was your vacation?

1177
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,590
Who told you

1178
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,800
I went on vacation?

1179
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,030
Ding.

1180
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,810
The whole company knows.

1181
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:57,950
Ding.

1182
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,420
You told the whole company

1183
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,750
that I went on vacation?

1184
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,150
No.

1185
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:03,550
How was your vacation?

1186
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,480
Did you have fun?

1187
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,960
You must be tired.

1188
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:09,110
It's fine.

1189
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:10,050
Well,

1190
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:12,280
you haven't taken a vacation for a year, right?

1191
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,460
It's good that you got to

1192
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,720
take your kid on a trip.

1193
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,020
Alright then.

1194
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:19,530
Prepare

1195
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,570
a progress report

1196
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:22,120
and send it to me later.

1197
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:25,270
Zhou, I didn't get a chance to tell you.

1198
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,090
Mr. Lyu has let me

1199
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:27,990
take charge of

1200
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:28,990
the previous project.

1201
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,580
So you're not my superior now.

1202
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,110
I don't need to report to you

1203
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:33,090
or give you

1204
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,670
a progress report.

1205
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:52,150
Ding.

1206
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:55,200
While I was away,

1207
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:57,710
what exactly happened?

1208
00:42:59,030 --> 00:42:59,750
Nothing much.
