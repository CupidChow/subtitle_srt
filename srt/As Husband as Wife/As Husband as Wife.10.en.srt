00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,150
What about the one in the north?

5
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,420
It's a bit far, but...

6
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,539
The billboard？

7
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,390
Okay, okay, I got it.

8
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,560
I'll try to find one with parking spaces.

9
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,390
It's settled then.

10
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,030
Bye.

11
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,210
What's wrong? Not going well?

12
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,240
Either it's too far,

13
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,380
lacks parking spaces,

14
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:11,970
isn't convenient enough,

15
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,360
or it's too expensive.

16
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,970
Why don't you ask Yuan Yi?

17
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,480
He has resources in this area.

18
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,390
I've already bothered him enough.

19
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,460
If I ask him for help again,

20
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,720
I'd feel embarrassed.

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,600
Why don't you let Meng Fei talk to him?

22
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,470
Meng Fei and Yuan Yi

23
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,270
have fallen out with each other.

24
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,790
Meng Fei is very stubborn.

25
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:27,620
She definitely won't take the initiative

26
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,590
to go to Yuan Yi.

27
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,680
I'll talk to him.

28
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:34,710
I have Yuan Yi's other WeChat contact.

29
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:36,980
You see?

30
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:40,500
Being the ex-brother-in-law is still the best.

31
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,420
You're familiar with him

32
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,730
and he listens to you.

33
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,540
-You're being sour.
-Right?

34
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,630

35
00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:55,360
Mom, didn't we agree on ten o'clock?

36
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,400
It's not ten yet.

37
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,950
Okay, okay, I'll wait for your news.

38
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,280
I'll wait for your news.

39
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,340
After I meet this person,

40
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,140
I will report back to you right away

41
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,440
about how it went, okay?

42
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,040

43
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,990
there won't be any problems.

I thought I should be more formal too.

52
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,050
I can't lose my presence.

53
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,910
It's too formal.

It feels like our home

55
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,740
is in a manor.

56
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,430
Besides, you're betraying me like this.

57
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,170
If you dress like this,

58
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,950
I need to go put on a tie.

59
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:29,710

You don't need to bother with that.

62
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,670
Then, then how about this?

63
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,829
I'll take this off.

64
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:34,710
Is this better?

65
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,630
It's much better like this.

66
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,030
Yeah.

English speech courses

120
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,550

with three adults and one child,

140
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,230
there should be at least four dishes and one soup.

141
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,909
The dishes are all

142
00:05:38,909 --> 00:05:39,909
carefully selected by me.

developing good living habits

154
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,080
is the only way to establish a healthy biological clock.

155
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,990
This is good for both children and adults.

156
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,640
By the way,

157
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,340
I also have

160
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,470
This way, I can understand

161

166
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,180
By the way, Mrs. Zhou.

167
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:22,800
You mentioned earlier

168
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,950
that you wanted to show me something.

169
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,550

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,230
Let's talk about it later.

171
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,190
We'll discuss that later.

172
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:29,710
Okay.

173
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,750
Honey, how about this?

174
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,750
Why don't you fill out

175
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,870
this test first?

176
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,270

00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,920
Of course.

187
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,110
-Okay.
-Of course.

00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,630
Okay.

This is our kitchen.

191
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,390
I can't bear to watch this.

192
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:00,900
This scene is about to

193
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,700
trigger my fear of awkwardness.

194
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,270
Stay calm.

195
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,550
It's just a small matter.

196
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,080
Zhou and Li can handle this.

197
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,080
What do you think of my answers?

198
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,400
Your answers are fine.

199
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,940
The focus is that the questions she came up with

200
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,680
are quite

201
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,430
professional.

202
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,550
This person's level of expertise

203
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,010
is beyond my imagination.

204
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,930
Honey, when I see her, I somehow

205
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,070
feel a bit nervous.

206
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,070
I feel like she...

207
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,430
I might not be able to handle her.

208
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,510
Why do you need to handle her anyway?

209
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,330
I think

210
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,790
it's mainly because

211
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,210
the gap between her level of expertise

212
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,190
and our perception of

213
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,120
this profession

214
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,909
is way too big.

215
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:46,540
So you are just

216
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,800
afraid of the unknown.

217
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,030
Don't worry.

218
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,650
From what we can see so far,

219
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:53,870
it's a good thing,

220
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,300
right?

221
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,270
She's so professional.

222
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,190
I'll observe a bit more

223
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,720
to see if she's patient and loving

224
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,780
towards the child.

225
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,510
If she does, then we didn't

226
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:00,970
make the wrong choice.

227
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:01,610
Definitely.

228
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,630
Personally, I think

229
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,750
this is worth every penny.

230
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,870
She charges 20,000 yuan a month.

231
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:05,430
I used to also

232
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,830
earn 20,000 yuan a month.

233
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,760
In the IT field,

234
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,670
I was worth every penny.

235
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,670
She's the nanny equivalent of that.

236
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,730
There must be a reason for the high price.

237
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,380
Alright then.

238
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,590
I really can't stay any longer.

239
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,230
Go, go quickly.

240
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,670
I'm leaving then.

241
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,670
I'll observe her at home for a day.

242
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,910
I'll call you right away if anything comes up.

243
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:19,350
Okay.

244
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,120
[You said you found a reliable consultant. Where is he?]

245
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,390
Well, the nanny came to

246
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,990
my house today.

247
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,150
I'm busy settling her in.

248
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,750
I will send it

249
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,210
to you as soon as possible.

250
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:43,549
I sent it to you.

251
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,360
[Yes]

252
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,360
[Accept Friend Request?]

253
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Hello, Tony.

254
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:08,230
I'm Cherry's friend.

255
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,820
I currently have a few questions

256
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,250
I'd like to consult with you.

257
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,290
I don't know if it's convenient for you.

258
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:14,420
Do you have the time?

259
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,570
She's quite polite.

260
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:18,800
It's convenient...

261
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,880
Doesn't this give it away?

262
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:30,870
[All good. Go ahead.]

263
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,270
So fast.

264
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,070
Here's the thing.

265
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,870
We plan to commercialize the operation

266
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,910
of Cherry's blog.

267
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,530
A friend recommended you.

268
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,030
They said you have

269
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,430
a lot of experience in this area.

270
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:47,920
So I wanted to consult with you.

271
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,850
How can we quickly

272
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,570
increase the online and offline attention

273
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,650
to expressive writing and articles

274
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,960
so we can attract fans and become more commercialized?

275
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,290
Could you talk about it?

276
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,100
She's quite professional.

277
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,430
[Creating private domain traffic with new media content is a process of balancing content and commercialization. It requires continuous exploration]

278
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,650

[Take a look at these documents.]

282
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,190
Not bad.

283
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:23,490
Rather than being eye-catching,

284
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,730
differentiation is the foundation

285
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,810
for self-media to establish itself.

286
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,150
You can try to

287
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,680
get to know her.

288
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,120
If you feel that...

289
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:38,030
Be polite, okay?

290
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,960
She's the lady I was talking about.

291
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,130
Come here.

292
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,190
Aiwen,

293
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,470
this is who Mommy told you about,

294
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,960
Ms. Shuangshuang.

295
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,660
Hello, Aiwen.

296
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,540
I'm Ms. Shuangshuang.

297
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,880
From now on, I will take care of you.

298
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,030
Do you want to

299
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:55,810
say hi to her?

300
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:04,910
Son,

301
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,640
didn't Mommy just

302
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,750
tell you?

303
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:09,950
Ms. Shuangshuang

304
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,220
knows a lot of things

305
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,170
and also knows many games.

306
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,590
She will have a lot of fun playing with you.

307
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,520
But Daddy knows these too.

308
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,420
Daddy has a new task now.

309
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,270
Daddy's hibernation is over.

310
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,730
He needs to go out hunting.

311
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,020
So he can't spend the whole day

312
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,290
at home with you.

313
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,170
But after work,

314
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,030
Mommy and Daddy will both play with you.

315
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,590
During the day, Ms. Shuangshuang will play with you.

316
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,110
Okay?

317
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,560
Aiwen,

318
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,020
I will play many

319
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:39,010
games with you that

320
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,270
your daddy hasn't played with you before.

321
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,240
So I think we

322
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:43,270
will definitely get along happily.

323
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,580
Really?

324
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,070
Do you want to try

325
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,200

326
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,230
Okay then.

327
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,910
Well,

328
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:51,390
Aiwen,

329
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:52,750
I will go cook first.

330
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,130
Later, I'll play a game

331
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,030
with you that you definitely

332
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,910
haven't played before.

333
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,320
Okay?

334
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,870
Alright.

335
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,350
Well, Mrs. Zhou,

336
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,280
I'll go cook now.

337
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,280
Okay, thank you for your hard work.

338
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,150
What's wrong?

339
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,400
I'm watching

340
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,350
how she interacts with Aiwen

341
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,520
and educate him

342
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,570
when they are alone together.

343
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,350
I understand that.

344
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,210
But why do you have to be so sneaky about it?

345
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:45,740
No way.

346
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,950
You have to let her

347
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,960
think that we are not around

348
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,730
for her to show her true self.

349
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:52,150
You are being too creepy.

350
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:52,830
What do you mean by creepy?

351
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,830
Didn't she just arrive?

352
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,830
Of course I have to

353
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,550
truly understand this person.

354
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,130
I think we still need to

355
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:57,950
take it easy.

356
00:12:57,970 --> 00:12:59,550
What are you taking easy?

357
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,370
Honey, you are being too fake.

358
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,270
How am I being fake?

359
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:04,890
Fake.

360
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,430
Ms. Shuangshuang.

361
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,160
I don't know how to do this part.

362
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,610
Can you help me?

363
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,110
Say please.

364
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,670
Ms. Shuangshuang.

365
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,230
I don't know how to do this part.

366
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,590
Please help me.

367
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,710
Thank you.

368
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,500
However,

369
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,710
I can't help you.

370
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,730
You have to finish it by yourself.

371
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,690
Then I don't want to play anymore.

372
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,520
Aiwen,

373
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,010
did your parents

374
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,410
teach you to be like this?

375
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,630
If you want to become

376
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,670
a man,

377
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:33,820
a real man,

378
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,430
you can't give up halfway.

379
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,690
You wanted to do this,

380
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,680
so please finish it on your own.

381
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,030
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

382
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,410
I think it’s not bad.

383
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,410
She lets Aiwen think for himself.

384
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,670
She didn't help him right away.

385
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:50,730
Anyway, I think the concept is right.

386
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,630
Does Aiwen like her?

387
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,560
He just met her.

388
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,910
Naturally, he doesn't like her.

389
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:57,670
He wants you to stay at home with him.

390
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,550
But I think

391
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,520
Aiwen is quite obedient to her.

392
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,590
Don't you think this girl

393
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,430
speaks a bit like a teacher?

394
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,160
Children are usually more afraid of teachers.

395
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,280
Yes, yes.

396
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,390
Come here.

397
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,790
I've been watching for a while, there's no problem.

398
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:11,670
She cooked dinner tonight.

399
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,530
Have you eaten?

400
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:13,690
I've eaten.

401
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,760
Even if you've eaten, have a taste.

402
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,430
Do you think the food she made

403
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:18,990
suits your taste?

404
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,920
It looks pretty good.

405
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,650
It smells quite fragrant too.

406
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,670
I really want to go hug my son.

407
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,630
It smells so good.

408
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Fragrant, right?

409
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,090
Try this dish.

410
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,410
This is really extraordinary.

411
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,770
-Not bad.
-It’s delicious, right?

412
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,770
It's really good.

413
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,630
Delicious, isn't it?

414
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,490
Besides her good cooking skills,

415
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,900
all the groceries she bought are organic.

416
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,700
You should know that in the supermarket,

417
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,090
groceries with the word 'organic' on them

418
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,950
are four to five times more expensive than regular ones.

419
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:00,710
Of course I know.

420
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,170
I've bought it before too.

421
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,590
Then you have to talk to her about this.

422
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,550
I can't argue with her.

423
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,950
She has a bunch of reasons.

424
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:11,660
At the end of the day,

425
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,750
her argument is that

426
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,070
it's for the good of the child.

427
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:15,450
And it is indeed better for the child.

428
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:15,980
How can I

429
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,370
argue with that?

430
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:19,110
But she also needs to understand

431
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,370
the actual situation.

432
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,990
You just started the company.

433
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,710
Our money

434
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:24,940
is hard-earned.

435
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,150
Otherwise, how about this?

436
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,150
Don't let her buy groceries in the future.

437
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:30,870
You do the shopping.

438
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,600
Work a little harder yourself.

439
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,370
Come in.

440
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,150
Sorry to bother you.

441
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:52,990
I'm here to report on

442
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,430
Aiwen's educational situation.

443
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,200
Please go ahead.

444
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,790
Okay, okay.

445
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,650
Please come in.

446
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,530
It's like this.

447
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,360
Aiwen is

448
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,610
five years old this year.

449
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,790
For children at this stage,

450
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,550
it's important to

451
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,810
focus on developing good living habits,

452
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,370
a healthy diet,

453
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,710
and completing his scientific

454
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,620
and artistic enlightenment

455
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,080
while attending classes.

456
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:10,630
Based on today's understanding,

457
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,790
I've made a preliminary assessment

458
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,590
of Aiwen's specific situation.

459
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,470
Tomorrow, I will prepare

460
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:14,960
a PowerPoint presentation

461
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,390
and send it to both of your email inboxes.

462
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:16,910
Okay.

463
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,040
This is the book list I mentioned before.

464
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,310
Please take some time

465
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:22,230
to purchase them when you're free.

466
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:22,870
Thank you.

467
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:24,990
Also,

468
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,120
we often say that

469
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,950
parents are role models for their children,

470
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,790
and children are a mirror of their parents.

471
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,190
If you two can't manage to

472
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,310
finish today's tasks today,

473
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:33,910
then Aiwen will also procrastinate everywhere

474
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,870
and make excuses.

475
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:35,990
Once bad habits are formed,

476
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,050
the consequences are unimaginable.

477
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:37,850
In other words,

478
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,270
please submit your test papers

479
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,670
to me as soon as possible.

480
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,290
I'm sorry.

481
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,880
Well,

482
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:47,270
actually, we filled them out a long time ago.

483
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,590
I just wanted to consider my answers

484
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,110
and see where I could improve on

485
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:50,710
before submitting them.

486
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,590
No problem, no problem.

487
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:52,310
Well.

488
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,630
I'm sorry.

489
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,580
Okay.

490
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,770
Then I won't disturb you anymore.

491
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:57,990
You go ahead and take care of your business first.

492
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,440
Okay.

493
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,470
Don't you think that

494
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,470
we are a little too

495
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,510
subservient in front of her?

496
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,190
I addressed her with honorifics just now,

497
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:12,710
right?

498
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,109
Yes.

499
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,140
In fact,

500
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,109
your pronunciation just now

501
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:16,750
was more standard than this.

502
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,470
Okay, honey.

503
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:17,910
I got it.

504
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,190
My pronunciation was inaccurate.

505
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:20,089
Yes, well.

506
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,109
Doesn't this feel strange?

507
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:22,710
It's okay, it's okay.

508
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,390
You'll get used to it.

509
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,990
You're right to respect her.

510
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,390
So professional.

511
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,119
Her presence

512
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,780
and aura are so strong.

513
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,250
Here, this, take that.

514
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,240
Shuangshuang.

515
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,710
Where did you put

516
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:48,610
tonight's leftover rice?

517
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,540
I poured it away.

518
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,730
You poured it away?

519
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,930
Come here for a moment.

520
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,050
Okay.

521
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,040
Enjoy yourself for a while.

522
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,070
What's wrong, Mrs. Zhou?

523
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,680
There was so much

524
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,580
clean rice left.

525
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,260
I was going to

526
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,640
make sushi for Aiwen.

527
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,000
Why did you pour it away?

528
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,810
Mrs. Zhou, here’s the thing.

529
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:19,710
Leftovers may be edible,

530
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,880
but they are easily infected by bacteria.

531
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,590
Not only are they less nutritional,

532
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:25,230
but they also cause various diseases.

533
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,830
So you'd better not eat them.

534
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,000
Kids, especially,

535
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,530
have weaker immune systems.

536
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,990
It would be troublesome if they get diarrhea from

537
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:31,790
eating the leftovers.

538
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,350
Shuangshuang, here’s the thing.

539
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,830
I know that leftover vegetables

540
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,160
cannot be eaten

541
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,120
after one night.

542
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,190
But meat and rice

543
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,360
are different.

544
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:40,410
As long as you preserve them well,

545
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,640
it's not that bad.

546
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,470
They are still

547
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,200
edible after one night.

548
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,930
It's not like I haven't brought up a child before.

549
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:46,990
I still know a thing or two

550
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,000
about what the child

551
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,350
can and cannot eat.

552
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:50,830
Mrs. Zhou.

553
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,500
It's true that leftovers are edible.

554
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,710
But it's not good for the

555
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,240
child's health and growth.

556
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,500
Also,

557
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,310
since you decide to buy groceries yourselves,

558
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,110
I have to make some things clear.

559
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,120
I've seen the yogurt you often bought.

560
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,270
The ingredients are not good.

561
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,850
There are too many additives.

562
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:05,930
How about this?

563
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:06,940
I'll write down a list of brands

564
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,340
you can buy from instead.

565
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,270
Are you implying that

566
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,270
when we buy something

567
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,400
in the future,

568
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,680
we need to show it to you

569
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,830
and get your approval

570
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,230
before we can buy it?

571
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,830
I wouldn't use the word

572
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,150
"approval" in this situation.

573
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,680
I'm just helping you eliminate some choices.

574
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,860
Let's talk about the rice again.

575
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,770
I thought about what you said.

576
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:29,180
It makes sense.

577
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,070
Can you not

578
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,830
cook so much rice in the future?

579
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,990
We can also avoid wasting food this way,

580
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,710
okay?

581
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:36,230
It's my first day at your house.

582
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:37,030
I'm not very familiar with

583
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,600
the meal portions of each family member.

584
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,770
I will pay attention to this in the future.

585
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:41,810
Can I say a few words?

586
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:43,200
-So...
-Oh, Mr. Zhou,

587
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,450
I have a question.

588
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,530
Do I also need to sleep

589
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:47,460
under the surveillance of you two?

590
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,150
Because my bedroom

591
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,070
has never had

592
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:50,610
surveillance cameras installed.

593
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,460
No, that was not...

594
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,830
I installed it for the child in the past.

595
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,350
I'll remove it now.

596
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,000
Okay.

597
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,460
Mrs. Zhou, is there anything else?

598
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:01,950
Nothing for now.

599
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,690
Then I'll go accompany Aiwen.

600
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:04,630
Alright.

601
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:09,780
It's been removed, Shuangshuang.

602
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,300
Honey, I can’t…

603
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,200
I know.

604
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,830
I know it very well.

605
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,310
You know?

606
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:22,340
Yes, you're both ladies.

607
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,190
As the opposite gender, even I

608
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:25,460
feel that...

609
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,310
No, no.

610
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,490
It has nothing to do with gender.

611
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:28,500
It's more like...

612
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,860
I clearly feel uncomfortable.

613
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,030
But I can't describe it.

614
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,150
Because what she said

615
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:34,220
made sense.

616
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,040
But the way she said it...

617
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,530
She's quick.

618
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,250
And very clear-minded.

619
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:43,720
And she

620
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,960
has no concept of thriftiness.

621
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,520
This is

622
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:46,790
a big matter, you know?

623
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:47,530
Apart from the grocery matter

624
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:48,770
I told you about,

625
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,420
she left the tap running

626
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,600
when she was washing the vegetables,

627
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,240
you know?

628
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:52,950
The tap was just running freely.

629
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,000
Why didn't she turn it off

630
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,770
or catch the water with

631
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:55,370
a container

632
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,540
to use it elsewhere?

633
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,110
The water wasn't dirty or anything.

634
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,790
I mean...

635
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,010
We're not a stingy family.

636
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:01,880
I don't think I'm

637
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,700
a stingy person either.

638
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,030
But you can't waste money like this.

639
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,170
It's not easy for me to make money.

640
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:05,840
Yes.

641
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,560
But now I don't know

642
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,440
if I can talk to her about that.

643
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,390
From an environmental perspective,

644
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:12,230
I think it's okay.

645
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,030
Find a chance.

646
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:13,760
No, I...

647
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,670
I have to think about

648
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:15,440
how to tell her.

649
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,350
Otherwise, I can't convince her.

650
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:16,770
You know?

651
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:17,830
Yes, that's right.

652
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,470
How was it?

653
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,490
How was your play-session

654
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,190
with Ms. Shuangshuang today?

655
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,640
I don't know.

656
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,390
What do you mean by 'I don't know'?

657
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,100
Dad,

658
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,870
Ms. Shuangshuang said a lot of

659
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,350
strange things today.

660
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,980
She told me to exercise more

661
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,120
and read more.

662
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,120
Then she also assigned me

663
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,520
a lot of homework.

664
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,390
Dad,

665
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,030
it's not homework assigned by the teacher.

666
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,350
Do I have to do it too?

667
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:55,030
Don't put the toys

668
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,130
in the quilt, okay?

669
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,580
Ms. Shuangshuang

670
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,940
is both a caretaker

671
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:03,790
and a teacher.

672
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,990
So sometimes,

673
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,090
she may seem

674
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,290
quite strict.

675
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,370
You need to slowly adapt to it,

676
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,190
okay?

677
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:15,550
Dad,

678
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:18,540
I still want to stay with you.

679
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,390
Ms. Shuangshuang is always like this.

680
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,280
I still want to stay with you.

681
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,360
Didn't I tell you?

682
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,440
She's both a caretaker and a teacher.

683
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:29,070
Sometimes,

684
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,270
it's normal for her to seem a bit strict.

685
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:31,950
Son,

686
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,870
we are both men.

687
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,200
We need to be strong,

688
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:35,890
okay?

689
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,120
Let's observe a bit more

690
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,420
and see if Ms. Shuangshuang

691
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,820
will always be like this,

692
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:41,790
alright?

693
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,530
Mr. Zhou, you're here.

694
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,000
It's time for Aiwen to go to bed.

695
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'm here to tell him a bedtime story.

696
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,450
Okay.

697
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,420
Go ahead.

698
00:22:59,130 --> 00:22:59,810
Aiwen,

699
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,790
what story do you want to hear today?

700
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:02,760
Wait a second.

701
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,230
Let me through.

702
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:11,030
Say please.

703
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,900
Please let me through.

704
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:24,900
Ms. Shuangshuang,

705
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,750
this is all of my

706
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,270
pocket money.

707
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,990
I'm giving it all to you.

708
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,360
Please leave quickly.

709
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,750
I want my dad with me instead.

710
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,590
Aiwen,

711
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,070
give me some time.

712
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,870
I will definitely make you

713
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,550
like me,

714
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,180
okay?

715
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,470
Alright,

716
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,520
let's listen to a bedtime story.

717
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,780
Get in bed, quickly.

718
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,570
Lie down properly.

719
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:02,430
Today, I'll tell you a story about

720
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,750
a bear in the forest.

721
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,150
I forgot a number.

722
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:11,960
Two.

723
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,550
Two.

724
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:15,870
Two.

725
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:16,990
One.

726
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:17,350
Okay.

727
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,310
Enjoy.

728
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,370
Thank you.

729
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,840
40 minus 9

730
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,790
equals 31.

731
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,670
Sit straight and write.

732
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,490
Yu, listen to me.

733
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,390
I'm not really doing this for you.

734
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,040
Don't cry first.

735
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,360
As for me,

736
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,360
I'm also doing this for myself.

737
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,210
They invested real money

738
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,510
into this project.

739
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,290
I'm thinking, what if

740
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,580
I have some problems,

741
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,380
such as feeling unwell,

742
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:21,350
or something else?

743
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,070
Our project

744
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,230
must continue uninterrupted.

745
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,030
We can't cause them any trouble.

746
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:25,950
Right.

747
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,450
Yes, you have the experience.

748
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,930
Stop selling seafood.

749
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,230
Tidy up your wig

750
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,670
and get ready to come out of retirement.

751
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:35,390
Okay.

752
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,770
Bye. Don't cry anymore.

753
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,640
The Tyrannosaurus

754
00:25:47,030 --> 00:25:49,270
held the Stagosaurus and charged forward.

755
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,530
I just corrected that.

756
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,830
What kind of 'saurus?

757
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,190
Stegosaurus.

758
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,570
Say it again. Tyrannosaurus rex.

759
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:57,600
The Tyrannosaurus rex held the Stagosaurus

760
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,800
and charged forward.

761
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:05,600
Mr. Guan.

762
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,590
Quan.

763
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,410
You're about to start the job.

764
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,950
How's the recruitment going?

765
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:11,720
I've recruited a few elite soldiers.

766
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,950
I think at this stage,

767
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,440
we don't need too many people.

768
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,930
They are all very, very experienced.

769
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:16,550
Rest assured,

770
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,550
I'll definitely complete the task.

771
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,340
Okay. Bye-bye.

772
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:46,990
Aiwen.

773
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,750
Let's play for another ten minutes.

774
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,950
We'll be reading picture books in a bit.

775
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:57,620
Ms. Shuangshuang.

776
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,250
You can’t…

777
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,350
Mixing the pants, underwear, and socks

778
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,870
in a single wash

779
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,010
is too unsanitary.

780
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,750
Mr. Zhou.

781
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:06,850
Did you see those posts

782
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,040
on your WeChat Moments?

783
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,310
That's all just psychological.

784
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:09,990
Rumors.

785
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,710
How can this be psychological?

786
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:12,640
Many experts

787
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:13,230
also say the same thing.

788
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:13,870
Washing these together

789
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:15,230
will breed bacteria.

790
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,070
The experts are all pseudo-science popularizers.

791
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,450
There's no scientific basis at all.

792
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:19,630
When I was studying abroad,

793
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,720
everyone washed their clothes like this.

794
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,070
No, but...

795
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,000
What's going on?

796
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:24,990
Ms. Shuangshuang

797
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,790
is putting the socks, underwear, and pants

798
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,990
all in one wash.

799
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:28,630
This is...

800
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,260
Mrs. Zhou.

801
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,290
If you don't believe it,

802
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,070
you can have Mr. Zhou.

803
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,170
go online and check if

804
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:37,760
they all wash clothes

805
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,890
like this overseas.

806
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,150
Shuangshuang, here's the thing.

807
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,170
Let's not talk about

808
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:43,320
habits overseas, domestically,

809
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,700
in another family, or your own.

810
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,360
Right now, you're in our home.

811
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,710
I still hope that you can slightly

812
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,230
respect our family's habits

813
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,110
and rules.

814
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,230
It's like if

815
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:53,590
you're working at a company.

816
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,390
You're very smart.

817
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,530
You have your own set of theories.

818
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:57,010
But you can't go ahead and

819
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,070
arrange everything your way

820
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,100
for your supervisors.

821
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,230
This is not allowed.

822
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,150
That's right.

823
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:03,950
Okay.

824
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,320
I will follow

825
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,150
Your ways and habits from now on.

826
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,140
It's time now.

827
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:11,070
I need to accompany Aiwen

828
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,180
and read picture books together.

829
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:12,790
How about this?

830
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:13,750
Leave the clothes here.

831
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,790
I'll come wash them in a bit.

832
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,270
But if you're worried that

833
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,920
the clothes will get stuffy inside

834
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,910
and breed bacteria,

835
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:19,770
you can also wash them first.

836
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,700
I'll come hang them up later, okay?

837
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,490
Don't be angry.

838
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,680
Let me do it.

839
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:32,670
Let me do it.

840
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:33,150
Let me.

841
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:33,470
Wait a moment.

842
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,870
She's reading a picture book with our son.

843
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:36,070
What are you going to do?

844
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,630
No, no.

845
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,320
I'm going to do the laundry.

846
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:53,390
Dad.

847
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,250
Can we move to a big villa?

848
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,390
Why?

849
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:03,030
Wang Sitong said

850
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,230
they live in a big villa.

851
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,030
It's very big and very nice.

852
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:10,440
Then let them say it.

853
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,050
I think our home is quite comfortable.

854
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,530
Mom,

855
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,430
is your bag a limited edition?

856
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:19,680
No, it's not.

857
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:20,690
Then you should still get

858
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,950
a limited edition one.

859
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,080
Why should I

860
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,710
get a limited edition bag?

861
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,770
Ms. Shuangshuang said that

862
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,840
as long as she takes one look at

863
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,800
the bag a woman is carrying,

864
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,020
she can tell

865
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,580
if the family is well-off or not.

866
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,440
I want to let others know

867
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,430
our family is doing really well.

868
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,670
Son, do you think

869
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,070
our family is doing well?

870
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:47,930
Yes, of course.

871
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,070
Then why must we let

872
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,240
others know?

873
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:52,830
Because saving face is also very important.

874
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,230
Is this also what Ms. Shuangshuang

875
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,080
told you?

876
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,160
Ms. Shuangshuang said

877
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,030
living in a big villa gives you face,

878
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:02,030
living in an apartment building doesn't.

879
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,630
Driving a car gives you face,

880
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,800
riding an electric bike doesn't.

881
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,930
Traveling abroad gives you face,

882
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,210
taking a day trip to the suburbs doesn't.

883
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,240
Eating Western food gives you face,

884
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,240
eating fried dough sticks doesn't.

885
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:18,870
Son, do you know what

886
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:19,710
antonyms are?

887
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,380
Yes, I do.

888
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,400
Just take what Ms. Shuangshuang

889
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,470
said to you

890
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,100
as antonyms.

891
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,100
Did she tell you these?

892
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,010
I heard her say it

893
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,430
when she was on the phone.

894
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,430
I know about her.

895
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:37,840
Oh, come on.

896
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,870
She's nothing.

897
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,430
The Chanel bag she carries

898
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:43,470
is not even a classic style that holds its value, okay?

899
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,750
Does she often make phone calls at home?

900
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,230
Yes.

901
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:48,220
It's like the other way around.

902
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,830
Suddenly, I'm the caretaker

903
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,960
and she is the child.

904
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,210
Then it becomes me taking care of her.

905
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,150
Aiwen.

906
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:56,190
Could you please help me

907
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,400
get a glass of water?

908
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,760
Here's your water.

909
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:01,830
Thank you.

910
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,490
Could you also get me a pear?

911
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,440
Here comes the pear.

912
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,150
Thank you.

913
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,350
Why didn't you

914
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,350
tell us earlier?

915
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:19,290
She told me to keep it from you.

916
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,270
Because she said

917
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,530
as long as I kept it from you,

918
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,200
she would give me a lot of

919
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,230
cheese sticks.

920
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,180
Cheese stick.

921
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:35,510
Go back and tell her.

922
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:47,670
Let's get straight to the point.

923
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:48,870
No need to waste time.

924
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,060
On the way back, well,

925
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,570
we heard Aiwen say in the car that

926
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,020
you said

927
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:57,870
those who live in villas have face,

928
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,630
while those who live in small houses don't.

929
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:01,110
Those who drive cars have face,

930
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:02,950
while those who ride mopeds don't.

931
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,470
You can tell if a woman is happy

932
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:06,070
and living well or not just by

933
00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:07,800
looking at the bag she carries.

934
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,520
Do you think these values

935
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,350
will influence Aiwen?

936
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:15,790
First of all, Mr. Zhou,

937
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,000
I'm not sure if you

938
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:17,750
have some misunderstanding.

939
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,550
It's just that

940
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,970
these are indeed my

941
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,990
personal values.

942
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,120
But I have never actively

943
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,830
instilled these in Aiwen.

944
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,180
He might have

945
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,420
overheard my phone calls.

946
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,190
That's what I think.

947
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,790
Indeed, with you holding these values,

948
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:30,970
aren't you afraid of influencing Aiwen?

949
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,080
That's what I mean.

950
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,840
Mr. Zhou, Mrs. Zhou,

951
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,240
I think you two

952
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,630
are spending so much money to hire me

953
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,960
because you want Aiwen

954
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,950
to become an outstanding and

955
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,480
successful person, right?

956
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,070
Then an important manifestation of success and excellence,

957
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,020
in my opinion,

958
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,640
is the material foundation.

959
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,270
In other words,

960
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,550
do you hope that in the future,

961
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,010
Aiwen can only ride a moped

962
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:54,750
and rent a

963
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,840
30-square-meter small studio apartment?

964
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,890
Don't you hope that he

965
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,640
can afford to buy a big villa?

966
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:00,880
If that's the case,

967
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,820
why not sincerely

968
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,060
tell him now

969
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,480
that a big villa is good?

970
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,020
I don't think

971
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,110
letting a child live in a

972
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,420
hypocritical fairy tale world from a young age

973
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,680
is beneficial for him.

974
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:10,680
Of course,

975
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,050
this is entirely my personal opinion.

976
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:12,470
If you two

977
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,330
don't agree with it,

978
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,000
I can teach

979
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:15,690
according to your materials.

980
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,630
Well, um.

981
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:22,870
You often get Aiwen

982
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,030
to serve you.

983
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,380
How do you explain this?

984
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:28,790
I think the word 'serve'

985
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,110
is not quite accurate.

986
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,150
I am cultivating

987
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,090
his life skills.

988
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,270
I believe this is something children

989
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:34,800
must learn from a young age.

990
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:43,670
Mr. Zhou, Mrs. Zhou,

991
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,470
do you have any other questions?

992
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,150
No more.

993
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,190
Do you?

994
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,110
No.

995
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,630
Then I'll go prepare dinner.

996
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:50,090
Please.

997
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,870
Why?

998
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:03,800
No, honey.

999
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,650
She is manipulating us psychologically.

1000
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,490
She is so good at twisting concepts.

1001
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,020
She is such a smooth talker.

1002
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,070
It seems that according to her,

1003
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,090
letting the child see a

1004
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:11,770
real world

1005
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,920
seems to be right.

1006
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:13,389
Right?

1007
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:14,020
This society has its

1008
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,949
cruel side.

1009
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,710
Aiwen is only five years old.

1010
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:18,070
Shouldn't we

1011
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:18,870
first cultivate him to

1012
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,400
see the beauty of this world

1013
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:22,190
so he would view it with love?

1014
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:22,949
As he grows up slowly,

1015
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:23,909
he will naturally

1016
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:24,790
come into contact with

1017
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:25,830
these various aspects of society.

1018
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:26,949
Step by step,

1019
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,610
he will come to understand these things.

1020
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:29,830
Yes. She's twisting concepts.

1021
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,630
She took advantage of a time gap.

1022
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:34,360
-What should we do?
-Honey, we can't keep her.

1023
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,960
Absolutely not.

1024
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,250
I feel the same way.

1025
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,810
Ms. Shuangshuang.

1026
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,860
Mrs. Zhou.

1027
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,350
Why are you here?

1028
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:04,840
Didn't I tell you

1029
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:05,910
to avoid entering

1030
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:06,640
Aiwen's room

1031
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,870
after his shower?

1032
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:09,230
It's not good for his independence.

1033
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,690
He will become dependent.

1034
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:12,680
His legs and belly

1035
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,430
are all exposed.

1036
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,160
It's so cold at night.

1037
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,240
Keep an eye on him.

1038
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,150
Otherwise, what if

1039
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,950
he falls sick?

1040
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,270
I was just messaging

1041
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,270
my parents.

1042
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,840
I'll keep an eye on him.

1043
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,820
Go back and rest.

1044
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,600
Don't worry.

1045
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,180
Keep an eye on him, okay?

1046
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,150
Go back and rest.

1047
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,150
Don't wake him up.

1048
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,800
This caretaker of yours

1049
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,540
is not simple.

1050
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:58,590
Insane, isn't it?

1051
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,330
It happened to you. You have patience.

1052
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:01,330
If it were me...

1053
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:02,290
Please,

1054
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:03,110
leave.

1055
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,470
The last thing we lack is people.

1056
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,470
Ms. Meng,

1057
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,840
you really have zero

1058
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,170
life experience.

1059
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:09,910
Don't you know that caretakers

1060
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,030
are talents nowadays?

1061
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,150
A scarce resource.

1062
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:12,990
Quit joking.

1063
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,300
Even this one was carefully selected

1064
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,980
by my mom and me.

1065
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,010
I think,

1066
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,270
rather than caring about the child,

1067
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,470
what your caretaker cares more about is

1068
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,810
how much money you make

1069
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,880
and how big your house is.

1070
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,120
House...

1071
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:27,910
About the office we saw earlier,

1072
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:28,750
didn't you like it?

1073
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,950
Why did you reject it?

1074
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,290
That place is not bad,

1075
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:34,250
but I think it's too far from home.

1076
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:36,430
I want to find a place closer to home.

1077
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,440
Also, recently,

1078
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,070
don't fill up my work schedule.

1079
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:40,290
I really need to allocate time

1080
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:40,890
and energy

1081
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,390
to take care of my family.

1082
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,960
I understand now.

1083
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:45,240
No matter how good the caretaker is,

1084
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,060
she is definitely not as good as

1085
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,460
the child's own parents.

1086
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,590
And do you know how much

1087
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,600
she charges per month?

1088
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,460
I don't think she is half as reliable

1089
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,350
as Zhou Quan.

1090
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,830
Then do you want to discuss it again

1091
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,830
with Zhou Quan?

1092
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,990
He hasn't started working yet, right?

1093
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:56,830
Didn't you say the child is...

1094
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:57,510
What was it?

1095
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:59,070
The transition year

1096
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:00,670
from kindergarten to primary school is very important?

1097
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,470
Let him hold on for another year.

1098
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,870
Holding on for a year is not that difficult.

1099
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,520
But I was

1100
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,270
a stay-at-home parent myself.

1101
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,710
I know at this age,

1102
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,070
finding a job that I like

1103
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,270
is really difficult,

1104
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,840
regardless of gender.

1105
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,520
I know you feel for Zhou Quan,

1106
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:23,290
but I also feel for you.

1107
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,430
It's not easy for you.

1108
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,070
Aiwen.

1109
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,170
Mom, I feel so uncomfortable.

1110
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:51,580
Why are you so hot?

1111
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,210
Xin Shuangshuang.

1112
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,690
Xin Shuangshuang.

1113
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:56,870
Xin Shuangshuang!

1114
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,760
Mrs. Zhou, why are you here?

1115
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,400
Didn't you know the child has a fever?

1116
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,230
I took his temperature before he went to bed.

1117
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,510
He did have a slight fever.

1118
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,510
How many degrees?

1119
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:07,310
37.8 degrees.

1120
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:09,680
Then why didn't you tell me?

1121
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:11,490
Mrs. Zhou, you don't need to worry too much.

1122
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,110
For children, a fever below 38.5 degrees

1123
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,790
is considered normal.

1124
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,230
It's 39.2 degrees now.

1125
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,910
How can you be so irresponsible?

1126
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:18,880
No, Mrs. Zhou.

1127
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,330
Please listen to me.

1128
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,240
You shut up.

1129
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,250
Zhou Quan.

1130
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:24,670
Your judgment is very accurate.

1131
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,390
Has the child ever had

1132
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,320
acute laryngitis before?

1133
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,080
No, no.

1134
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,050
Then how did you know?

1135
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,030
I usually do my research online.

1136
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,780
Fortunately, you brought him here in time.

1137
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,350
If you had delayed a little longer,

1138
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:37,210
the child could have suffocated.

1139
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:39,000
So as parents,

1140
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,580
you still need to be more cautious.

1141
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,650
If something happens,

1142
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,790
it will be too late for regrets.

1143
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,190
Got it.

1144
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,100
Got it.

1145
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,270
You can watch over him for now.

1146
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:45,680
Okay.

1147
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,310
Come find me if there's anything.

1148
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,510
Thank you, thank you.

1149
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,070
Did you hear what the doctor

1150
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:02,900
said just now?

1151
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:07,220
I called Mom over.

1152
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,510
When she arrives, let's go home.

1153
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:08,940
Okay.

1154
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:22,640
Later,

1155
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,340
no matter what other opinions she expresses,

1156
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,870
we will treat her every word

1157
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,310
as thin air.

1158
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,380
Our demand must be very clear.

1159
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,560
We want her to leave.

1160
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,760
And we must

1161
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:32,990
get things straight.

1162
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:33,670
Zhou Quan.

1163
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:34,750
No matter how

1164
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,510
I deal with her later,

1165
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,540
don't stop me.

1166
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,600
I won't stop you even if you hit her.

1167
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:44,550
Xin Shuangshuang.

1168
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,610
Xin Shuangshuang.

1169
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,210
Xin Shuangshuang!

1170
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,650
Xin Shuangshuang!

1171
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,390
Xin Shuangshuang...

1172
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,190
Honey, honey.

1173
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,100
Dear Mrs. Zhou and Mr. Zhou.

1174
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:58,670
First,

1175
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:59,830
children's minor illnesses

1176
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,150
have the ability to self-heal.

1177
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:02,110
Taking medicine and getting injections

1178
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,260
are not good for children.

1179
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,920
[Letter of Resignation]

1180
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:03,820
Two,

1181
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,750
the child's illness is due to the lack of

1182
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,790
quality organic food in the family

1183
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,570
and your family's unscientific

1184
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,190
and unhealthy living habits.

1185
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,950
I informed you in advance,

1186
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,190
but you didn't follow

1187
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:16,110
my requirements.

1188
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:16,710
Therefore,

1189
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,710
I take no responsibility if anything happens.

1190
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,110
Third,

1191
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,000
your family's

1192
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,510
educational philosophy differs from mine.

1193
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:24,270
So I specially resign from this job.

1194
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,750
According to the labor law,

1195
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,680
you have to pay me

1196
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,960
three months' salary.

1197
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,920
But considering your family's

1198
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,480
poor financial situation,

1199
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,130
I voluntarily resign

1200
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,830
to waive your compensation.

1201
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:39,220
Ms. Che,

1202
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,600
you are also a celebrity to some extent.

1203
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,160
If this matter gets out,

1204
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,630
it's not good for anyone.

1205
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:46,810
I hope you are grateful

1206
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,360
and behave yourselves.

1207
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,260
Finally gone.

1208
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:08,570
Healthy meals every day.

1209
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:10,630
I'm all loosened up.

1210
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:18,510
Pa!

1211
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:20,430
Wake up.

1212
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:23,810
Look,

1213
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,020
you're hibernating early due to a lack of carbs.

1214
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,510
Come on, be quiet.

1215
00:41:33,510 --> 00:41:34,910
You need to calm down.

1216
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,290
Look, look at my move.

1217
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:37,230
Aiwen.

1218
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,720
How is he?

1219
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,440
Aiwen.

1220
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,170
Let me feel your forehead.

1221
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,570
Do you still have a fever?

1222
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,270
No more fever.

1223
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,590
Do you feel uncomfortable?

1224
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:46,440
Uncomfortable.

1225
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,030
Where do you feel uncomfortable?

1226
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,140
You were playing so happily with your dad.

1227
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,000
Yeah, do you feel uncomfortable?

1228
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,830
My arm feels uncomfortable.

1229
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,310
Really?

1230
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:54,510
Let me treat your arm.

1231
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:55,460
Come on.

1232
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,030
Aiwen.

1233
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,280
Aiwen.

1234
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,880
Tell me.

1235
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,690
Are my dishes delicious?

1236
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:05,800
Yes, it's delicious.

1237
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,640
Right?

1238
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:08,310
It's much better than Ms. Shuangshuang's

1239
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,030
cooking.

1240
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,270
Forget about that person.

1241
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:10,770
Forget about her.

1242
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:11,630
Listen to this.

1243
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,630
I told you.

1244
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,540
We shouldn't have hired a nanny.

1245
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,760
You know, this nanny

1246
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,080
kept talking about foreign countries

1247
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,630
as if she were a foreigner.

1248
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:21,670
So arrogant.

1249
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,870
Most importantly, she was bad for Aiwan.

1250
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:26,070
Otherwise, how could he have gotten sick?

1251
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:26,720
Mom.

1252
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,030
This nanny has already been dismissed.

1253
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,440
Don't keep repeating the same thing,

1254
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,120
okay?

1255
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,180
I must say this.

1256
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:32,950
We can't hire a nanny anymore.

1257
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,110
You might be able to risk it,

1258
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:35,820
but I can't risk my grandson.

1259
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,290
Honey.

1260
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:38,480
He has an English class later.

1261
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,470
Will you take him or should I?

1262
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:39,810
I'll take him.

1263
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,710
Don't you need to go house hunting?

1264
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,990
The child is sick.

1265
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,110
Let the child rest for a while.

1266
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,150
When it comes to English...

1267
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:46,110
You can't learn it

1268
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,310
in a day or two anyway.

1269
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,300
Take it slow.

1270
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:49,140
He's all recovered from the illness.

1271
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:49,770
He can't be so delicate that

1272
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:50,810
he misses his class.

1273
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,670
Why are you going backward again?

1274
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,670
I haven't even started on you yet.

1275
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,730
You're eating, so eat properly.

1276
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:56,250
If there's nothing,

1277
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,460
why are you fiddling with your phone?

1278
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:58,340
I'm working.

1279
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,230
I have important information

1280
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:00,090
to reply to someone.

1281
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,450
You really want to control everything.
