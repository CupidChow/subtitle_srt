Still feeling upset?

00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,550
Your capability at work

6
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,550
is evident to everyone in the company.

7
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,310
Mr. Lyu

8
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,930
was just trying to scare you.

9
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,550
In the end, the important tasks

10
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:50,789
will still be handed over to you.

11
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:52,350
Ding can't handle it at all.

12
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,680
I'm not thinking about that.

13
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,840
I just think that Ding

14
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,240
was out of line this time.

15
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,390
It hurt me.

16
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,280
I treated him well, too.

17
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,630
What does this indicate?

18
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,890
A matter of mentality.

19
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:07,810
This is the workplace.

20
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,030
I thought you would no longer be

21
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,180
bothered by these things by now.

22
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,300
It's not worth it for you to be

23
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,340
angry about this.

24
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,240
Besides, this young man

25
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,150
does have a problematic character.

26
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,270
If he continues like this,

27
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,870
he might have terrible luck.

28
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,250
I heard that

29
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,150
there will be personnel changes recently.

Actually, to be honest,

33
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,440
I quite pity these young people.

34
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,900

I don't know who Steve Jobs is either.

65

But I think this kid must be quite tired.

66
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,950
Have I been too lax with him?

67
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,470
I should sign him up for some classes

68
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,390
and let him learn a skill or two.

69
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:51,070

74
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,630
him perform something?

75
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:58,750
Of course he performs.

76
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,930
He had performances in kindergarten.

77
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,130
There will be even more when he goes to elementary school.

78
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,610

00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,390

00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,670
as long as the kid

84
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,360
is healthy

85
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,350

00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,060

it's good enough.

you weren't like this with me.

are you afraid of them?

But you know?

Human desires can't be provoked.

00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,450
I did all the big and small chores.

193
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:32,059
I've been here

194
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,260
for almost ten years.

195
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,340
The plants flourished under my care

196
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,340
while my hair fell off by the clumps.

197
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,179
And now that fool fired me!

198
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,049
He told me to graduate!

199
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,700
Ridiculous, isn't it?

200
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,350
What have I done wrong?

201
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,950
When have I not worked overtime?

202
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,840
Why should I?

203
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,500
Isn't this bullying an honest person?

204
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:56,510
Yu.

205
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:58,990
Yu.

206
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,690
Yu!

207
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,420
Yu, calm down.

208
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,670
I am calm.

209
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,270
I'm very calm!

210
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,950
You thought I was going to jump, didn't you?

211
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,750
Don't worry, I won't.

212
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,800
I still have a wife and a kid.

213
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,270
I'm here thinking about

214
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:27,600
how to explain this to them when I get home.

215
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,260
What exactly did I do wrong?

216
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,310
I'm 46 this year.

217
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,280
I've been working at the company for almost a decade.

218
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:46,000
They fired me just like that.

219
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:50,870
Work.

220
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,670
Family.

221
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,910
I seem to have achieved nothing.

222
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,350
As a man,

223
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,950
I'm under too much pressure.

224
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,770
Oh my god.

225
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:03,920
I have nothing now.

226
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,410
Let me tell you,

227
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,320
don't be afraid.

228
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,750
It's not the end.

229
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,570
Life still has to go on.

230
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,840
You have to stay strong.

231
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:20,430
At least you still have me as a friend.

232
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,590
Well done, Zhou Quan.

233
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,990
Drinking during working hours?

234
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,390
Do you think this is a bar?

235
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,810
How about

236
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,560
a plate of pork head for you?

237
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,470
You can drink another half a liter.

238
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,150
No, no need.

239
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,230
I...

240
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
What's wrong with drinking at work?

241
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,520
Don't you sleep at work?

242
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,470
Do you know business?

243
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:16,160
Do you know management?

244
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:16,910
You fired

245
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,140
such a good employee.

246
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,030
Do you have a conscience?

247
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,050
Do you?

248
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,390
Answer me.

249
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,630
Do you have a conscience?

250
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,710
Do you?

251
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:31,320
Zhou Quan?

252
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,520
Are you really drunk?

253
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:34,840
Why don't I

254
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,550
help you inside for a nap?

255
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,390
No need.

256
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:38,730
Go back to work.

257
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:54,910
Really.

258
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,790
I feel it's really cruel.

259
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,350
Yu

260
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,360
is a down-to-earth,

261
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,230
honest, and upright person.

262
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,990
He joined the company at the same time as me.

263
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,830
He never provoked or offended anyone.

264
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:15,910
His professional ability

265
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,950
is not bad either.

266
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,310
He helps everyone.

267
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,070
He spent his own money and bought

268
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,110
those pothos for the company.

269
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,150
I thought he liked flowers.

270
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,660
But he bought them because he wanted us

271
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,230
to get some fresh air in the office.

272
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:34,410
Such a nice person.

273
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,170
They just fired him without hesitation.

274
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:39,320
Who the hell does

275
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,560
Bossy Lyu think he is?

276
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:44,270
At least look into who he's firing.

277
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,320
Since I was in college,

278
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,510
I've always told myself

279
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,390
that I must persevere.

280
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,200
I must be myself,

281
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,030
be honest,

282
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,910
and be righteous.

283
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,190
Now I really don't know

284
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,120
who I am anymore.

285
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:07,630
Damn it.

286
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:11,630
I really wanted to swear at Bossy Lyu.

287
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,790
But at the critical moment,

288
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,030
I didn't step forward

289
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,110
and take a stand.

290
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,290
I really

291
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:20,440
look down on myself.

292
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,390
Honey.

293
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,110
When encountering

294
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,440
this kind of situation,

295
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,370
most people will choose to play safe.

296
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,270
Being a person

297
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,190
is difficult in the first place.

298
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,230
To be a brave and righteous person

299
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,310
is even harder.

300
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,290
Everyone

301
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,730
can only be responsible

302
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,810
for their own life.

303
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:05,070
They can only be responsible for their own family

304
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,330
and loved ones.

305
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,830
In this regard,

306
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,630
you have already done very well.

307
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,830
You are a brave person.

308
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,330
I know you are upset.

309
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,710
Why don't you see

310
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,120
if there are any friends

311
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,840
who have a job suitable for Yu?

312
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,370
You can help recommend him.

313
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,070
That's also a solution.

314
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,660
Zhou Quan?

315
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,110
Zhou Quan.

316
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:55,830
You must be tired.

317
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,150
Sleeping as soon as you come to work.

318
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,390
No, no.

319
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,990
Mr. Lyu, I... I was...

320
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,160
Didn't Yu leave?

321
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,670
He left a lot of unfinished work.

322
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,550
Last night,

323
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,600
I worked overtime at home

324
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,720
and finished all

325
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,330
his remaining work.

326
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,390
I'll send it to you to have a look.

327
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,390
No need, no need.

328
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,010
The copywriting

329
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,660
was already done by Ding yesterday.

330
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,460
He sent it to me before midnight.

331
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:20,880
He did a really good job.

332
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,430
As for your version, just keep it.

333
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,630
Keep it as a souvenir.

334
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,790
Ok. Go back to sleep.

335
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,070
I won't disturb you.

336
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,030
-No.
-Go back to sleep.

337
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,680
No, no.

338
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,510
Alright, alright, I'm leaving.

339
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,310
About Yu's matter,

340
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,040
I know you are not happy either.

341
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:47,720
You have been holding it in.

342
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,750
But,

343
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,510
we have been working together in the company

344
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:53,510
for so many years.

345
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,010
You have become more and more mature.

346
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,300
I'm quite happy about it.

347
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,450
You are happy that Yu left?

348
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,510
No.

349
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,750
Let me tell you, you don't need to persuade me.

350
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,470
But deep down,

351
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,870
I do feel uncomfortable.

352
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,640
I think anyone else

353
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:10,740
would feel the same in my shoes.

354
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,530
We've known each other

355
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,230
and worked together

356
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,440
for such a long time.

357
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,070
Yes.

358
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,940
We never had any conflicts.

359
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,700
Yu is such a good person.

360
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,290
He fired him just like that.

361
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,110
Who does he think he is?

362
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,390
I'm telling you,

363
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,720
I want to get back at him.

364
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,710
But after thinking it through,

365
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,370
I don't think it's necessary.

366
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,110
Putting myself in his shoes,

367
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,310
I can sort of understand.

368
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,350
Forget it, let it go.

369
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,880
You can rest assured.

370
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,550
I definitely

371
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,950
won't cause trouble in the company.

372
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:43,670
Alright?

373
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,510
I'm relieved to hear you think that way.

374
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:56,400
If there's nothing else, I'll head out first.

375
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,710
Quan.

376
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,470
This morning,

377
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,910
I received an

378
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,450
important decision from the company.

379
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,950
Brother Quan, packing up?

380
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,110
Leaving early again?

381
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,850
I've been transferred to the headquarters.

382
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,750
Starting from tomorrow,

383
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,830
I will be Mr. Lyu's superior.

384
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,490
Congratulations, Brother Quan.

385
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,390
Brother,

386
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,450
I was wrong.

387
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,440
I was really wrong.

388
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,070
I hope you won't hold any grudges.

389
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,540
It's in the past.

390
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,150
Ding,

391
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,680
I have to give you a piece of advice.

392
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,340
I can understand young people wanting to get ahead.

393
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,870
But don't be too greedy.

394
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,940
To do great things,

395
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,830
walk the righteous path.

396
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,450
Don't go for instant gratification.

397
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,630
Those who commit many unjust acts will bring about their own ruin.

398
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,630
You're happy now,

399
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,400
but have you thought about the future?

400
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:22,800
Brother,

401
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,120
I'll remember that.

402
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:27,970
Can you forgive me?

403
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,310
I've never blamed you.

404
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,040
But you're an adult.

405
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,470
For everything you've done,

406
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,490
you have to take responsibility.

407
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,270
Lin.

408
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:42,750
Brother Quan.

409
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,470
The snacks in my drawer,

410
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,930
I'll leave them all to you.

411
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:47,450
Thank you, Brother Quan.

412
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,180
Brother Quan is so good to me.

413
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,310
This pillow of mine,

414
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,510
and the bedding and stuff,

415
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:52,830
everyone can share them.

416
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,270
Okay.

417
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,090
All right then.

418
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:55,420
I'll put it on right now.

419
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,590
Everyone,

420
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,150
we'll meet again.

421
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:05,850
Brother Quan!

422
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,480
Brother Quan!

423
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:11,030
Brother Quan!

424
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,730
Brother Quan!

425
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,390
Brother Quan!

426
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,870
Brother Quan!

427
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,370
What's all the fuss about?

428
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,950
Put your hands down.

429
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:30,270
Don't think that

430
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,480
just because you have some business skills,

431
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,880
you can do whatever you want in the company.

432
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:34,550
Listen up.

433
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,790
Here,

434
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,430
I call the shots.

435
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,390
If anyone doesn't follow the rules again,

436
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:42,830
they'll end up like Zhou Quan.

437
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,550
Mr. Lyu,

438
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:48,000
what happened to Brother Quan?

439
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:51,010
Wasn't he transferred to the headquarters?

440
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,800
That's what he told you?

441
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,270
Great, another crazy one.

442
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:06,970
Get back to work.

443
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,210
Honey.

444
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,750
Hey, honey.

445
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,360
Why are you so late today?

446
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:41,790
Still working overtime?

447
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,440
I'm sitting in the yard.

448
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,800
Can you see me?

449
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,090
What are you doing?

450
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,440
Are you out of your mind?

451
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:54,580
I'm coming in.

452
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,790
Have you been drinking?

453
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:25,230
Did you get a designated driver?

454
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,760
Tell me, what's wrong with you?

455
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,900
I got fired.

456
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:41,510
I'll go through the procedures in a couple of days.

457
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm sorry.

458
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,670
Go take a shower. You stink.

459
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:20,790
Mommy, fire! Fire!

460
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,230
Fire!

461
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,190
Run!

462
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,970
Run!

463
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,400
Run, go go go!

464
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,590
Put the lid on the pot!

465
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:37,830
Put the lid on the pot!

466
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:41,930
Turn off the stove!

467
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,800
What were you doing?

468
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,310
I wanted to fry an egg.

469
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,030
Then it caught on fire.

470
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,030
Do you know how to fry an egg?

471
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:56,690
No, I don't.

472
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,870
Why didn't you ask me?

473
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,930
You were sleeping.

474
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:00,190
What time is it?

475
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,640
It's 7 o'clock.

476
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,030
Why didn't my alarm go off?

477
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:03,870
I turned it off.

478
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:04,830
Then how did you wake up?

479
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,030
I didn't sleep at all.

480
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,600
Then let's make it together.

481
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,060
The pot is all burnt, let's order takeout.

482
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,870
Okay, I'll order.

483
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:17,510
What should we eat?

484
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,640
Fried dough sticks.

485
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,610
Fried dough sticks!

486
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:24,870
Fried dough sticks!

487
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,910
-Great!
-After eating fried dough sticks,

488
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:26,390
the two of us will

489
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,320
take you to school together, okay?

490
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,570
Dad, aren't you going to the company?

491
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,500
Not anymore.

492
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,990
I didn't do well at work.

493
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:33,840
I was fired.

494
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:36,350
What does 'fired' mean?

495
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,110
Being fired means I don't have a job anymore.

496
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,470
What happens when you don't have a job?

497
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,470
Without a job,

498
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,310
I can stay at home every day

499
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,370
and accompany you.

500
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,530
Not having a job is great!

501
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,150
Not having a job is great!

502
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,910
Go get Mom's slippers.

503
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:57,990
Coming.

504
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:02,390
Your head is too big.

505
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:04,290
Mom, here are your slippers.

506
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,480
Thank you, baby.

507
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,690
Let's eat fried dough sticks.

508
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,700
Go brush your teeth and wash your face by yourself.

509
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,190
Sir, stack them at the door first.

510
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:13,830
Then I'll tell you

511
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,390
where exactly to put them.

512
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,720
Carry your own bag.

513
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,830
Mom,

514
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,470
is this our home?

515
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,870
Yes, this is our new home.

516
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:20,670
Do you like it?

517
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:21,630
I hope

518
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,490
there are many children here.

519
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,470
Of course.

520
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,820
There are so many children here.

521
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,590
Mom, I'm a little hungry.

522
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,040
Then let's move quickly,

523
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,310
and mom will make you food right away.

524
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:33,880
Okay?

525
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,140
Hurry, hurry, come on.

526
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:38,030
Here, hold this for me.

527
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,710
Drag a box with you.

528
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,630
I'll take one.

529
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:42,760
Let's go.

530
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,730
Follow me.

531
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,670
Come on.

532
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,480
So what's your plan for the future?

533
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,910
Plans for the future...

534
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,410
Do you want to consider God's will?

535
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,800
What do you mean?

536
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:07,430
Come back and be the head of the household.

537
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,860
Temporarily be a stay-at-home dad.

538
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,120
Great minds think alike.

539
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,990
Really?

540
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,650
I was thinking the same thing.

541
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:17,770
In the past,

542
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,310
I didn't spend much time with the kid.

543
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,590
I can take this opportunity

544
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,550
to improve

545
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,870
our father-son relationship.

546
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:24,440
I think I can cultivate

547
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,130
his interest in learning too.

548
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,990
Do you know what I'm thinking?

549
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:29,590
Tell me.

550
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,150
The deposit has arrived.

551
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,470
Another 200,000 will arrive once I finish the book.

552
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,630
Meng Fei said if it sells well,

553
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,890
I will also get a bonus.

554
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,340
I'm telling you this

555
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,030
so you won't

556
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,000
feel any financial pressure.

557
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,200
At least for a year,

558
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,060
I can guarantee

559
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,350
our family's livelihood.

560
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:44,950
As for you,

561
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:46,590
you can think carefully about

562
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,990
what kind of job you want to find.

563
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,670
I don't want

564
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,920
you to find a job

565
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,230
that you don't really like

566
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:51,950
because of the financial burden

567
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,030
on the family.

568
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:55,950
Alright, regarding this matter between us,

569
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,550
we've reached an agreement.

570
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,020
The next difficult decision

571
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,030
is whether we should keep it from them for now.

572
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,430
My parents live far away,

573
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,430
so it's not hard to keep it from them

574
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,890
for a short period of time.

575
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:08,260
But your mom is close by.

576
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,080
We can't hide it from my mom.

577
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,110
We'll have to find a way to convince her.

578
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:16,310
Let's stock up on some fast-acting heart relief pills at home.

579
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,240
For my mum?

580
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:18,690
For all of us.

581
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,480
It won't be that bad.

582
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,210
I can persuade her.

583
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,910
Okay.

584
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:30,610
Checkmate.

585
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:36,790
When was your Chariot piece

586
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,440
here?

587
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:40,750
Zhao,

588
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,500
if you hadn't undone one of your moves just now,

589
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,110
you might not have

590
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,460
won this match.

591
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,950
Don't be a sore loser.

592
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,730
Alright. Let's leave it at that for now.

593
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,910
Wait for me to take a sip of water and we'll go again.

594
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:52,670
Seriously.

595
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,440
Ambushing me like that.

596
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,390
By the way, Zhao,

597
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,750
how is your son doing abroad?

598
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,140
My son is in the US.

599
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,470
He works in investment.

600
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,470
That place

601
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,950
is full of incredible people.

602
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:11,750
Zhou,

603
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:14,710
your kid has been a good student since he was young.

604
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,510
What kind of work is he doing now?

605
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,230
He's at a big company.

606
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,150
What company?

607
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,560
Never heard of it, have you?

608
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,920
A big company

609
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:24,830
is one that handles

610
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,830
IT-related work.

611
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:26,610
You could say that

612
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,380
the top IT talents in the country

613
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,110
are all there.

614
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,440
Isn't that right, Zhao?

615
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,420
As the saying goes,

616
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,350
raise sons to provide for old age.

617
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,310
But you both live

618
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,390
far away from your children.

619
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,830
It's not convenient for them to take care of you.

620
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,210
That's why my son wants me

621
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:41,470
to move to the US.

622
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,690
I didn't agree.

623
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:43,550
So he said

624
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:45,450
he'd get me a nanny

625
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,880
and a driver who could also be my translator.

626
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,760
As for my son,

627
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,390
he also said he'd buy me an apartment.

628
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,910
He said, "200 square meters should be enough, right?"

629
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,510
"As long as we live close by,"

630
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,170
"we can keep an eye on you and put our minds at ease."

631
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:55,790
"That's all that matters."

632
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,470
See?

633
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:58,910
Zhou,

634
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,430
you're really blessed.

635
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,630
In a big city like this,

636
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:05,110
being able to buy a 200-square-meter apartment

637
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,150
is no easy feat.

638
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,440
It's nothing to him.

639
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:10,850
He's even going to hire a nanny for us.

640
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:12,060
So are you going

641
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:12,990
or not?

642
00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:16,550
Dear colleagues,

643
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:17,880
today we are holding this

644
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,140
commendation meeting

645
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,870
especially for Meng.

646
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,180
In just two short years,

647
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,600
she has been able to cultivate top authors.

648
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,710
Meng's achievements are evident to all.

649
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,150
Meng.

650
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:35,820
You've been with the publishing house for so many years,

651
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:38,350
starting from scratch to where you are today.

652
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,390
You must have a lot of thoughts to share.

653
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:42,310
Come, tell everyone about it

654
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,790
and boost our morale.

655
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:44,950
Applause.

656
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:01,910
Thank you everyone for your support.

657
00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:03,460
I do have a lot of thoughts.

658
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,970
The thought I have the most

659
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,430
is gratitude.

660
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,070
I'm grateful to my colleagues at the publishing house

661
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,070
for their constant encouragement.

662
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,500
I'm grateful to the authors.

663
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,830
I'm grateful to myself.

664
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,020
I'm grateful that we didn't stop

665
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,540
when we were ignored, looked down upon,

666
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,840
and when our resources

667
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:22,400
were intercepted halfway.

668
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,190
If it weren't for your encouragement

669
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,120
and motivation,

670
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,070
I wouldn't have had any pressure.

671
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:26,740
Without pressure,

672
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,920
I wouldn't have made it to where I am today.

673
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,270
I hope you will continue to work hard

674
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,350
and achieve even greater success.

675
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,810
Please give me a bit more pressure

676
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,340
so that I can grow even more.

677
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,800
Thank you everyone.

678
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,510
Why do you

679
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,270
take everything so seriously?

680
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:48,770
It was too fake.

681
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,550
Yes,

682
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,990
your professional ability is strong.

683
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:02,120
That's a good thing.

684
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:05,150
But those with less outstanding

685
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,940
professional abilities

686
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,150
also have their own

687
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,100
way of survival.

688
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:12,070
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

689
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,660
In interpersonal interactions,

690
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,460
there is more than one standard.

691
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:19,640
If you can tolerate

692
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,870
things that are different from yourself,

693
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,300
that is true growth.

694
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,800
Understand?

695
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,440
If growth

696
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,140
means doing and saying things

697
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:33,710
against my will,

698
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,910
then I'd rather not grow.

699
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:40,570
President.

700
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,940
I still have next month's topic selection to do.

701
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,740
I'll go take care of those first.

702
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,070
You love eating pork, don't you?

703
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,000
Just remember this.

704
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,150
The garbage that pigs love to eat is called wet garbage.

705
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,070
The garbage that pigs don't like to eat is called dry garbage.

706
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:59,640
And the garbage that can be sold to buy pigs is called

707
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,050
recyclable garbage.

708
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,180
When buying vegetables,

709
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,230
you should go to the market on the east side,

710
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,430
because the vegetables there are both cheap and fresh.

711
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:06,380
At the beginning of each month,

712
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,120
you need to pay the utility bills

713
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,450
as well as the mortgage.

714
00:32:09,670 --> 00:32:11,800
Pay the internet fee in mid-February.

715
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,930
Disinfect Aiwen's toys

716
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,160
every half a month.

717
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:17,450
As for Mom's medicine,

718
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,770
you should pick it up once a month.

719
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:20,670
Got it?

720
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,240
What are you doing?

721
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,870
Didn't you ask me to record it?

722
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,830
I asked you to record the audio,

723
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,030
not the video.

724
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:27,790
But you're pretty.

725
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,750
You should have told me earlier. I would have put on some makeup.

726
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,390
These things are a bit complicated.

727
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:32,590
You don't need to rush.

728
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,080
You'll remember them gradually.

729
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:34,850
Okay, honey?

730
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,810
I've recorded it all down.

731
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:42,070
It's not that difficult, right?

732
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,080
It is difficult.

733
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,750
You've worked hard all these years.

734
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,550
It's not hard.

735
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:47,870
My work is not as hard as your job.

736
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:48,750
I don't have to face

737
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,950
those vicious bosses

738
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,320
and deal with those

739
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,610
scheming colleagues.

740
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,520
After I send Aiwen to the kindergarten,

741
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,040
I can

742
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,400
write the things I like.

743
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,700
A little world of my own,

744
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,310
all under my control.

745
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,060
I've just started,

746
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:05,400
and my waist and legs are already sore.

747
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,450
All these years,

748
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,490
do you really not feel wronged?

749
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,430
Not at all.

750
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,430
It's still a little bit difficult.

751
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,470
Don't worry, take it slow.

752
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,880
Oh right,

753
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,630
our house's drainage pipe

754
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,560
has some issues.

755
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,510
It's my fault.

756
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,030
I didn't fix it properly during the renovation.

757
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,990
Every week, you need to use the drain cleaner

758
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,830
to unclog it.

759
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,650
Remember to wear gloves.

760
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,350
Don't lean your head forward,

761
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,950
because that stuff is toxic.

762
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:45,270
Got it?

763
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,950
My mom is video calling.

764
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,070
Mom.

765
00:33:59,310 --> 00:33:59,790
Hello?

766
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,190
Lily, I'm fine.

767
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,500
I just wanted to ask you something.

768
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,310
Is Aiwen...

769
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,380
Why is Zhou Quan at home?

770
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,179
Is he off work?

771
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,170
Yes, that's right.

772
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:15,710
Mom.

773
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,270
Why is...

774
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:20,909
Why is

775
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,630
Zhou Quan wearing an apron?

776
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,130
What are you doing?

777
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:25,679
Helping Li with chores.

778
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,909
Mom, the signal seems a bit choppy...

779
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,280
Hello? Hello?

780
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:34,389
Li.

781
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:37,560
Can you see me?

782
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,370
I almost blinked.

783
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:42,870
I was suffocating.

784
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:46,659
What should we do?

785
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:47,810
Keep hiding it?

786
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,530
No more hiding.

787
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,159
Let's gradually break the news.

788
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:53,560
Don't overthink it.

789
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,469
I made a reservation at a popular restaurant.

790
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:56,360
Let's go out today

791
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,160
to splurge and enjoy ourselves.

792
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,120
Don't worry.

793
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,180
I'm sure you'll do an amazing job.

794
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,550
I have complete faith in you.

795
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,190
Mom.

796
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,440
Feifei, you're back.

797
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:25,070
Second Aunt, Mrs. Wang.

798
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,710
What are you doing?

799
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,910
Come here, come here.

800
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,170
There's something I need to tell you.

801
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,670
Come here.

802
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,560
Coming, coming.

803
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,710
Here's the thing, Feifei.

804
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,610
I have

805
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,950
a favor to ask of you.

806
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,360
There's this person.

807
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,720
He's my best friend's son.

808
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:46,380
I'd like you to help entertain him.

809
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,070
Entertain him?

810
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,110
Don't tell me.

811
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,180
You're setting me up on another blind date, aren't you?

812
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,240
A blind date is a blind date.

813
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,290
Why hide it?

814
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,950
It's not the first or second time anyway.

815
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,550
Go away.

816
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,550
What does he do for a living?

817
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,480
He started a company with his partner.

818
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,750
The company does something with... WC?

819
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:07,700
No, no.

820
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,070
MC?

821
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,310
Anyway, I don't really understand it.

822
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,580
He just manages a group of

823
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,550
streamers, influencers, and the like.

824
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,080
Sounds pretty impressive.

825
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:17,240
It's a multi-channel network, right?

826
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,570
Yes, yes, that's it.

827
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,310
Okay, that sounds interesting.

828
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,670
Send me the address.

829
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,560
What do you want to eat for dinner?

830
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,870
Do you want to eat tomato and scrambled eggs

831
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,470
or cucumber and scrambled eggs?

832
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,410
The property management really needs to take care of this.

833
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:34,540
The first flight of stairs is too high.

834
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,820
We've brought this up to them before, right?

835
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:37,020
It's even collapsed.

836
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,090
Tomato and scrambled eggs.

837
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:41,140
Then do you want sweet and sour pork ribs...

838
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,000
Do you live here?

839
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,080
-Yes.
-Yeah.

840
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,380
I moved here a couple of days ago.

841
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,560
What a coincidence.

842
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,740
-What a coincidence!
-Nuomi.

843
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,570
Greet them.

844
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,220
Do you still remember us?

845
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,070
Hello.

846
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:54,630
Are you familiar with the neighborhood?

847
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,180
Not very familiar yet.

848
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,650
The children's area is over there.

849
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:58,870
People usually bring their kids

850
00:36:58,870 --> 00:36:59,930
to play over there.

851
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,110
Right, it's just that one area.

852
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,180
-It's not a big place.
-The neighborhood, yes.

853
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:02,790
Okay.

854
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,820
And then there are many

855
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,550
stray cats you can feed over there.

856
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,710
What a coincidence.

857
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,330
Then let's make plans for the kids to play together

858
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:08,890
next time.

859
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:10,050
Sure, you can also come to our house to play.

860
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:10,650
We live in Block One,

861
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:11,650
Unit 102.

862
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,310
We live right there.

863
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:12,910
Okay.

864
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:13,870
Alright.

865
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,110
Are you going out?

866
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:15,790
We were just about to head out.

867
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,650
Yes, we're going to eat.

868
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,150
Okay.

869
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:17,840
Then we'll see you next time.

870
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,640
-Okay.
-Okay.

871
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,540
Say goodbye to them.

872
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,630
-Bye. Bye.
-Bye.

873
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,670
What a coincidence. Bye.

874
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,900
-Hello.
-My surname is Meng.

875
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,430
This is your reserved seat.

876
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,390
Thank you.

877
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,230
I'll have a glass of lemonade.

878
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:48,870
Okay.

879
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,310
Sorry about that.

880
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,050
My friend had something to take care of.

881
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,310
Where were we just now?

882
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,230
You said you and your senior were

883
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,750
already working before graduation.

884
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,080
Were you not worried that

885
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,740
it would affect your studies?

886
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:04,560
It was a concern.

887
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,700
Here is your lemonade.

888
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,290
Thank you.

889
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,330
But I felt the timing for starting a business

890
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,240
was fleeting.

891
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,980
Studying can always be done later.

892
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,400
But you dropped out of college.

893
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,570
That kind of education background

894
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,100
doesn't look good on paper.

895
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,120
May I ask who is looking?

896
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,470
For myself, it's good enough.

897
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:31,270
If you want to compare me with Bill Gates

898
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,120
or Zuckerberg,

899
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,590
then it's indeed not good enough.

900
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,750
To me, education and degrees

901
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,170
are just springboards for finding a job.

902
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:37,100
I've found one now,

903
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,210
and I'm quite satisfied with it.

904
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,300
Is this

905
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,900
how you always talk?

906
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,760
Or do you have a bias against me?

907
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,520
I don't have much bias against you.

908
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,430
But I can see

909
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,080
that you may have

910
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,670
a little bit of bias against me.

911
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,740
Am I right?

912
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,870
The fact that I dropped out of college

913
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:55,330
shows that I'm not diligent in doing things.

914
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:56,430
I'm not steady

915
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,480
and easily give up halfway.

916
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,000
Giving up studying to chase after profit

917
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,360
shows that I'm a bit eager for quick success and instant benefits.

918
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,690
Plus, in my line of work,

919
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:06,280
I often come across some

920
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,010
young and pretty girls.

921
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,440
So all in all,

922
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,110
I'm probably not

923
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,910
a suitable marriage candidate.

924
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,630
Hello, could I borrow a light?

925
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,390
Thanks.

926
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,590
Since this is your attitude,

927
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,120
then why

928
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,150
did you even come to this blind date?

929
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,230
Since you asked,

930
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,560
I'll tell you the truth.

931
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,100
The reason I came today

932
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:28,890
is because

933
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,170
the restaurant you chose

934
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:32,750
has great food.

935
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:34,050
Their steak is particularly great.

936
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,580
Let me cut you a piece to try.

937
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,200
You're leaving?

938
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:43,640
Isn't this a waste?

939
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:50,830
Waiter,

940
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,140
could you please take this to that table over there?

941
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:53,740
Thank you.

942
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,390
Sorry, sorry.

943
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,410
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

944
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:03,820
Oh, it's you.

945
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,790
So now the number one candidate

946
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,110
has been eliminated,

947
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,700
and I'm the backup, right?

948
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,280
I was enjoying myself and watching the drama unfold,

949
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,050
but then I realized

950
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:16,510
I'm also part of the drama.

951
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,930
Now I'm finding it a bit hard to digest.

952
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,490
Mr. Executive,

953
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:23,170
I thought I was being dismissive enough,

954
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,740
but you're doing this round-robin style.

955
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:26,510
Isn't it a bit

956
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,400
disrespectful to women?

957
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,150
No, listen to me.

958
00:40:30,410 --> 00:40:31,100
This is a misunderstanding.

959
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,440
I was forced to come here.

960
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,720
Yes, of course.

961
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,050
Everyone's being forced.

962
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,570
The scumbaggery is out of this world.

963
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,350
Alright, you can go.

964
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,310
Why should I be the one to leave?

965
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,460
Given the current situation,

966
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,790
do you think we can still

967
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,630
proceed with the blind date?

968
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:51,990
Moreover, you happily risked

969
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,280
being called a scumbag

970
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:54,430
just to eat here.

971
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,190
I'm really curious about the taste

972
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,480
of this restaurant's food.

973
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,010
Right? You're curious too.

974
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,510
The food here is amazing.

975
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,950
That's why even if you ask me to go,

976
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:03,730
I cannot leave

977
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,060
before I finish my food.

978
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:05,750
Besides,

979
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,700
you have no intention of going on a blind date,

980
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,960
and I have no plans to court anyone.

981
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:10,720
In that case,

982
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,070
let's just make do this time

983
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,070
and share a table.

984
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:16,950
Do you have another date after this?

985
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,080
You're the last one.

986
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,880
Waiter, order, please.

987
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:30,980
Come, have a taste.

988
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:31,910
Thanks, no need.

989
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:44,640
Thanks, no need.

990
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,030
Isn't there an old saying?

991
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,160
It takes ten years of cultivation to cross the river in the same boat.

992
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,630
This is our second meeting.

993
00:41:58,630 --> 00:41:59,520
Anyway,

994
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,510
we can say there is some fate between us.

995
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,500
You can say that I'm offering you a slice of beef

996
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,430
and a cup of water

997
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,350
to return the favor for your lighter.

998
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:06,880
You don't have to be so cold.

999
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,440
It's not about that.

1000
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,090
I have hands and feet.

1001
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,230
I don't want to trouble you.

1002
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,360
I don't want to pretend to be weak

1003
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:15,920
to satisfy your

1004
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,400
chauvinistic vanity.

1005
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:21,760
Now I know

1006
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,330
why your colleagues

1007
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,630
say those things about you.

1008
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:25,290
You really speak too bluntly.

1009
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:28,990
Thank you for your compliment.

1010
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:29,620
I always feel that

1011
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:30,750
this is my strength.

1012
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,550
After hearing your conversation just now,

1013
00:42:33,550 --> 00:42:35,770
it's hard for me not to have prejudice against you.

1014
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,070
If you don't want to be targeted,

1015
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:37,870
I advise you to

1016
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,180
eat more meat and talk less.

1017
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:43,750
Miss Meng,

1018
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,470
actually there's no need for you to

1019
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:46,670
be so sharp-tongued.

1020
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,630
I admit,

1021
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,800
you're smart and beautiful.

1022
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,190
It's normal for you to be

1023
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,120
a bit conceited.

1024
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:54,070
But everything has a bottom line.

1025
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,090
Not all men

1026
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,270
can unconditionally tolerate

1027
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,480
a beautiful woman's every action.
