[Episode 4]

4
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,110
Mr. Executive,

5
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:44,920
I think

6
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,390
you might have misunderstood.

7
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,110
Whether I'm pretty or not,

8
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,550
smart or not,

9
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,580
it has nothing to do with you.

10
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,550
My appearance

11
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,050
is not for men like you

12
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,330
to judge.

13
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:55,890
I prefer to focus on

14
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,820
my own feelings

15
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,090
rather than others' opinions.

16
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:58,910
I hold myself in high regard

17
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,150
because I have confidence,

18
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,880
not because of your tolerance.

19
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,310
You are so aggressive.

20
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,370
I don't like it at all.

21
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,300
But

22
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,229
I can't find any reason

23
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:11,350
to argue against you.

24
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,390
Indeed.

25
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,160
Being used to granting favors,

26
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,030
you've long forgotten

27
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,150
what it's like to communicate as equals.

28
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,150
Let's be fair

29
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,470
and avoid double standards.

30
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,070
If a woman

31
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,260
wants to live her life fiercely,

32
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,420
that's her right.

33
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,990
Why should she care whether men

34
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,250
can tolerate it or not?

35
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,520
When you

36
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,480
make dirty jokes

37
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,990
or discuss your dates in public,

38
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,910
do you ever consider

39
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,940
whether women can tolerate it?

40
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,070
So, isn't it a double standard when you generalize

41
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,329
and criticize all men?

42
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,790
If a man has standards for women,

43
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,630
he's condemned,

44
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,360
but if a woman

45
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,770
has standards for men,

46
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,310
it's completely acceptable?

47
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,070
According to your logic,

48
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,079
in the future,

49
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,660
one would be invincible

50
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,410
as long as she is a woman.

51
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,480
Which ear of yours

52
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,510
heard me say that?

53
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,230
Do you know what the biggest difference

54
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,670
between us is?

55
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,670
It’s that I don’t care

56
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,790
about your life at all.

57
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,640
Whether you’re arrogant, indulgent, or a jerk,

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,579
it has nothing

59
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,829
to do with me.

60
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,080
As long as you don’t break the law,

61
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,900
I respect you.

62
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,350
But you?

63
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,610
You always want to lecture me,

64
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,340
trying to regulate my behavior

65
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,570
based on your needs.

66
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:08,790
You’re not even a woman,

67
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,270
so what gives you the right to teach me how to be one?

68
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,890
Fine, you said that.

69
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,990
Let’s be fair.

70
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,750
Same goes for you.

71
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,180
You’re not even a man,

72
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,510
yet you're teaching me

73
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,490
how to be one, right?

74
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,020
What are you doing here?

75
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,250
Why are you here?

76
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,270
What are you two doing here?

77
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:34,070
Stop laughing.

78
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,350
We’re both older and unmarried.

79
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,100
What’s wrong with us going on a blind date?

80
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,460
If you keep laughing, I'm going to lose it.

81
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,240
Come on.

82
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,910
Is it necessary?

83
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,750
Let's be serious.

84
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,390
Let me introduce her properly.

85
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,700
This is Meng Fei,

86
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:47,950
a good friend of mine

87
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,610
and also my executive editor.

88
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,120
She’s the coolest woman

89
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,829
I know.

90
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,950
Then let me introduce him as well.

91
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:55,590
Yuan Yi,

92
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,310
the most

93
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,270
wild...

94
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,760
ly romantic man

95
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,590
I’ve ever met in this world.

96
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,580
He is my younger brother.

97
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,710
He is the younger brother of his ex-girlfriend.

98
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,870
They are very, very,

99
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,790
very close.

100
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,350
I like the description of "wild".

101
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,150
It's accurate.

102
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,480
If being cool means

103
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,740
not caring about other people's feelings,

104
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,670
then I also think that's accurate.

105
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,440
What are you two

106
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:19,070
here for today?

107
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,019
It’s really hilarious.

108
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:21,709
The key point is,

109
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,370
why are two people who don’t want to get married

110
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,620
doing this?

111
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,960
You don't want to get married?

112
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,020
You don't want to get married either?

113
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,230
Why is that?

114
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,990
Why should I tell you?

115
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,080
What are you doing?

116
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,090
Be sincere.

117
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,830
Share your viewpoint with her.

118
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,750
For me,

119
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:42,990
it's because I lack confidence

120
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,510
in spending a lifetime with one woman

121
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,070
and don’t have

122
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,670
the desire to start a family.

123
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,090
Mainly,

124
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,520
I believe that

125
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,350
the best kind of romantic relationship

126
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,330
is dating—

127
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,800
a limited partnership

128
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,190
where each party gets what they need

129
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,570
without excessive demands

130
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,970
on each other or oneself.

131
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:58,110
Unlike marriage,

132
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,990
which is a deep binding

133
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,150
with low tolerance for errors

134
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,910
and high risks

135
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,310
without guaranteed benefits.

136
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,950
That’s why I choose not to marry.

137
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,810
I'm different.

138
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,510
I respect marriage and believe in love,

139
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,350
but I don't think

140
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,550
I need them in my life.

141
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,550
I have a job, which can support me

142
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,720
and meet most of my needs

143
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,480
in life.

144
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,580
If one plus one

145
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,650
doesn’t add up to more than two,

146
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,050
why should I get married?

147
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,830
According to my personal experience,

148
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:21,620
living with someone

149
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,800
is definitely not as comfortable as living alone.

150
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,300
I’m used to being free,

151
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,320
and I don’t want to change, nor can I.

152
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,590
Are you perhaps

153
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,790
a bit afraid of marriage?

154
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,790
For those of us who have been married...

155
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,350
I think the two of us are doing just fine.

156
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,490
That’s because you’re lucky

157
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,420
to have met our Li.

158
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:39,950
No, no, no.

159
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,070
I'm quite lucky too.

160
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,010
No, no, no.

161
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,650
My ancestors were all lucky.

162
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,540
Alright, we are leaving.

163
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,040
Drive slowly and be careful.

164
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,670
-Bye.
-Okay.

165
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,370
Bye, Li.

166
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:57,470
Focus on your article when you're back.

167
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,070
The night is still young.

168
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:59,450
You don’t need to take care of the kids,

169
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:00,370
or write.

170
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:01,020
Cherry.

171
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,310
Bye.

172
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,750
We haven’t reached a conclusion yet.

173
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,590
Let's go somewhere else.

174
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,250
Do you dare?

175
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,510
Let's go.

176
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,650
Yuan Yi was so embarrassed today.

177
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,110
He truly got bullied by me.

178
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:27,510
Meng Fei wasn’t much better off.

179
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,870
A blind date? Oh my gosh.

180
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,630
So old-fashioned,

181
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:32,990
and we ran into it.

182
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,050
The key is that those two were on a blind date.

183
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,150
Two weirdos.

184
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,310
I really think that scene

185
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,170
was hilarious.

186
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,200
When I was eating—

187
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,330
it wasn’t intentional, Honey—

188
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,090
every time I saw those two,

189
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,270
I just wanted to laugh.

190
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,190
Just consider it a joke.

191
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,150
I don’t think they’ll last long.

192
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,550
They're just having fun.

193
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:47,909
Not necessarily.

194
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,450
I actually think they

195
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,350
might have a chance.

196
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,970
What’s the basis for that theory?

197
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,670
Look,

198
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,880
let’s start

199
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,159
with the atmosphere at the scene.

200
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,510
Even though they were both glaring

201
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:58,970
at each other,

202
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,180
if either of them really wanted to leave,

203
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,020
they would have found an excuse and left.

204
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,050
But they didn’t;

205
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,470
they kept sitting there.

206
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:05,680
Don’t you think the atmosphere

207
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,070
was very subtle and strange?

208
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,590
I know.

209
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:10,550
I know my brother.

210
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,450
A temporary liking

211
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,440
doesn’t mean it will last long.

212
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,330
He is extremely insecure.

213
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,420
He’s not a bad kid.

214
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,390
But a girl like Meng Fei,

215
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,430
I think…

216
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,790
Let's make a bet.

217
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:23,830
What's the bet?

218
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,330
They won’t last more than a month.

219
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,960
The loser gives the winner a ten-minute massage before bed.

220
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,800
Make it half an hour.

221
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:34,950
I love your

222
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,430
confidence and optimism.

223
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,750
How about an hour? Do you dare?

224
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,610
Honey, can your body handle that?

225
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:42,420
Let’s go home and find out.

226
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:43,510
Drive faster then.

227
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,080
Mommy.

228
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,830
It hurts.

229
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:43,909
It hurts.

230
00:08:43,929 --> 00:08:44,730
What's wrong?

231
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,120
What happened?

232
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,670
It hurts. It really hurts.

233
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,890
What happened?

234
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,750
Mommy, Daddy is abusing me.

235
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:54,950
What kind of false accusation is this?

236
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,350
Why would he abuse you?

237
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:58,140
Wasn't I just giving you a bath?

238
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,380
I don't want you.

239
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,510
-I want Mommy. Go away.
-Aiwen.

240
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,400
Let your mom bathe you then.

241
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,260
So hard to please.

242
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,190
How can you

243
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:13,130
talk to your dad like that

244
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,730
when he's taking care of you?

245
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,840
It hurts his feelings,

246
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,680
you know?

247
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,580
Dad just grabbed the wrong scrubbing cloth.

248
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,570
You could have said,

249
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,200
"Daddy,

250
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,670
I actually use this one."

251
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,200
Got it?

252
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,830
Got it.

253
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,710
When you talk like that,

254
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,310
it really hurts your dad.

255
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,820
Does this feel comfortable? Does it hurt?

256
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,550
Comfortable. It doesn't hurt.

257
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,210
Make sure to rub the oil evenly.

258
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,180
Mommy will check later,

259
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:37,820
got it?

260
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,110
Hurry up. Don't catch a cold.

261
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,150
Okay.

262
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,510
What's wrong? Are you feeling down?

263
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,440
He used to always cry for me.

264
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,670
But when I start taking care of him,

265
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,150
he always puts me down.

266
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,700
When I write code,

267
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,270
as long as I'm bold and meticulous,

268
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,480
I get applause

269
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,640
and admiring looks.

270
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,930
Taking care of a kid

271
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,030
is so troublesome.

272
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,080
Maybe I should

273
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,140
just go back to work?

274
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,010
Really?

275
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,080
Are you giving up so soon?

276
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,530
I've been intentionally staying out of it

277
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,120
the past few days,

278
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,240
just to see

279
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,990
what your strengths

280
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,120
and weaknesses are.

281
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,270
Don’t worry about your weaknesses.

282
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,860
I’m here to teach you.

283
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,680
You’re so smart,

284
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,590
you’ll pick it up quickly.

285
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,390
Then tell me about my strengths.

286
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,760
When you take care of the kid,

287
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,640
you show a lot of masculine wisdom

288
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,500
and charm.

289
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,490
With you around, Aiwen will

290
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,390
definitely become

291
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:35,060
more responsible and brave.

292
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,480
That’s the honest truth.

293
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,270
Let me tell you something about this kid.

294
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,440
When I was having a duel with him,

295
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,370
he used a tactic.

296
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,630
What tactic?

297
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,420
He started by pulling down my pants.

298
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,640
What a bad habit.

299
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,690
You call that a tactic?

300
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,330
Don’t worry about whether it's a bad habit.

301
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,550
This can be corrected later.

302
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,990
But his approach was correct.

303
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:52,790
Given my size,

304
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,190
he definitely had to pull down my pants first.

305
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,090
That showed his intelligence?

306
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:55,820
Of course.

307
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,390
See?

308
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,190
This is the difference between Dad's thinking

309
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,310
and Mom's thinking.

310
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,040
If it were me,

311
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,070
I’d only see

312
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:02,830
his bad habit.

313
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,230
I’d educate and criticize him,

314
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,360
but I might not

315
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,450
see his other side.

316
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,430
That makes sense.

317
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,430
It’s all red. It was scrubbed red.

318
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,590
Mommy, come in

319
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,630
and sleep with me.

320
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,240
Does he think he’s the king

321
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,480
of the house?

322
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:23,040
I'll start working.

323
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,620
Go for it, Honey.

324
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,340
Mommy is here.

325
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,360
You’re the enemy.

326
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,550
I want Mommy!

327
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,840
Do you want to hear the story of Pinocchio?

328
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,520
I want Mommy!

329
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,910
Do you want to hear the story of Pinocchio?

330
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,680
Okay.

331
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:36,910
Let me see where it's red.

332
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,600
Here.

333
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,270
You scratched it yourself, okay?

334
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,950
It was clear that you scrubbed it red.

335
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,320
Once upon a time, there was a little wooden boy.

336
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,390
His name was Pinocchio.

337
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,510
Jerry!

338
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,030
The usual.

339
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:56,810
Alright.

340
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,350
Do you like me?

341
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,030
What did you say?

342
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:07,790
I said,

343
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,390
do you like me?

344
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,840
You're drunk, aren't you?

345
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,150
Not even a little bit.

346
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,670
Keep dancing?

347
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,130
Let's go.

348
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:15,930
Keep dancing!

349
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,380
Let's go.

350
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,660
You said you'd...

351
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,130
take me away.

352
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,990
Why did you bring me here instead?

353
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,480
Isn't this place good?

354
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,560
How did we get here?

355
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,220
Blind date.

356
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,340
Blind date?

357
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,400
Yes, blind date.

358
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,470
Here.

359
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:53,820
Don't move.

360
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,760
What are you doing?

361
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,060
Don't move.

362
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,130
What are you doing?

363
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,260
I'm tying your hair.

364
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,530
It's all dirty.

365
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,080
Looks good.

366
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:05,940
You're a man.

367
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,120
Where did you get the hair tie?

368
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,790
Did a woman

369
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,870
leave it for you?

370
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,520
It's mine.

371
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,550
I use it to tie my hair when I work out.

372
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:13,940
It's all sweaty.

373
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,030
So gross.

374
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,290
It's not gross.

375
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,850
As always, really.

376
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:22,870
Bye.

377
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:23,490
Thank you.

378
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,890
Let's have a drink.

379
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,670
When you were on blind dates,

380
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,540
did you ever encounter anything fun,

381
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,780
weird, or odd?

382
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,510
I once met a woman

383
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,210
who was a returnee.

384
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,470
What is your...

385
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,630
I can't remember it's Chinese name.

386
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,610
What's your air control system?

387
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,630
It was exactly like it.

388
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:50,410
Really.

389
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,720
What about you? Did you?

390
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:55,630
When we were on a blind date, he asked me,

391
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,120
"Do you like dogs?"

392
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,230
I said it was okay.

393
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,570
Then he said, "Let's get married."

394
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,830
Later, he told me

395
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,950
that he was looking for a wife

396
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,320
just to find a companion

397
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,190
for his dog.

398
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,350
Isn't that so crazy?

399
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,430
So,

400
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,630
dogs are not okay.

401
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,350
What about horses?

402
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,180
Horses are okay. A white horse is fine.

403
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,710
I'm not going on blind dates

404
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,520
for anything else;

405
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,310
I just want to find true love.

406
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,470
Do I look like

407
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,730
I'm short of people to date?

408
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:29,460
I don't.

409
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,210
But really,

410
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,190
I must wait

411
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,300
for the right one to come.

412
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,310
I just want to find true love.

413
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,250
Is that too much to ask?

414
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,990
Absolutely not, it's not too much at all.

415
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,990
To true love. To white horses.

416
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,030
To Sun Wukong and Zhu Bajie!

417
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,900
♫The White Dragon Horse is heading west♫

418
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:49,920
♫Carrying Tang Sanzang♫

419
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,190
♫Followed by his three disciples♫

420
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,910
♫On their journey to the Western Paradise to retrieve the Scripture♫

421
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:59,110
♫They travel thousands of miles♫

422
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,310
Let me sleep a little longer

423
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,440
Just a little longer

424
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,830
Get up!

425
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,970
What are you doing?

426
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,520
Yesterday, we...

427
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,550
I don't think we...

428
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,390
We didn't do anything last night, did we?

429
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,520
No, I don't think so.

430
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,390
Yours.

431
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,820
Why is this here?

432
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,840
Did you bring the luggage here last night?

433
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,390
Who booked the room?

434
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,040
I think it was me.

435
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,070
I don't remember.

436
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,150
Let's split the cost.

437
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:54,980
No need.

438
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,710
When I book a room, I don't split the cost.

439
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,240
Being all macho again, huh?

440
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,370
How is that being macho?

441
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:01,680
It's not much money.

442
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,460
It's not about the money. It's about fairness.

443
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,900
Forget it. I'm leaving.

444
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,790
I'll settle the bill.

445
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,510
Wait!

446
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,550
I'll leave first,

447
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,790
and you leave half an hour later.

448
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,470
Got it?

449
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,270
Alright then.

450
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,460
As long as you're happy.

451
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:18,500
Hand me the phone.

452
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,319
You dropped it yourself and blamed me?

453
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,920
Don't tell anyone else.

454
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,670
Don't worry.

455
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:33,190
If you don't say anything, I won't tell others.

456
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,240
The matchmaker, my aunt and others.

457
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,120
What happened?

458
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,070
What's this?

459
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:57,830
Daddy,

460
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,980
are my big wontons ready?

461
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,790
Yes.

462
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,860
Big wontons are coming.

463
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:04,950
Please have a seat.

464
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,420
My big wontons.

465
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,800
Open the lid!

466
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,710
Mommy!

467
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:14,690
Why are you yelling?

468
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,840
These aren't big wontons at all.

469
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:18,230
We...

470
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,150
Only southerners eat big wontons.

471
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:20,880
We Shandong people

472
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,010
prefer noodle soup.

473
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:24,390
You started with the big wontons?

474
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,510
Honey, you're quite something.

475
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,560
But in the video

476
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,790
it was pretty simple.

477
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,610
How come they fell apart when I cooked them?

478
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:30,760
At least the filling

479
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:31,630
is still good.

480
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:32,250
Really?

481
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,270
-Yeah. Try it.
-Let me try it for you.

482
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:34,710
Okay.

483
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:37,050
It might actually be good.

484
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,750
Yes.

485
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,430
Noodle soup is easy to digest.

486
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:47,920
Is it good?

487
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,730
It's definitely not good.

488
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,650
Isn't this salt?

489
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,190
Why don't you taste it and find out?

490
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,800
So sweet.

491
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,350
Honey, start with what you know.

492
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,380
Don’t begin with

493
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,710
something too difficult.

494
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,440
But I have to learn everything.

495
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,090
I picked the hardest one,

496
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,060
hoping for an unexpected success.

497
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,640
Let’s not learn

498
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,030
when our kid urgently needs to eat,

499
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,630
okay?

500
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,390
Take your time to learn at home after you send him off.

501
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:12,920
Alright.

502
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,870
So, should we order takeout then?

503
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,420
I can fix this.

504
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:17,780
Come with me.

505
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,420
Okay.

506
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,990
Mommy, I'm hungry.

507
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,270
Son, I need at most ten minutes,

508
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:25,870
okay?

509
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,110
Stop.

510
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,220
You didn’t come home last night.

511
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,710
Where have you been?

512
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
I was...

513
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,630
Don't tell me

514
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,410
you went to the publishing house.

515
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,870
The president said you didn’t show up at all.

516
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,970
No, I...

517
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,190
Well, I...

518
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,410
I went out for dinner yesterday, right?

519
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,630
I accidentally

520
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,680
ran into my writer

521
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,830
at that restaurant.

522
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,340
After we finished eating,

523
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:29,630
I went...

524
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,030
went... with...

525
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,230
with her to her place to keep her company while she worked.

526
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,310
Really?

527
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:37,340
Look,

528
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,290
I have...

529
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,430
I have this as proof.

530
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,160
This is true.

531
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,950
Here, look.

532
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,660
Right, see?

533
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,270
Right?

534
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:48,010
I happened to run into her.

535
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,890
Why do you think you’re not suitable for each other?

536
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,670
She’s a high-achiever

537
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:54,960
who studied abroad,

538
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,280
graduated from a prestigious university,

539
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,730
and now has a decent job.

540
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,470
Why is she not suitable for you?

541
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,790
A prestigious university?

542
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,500
She seems more like a sports school graduate.

543
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,930
She runs faster than anyone.

544
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,250
Yi,

545
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,650
the news says

546
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,670
that for older single men like you,

547
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,070
finding a partner is extremely difficult.

548
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:12,350
You're already 30.

549
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,110
It's time to settle down and start a family.

550
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,550
Once you have a family,

551
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,870
I can relax

552
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,740
and finally

553
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:20,430
join your late grandparents.

554
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,400
Mom, don't say that.

555
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,280
What have I

556
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:24,630
been working so hard for?

557
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,060
Isn't it all for your happiness?

558
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,260
You have to live well.

559
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,640
Then you must find me

560
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,310
a reliable daughter-in-law quickly.

561
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,200
Since you brought it up,

562
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,730
I need to say something too.

563
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:33,830
Don't arrange

564
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:35,190
your blind date.

565
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:37,190
You scheduled two dates

566
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:37,970
at the same time and place.

567
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:38,720
It was so embarrassing.

568
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,520
Who does that?

569
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:40,930
Didn’t you go for a walk

570
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:42,320
with Yuan

571
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,150
to get to know each other better?

572
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,940
We just didn’t hit it off.

573
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,790
So...

574
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:50,220
Why didn't you hit it off?

575
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,000
What don't you like about him?

576
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,320
Because just like me,

577
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,250
she doesn't want to get married either.

578
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,080
She just went there because her parents asked her to.

579
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,850
Don’t assume everyone is like you.

580
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,450
Try to get to know her better.

581
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:01,910
We’ve only met once.

582
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,040
It’s not necessary.

583
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,190
Right?

584
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,630
You guys should go to bed early.

585
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,960
You've woken up, right?

586
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,780
Good morning, good morning.

587
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,170
Outrageous.

588
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,590
Everyone is tired of

589
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,030
things like

590
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,110
"alpha boss's love."

591
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:21,990
Besides, personally,

592
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,480
I’m not really a fan either.

593
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,560
So this time, I want to write about

594
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:27,760
a relationship that shows

595
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,120
how two mature people

596
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,350
handle it

597
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,100
when love meets reality.

598
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:33,990
I want both characters

599
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,260
to be strong.

600
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,040
I want it to be a clash of strong personalities from the start,

601
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,700
an intense situation right from the beginning.

602
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,130
What are you doing?

603
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,790
Editor Meng, who considers

604
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,670
even breathing a waste of time

605
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,000
during work,

606
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:52,830
are you slacking off?

607
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,790
I’m sorry.

608
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,390
I’m not in the best shape today.

609
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,130
I listened.

610
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,510
You made some good points,

611
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,290
quite innovative.

612
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,350
Did you really listen?

613
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,190
I did.

614
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,230
Really?

615
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,380
Should I write in that direction then?

616
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:05,710
No problem.

617
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,310
Let's give it a try.

618
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,590
If it doesn’t work out,

619
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,800
we’ll figure out another way.

620
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,930
After dinner yesterday,

621
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,990
did you have any contact with Yuan Yi?

622
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,440
No.

623
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:26,310
Fine.

624
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,810
Why is your Zhou Quan

625
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,690
so close with Yuan Yi?

626
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,300
They’re not even on the same page.

627
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,460
Are you asking this question

628
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,890
because you're interested

629
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,450
in my husband or Yuan Yi?

630
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,740
I guess it’s Yuan Yi.

631
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,040
I don’t know much about him.

632
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,160
What I do know is,

633
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:48,480
firstly,

634
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,720
that my husband really gets along well with him.

635
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,790
That means

636
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,190
his character should be fine;

637
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:53,690
otherwise,

638
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,350
Zhou Quan wouldn’t be so close with him.

639
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,510
Secondly, he’s tall and good-looking,

640
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,380
as you’ve seen.

641
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,110
Thirdly,

642
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,140
he’s quite good at making money

643
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,200
and has strong professional skills.

644
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:06,670
That’s all I know.

645
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,440
Are you interested in him?

646
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:11,530
Yes, I am.

647
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,130
Really?

648
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,630
Yes, I’m really interested.

649
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,630
I want to sign him

650
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,460
and publish a book for him

651
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,220
called The Master of Time Management.

652
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,640
It’s going to be a hit for sure.

653
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,860
Your mouth

654
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,460
is really mean.

655
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Come and catch me!

656
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:35,990
come on, come on!

657
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:42,000
Snacks are here. Everyone, come quickly!

658
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,070
Daddy, I want some. I want some.

659
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,140
Actually, I think your Zhou Quan

660
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,740
is quite good in this regard.

661
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,160
Many men believe

662
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,590
that family and children

663
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,940
should be women’s responsibility.

664
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,210
But Zhou Quan actually thinks

665
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:53,130
quite clearly about this.

666
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,240
Really. I'm telling you.

667
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,120
I think my husband

668
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,120
is very broad-minded in this aspect.

669
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,040
He’s really different

670
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,840
from most men.

671
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,540
So now, with you charging ahead

672
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,150
and him taking on the role of a stay-at-home dad

673
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,380
and handling family responsibilities,

674
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,350
isn’t that

675
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:04,090
a natural progression?

676
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,090
It's pretty good.

677
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,060
Everything is the best arrangement, I suppose.

678
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,120
[Purchase List]

679
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:41,550
Honey,

680
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,900
don’t buy so many vegetables

681
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,540
at the market in one go.

682
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,220
We only have

683
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,350
a few people in the house.

684
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,190
If we can’t finish them,

685
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,450
the vegetables won’t be fresh anymore.

686
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,310
Will you throw them away

687
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,110
or not?

688
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,930
It’s really wasteful, you know?

689
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,790
Also, I asked you to buy soft-shelled turtles.

690
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,800
But why did you

691
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,240
buy two little turtles instead?

692
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,630
Soft-shelled turtles are too ugly.

693
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,550
And...

694
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,660
I can’t bring myself to eat them.

695
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,720
These little turtles are so much fun.

696
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,720
Let’s keep them as pets.

697
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,070
I’ve already named them:

698
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,830
Packy and Wacky.

699
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,930
Wacky escaped from prison successfully.

700
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:08,990
It’s the smart one.

701
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,370
Packy

702
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,920
was very anxious and angry.

703
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,090
And for the water celery,

704
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,630
don’t buy this kind next time.

705
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:17,980
Pinch it with your fingers.

706
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,080
It’s too old.

707
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,260
It will taste bad when stir-fried.

708
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,460
Our kid won’t like it.

709
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:22,340
Packy.

710
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,430
Packy.

711
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,610
You scared me to death,

712
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:27,610
Honey. What if it bites me?

713
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:29,420
Can you please be serious?

714
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,150
Okay.

715
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,210
This is a job.

716
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,900
This job is not that easy.

717
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,370
It's not as simple as you think.

718
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,400
Now the whole family's well-being

719
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,370
is in your hands.

720
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:41,270
Do you understand?

721
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:41,930
I got it, Honey.

722
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:42,810
With your attitude

723
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,540
and ability,

724
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,370
when my mom sees it,

725
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,560
she definitely won’t agree

726
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,910
to entrust Zhou Aiwen to you.

727
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,230
This is not a joke.

728
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:48,990
I see.

729
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,580
Packy.

730
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,470
What is this?

731
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,080
Garlic sprouts.

732
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,000
Water celery, water celery.

733
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,720
I disagree.

734
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,130
I totally disagree.

735
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,960
He got fired, so he should go find another job.

736
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,560
Why stay at home taking care of the kid?

737
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,760
How can I face others?

738
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:09,310
When people ask,

739
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,130
"What does your son-in-law do?"

740
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,310
"My son-in-law stays at home taking care of the kid

741
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,070
and lives off my daughter."

742
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,320
How can I face others?

743
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,460
He stays at home taking care of the kid.

744
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,100
Why is that a loss of face?

745
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,430
Of course it’s a loss of face.

746
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:18,830
People will think

747
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:19,750
he’s a kept man.

748
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,550
Mom, you can't

749
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,870
say that.

750
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:22,870
What do you mean by "kept man"?

751
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:23,530
What about me before?

752
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,760
When I was staying at home taking care of the kid,

753
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,060
was I a parasite?

754
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,530
What’s the difference between a man

755
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:28,770
staying at home taking care of the kid

756
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:29,830
and a woman doing the same?

757
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,410
It’s just our division of labor.

758
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:32,590
The key point is, what if he

759
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,350
gets lazy staying at home and gives up,

760
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:34,650
right?

761
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:35,800
What if he doesn’t want to go out and work

762
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,220
in the future?

763
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,170
I took care of Aiwen at home for five years.

764
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:37,950
Did I give up on my efforts?

765
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:38,700
Aren’t I doing well

766
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,940
at work now?

767
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,270
Why can’t he do it?

768
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,020
It’s just temporary.

769
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:43,960
If he finds

770
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,800
a suitable job in the future

771
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,640
and wants to take it,

772
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,130
I’ll respect his decision.

773
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,890
We can reconsider it then.

774
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,000
I’m telling you,

775
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:51,540
men should go out and earn money,

776
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,830
while women stay at home taking care of the kids.

777
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,870
That’s how it’s supposed to be, you know?

778
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,770
Who decided that?

779
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,500
Generation after generation.

780
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,350
It’s been this way for generations.

781
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,420
Besides, with your little bit of manuscript fees,

782
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,930
how long can it support

783
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,510
your family?

784
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,950
Mom, calm down, calm down.

785
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,930
Can I show you something?

786
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:06,290
Here.

787
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,310
Take a look at the bank statement.

788
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,220
My copyright fees,

789
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,470
tips from my blog,

790
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,440
and the deposit for my new book.

791
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,610
I’ve earned in a month

792
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,410
what he makes in six months.

793
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,030
Ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand.

794
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,010
Oh my, so much?

795
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:27,350
Yes.

796
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:29,030
So what are you worried about?

797
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,680
But this is

798
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,450
unstable.

799
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,940
Can you trust me

800
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,260
and Zhou Quan?

801
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,210
And don’t ever

802
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,460
say things like

803
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,190
kept man.

804
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,530
When he left the company,

805
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,300
he got a large sum of compensation.

806
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,960
He’s not being supported by me now.

807
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,550
It's that I need him to make some

808
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,090
sacrifices and contributions to this family.

809
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:47,530
Fine.

810
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,470
I find that you’re really on his side.

811
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,590
You don’t even consider me

812
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:51,490
a part of this family.

813
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:52,940
You're not discussing this with me.

814
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,580
It’s just you saying, "Just to let you know,

815
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,070
here’s how we’re going to do it."

816
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:56,470
You...

817
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,060
Honestly, you’re driving me crazy.

818
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,570
I can’t breathe.

819
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,390
Ms. Li, Ms. Li.

820
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,000
What's wrong with you?

821
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,070
I just explained the whole situation

822
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,110
to you so clearly.

823
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,010
Doesn't Aiwen need a father?

824
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,960
At his age, having his dad around

825
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,490
is great.

826
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:09,090
Secondly, with him at home,

827
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,490
our family gains a tutor,

828
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,510
a driver,

829
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,080
and even a nanny all in one.

830
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,610
Can't you see the benefits?

831
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,610
And his willingness to do this

832
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:16,210
gives me more opportunities

833
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,590
to develop my career.

834
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,200
Isn't that great?

835
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,620
Why can't you understand?

836
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,820
Keep trying to fool me.

837
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,510
I'm really not trying to fool you.

838
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,230
Mommy,

839
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,200
just think about it for my sake.

840
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,150
If we don't do this, when I get busy,

841
00:29:26,150 --> 00:29:27,050
what will we do about the kid?

842
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:27,720
Can you find someone

843
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,270
more reliable than him

844
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,530
to take care of the kid?

845
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,810
He can't do housework.

846
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,270
Look at him doing chores.

847
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:35,030
His hands are even clumsier than his feet.

848
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,490
Can he take care of the kid?

849
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,600
He has never done it before, right?

850
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,430
Code is so complicated,

851
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:41,850
yet he handles it so well.

852
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,090
He can’t learn it?

853
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,790
My husband is quite smart.

854
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,300
That's fine.

855
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,930
But I have one condition.

856
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:50,860
Please go ahead.

857
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,620
He must pass my evaluation.

858
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,420
Of course.

859
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,350
Test him.

860
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,960
Do you think Zhou can handle it?

861
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:06,030
Let me go.

862
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,440
It’s too hard to face this kind of situation

863
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,700
right after arriving.

864
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,310
Tell me.

865
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:17,950
The company

866
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:18,950
is very complicated.

867
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:19,820
It’s not just about

868
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,010
going to work, getting off work,

869
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,820
and sitting in the office.

870
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,200
There are many interpersonal relationships

871
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,270
and a lot of scheming

872
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,070
and intrigue.

873
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,650
I wanted to stay away from all that.

874
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:30,040
I wanted to find a clean place

875
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,570
and leave this mess behind.

876
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,790
Why did you

877
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,160
get fired?

878
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,650
They thought I was too old.

879
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,420
You’re avoiding the "mean" issue.

880
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,950
What do you mean by avoiding the "mean" issue?

881
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,820
Avoiding the main issue!

882
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,940
So, as for the "main issue",

883
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,230
what do you want me to say?

884
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,430
That I’m not capable?

885
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,550
That I’m lazy and stupid?

886
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,340
What I care about is your attitude.

887
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,130
What I care about is your attitude.

888
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,270
Mom, he worked very hard.

889
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,300
Do you know how late

890
00:30:59,300 --> 00:30:59,860
he worked every day?

891
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,130
He’s very good to me.

892
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,050
He gave me all his salary.

893
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,260
He's also very good to Aiwen.

894
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,860
And he's very good to you too.

895
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,390
You don't understand that industry.

896
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:07,410
He’s not the only one who’s been laid off

897
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,360
at 35.

898
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,310
Did I just talk to you

899
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:10,590
for nothing?

900
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,750
I know he’s good to me

901
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:13,450
and to this family,

902
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:14,330
and I

903
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,030
know that.

904
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,180
But I’m feeling anxious right now.

905
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,660
Our strong,

906
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,610
dependable man,

907
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,250
bang,

908
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,160
has crashed down.

909
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,230
How did my husband just "bang"?

910
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:23,960
How do you know

911
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,020
I won’t "boom" one day?

912
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,420
How do you know he won’t "boom" one day?

913
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,430
I mean, he makes me anxious.

914
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,560
What are you anxious about, mom?

915
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,820
I'm earning money.

916
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,230
I've been at home for five years.

917
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,180
Since I can support the family,

918
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,300
what’s wrong with him coming back

919
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,130
to spend time with the kid?

920
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,150
Besides, I don’t think it’s shameful

921
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,230
for a man to stay at home

922
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:38,610
and take care of the children.

923
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:39,280
There are

924
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:41,260
too few men doing that nowadays.

925
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,350
I...

926
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,570
I found

927
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,330
that I am more anxious than you.

928
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,390
It's really...

929
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:46,990
It's real.

930
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:55,030
Alright, alright.

931
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,070
Since you two

932
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,310
have already decided

933
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:00,430
to switch roles,

934
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:01,470
right?

935
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,110
Li can now support the family.

936
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,280
But Zhou Quan, your ability

937
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,500
to take care of the kid is definitely not enough.

938
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,130
I'll learn it quickly.

939
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,410
It won't take many days.

940
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,540
I give you two weeks.

941
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,340
You must pass my evaluation.

942
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,260
Okay?

943
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,060
Okay.

944
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,320
Alright then.

945
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:30,320
Be understanding.

946
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,350
Be understanding.

947
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,510
Avoid the "mean" issue.

948
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,840
Avoid the "mean" issue.

949
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,720
It's time to get up.

950
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,700
Daddy, why is it you?

951
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,830
I want Mommy.

952
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:57,700
What do you mean you want Mommy?

953
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,290
Mommy has been very tired lately.

954
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,200
Daddy happens to be on a break.

955
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,170
So, recently, Daddy will probably

956
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,450
spend more time

957
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,410
with you,

958
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:06,250
okay, son?

959
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,530
Starting today,

960
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:08,630
there will be some

961
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:10,350
small changes at home.

962
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,840
I hope you can adapt.

963
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:14,880
Brushing your teeth, washing your face, and using the toilet

964
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,720
should take 10 minutes, right?

965
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,210
Today, Daddy is here.

966
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,410
I give you 11 minutes.

967
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,400
Why are you here?

968
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:29,730
After you finish lecturing the kid,

969
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,600
you always come here.

970
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,060
Do you know what you need to do specifically?

971
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:17,989
Is this leaf dead?

972
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:18,320
Yes.

973
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,280
Let's cut it off.

974
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,739
Here, I'll leave it to you.

975
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:49,880
Ten-ring.

976
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:52,110
You...

977
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:52,850
Zhou Quan.

978
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:55,610
How could you shoot the arrow

979
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,650
at the TV?

980
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,150
Mom, he still has the bow in his hand.

981
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,880
Give it to me.

982
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:01,070
He's just a child.

983
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,930
Can I scold him?

984
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:02,920
Alright. My bad.

985
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:03,810
My bad. My bad.

986
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,730
My bad. My bad.

987
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,730
Are you going to sleep or not?

988
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,480
Daddy, you were snoring.

989
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,580
Nonsense.

990
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,980
I wasn't sleeping at all.

991
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,700
You really were snoring.

992
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:19,330
Are you going to sleep or not?

993
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,390
No.

994
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,600
Okay. If you don't want to sleep, son,

995
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,450
I can play with you.

996
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,440
Let's keep our voices down.

997
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,680
Don't alarm your grandma.

998
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,110
But later when you go out,

999
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,120
you need to say,

1000
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,570
"Grandma,

1001
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,120
Daddy and I slept so well."

1002
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,390
Try it.

1003
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,960
Grandma,

1004
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,710
Daddy and I slept so well.

1005
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:40,570
You need to say it seriously.

1006
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,300
No laughing.

1007
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:42,750
One more time.

1008
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,430
Grandma,

1009
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,150
Daddy and I slept really well.

1010
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,240
Okay. You passed.

1011
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:50,130
Do you want to hear a story?

1012
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,660
No, I want to play.

1013
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,320
Play? Okay, come. What do you want to play?

1014
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,570
Keep your voice down.

1015
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,840
Don't make a sound.

1016
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,210
Be careful, it's hot.

1017
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:13,550
Zhou.

1018
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:14,700
Well,

1019
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,400
I clearly bought two boxes of pancakes.

1020
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,330
How come there's only one box left?

1021
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:20,720
I shared that box of pancakes

1022
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,270
with Zhao and Li.

1023
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,750
They all said they were pretty tasty.

1024
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:26,500
Zhou,

1025
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:28,670
in the future, when you take things from home

1026
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,350
to share with others,

1027
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,090
can you let me

1028
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:32,970
know first?

1029
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,210
Those were specially prepared

1030
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,290
for our son.

1031
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,240
How could you...

1032
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,870
It's just a box of pancakes.

1033
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,130
Is it that big of a deal?

1034
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,160
You can buy it

1035
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,320
at the supermarket.

1036
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,840
You’re really stingy.

1037
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,510
I'm stingy?

1038
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:53,870
You’re generous.

1039
00:36:58,970 --> 00:36:59,580
Now I have to do

1040
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,380
all his homework

1041
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,420
in advance.

1042
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,410
Only then can I help him

1043
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:03,690
after school.

1044
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,830
It’s so tiring.

1045
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:05,400
Indeed.

1046
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,800
When my son does his homework,

1047
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,160
my head starts buzzing.

1048
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,780
After he finishes, I still have ringing in my ears.

1049
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,090
Duo's mom

1050
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,610
graduated with a degree in science and engineering.

1051
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,790
She’s different.

1052
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:16,470
What

1053
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:17,490
was your major?

1054
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,720
I majored in Chinese.

1055
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,070
Chinese is great.

1056
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,400
You could become a writer.

1057
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,710
Look at Cherry,

1058
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,300
she stays at home

1059
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,380
and writes articles for her blog every day.

1060
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:25,990
I don't have

1061
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,430
that talent.

1062
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,290
We have two kids,

1063
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,910
the older one is in fourth grade,

1064
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:31,570
and the younger one

1065
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:32,730
is about to start elementary school.

1066
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:34,320
Our home looks like

1067
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,010
it’s been hit by a landmine.

1068
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,580
There’s never a moment of uninterrupted time.

1069
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,210
I’m constantly

1070
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:41,270
being called “Mommy.”

1071
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,740
It drives me crazy.

1072
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:43,790
I really

1073
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,290
admire Cherry.

1074
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,060
She manages

1075
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,150
to write such beautiful words

1076
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,330
while taking care of her child.

1077
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,410
Indeed.

1078
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,100
Do you know?

1079
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,070
Her husband

1080
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,780
doesn’t do any housework at all.

1081
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,590
She’s not even a bit angry about it.

1082
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,720
Do you think she really feels that way?

1083
00:37:59,080 --> 00:37:59,610
She does.

1084
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:03,650
Who's this guy?

1085
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,570
I don't know.

1086
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,030
What about you? What did you major in?

1087
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:06,580
Yeah.

1088
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,150
To tell fairy tales

1089
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,700
to our Jing,

1090
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,590
I studied broadcasting and hosting.

1091
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,990
Show us!

1092
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:18,360
Mirror, mirror,

1093
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,100
on the wall,

1094
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:22,610
who is the fairest of them all?

1095
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,360
Does Jing like it?

1096
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,690
She cried on the spot.

1097
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,750
Just now, we had a Sun Xingzhe.

1098
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,350
And now we have a Zhe Xingsun.

1099
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:31,850
Brother,

1100
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,990
I think you are in the monkey’s nest.

1101
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,880
It's from Journey to the West.

1102
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,760
You're disturbing us.

1103
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,310
Close the window.

1104
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,510
Wait, I just wanna...

1105
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:41,870
Close the window.

1106
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,280
Okay.

1107
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:42,980
Who's he?

1108
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,420
Who is this person? Do you know him?

1109
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,820
Here’s my suggestion.

1110
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,460
I think that soft advertisement placement in articles

1111
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,310
needs to be natural, not forced;

1112
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,910
otherwise, readers will find it off-putting.

1113
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:53,490
Don't worry.

1114
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,300
I’ll find

1115
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,560
the most appropriate place

1116
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,720
to integrate

1117
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,090
the soft advertisement smoothly.

1118
00:38:59,090 --> 00:38:59,530
Right?

1119
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:00,530
You are the professionals.

1120
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:02,400
I have complete confidence in you.

1121
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,600
I won’t take up any more of your time.

1122
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,580
I’ll take my leave.

1123
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,380
-Okay.
-Okay.

1124
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:06,890
I wish us a successful collaboration.

1125
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:07,670
I wish us a successful collaboration.

1126
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:08,290
I'll see you out.

1127
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:08,820
Alright.

1128
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:10,880
Goodbye.

1129
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,560
Hello, Honey.

1130
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,220
How's it going?

1131
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,230
Honey,

1132
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,630
I'm... I'm doing okay.

1133
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:26,470
I... I'm now

1134
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,090
trying hard to fit in.

1135
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,900
Alex's mom didn’t come.

1136
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,550
I think it might be a bit difficult

1137
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,940
for me to fit in.

1138
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,380
I... I’m afraid that if this continues,

1139
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,910
they might call the police.

1140
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,400
Don’t run away, Honey.

1141
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,970
You’re there on a mission.

1142
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,310
But they're all women.

1143
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:40,840
I...

1144
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,800
I don't know what to say.

1145
00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:43,990
There are a few moms among them

1146
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,150
who are quite something.

1147
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,870
Their parenting skills are top-notch.

1148
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,400
You should learn from them.

1149
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,060
Okay, I see.

1150
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,540
I'll try my best to learn.

1151
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,920
I’ll wait a little longer.

1152
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:53,740
Alex's mom.

1153
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:55,290
Keep going. Love you.

1154
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,580
Alright, you go ahead with your work.

1155
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:02,700
Oh my god, you two are so lovey-dovey.

1156
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:03,570
What's going on this time?

1157
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:04,660
We're not.

1158
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,890
Today, I was supposed to attend

1159
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,400
a moms' group meeting

1160
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,590
to share

1161
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:10,880
parenting experiences.

1162
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,910
But I was dragged here

1163
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,990
by you.

1164
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,020
So I sent Zhou Quan

1165
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:14,700
instead.

1166
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,700
He feels a bit awkward

1167
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,900
since it’s all women.

1168
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,530
He should have gone a long time ago

1169
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:20,510
to see

1170
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,090
how tough it is to take care of a child.

1171
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,570
Zhou Quan has always known.

1172
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:25,460
He cares about me.

1173
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:25,900
He knows that

1174
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,640
taking care of the kid hasn't been easy for me.

1175
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:28,640
Okay, okay, I get it.

1176
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,000
I know your husband cares about you the most,

1177
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,570
okay?

1178
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,090
Here, take a look at this contract.

1179
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,880
If there’s no problem, sign it.

1180
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,070
You didn't read it!

1181
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,370
Haven't you reviewed it already?

1182
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,120
Besides my mom and my husband,

1183
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,100
you’re the person I trust the most.

1184
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,430
What are you talking about?

1185
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,920
I could hear you from far away.

1186
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:54,780
Come over here.

1187
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:56,960
Alex's mom.

1188
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,170
Zhou Quan, you're here.

1189
00:40:58,170 --> 00:40:58,690
Yes, yes, yes.

1190
00:40:58,690 --> 00:40:59,290
Come over here, come over here.

1191
00:40:59,290 --> 00:40:59,670
Okay.

1192
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,410
Let me give you

1193
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:01,740
a proper introduction.

1194
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,610
This is the husband of a new friend I met

1195
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:05,900
in the mommy group buying chat group.

1196
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,690
His wife is Ms. Cherry.

1197
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:10,490
Ms. Cherry?

1198
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,040
Just now…

1199
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,270
Just now, I was trying hard

1200
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,090
to fit in,

1201
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,180
but I failed.

1202
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:15,080
A few days ago,

1203
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:15,910
my friend forwarded

1204
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:16,890
Cherry’s articles to me.

1205
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,310
They're so interesting, aren't they?

1206
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,880
Cherry has become so popular recently.

1207
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,250
By the way,

1208
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:21,440
why didn't your wife come today?

1209
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,070
She's busy.

1210
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:22,890
She's working.

1211
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:23,960
Your wife is really amazing.

1212
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,760
She writes such excellent articles

1213
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,240
while taking care of the kid.

1214
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,060
They’re incredibly genuine.

1215
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,710
Mr. Zhou,

1216
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,250
let’s add each other on WeChat.

1217
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,310
I can say I know a semi-celebrity now.

1218
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:34,350
Introduce your wife to us

1219
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,090
next time.

1220
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:35,760
Okay.

1221
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,470
Well, Alex's mom,

1222
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,170
could you create a group chat

1223
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:38,930
so we can all stay in touch?

1224
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:39,630
I'll create a group chat later.

1225
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,650
Make sure to add me.

1226
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,560
Make sure to add me.

1227
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,520
Definitely.

1228
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,460
Zhiwen's mom, you're here.

1229
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,550
Come, have a seat.

1230
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,350
Here she is.

1231
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,260
This is Zhiwen's mom.

1232
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:52,120
She completed an integrated undergraduate, master's, and doctoral program.

1233
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,760
Her husband is a top student with a full scholarship

1234
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,290
from Stanford University.

1235
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,900
Their son was just admitted to Harvard.

1236
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:59,510
Listening to her talk about

1237
00:41:59,510 --> 00:42:00,480
how she educated her child

1238
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,030
is more valuable than many private tutoring sessions.

1239
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:02,690
Okay, okay.

1240
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:04,690
Zhiwen's mom,

1241
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,180
what classes have you been taking recently?

1242
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,800
Sleep with me!

1243
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:11,650
Mommy, sleep with me!

1244
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,810
Mommy is going to sleep with me.

1245
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:16,160
-Sleep with me.
-Sleep with me.

1246
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,100
-Sleep with me.
-Sleep with me.

1247
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:21,550
Li, what's the matter?

1248
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,110
Let the kid sleep with you.

1249
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:24,830
You're busy outside all day long.

1250
00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:25,570
You finally came back.

1251
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,170
Let the kid get close to you.

1252
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,100
Stand up straight.

1253
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:28,900
Sleep with me.

1254
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,200
That's enough, Aiwen.

1255
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,640
Mom, listen to me.

1256
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:33,970
We can play and fool around.

1257
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:35,010
But when it comes to educational philosophy,

1258
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,370
I hope you respect me.

1259
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,630
He has grown up.

1260
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,700
He can't sleep with us anymore.

1261
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,100
He's such a little child.

1262
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,270
How old is he

1263
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,850
that he can't sleep with you?

1264
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:45,150
As a father, you...

1265
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:46,150
Let me tell you.

1266
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:46,900
First of all,

1267
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:47,770
you fail my assessment.

1268
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:48,320
Come on.

1269
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:49,520
Whether I pass the assessment

1270
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,770
is up to the kid, right?

1271
00:42:50,770 --> 00:42:52,250
We need to foster his independent personality.

1272
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,050
Sleep with me.

1273
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:54,420
If he grows up

1274
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,400
without an independent personality,

1275
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,940
he’ll become very inept.

1276
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:58,790
He... Are you competent?

1277
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,870
You don’t even go to work now.

1278
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:01,000
My daughter is supporting you,

1279
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,630
right? You...
