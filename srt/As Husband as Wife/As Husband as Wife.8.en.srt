[Episode 8]

4
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,190
The cooperation was quite successful.

5
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,850
I still didn't sing very well.

6
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,070
It's fate.

7
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,950
Dong has even praised you in front of me,

8
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:48,509
saying you're earnest, professional, and experienced.

9
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,289
Senior,

10
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,030
I have a project.

11
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,710
I'll give you a week's time.

12
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,259
Come find me at the company when you're ready.

13
00:01:59,110 --> 00:01:59,940
Understood.

14
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:04,500
Dong,

15
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:07,230
give me another song.

16
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,509
Okay, Jun.

17
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,789
What song?

18
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:10,870
How about

19
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,840
"A Grateful Heart"?

20
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,760
Okay. This song is good.

21
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,300
Go ahead.

22
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,170
Glasses frame.

23
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,290
I'm back.

24
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,290
Daddy's back.

25
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,640
You're so late today.

26
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,360
Today, I ran into Dong,

27
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:33,200
my junior.

28
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,390
Did you drink?

29
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:36,250
I didn't drink.

30
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,200
He and that...

31
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,930
That boss I had an interview with the other day.

32
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:39,970
On the way back,

33
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,230
he asked me to sing with him in the car.

34
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,430
You could sing in the car?

35
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,310
That's impressive.

36
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,510
Then, listen,

37
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,420
I got a

38
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,510
an opportunity of probation.

39
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,710
They directly gave me the project

40
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,640
and told me do it.

41
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,270
Really?

42
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,390
That's great!

43
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,579
Then he's struck gold.

44
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,670
How could you possibly

45
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,560
not find a job?

46
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,870
It's mainly because Dong kept

47
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,910
putting in a good word for me in the car.

48
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,520
Son,

49
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,080
give the gift to Daddy.

50
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,630
Here's your gift.

51
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,610
Come up here.

52
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,550
The drawing was done by our son,

53
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,740
and I wrote the words.

54
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,920
[To Zhou Quan, you're our hero forever] [From Che Li]

55
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,430
The first copy of my new book

56
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,710
must be given to my best reader,

57
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,140
the most special and unique

58
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,230
Zhou Quan.

59
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,560
Thank you for giving me

60
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,620
everything I want.

61
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,750
To Zhou Quan,

62
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,050
you are our hero forever.

63
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,710
Che Li.

64
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,640
Aiwen, who is Che Li?

65
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:39,870
Mommy.

66
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,280
Isn't her name Cherry?

67
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:45,300
It's in Chinese.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,670
Make it Chinese

69
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,000
and she becomes Mommy, right?

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,430
Yes.

71
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:49,990
Make it English

72
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,700
and she becomes a strong woman, right?

73
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,190
Right.

74
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,650
Son, you're pressing on my hair.

75
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,070
Thank you, honey.

76
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:03,530
Thank you, son.

77
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,920
Is Daddy's face this round?

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,710
I even said he

79
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,240
drew you quite handsomely.

80
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,960
You made my mouth like this.

81
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,390
You're always like this.

82
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,000
Who said that?

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,840
Is my mouth like this?

84
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,570
You're rogue

85
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,940
and improper.

86
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,230
My mouth is like this. Come give me a kiss.

87
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,070
Are you touched?

88
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,910
So happy!

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,160
Are you happy?

90
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:42,970
Zhou, you're here.

91
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,390
-Hello, Qian.
-Hello.

92
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,050
How are you?

93
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,550
Director Zhou.

94
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,030
Hello.

95
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,070
Busy as always.

96
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,930
Director Zhou.

97
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,150
The director is here.

98
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,080
Good.

99
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:02,750
Have a seat.

100
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,620
Here, have some water.

101
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,440
Okay.

102
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,530
-Come on.
-There's more.

103
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,390
Add some.

104
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,070
I say,

105
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,220
don't keep calling me Director in the future.

106
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,910
I've been retired for so many years.

107
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,040
No matter how long it's been,

108
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,570
you're still the director.

109
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,150
I can't change the habit.

110
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:16,850
Well...

111
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,780
When Qian from the reception room

112
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,750
saw me just now,

113
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,320
he also kept calling me Director.

114
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,950
I told him this is not good.

115
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,190
Here.

116
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,940
You'll make the current director

117
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,290
feel awkward, right?

118
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,270
He told me

119
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,590
the current director can't even compare to

120
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,190
half of what I was in the past.

121
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,990
I said, "You can't say that."

122
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,880
Young people might not be able to perform to standards immediately.

123
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,810
We can all understand that, right?

124
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,270
In the past, I had a higher prestige,

125
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,750
but that's all in the past now.

126
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,500
We have to allow young people

127
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,900
to have a growth process.

128
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:47,510
Am I right?

129
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,350
You have a broad mind.

130
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,320
You're all here?

131
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,170
Zhao is here.

132
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,110
Zhao is here.

133
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,350
What are you showing off again?

134
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,680
Wait, let me take a look.

135
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,360
Is this a camera?

136
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:00,840
It sure is.

137
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,010
My son sent it from the United States.

138
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,990
It's the most expensive one.

139
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,150
It's nothing special.

140
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,550
I took it out to play with.

141
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,690
Nowadays, people use cell phones to take photos.

142
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,590
It's convenient

143
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:14,550
and the effect is good.

144
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,940
Who still uses this thing?

145
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,870
They don't even produce film anymore.

146
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,750
It seems so.

147
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,470
Zhou, this is a digital camera.

148
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,850
It doesn't use film.

149
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,730
It doesn't?

150
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,300
Then...

151
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,600
Do you know how to use it?

152
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,510
You don't believe me?

153
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:32,510
Come, stand over here.

154
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,250
I'll take a photo of you.

155
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,159
Come, let's take a photo.

156
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,060
Come on, really.

157
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,070
Let me see.

158
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:46,840
How is it?

159
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,130
How is it?

160
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,220
Looks pretty good.

161
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,880
It does seem quite clear.

162
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,750
Right?

163
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,190
Seriously.

164
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:54,950
I can't use this.

165
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,909
I'd rather...

166
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,320
Quickly set it up.

167
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,490
Okay, come.

168
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,970
Come, set it up.

169
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,500
Meng Fei played an indispensable role

170
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,960
for our new book to be a bestseller this month.

171
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,230
[Commendation Conference]

172
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:07,790
Put it on.

173
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,730
It's quite festive.

174
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,110
Your award.

175
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:17,770
Your bonus.

176
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,590
Thank you, President.

177
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:22,190
What are you thanking me for?

178
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,480
This honor

179
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,680
and this 20,000-yuan bonus

180
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,810
are well-deserved.

181
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,370
You worked hard recently.

182
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,230
Keep up the good work in the future.

183
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,690
Create brilliance again.

184
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:31,880
Alright.

185
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,070
Applause.

186
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,790
Why did I ask you

187
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,570
where you want to go?

188
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,590
I should've just taken you

189
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,440
to the beauty salon

190
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,980
and given you a makeover.

191
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,680
You got a bonus and wanted to treat me to a meal.

192
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,740
You said I could go

193
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,700
wherever I want.

194
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,360
The new semester is starting,

195
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,710
so I brought him to buy some gifts

196
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:50,740
for his classmates.

197
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,550
It's so much fun here

198
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,420
with all these good things.

199
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,820
Okay, super good.

200
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,040
This notebook is not bad.

201
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,920
Have you decided what to buy?

202
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,830
-I got it. How about…
-What?

203
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,160
we buy diaries for my classmates?

204
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:06,770
That works.

205
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,110
Then pick one you like.

206
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,490
Encourage them to write more in their diaries,

207
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:10,190
right?

208
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:10,640
Right.

209
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,230
Go ahead and choose.

210
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,960
Not bad.

211
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,910
Start the writing from a young age.

212
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:19,580
So soft.

213
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,150
So soft.

214
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,590
Isn't this gun interesting?

215
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,390
I have one too.

216
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,470
Senior,

217
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:39,830
you must get this project

218
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,710
from Mr. Guan.

219
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,760
Do it well.

220
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,030
As far as I know,

221
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,030
this project is highly regarded in the industry.

222
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,990
If you can get it,

223
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,130
Mr. Guan will definitely

224
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,730
let you lead the team to do it.

225
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:49,870
By then, it won't be a matter of

226
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,130
finding a job anymore.

227
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,270
Everyone in the industry

228
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,270
will come to poach you, the big shot.

229
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,510
I'm back.

230
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,330
This child...

231
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,640
He won't be able to focus.

232
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,000
How can he not focus?

233
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,300
Where's everyone?

234
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,910
Studying and deepening his impression.

235
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,500
We definitely have our method.

236
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,160
You have to…

237
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,010
When the child

238
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:16,900
goes to school,

239
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,660
he must have a specified time.

240
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:19,730
If you do this to him,

241
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,750
he won't be able to focus in the future.

242
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,350
You know?

243
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,190
Why won't he be able to focus?

244
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,150
My goal is to make him remember

245
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:27,590
the things he needs to learn.

246
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,950
What are you arguing about?

247
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,500
What's the problem with this?

248
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,350
If he can't focus,

249
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,280
he won't be able to learn anything.

250
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,400
You're starting again.

251
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,870
Li, you're finally back.

252
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:38,460
I'm telling you,

253
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,990
you need to talk to Zhou Quan about this.

254
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,860
It's okay for you to let the child learn idioms,

255
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,190
but you have to make him sit still.

256
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:43,590
Right?

257
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,070
This learning method is not good.

258
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:45,510
Honey,

259
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,700
you have to reason with her.

260
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,660
After receiving your instructions,

261
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,470
I quickly started teaching him to memorize idioms.

262
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,080
But to

263
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,270
memorize these idioms

264
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,480
in such a short time,

265
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,640
I needed some methods.

266
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,110
So,

267
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,560
we used a game

268
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,650
to remember these idioms.

269
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,550
Do you think there's a problem with this?

270
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,240
No problem.

271
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,310
No, you don't have a problem.

272
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,670
Mom.

273
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:02,240
I gave him this task

274
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,360
because I accepted a

275
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,240
commercial ad for 100,000 yuan.

276
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,080
Aiwen has to contribute.

277
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:07,920
Within two days,

278
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,330
he needs to memorize a lot of idioms.

279
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,390
So he's taking him to memorize idioms.

280
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,790
What are you upset about?

281
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,590
I don't mind you making money.

282
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I have no objections

283
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:20,430
to the child learning idioms, either.

284
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:21,490
I'm telling Zhou Quan

285
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:23,630
that he can't play while learning.

286
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,170
Isn't the end goal for him to memorize them?

287
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:27,200
Why do you always have to order him around?

288
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,470
Ask him if he can remember them or not!

289
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,030
Mom, alright.

290
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:29,830
Let's not talk about this anymore.

291
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,150
Using my method,

292
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:32,770
I can even make you

293
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,350
memorize the idiom dictionary.

294
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,150
Impossible.

295
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,320
Want to give it a try?

296
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,560
I'm not going to try.

297
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,250
I'm an adult.

298
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:39,670
I've memorized it all already.

299
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:41,200
Exactly. Do you dare to try?

300
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,010
Do you dare?

301
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,110
What do you mean I don't dare?

302
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,800
You guys keep provoking me.

303
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,870
Isn't it just idioms?

304
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,000
Come on, let's do it together.

305
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,310
-Honey, join us.
-I want to play, too.

306
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,150
What game?

307
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,530
You're awesome.

308
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,370
Okay, okay, you're the best.

309
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,110
You're amazing, you're amazing.

310
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,250
Grandma has 25 points now.

311
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,050
Come on, pick one.

312
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,250
What should I choose?

313
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,910
I...

314
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,130
I can't see it clearly.

315
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,070
Don't be a sore loser.

316
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,410
Don't be a sore loser.

317
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,810
You've never won before.

318
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,700
The brief handover

319
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,110
between Zhou Quan and I

320
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:45,150
can be considered to have come to an end.

321
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,150
With family matters,

322
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:46,990
there is actually no way

323
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,320
to measure right and wrong by the outcome.

324
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,580
During the time Zhou Quan took care of the child,

325
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,040
Aiwen did change a little.

326
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,070
Zhou Quan also understands the child better now.

327
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:56,200
That's good enough.

328
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,960
Sometimes, life

329
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,660
needs some small changes.

330
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,320
It's just like adding

331
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,320
interesting seasoning to the soup.

332
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:04,440
If you add too much,

333
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,100
it will just be a little salty.

334
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,390
No harm done.

335
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:09,380
At this point,

336
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,310
I still haven't figured out

337
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,950
how to handle the family affairs

338
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:12,820
going forward,

339
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,500
but where there's a will, there's a way.

340
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,350
There will always be a solution.

341
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,510
Dark clouds.

342
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,980
Grandma, you can't say the answer.

343
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,270
Oh right!

344
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,430
I can't tell you.

345
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,510
You're supposed to guess, right?

346
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:31,970
Yes.

347
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,170
Okay, let me see.

348
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,050
The second one.

349
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,710
A heart.

350
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,550
Tomato?

351
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,170
Circle?

352
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,350
Potato!

353
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,370
Potato?

354
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,000
Yes.

355
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,620
Grandma, you said the answer again.

356
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,670
Didn't you ask me?

357
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,870
Wasn't it that you couldn't guess it?

358
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,550
Okay, the third one.

359
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,950
The third one.

360
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:01,630
Juice.

361
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,110
Straw.

362
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,510
You...

363
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:06,110
Tomato!

364
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:09,030
I've made it so clear already.

365
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,410
Can't you guess it?

366
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,270
No.

367
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,510
Zhou Quan,

368
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,850
I showed him a tomato with gestures,

369
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,370
but he couldn't guess it.

370
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,290
You try showing a tomato.

371
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:17,230
Let me see what it looks like.

372
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,170
Mom, you already said it.

373
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:18,860
If I continue gesturing,

374
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,510
he'll definitely figure it out.

375
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,970
Wait, how would you gesture it?

376
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:22,940
I was like this.

377
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,780
This could be a coconut.

378
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,690
Right?

379
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,550
Then, you show me.

380
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,150
Look at me.

381
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,290
East, south, west, north.

382
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:39,870
West.

383
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,670
Red.

384
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,710
Yes.

385
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,060
Tomato.

386
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,860
But...

387
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,820
We have great chemistry.

388
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,710
Let me ask you again.

389
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,470
There's another new word.

390
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,000
A new one.

391
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,600
Watch me, Aiwen.

392
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:10,630
Hand.

393
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,190
Five.

394
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,390
One.

395
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,000
Yi.

396
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,710
Mountain.

397
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,930
Wuyi Mountain.

398
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:34,410
Grandma, you're so dumb.

399
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,070
You couldn't even guess it.

400
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:37,550
Yes.

401
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,140
Aiwen,

402
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,310
don't talk to Grandma like that.

403
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:46,190
You two can play charades.

404
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,220
Oh right, I...

405
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,110
I made plans with friends.

406
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,660
We said we'd have coffee together.

407
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,320
I'll go now.

408
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,050
I'm leaving now.

409
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:53,130
No, Mom, we play it often.

410
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,030
I know, I understand.

411
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:54,650
Practice more.

412
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,310
No, I won't practice anymore.

413
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,350
Aiwen, I think...

414
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,790
First of all, you can't

415
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,520
demand Grandma to play games

416
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,060
we're familiar with.

417
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:15,630
And you definitely can't demand this of strangers.

418
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:16,750
We play often,

419
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,030
so we've been trained.

420
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,660
That's the first point.

421
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,260
Secondly,

422
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,080
Grandma raised you up

423
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,390
until now.

424
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,810
When you were little,

425
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:26,550
it was always Grandma who took care of you.

426
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,270
So do you think

427
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:27,930
what you said just now

428
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:29,730
would hurt Grandma's feelings?

429
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:30,950
Yes.

430
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:32,400
Was it wrong?

431
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,400
It was wrong.

432
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:34,110
Okay.

433
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,910
Figure out a way to make it up to her.

434
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,130
I'll give you 15 minutes.

435
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,990
Let me know when you've thought of something.

436
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,270
I can help you, okay?

437
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,440
Good boy.

438
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,470
This cake is really good.

439
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,380
Let me take a photo of you.

440
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:52,860
Alright.

441
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,320
This red dress looks nice.

442
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,530
Come on, let me take a picture of you

443
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,470
with the cake.

444
00:15:59,430 --> 00:15:59,870
Okay.

445
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,470
Come on.

446
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,600
Let me take a photo of you two together.

447
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,580
Okay.

448
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,090
The scenery here is really beautiful.

449
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,010
What's wrong? You look gloomy.

450
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,810
Aren't you busy competing

451
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,070
with your son-in-law?

452
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,070
Competing with my son-in-law is so much fun.

453
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:20,520
But competing with my grandson

454
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:24,110
leaves me battered and bruised.

455
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,540
Is it that serious?

456
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:28,510
I spent more than 20 years

457
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,300
raising our Li.

458
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,770
I put even more effort into

459
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,240
bringing up my grandson.

460
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,140
As time went by,

461
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,020
they started their own families and careers.

462
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,210
They grew up,

463
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:45,890
but I grew old.

464
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,590
I... I want to

465
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,970
I want to fit in with them,

466
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,130
but I find that I...

467
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,180
I... I just can't keep up.

468
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:57,270
If you can't fit in, then just don't.

469
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:58,710
Anyway,

470
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,150
ever since I had the bypass surgery,

471
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,870
I finally understand the meaning of life.

472
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,470
How many more 20 years

473
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,390
or six years do we have left?

474
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:06,810
Exactly.

475
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,609
Why waste it all on the children?

476
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,829
-That's right.
-Yes.

477
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,339
The children have their whole lives ahead of them,

478
00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:13,180
but your life

479
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,480
is also a life.

480
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,240
You have to leave some time

481
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,510
to live for yourself.

482
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,760
Besides, each generation

483
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,310
has their own way of living.

484
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,119
When the time comes,

485
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,510
you should step back,

486
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,190
so as not to waste your energy

487
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,630
and end up unappreciated.

488
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,920
You don't know.

489
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,540
Li's father

490
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,620
passed away early.

491
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,690
It's just been me and my daughter,

492
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,100
relying on each other for survival

493
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,030
all these years.

494
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,270
I have been wholeheartedly

495
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,350
and vigorously

496
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,220
raising my grandson too.

497
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,510
I just feel like

498
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,110
if I were to be separated from them,

499
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
if I were not with them,

500
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,680
what would I do?

501
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,830
What can I do?

502
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,790
I don't know what I can do.

503
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,360
You can do anything.

504
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,050
Your children have their own happiness.

505
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:09,720
As for us,

506
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,690
we should be like the young people,

507
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,240
drinking coffee every day

508
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,640
and having some snacks.

509
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,050
Exactly.

510
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:15,870
Play some mahjong

511
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,350
and dance in the square.

512
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:19,110
How carefree!

513
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,160
Look on the bright side.

514
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,610
Yes, look on the bright side.

515
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,030
Don't you still have us?

516
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,140
That's right.

517
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,830
From now on, join us every day

518
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,310
to dance and play mahjong.

519
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,420
How joyful!

520
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,630
Okay, dance and play mahjong.

521
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,030
Yes, my treat tomorrow.

522
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,340
We'll dance and have tea.

523
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,190
I'll treat you to dinner in the evening too.

524
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,170
Let's have coffee first.

525
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,700
Come on, let's have coffee.

526
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:53,950
Camera.

527
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,750
Who bought a camera?

528
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:59,690
Could it be delivered to the wrong address?

529
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,510
Don't touch it.

530
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,870
Don't mess with it. I bought it.

531
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,920
-Come on.
-You bought it?

532
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,590
Be gentle.

533
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,820
Oh boy.

534
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,140
This thing is really expensive.

535
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,100
Take a look.

536
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:13,360
Let me tell you.

537
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,670
Nowadays, this camera

538
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,370
is really trending

539
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,100
among the retired officials.

540
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,160
This one

541
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,600
cost me a fortune,

542
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:21,310
you know?

543
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,650
Let's take a look first.

544
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,270
Just by looking at this thing,

545
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,600
it's better than Yu's.

546
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,940
Whenever I spend a little money

547
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,890
to buy a performance costume,

548
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,510
you nag endlessly about it.

549
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,350
Oh boy.

550
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,500
You spend a fortune on to buy yourself

551
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,730
a toy.

552
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,220
Look at you, you're even comparing yourself to Yu.

553
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,070
Do you even know how to use it?

554
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,300
Alright, alright, alright.

555
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,890
Women just love to nag.

556
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,730
How about this?

557
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:52,340
Let me take a photo of you first.

558
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,760
Outside, it's brighter outside.

559
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,800
Come, come, come.

560
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:58,990
Come.

561
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,390
Okay.

562
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:04,950
This thing...

563
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,790
Okay.

564
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,640
How is it broken?

565
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,190
I can't see you in here.

566
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,180
You didn't remove the lens cap.

567
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:21,150
You thought I really didn't know?

568
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,770
I was just testing you.

569
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,490
Let me tell you.

570
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,650
Photography is a highly technical

571
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,850
kind of work.

572
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,080
Not everyone who wants to do it can do it.

573
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,030
Who are you looking down on?

574
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,040
I was able to give birth to a son

575
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,640
who fiddles with computers.

576
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,950
How can I not

577
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,440
handle this lousy camera?

578
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:39,350
Seriously.

579
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,360
Fine. You know everything.

580
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:42,990
I give up.

581
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,200
Hey, son.

582
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,270
It's working hours now.

583
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,090
What made you think of calling me?

584
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,420
I have the day off today.

585
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,270
Have you and Dad

586
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,060
been doing well?

587
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:01,990
I'm good.

588
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,680
I'm working here,

589
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,760
cleaning and mopping the floor.

590
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,030
Aiwen.

591
00:21:13,470 --> 00:21:14,030
Aiwen.

592
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,120
Grandma, I'm here.

593
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,880
Aiwen, good boy.

594
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,710
Let me see where you got hurt.

595
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,640
I'm not hurt, Grandma.

596
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:23,870
-Grandma. Sit down.
-Not hurt?

597
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,310
No.

598
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,300
Your dad told me on WeChat

599
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,260
that you fell.

600
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,350
Are you sure you're not hurt?

601
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,590
I'm fine. Daddy was just tricking you.

602
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,900
Grandma, sit down.

603
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,070
Okay, I'll sit.

604
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,750
You're really okay, right?

605
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,020
Really, I'm fine.

606
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,980
You scared me to death.

607
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:40,910
Okay.

608
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:41,990
Okay.

609
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:42,500
Grandma,

610
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,090
these are the noodles

611
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,520
I made for you with Dad.

612
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,500
Grandma, I'm sorry.

613
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,390
I shouldn't have lost my temper with you.

614
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,220
It's okay, good boy.

615
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,680
I would never

616
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:02,530
get mad at you.

617
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,630
Yes, it's nothing.

618
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,930
Grandma, let me feed you.

619
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,220
Grandma can eat by herself.

620
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:06,810
There's nothing

621
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:08,650
that a bowl of chicken soup can't solve.

622
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:10,370
Aiwen and I made the noodles together.

623
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,030
The scheme was all my idea.

624
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,650
Congratulations, you fell for my trick again.

625
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,380
You little rascal.

626
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,380
Grandma, let me feed you.

627
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:31,920
Okay, I will eat.

628
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,850
Alright.

629
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,170
Try some more of these noodles.

630
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,900
It tastes so good.

631
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,150
Let me give you another taste of these noodles.

632
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:45,150
I'll do it myself.

633
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,810
I'll do it myself. Good boy.

634
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,010
Let my sweetheart take a big bite first.

635
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,390
Good job.

636
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,580
I'll gobble it up.

637
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,030
Go ahead.

638
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,660
Yes, this is for you.

639
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,640
Aiwen, this one.

640
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,530
Be generous

641
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,130
and share your gift

642
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,370
with your friends.

643
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:22,150
Okay?

644
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,880
You need to be very generous.

645
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,620
Do you remember that English phrase

646
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,620
Mommy taught you?

647
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:27,760
I remember.

648
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,080
Work hard, play hard.

649
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,790
Daddy.

650
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,730
Yes, only by doing so

651
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,880
can you "day day up."

652
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,560
Got it. Day day up.

653
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,710
It's not "day day up."

654
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,510
Don't listen to your dad's nonsense. So annoying.

655
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,100
Isn't that Cheng's mom?

656
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,590
Why did she come out?

657
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:44,330
Cheng's mom.

658
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,110
Aiwen's mom.

659
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:46,960
Cheng has grown taller.

660
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:47,720
Yes, indeed.

661
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,920
Did he start playing some sport?

662
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,970
How come he got a growth spurt?

663
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,820
I signed him up for a basketball class.

664
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,550
It seems to be quite effective.

665
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,910
He grew a few centimeters.

666
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,120
It's really quite effective.

667
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,050
Aiwen should play too.

668
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:56,870
Yes, he must.

669
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:57,950
You guys, hurry up.

670
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,100
The class is about to start.

671
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:00,660
Why are you

672
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,990
all taking the kids out?

673
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,110
Aren't they starting elementary school soon?

674
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,450
We came today to ask for leave.

675
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,570
He won't be coming to kindergarten this semester.

676
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,370
He'll go directly to the kindergarten-elementary transition class.

677
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,610
Don't they all go to local schools now?

678
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,110
There's still one year before elementary school,

679
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:12,510
right?

680
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:14,590
You're still going to kindergarten-elementary transition class?

681
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,810
You're really honest.

682
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:16,870
Learning more skills

683
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,110
will definitely be useful.

684
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,030
Kids nowadays

685
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,600
all like to be the center of attention.

686
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,510
Having some talent

687
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,200
can also improve their social skills.

688
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,490
They all have to go to elementary school.

689
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,190
This transition class

690
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,640
is just to prepare in advance.

691
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,750
We'll go to class now.

692
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,270
Let's go.

693
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:28,990
Let's go to class.

694
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:30,230
Hurry and take Aiwen there.

695
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,640
Okay.

696
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,330
See you. Bye.

697
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,470
-Bye.
-Thank you.

698
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,670
This way.

699
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,710
Zhou Quan.

700
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:55,870
You don't say, this extracurricular class

701
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,510
is really something.

702
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,630
How can such a young child

703
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,630
sit still for a whole morning?

704
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:02,260
Mom,

705
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,850
it's actually quite similar to kindergarten.

706
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:05,510
It just has a few more courses.

707
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:06,670
Don't worry.

708
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,190
That makes sense.

709
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,300
By the way,

710
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:11,550
Zhou Quan,

711
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,660
if I take Aiwen

712
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,770
to dance in the square,

713
00:25:14,770 --> 00:25:15,990
do you think it's okay?

714
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,190
I don't think there's any need for that.

715
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,180
I think if you take him dancing,

716
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,850
he won't enjoy watching

717
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,460
and he won't enjoy dancing either.

718
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,440
What's the point?

719
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,840
That makes sense. Forget the dancing then.

720
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,320
Drink the porridge.

721
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:30,800
Come, I'll feed you.

722
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,110
What's up with my mom today?

723
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,310
She's respecting your opinion so much,

724
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:41,070
asking for your advice on everything.

725
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,910
This doesn't seem like the

726
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:42,770
My Sassy Mother-in-law image

727
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,370
that our family usually has.

728
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,660
What trick did you use on her?

729
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,820
Interpersonal relations

730
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,230
are ever-changing.

731
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,620
Just enjoy the result.

732
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,270
I love it when you

733
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,660
don't make sense.

734
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,430
Where are you going?

735
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,270
To water the flowers.

736
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,600
Go ahead and water them.

737
00:25:58,830 --> 00:25:59,670
Water them.

738
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,570
Stop messing around.

739
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,750
Look at you.

740
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,050
You finally have a day off

741
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,880
and you spend the whole day at home,

742
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,830
eating and sleeping, sleeping and eating.

743
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,690
How is your life

744
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,430
any different from a pig's?

745
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,260
Are you going to keep eating this or not?

746
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,450
I'm done with that.

747
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,140
I'll have some fruit.

748
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,390
Seriously...

749
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,720
What are you looking at?

750
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,150
Isn't this that author of yours?

751
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:34,150
Yes, Che Li.

752
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,110
She's really popular now.

753
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:38,400
Everyone on Douyin

754
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,270
and WeChat are sharing

755
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:41,720
that stay-at-home dad speech

756
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,000
of hers.

757
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:44,670
You know her, too?

758
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,750
You underestimate your mother.

759
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,480
Your aunt said

760
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,810
she has a friend who makes

761
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,940
educational toys for young children.

762
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,830
She wants you to ask if Che Li will take an advertisement deal.

763
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:55,510
Seriously?

764
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,910
Of course.

765
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,810
Aren't you her agent?

766
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,190
Mom,

767
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,770
I'm an editor.

768
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,620
I'm an editor!

769
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,580
I think it's all the same.

770
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,740
I guess it is pretty much the same now.

771
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,790
[her and her son for a parent-child promotion event?]

772
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,790
[I wonder what's the quotation if we invite]

773
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,790
[Dear, are you the editor of Cherry?]

774
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:32,680
[Will Ms. Cherry consider signing with an internet celebrity agency?]

775
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,310
Meng.

776
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,160
a media outlet reached out to the publishing house.

777
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,220
They want to schedule an interview with Cherry.

778
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,770
She's your author after all.

779
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:42,030
You can't ignore this.

780
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,750
I sent you the interview time.

781
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:44,720
Come to the publishing house

782
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,450
and we'll discuss the details.

783
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,510
Li, are you at home?

784
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,860
I'm about to go out.

785
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,800
My mom went shopping with Aiwen.

786
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,670
They said they bought too much

787
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,910
and asked me to pick them up.

788
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:10,800
Wait for me a little bit.

789
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,570
I'll come to you.

790
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:12,830
There's something I want to discuss.

791
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,590
Right now? Are you in a hurry?

792
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,390
Wait a moment.

793
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,500
Who is it?

794
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,130
Someone's knocking on the door. Hold on.

795
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,070
Li.

796
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:23,570
Yuan Yi, why are you here?

797
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,440
To see you.

798
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,120
Who is it?

799
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,670
What does he want with you, Li?

800
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:32,450
What are you doing?

801
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:35,050
There's good news, but she can't know about it.

802
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,790
Where are you going

803
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,960
in such a hurry?

804
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:46,390
Aren't you going to eat?

805
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:46,910
Mom,

806
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,610
I'm heading towards the path of freedom.

807
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,270
Forget about trivial matters

808
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,130
like eating.

809
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:58,390
Have you come yet?

810
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:00,310
Aiwen and I are both, well...

811
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,880
We've left the supermarket after shopping.

812
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,280
When we get home,

813
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,340
I will make you something delicious.

814
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,000
Grandma, let me give you a massage.

815
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,660
My precious baby is giving me a massage.

816
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,840
That's great.

817
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:20,610
What a good boy.

818
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,710
So good.

819
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,760
So thoughtful.

820
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,620
Are you Ms. Li Xiulan?

821
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,020
Yes, I am. Who are you?

822
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,780
I was sent to pick you up

823
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,580
by Mr. Yuan Yi.

824
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,100
Mr. Yuan?

825
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:32,750
Yes.

826
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,340
Che Li sent you a WeChat message.

827
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,740
Please check your phone.

828
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,290
Really? Wait a moment.

829
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,050
I didn't see it.

830
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:39,850
Okay, Auntie.

831
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,870
Your mom really did send us a WeChat message.

832
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:47,240
We didn't see it. Yes, yes.

833
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,400
Here, let me help you with your things.

834
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,330
I'll do it myself.

835
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:49,800
It's okay. It's okay.

836
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,020
Let me help you with your things.

837
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,020
I'll do it myself.

838
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:52,740
Thank you.

839
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:53,870
Thanks.

840
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,640
Invite me to be an internet celebrity at your company?

841
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,040
What?

842
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,940
Don't you think it's ridiculous

843
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,110
and unbelievable?

844
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:16,640
Why is that?

845
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:20,990
You...

846
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:23,560
In all these years since I married Zhou Quan,

847
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,850
we have indirectly

848
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,740
gotten to know each other, right?

849
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,820
I'm just a writer.

850
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,350
Do you think I'm capable of

851
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:31,910
being in front of the camera

852
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,430
and expressing myself,

853
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:35,930
or acting all cutesy?

854
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:37,780
Is that me?

855
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,260
How can I possibly do that?

856
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,480
Li, the thing is,

857
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,730
what you just said

858
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:42,870
actually reflects

859
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:44,210
most people's stereotype

860
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,650
of internet celebrities.

861
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:46,680
They think being a livestreamer

862
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,480
means you have to sing and dance.

863
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,720
But that's not the case.

864
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,300
Actually, nowadays,

865
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,310
multi-channel network agencies

866
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,290
don't set any limits

867
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,670
on content creators at all.

868
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,310
Look,

869
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,950
just at our company, we have all sorts of creators,

870
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:56,950
like e-commerce livestreaming,

871
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:57,990
beauty product reviews,

872
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,510
store visits, and so on.

873
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:00,440
Believe me.

874
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,690
Even if you livestream

875
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,080
you only have to type on a keyboard

876
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,050
and you'll still attract

877
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,010
a huge number of people.

878
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,010
No problem at all.

879
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,630
Me, typing there

880
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,630
will attract

881
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,650
a large audience?

882
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,630
But why?

883
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:14,740
You still don't believe it?

884
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,550
I don't believe it. How is that possible?

885
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:18,010
Let me give you an example.

886
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,510
Last year, our company

887
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,380
had a case where

888
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,330
one livestreamer

889
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,230
did nothing for a whole year.

890
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,430
You know what she did?

891
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,110
She just livestreamed

892
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,550
the entire process of herself sleeping.

893
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,040
Sleeping? Who would watch that?

894
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,350
She got over 30,000 views

895
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,740
and over 10,000 yuan in revenue.

896
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,770
Nowadays, being boring is not a problem.

897
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,430
The problem is if you're not unique.

898
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,160
So Li, really,

899
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,650
trust me.

900
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,300
With our friendship of so many years,

901
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,500
I wouldn't lie to you.

902
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,490
Sign with me

903
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,340
and let's

904
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,030
open up a new track together.

905
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:42,030
Plus, you can choose

906
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,560
the family life category

907
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,660
or the parenting education category.

908
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:45,430
Up to you.

909
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:48,920
Must be Meng Fei.

910
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,210
Yes, she said she was going to come find me.

911
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,100
How did you get here so fast?

912
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,470
I have to be fast.

913
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,200
If I were any slower,

914
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,060
you would be taken away

915
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,120
by the big bad wolf!

916
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,600
You didn't say yes to him, did you?

917
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:08,450
No matter what he says,

918
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,780
you must not agree.

919
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,510
You hear me?

920
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:11,520
Ms. Meng,

921
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:12,370
don't bring your personal emotions

922
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,250
into work.

923
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,870
Do you have better suggestions than me

924
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,350
about Li's career plan?

925
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,340
Of course.

926
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,870
Cherry, let me help you.

927
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,040
Let's

928
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,190
set up a studio together.

929
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:36,990
You two

930
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,710
are quite funny.

931
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,170
Starting a company

932
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:43,510
is not as simple as opening a bottle of wine.

933
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,690
It requires a large investment of

934
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,560
manpower, material resources, and financial resources.

935
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,530
It's not something you two

936
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:48,930
can afford at this stage.

937
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,300
Today, your platform

938
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,500
may open up to Cherry,

939
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,450
but tomorrow, it could

940
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,630
open up to Strawberry, Blueberry, and Raspberry.

941
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,850
The cake is only so big,

942
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,050
but the number of people sharing it

943
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:57,750
is growing.

944
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:58,890
In the end, the energy

945
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:01,070
will only be spent on internal competition.

946
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,590
How can we even focus on creation?

947
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,670
But I'm different.

948
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,310
What I can do for Cherry is that

949
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,920
if we start a company

950
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,830
or a studio,

951
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,100
all my energy will

952
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,610
be focused on her alone.

953
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,930
No, aren't you just making empty promises?

954
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:12,610
Who's making empty promises?

955
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,230
You are making empty promises.

956
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,210
That fleeting

957
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,230
opportunity to cash in

958
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,170
will be gone if you miss it.

959
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,170
You're messing up a good hand.

960
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:18,840
Do you know what I mean?

961
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,660
I understand all too well.

962
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,190
Only people who lack confidence

963
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,850
would say that.

964
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,130
It's still better than your blind confidence.

965
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:23,970
Who's blindly confident?

966
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:24,730
You are blindly confident.

967
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:25,360
How long have she and I known each other?

968
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,130
We have

969
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,010
a great deal of tacit understanding.

970
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,810
Can you listen to me for a second?

971
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,790
Let me make my position clear.

972
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,960
I really don't think

973
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,940
I can go to Yuan Yi's place

974
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,670
and become an internet celebrity.

975
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:43,500
I also don't think

976
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,530
I can start a company or a studio.

977
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,550
Really,

978
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,460
I have neither manpower nor resources.

979
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,350
I still have to take care of my family.

980
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,270
Even if I wanted to,

981
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,270
I wouldn't have the ability to do so.

982
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,840
-You don't need it, Li.
That's why you need my help.

983
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,990
I can help you perfect everything.

984
00:33:58,990 --> 00:33:59,930
You can't help with anything.

985
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:00,610
-I can.
-She and I...

986
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,560
-No problem.
-We're very…

987
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,630
We've had a tacit understanding for many years.

988
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:03,270
Don't always be like this.

989
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,090
You're the one who's making empty promises.

990
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,480
Mom, I'm back.

991
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,470
You're back?

992
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,030
Auntie.

993
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:08,790
Auntie.

994
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,480
Meng, you're here.

995
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,250
Yuan Yi and Meng are here.

996
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,710
You bought so many things.

997
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,040
How can you carry all of these?

998
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,550
Yeah.

999
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,489
Give it to me.

1000
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:15,850
Are the eggs broken?

1001
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,449
It's okay.

1002
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,159
Let me help.

1003
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,190
No need.

1004
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,070
You're so fake.

1005
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:19,710
Okay.

1006
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,630
Yuan, have a seat.

1007
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,500
Ms. Li.

1008
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:22,659
Mom.

1009
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:24,580
A super big car came

1010
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,670
to pick us up today.

1011
00:34:25,949 --> 00:34:27,870
We could drink beverages inside

1012
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:29,219
and watch cartoons.

1013
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,840
It could even heat up our bottoms.

1014
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,480
Can we buy one too?

1015
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:35,050
We'll buy...

1016
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:36,510
Mommy will buy you

1017
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,840
a heated seat cushion, okay?

1018
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,570
It can also heat up your bottom.

1019
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,010
That's not the same.

1020
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,159
Greet them.

1021
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,350
Hello, Uncle Yuan.

1022
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:46,800
Hello, Auntie Meng Fei.

1023
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:48,270
As long as Aiwen is happy.

1024
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,030
So, Li,

1025
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,770
if you sign with me,

1026
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,560
I'll pay for

1027
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,000
the regular pick-up and drop-off,

1028
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,460
plus a housing allowance.

1029
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,160
Aiwen, can I borrow

1030
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,290
your paper and pen?

1031
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,350
Over there.

1032
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:02,050
Thank you.

1033
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,130
What are you up to now?

1034
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,790
[Letter of Resignation]

1035
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,520
Are you crazy?

1036
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,160
It's my determination.

1037
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,990
As long as you're willing to go all out

1038
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,050
and do this with me,

1039
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:27,370
I'll go resign from the publishing house tomorrow.

1040
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:40,940
Ms. Meng.

1041
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:42,740
Ms. Meng.

1042
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,390
You dropped something.

1043
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:43,730
What?

1044
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,440
What dropped? Your heart?

1045
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,370
It's your heart.

1046
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,450
You dropped your determination.

1047
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,230
Here we go again, right?

1048
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,590
Give it back to me.

1049
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,010
I know you want to

1050
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,450
work with Li.

1051
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,140
You two are the best partners.

1052
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:04,810
I have a better idea.

1053
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,010
Do you want to hear it?

1054
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,130
You two come to my company together.

1055
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,860
You'll be her exclusive agent.

1056
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,550
It'll be a win-win situation for us.

1057
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,100
What do you think?

1058
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,640
Keep dreaming your big dreams.

1059
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:18,210
Let me tell you.

1060
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,790
There are only two paths for this matter.

1061
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:21,050
One is that I win a complete victory.

1062
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,530
The other is that you suffer a crushing defeat.

1063
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:23,620
No way.

1064
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:28,400
What do you have against me?

1065
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,050
Have my wife sign with you?

1066
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,670
Yes, bro.

1067
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:36,550
I understand your concerns.

1068
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:37,390
It's like this.

1069
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,620
If Li really intends to

1070
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,930
enter this business,

1071
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,190
then first of all,

1072
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:42,960
she will encounter many troubles

1073
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,020
and difficulties.

1074
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,980
She'll pay a high price,

1075
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,940
but it'll be different if she signs with me.

1076
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,940
I will back her up.

1077
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:50,690
I will help her avoid

1078
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:51,700
many risks.

1079
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:53,210
Actually, when it comes to internet celebrities,

1080
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,870
there are many different types.

1081
00:36:54,870 --> 00:36:55,990
Your wife isn't popular now,

1082
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:56,470
but

1083
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,810
I'm very optimistic about her future.

1084
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:00,490
I understand.

1085
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,530
I understand everything you said.

1086
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:02,990
I also trust you very much.

1087
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:04,880
It's just that,

1088
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,960
she... First is

1089
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,500
her relationship with Meng Fei.

1090
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,740
And another thing is,

1091
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,850
you know, i is...

1092
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,350
She doesn't really understand these things.

1093
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,480
She is a writer.

1094
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:14,270
So she has a lot of this

1095
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,690
pride.

1096
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,340
And she has a lot of

1097
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,570
her own aesthetic standards.

1098
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:19,990
Bro, I understand.

1099
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,940
Let me sum it up in one sentence.

1100
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,510
I am

1101
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,440
not completely coming from my own perspective

1102
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,990
when considering this issue.

1103
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:26,020
I'm considering it from the perspective of your family

1104
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,880
for this issue.

1105
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,280
If Li does well, you do well,

1106
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:31,510
then your family will do well.

1107
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,270
Do you understand what I mean?

1108
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,050
It feels a bit like

1109
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,280
you are threatening me,

1110
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,280
but I understand.

1111
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,740
I'm just joking. I know.

1112
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,670
I understand everything you said.

1113
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,290
I'll go back

1114
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,440
and whisper in her ear.

1115
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,090
Let me think about how to talk to her.

1116
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,660
But the final decision

1117
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:51,790
is still up to her.

1118
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,990
I have to respect her.

1119
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:54,870
Okay, you just...

1120
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,510
Keep whispering to her.

1121
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,230
Got it.

1122
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,710
-Play some music.
-Okay.

1123
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,910
Let me think about it.

1124
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:03,870
When you play music at home,

1125
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,990
also put in a good word for me.

1126
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:05,910
I know, I know.

1127
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:06,920
You must.

1128
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,160
Don't talk.

1129
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,350
Give me some peace and quiet.

1130
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:10,550
Let me think about it.

1131
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,330
Can you tell what this drawing is about?

1132
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,600
There are even two doors like this.

1133
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,700
It's an RV?

1134
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:19,780
Haven't you seen

1135
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,160
Yuan Yi's car before?

1136
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,190
This is way too abstract.

1137
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:28,710
This kid

1138
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,070
has been corrupted by the evil capitalism

1139
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:31,950
way too fast.

1140
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:33,900
He can't stop thinking about it.

1141
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:34,760
He hopes that you can

1142
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,240
get your hands on the same model.

1143
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,830
Alright, he's asleep now.

1144
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,950
He can have plenty in his dreams.

1145
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,080
Our home was in chaos today.

1146
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,580
Yuan Yi talked to you about it, right?

1147
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,590
He did.

1148
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,920
He wants to turn me into a seductress

1149
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:49,800
and whisper in your ear

1150
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,850
to influence you.

1151
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,790
I didn't give him a definite answer.

1152
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:55,230
But I didn't refuse either.

1153
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:56,560
So what's your opinion?

1154
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:57,950
Do you think

1155
00:38:58,850 --> 00:39:01,180
I'm suitable to be an internet celebrity?

1156
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:04,580
Whether you're suitable to be an internet celebrity

1157
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,720
or a boss or not,

1158
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,030
you have to decide for yourself.

1159
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,890
I can't make the decision for you.

1160
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,630
I think

1161
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,230
you need to make yourself comfortable.

1162
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,350
Making yourself comfortable

1163
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:16,950
is the most important thing.

1164
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,460
So the choice is still in your hands.

1165
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,030
You have to choose for yourself.

1166
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,630
But then I was thinking

1167
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,500
if I could really

1168
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,190
take this opportunity

1169
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,480
to make our family's life better,

1170
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,590
to let our son sit in

1171
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,210
a car with heated seats,

1172
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:30,010
I'd be willing

1173
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,410
to bravely take the risk.

1174
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,740
If you want a car with heated seats,

1175
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,050
you might have to tuck your tail between your legs.

1176
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,050
I think happiness

1177
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,400
is our only choice.

1178
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:40,030
It's best to be happy.

1179
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,520
Making money is also quite important.

1180
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,980
Let me think about it. I'm torn.

1181
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,070
Honey.

1182
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,780
I have something to ask you.

1183
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,030
I need to go out and treat someone to a late-night snack.

1184
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,700
Dong.

1185
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,720
I have to thank him in person

1186
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,030
for helping me out so much.

1187
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:03,430
The job opportunity is pretty good too.

1188
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,590
Why are you asking for my permission on this?

1189
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,910
Haven't I always been like this?

1190
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,570
You're the one who calls the shots in our family.

1191
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:12,720
Thank you, Senior.

1192
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,810
No, Junior.

1193
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,810
I should thank you.

1194
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,940
I'm truly grateful, really.

1195
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:19,630
Quan, you don't need to be so polite.

1196
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:21,430
If you didn't have this ability,

1197
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,940
it would be futile no matter

1198
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,070
how I recommended you.

1199
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:24,510
Right?

1200
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:25,910
But Quan,

1201
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,890
let me tell you.

1202
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,080
As long as you get in,

1203
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,010
the treatment you get

1204
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,400
won't be any worse than your former company.

1205
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,260
I believe that.

1206
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:35,890
When I heard you say

1207
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:37,460
you were staying at home,

1208
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,230
I thought

1209
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,470
you were joking.

1210
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:42,350
I didn't expect you really stayed home

1211
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:44,030
and did housework for a month.

1212
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:46,630
It was originally just a temporary plan,

1213
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,010
but after staying at home,

1214
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:48,790
I indeed discovered that there were

1215
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:49,770
many issues at home.

1216
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,300
I feel I still have some use.

1217
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:53,350
Besides, in the past,

1218
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,410
when I was working,

1219
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,790
Li was very supportive of me.

1220
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:58,200
Now,

1221
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:01,460
she has re-entered the workforce,

1222
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,130
and

1223
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,220
she's also enthusiastic about work.

1224
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:05,190
As her husband,

1225
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,520
I definitely need to support her well.

1226
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,160
You're truly a good man,

1227
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:11,330
Quan.

1228
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,620
You are our school's

1229
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,280
role model for male students.

1230
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,390
I respect you.

1231
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:17,360
I wish you success tomorrow.

1232
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,940
Thank you, thank you.

1233
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,870
The technical architecture is roughly like this.

1234
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,530
Now let me talk about

1235
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,630
the effect of the time-sharing computing.

1236
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:27,510
Nowadays, each of us

1237
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,550
has a phone with a very powerful

1238
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,270
CPU,

1239
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:30,890
but the vacancy rate is very high.

1240
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,050
After installing the app

1241
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:32,810
we designed,

1242
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:33,830
every user

1243
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,690
can perform computing

1244
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:37,150
and accept computing tasks

1245
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,870
when the phone is idle.

1246
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,080
Each customer

1247
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:41,730
will receive a bonus

1248
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,810
during the computing process.

1249
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,540
A few hundred yuan per month is enough.

1250
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,260
After they accept

1251
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,410
one year of tasks,

1252
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,580
they can get

1253
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,370
a new phone.

1254
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:50,040
It's equivalent to receiving two phones

1255
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,420
for the price of one.

1256
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,730
If the number of users exceeds one million,

1257
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,800
the computing power will be very strong.

1258
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,750
In this way, we will have

1259
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,190
the conditions to undertake commercial computing projects.

1260
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,990
That's all for my presentation.

1261
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,230
Thank you.

1262
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,330
What are the conditions

1263
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,330
for his position?

1264
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,160
It's 20,000 yuan per month during the probation period

1265
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,070
and 30,000 yuan per month after that,

1266
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,530
a 13th month pay schedule,

1267
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:20,120
and 10% commission for team projects.

1268
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,160
Give him these conditions.

1269
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:23,660
Okay.

1270
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,540
You will officially start next month.

1271
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,670
During this period,

1272
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:30,340
you can recruit people

1273
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,610
and build your team.

1274
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:32,610
Understood.

1275
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:35,170
Zhou, I chose you

1276
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,830
not only because of your experience

1277
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:37,560
and ability,

1278
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,670
but also because of your tenacity.

1279
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,790
At our age,

1280
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:42,950
we're like shirkers in games.

1281
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,230
We can only wait.

1282
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:48,060
We can't compare with the young people in terms of drive.

1283
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,220
Staying in place or being unable to move forward

1284
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:51,530
means being eliminated.

1285
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:52,850
But once we start to develop,

1286
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:53,910
it will be amazing.

1287
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,260
Those reckless young people can't compare with us.

1288
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:59,430
Mr. Guan, don't worry.

1289
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,730
We will all develop very well.
