I'm sure

00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,300
you won't be put in prison now.

00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,740
Lord Han put in

8
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,860
so much effort for you.

9
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,820
He is very protective of you.

10
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,340
You and Han Wuwei

11
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,700
are not my family.

12
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,620
You don't have to

13
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,540
do so much for me.

14
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,530
What are you talking about?

00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,260

do you like my brother?

17

If you don't,

18
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,660
why are you so kind to me?

19
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:36,090
I...

20
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,420
Of course I like your brother.

21
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,900
But my kindness to you

22
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,460
has nothing to do with me liking your brother.

24
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,780
Just remember

25
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,700
you are a lovely girl.

26
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:48,980
So you deserve

27
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,140
to be treated well.

28
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:53,420
I'm not

29
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,860
a lovely girl.

30

34
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,060
How can you say I've never seen it?

35
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,460
How can you say you did?

36
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,820
I've never seen you.

37
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,460
But I have seen your brother.

38
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,860
You two are quite alike.

39
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,330
But you express it differently.

40
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,780
Your brother

41
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,100
doesn't like to talk.

42
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,100
He kept everything to himself.

43
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,140

upside down.

Actually,

47
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:21,860
you just held on

48
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,300
and didn't want to show weakness.

49
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,340
Who are you talking about?

50
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,820
It must be hard to be alone outside.

51
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,020
But don't worry.

52
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,860
You won't be alone anymore.

53
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,180
We'll be with you.

54
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,100
Why are the girls outside

55
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,340
so cheesy?

56
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:45,850
I thought

57
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,300
you were different from them.

58
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,100
How is that cheesy?

59
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,460
It's wrong to be nice to you?

60
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,100
Go to sleep.

61
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,300

To run Mowu Pavilion,

67

there must be outlaws.

68
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,140
Since I was young,

69
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,500
I practiced martial arts with those kids.

70
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,140
Once we grew up,

71
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,019
we had to fight each other.

72
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,060
And the top ones

73
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,820
will be selected as White Ghosts.

74

Those kids

75

are still young.

76
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,420
Threatening and tempting alone

77
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:34,900
might not work.

78
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,180
The officials I dealt with

79
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,220
were all criminals

80
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,260
with extreme cases.

81
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,060
What the Pavilion needed to do

82
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,060
was to find

83
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,500
key evidence of evil

84
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:47,740
or to kill

85
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,980
major figures.

86
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,540
They called this

upholding justice.

88
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,020
Only by grabbing their hearts

89
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,380
can we command them

90
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,700
over the years.

91

In the history of Mowu Pavilion,

94
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:06,860
there were times

95

when he acted foolishly.

But without

97

the Grand Secretary's incition,

98
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,820
he wouldn't have made a mistake

99
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,620
and be used by the Grand Secretary.

100
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,660
Without me,

101
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,580
Mowu Pavilion

102
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,780
would have ceased to exist,

103
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,260
let alone stand up to the imperial court as an equal.

104
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,260
Unfortunately,

105
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,340
it was the son of Juzi

106
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,220
who destroyed Mowu Pavilion

107
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,900
with the imperial soldiers.

108
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,570
Although I'm the son of Juzi,

109
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,460
I'm not like him.

110
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,580
The reason I stayed there

111
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,580
is just that

112
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,580
I have family that is hard to leave.

113
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,900
If Juzi knows,

114
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,180
should he hate me

115
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,620
or

116
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,900
his own son?

117
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:01,940
Now everything

118
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,050
is gone.

119
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:04,700
In this world,

120
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,980
only Tumi and Li

121
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,020
are my concerns.

122
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,340
If I can find out

123
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,220
everything

124
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,500
and let them live better

125
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,180
and stabler,

126
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:16,460
it'll be the best result.

127
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:27,780
This Yaksha has too many things

128
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,940
out of his command.

129
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,740
Poor thing.

130
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,420
Did your interrogation of the Grand Secretary go well?

131
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:33,540
Tumi and the others

132
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,570
are waiting for Yaksha to come home.

133
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,620
I'll take him home.

134
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:44,500
What's wrong?

135
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,780
You seem troubled.

136
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,140
I'm just tired.

137
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,380
It smells like stinky overnight steamed buns.

138
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,780
It's all rotten.

139
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,260
Get changed.

140
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,660
Brother.

141
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:28,900
All right.

142
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:32,980
Welcome home.

143
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:39,820
This is the house

144
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:40,860
Lord Kang found for you.

145
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:41,780
Do you like it?

146
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,260
Yes.

147
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,659
This is our home now.

148
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,460
Yes.

149
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,620
Home is

150
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,740
where family

151
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,659
and friends are.

152
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,260
In the past,

153
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,140
I always thought

154
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,220
as long as I work hard,

155
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,900
I can let Li live

156
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,380
with father's care.

157
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,380
Yesterday,

158
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,340
Ayili was standing here

159
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,620
watching these

160
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:11,820
and talking about you again.

161
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,300
She smiled happily.

162
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,340
She said

163
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,180
we should always look forward.

164
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,500
Ye,

165
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,140
I may not be able to

166
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,740
feel for

167
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,100
the things you went through.

168
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:25,860
But

169
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,340
I will be with you.

170
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,260
No matter how much time you need

171
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,580
to get over those pain,

172
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,860
I'll always be by your side.

173
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,020
When I was recording the testimony,

174
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:40,700
they asked me

175
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,330
if I've been

176
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,980

00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,940
it was very dangerous.

349
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,380
But after their boss died,

350
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:19,620
they were

351
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:20,820
in a state of disunity.

352
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,420
I just need to catch them separately.

353
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,620
Then the problem is solved.

354
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,580
But it will take longer

355
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,660
to get the bounty.

356
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:27,900
Isn't that

357
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,060
what supporting a family is all about?

358
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:32,860
Why are you laughing?

359
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,380
I'm not laughing at you.

360
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:37,530
I'm just surprised.

361
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,100
The top assassin in Mowu Pavilion

362
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,020
has started to

363
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,140
think about supporting a family.

364
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:44,660
Ye.

365
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,740
What task did you take?

366
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:46,940
Tell me.

367
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,540
Let me see if there's anything I can help.

368
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,780
Just searching for gangsters

369
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,180
and lost official seals and others.

370
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,300
The hardest part

371
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,260
is

372
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,060
to distinguish whether their information is true.

373
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
How?

374
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,780
Miss Chun, do you want to change your profession?

375
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,180
I’m just asking.

376
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,420
Maybe it will help me

377
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,300
solve cases in the future.

378
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,220
What information do you think

379
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,460
is the hardest to distinguish?

380
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,700
70% true and 30% fake ones.

381
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:16,860
It's 100% ones.

382
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,340
100% ones?

383
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,460
Isn't that completely true?

384
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,340
What's so hard about it?

385
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,260
Not really.

386
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,490
It should be 120%.

387
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,660
The 20% that disappeared

388
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,260
is because the former 100%

389
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,180
is true.

390
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,700
That's why people can't tell.

391
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,700
In the end, you lose everything.

392
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,580
That makes sense.

393
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:46,940
[UNIFON]

394
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:40,900
Ye,

395
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,540
what tasks

396
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,460
did you take before?

397
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,580
I thought, when you were on task,

398
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:45,980
you only needed to...

399
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,700
How is that possible?

400
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,220
I used to go astray,

401
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,330
but

402
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:53,540
I was not

403
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,060
a little thief who robbed houses.

404
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,220
I can't just be aggressive

405
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,460
all day long, right?

406
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,740
I've handled many tasks

407
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,980
related to the imperial court.

408
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,420
But the last step

409
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,900
is usually the simplest.

410
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:06,260
That's why I needed...

411
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:10,420
So,

412
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,260
The hardest part is to distinguish the real from the fake.

413
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,339
What's the first step

414
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,220
to be a litigator?

415
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,020
End the patrol.

416
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,500
Say goodbye to Lord Kang first,

417
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,619
sort out

418
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,339
the previous cases

419
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,819
and start my own business.

420
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:28,380
But Mowu Pavilion

421
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,020
suddenly disrupted my plan.

422
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,540
Lord Kang is busy interrogating the Grand Secretary.

423
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,780
He has no time to see anyone.

424
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,820
So I have to wait and wait.

425
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,140
Didn't Lord Kang

426
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,340
already finished the trial?

427
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,100
Yes.

428
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,060
I thought he was interrogating the Grand Secretary.

429
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,180
That's why he didn't invite me.

430
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:45,180
Have you seen the person who interrogated the Grand Secretary?

431
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,170
Could it be Lord Han?

432
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,380
What about you?

433
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,300
Who interrogated you?

434
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,180
Lord Kang.

435
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,020
How could it be

436
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,340
Lord Kang who interrogated you?

437
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,980
The Mowu Pavilion case is such a big case.

438
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,660
Lord Kang received the imperial edict.

439
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,220
The Grand Secretary is the main culprit.

440
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,460
There's no way Lord Han,

441
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,340
such an inexperienced person,

442
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,060
was the one to interrogate him.

443
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,500
Ye.

444
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:07,180
Don't you think it's strange?

445
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:10,340
It's okay.

446
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,180
There's always a way.

447
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,740
When Lord Kang is finished with his business,

448
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,580
when you see him,

449
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,660
you can ask him.

450
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,260
Brother, let's go to the front.

451
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:24,900
Okay.

452
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,540
Lord Han,

453
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,500
why do I feel

454
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,980
you have a lot on your mind today?

455
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:36,780
Really?

456
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,620
Tumi.

457
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,260
Look.

458
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:41,860
Do they look like

459
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,580
our family of three?

460
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:43,660
The one in the middle is me.

461
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,460
The one on the left is you.

462
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,460
The one on the right is my brother.

463
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,620
Yours is the prettiest one.

464
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,860
I liked it at first sight.

465
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,300
In the future, I'll put them

466
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,220
in the most eye-catching place.

467
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,180
Nice.

468
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:53,940
Lord Han,

469
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,100
what do you think?

470
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,780
The colors are not bad.

471
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,260
But the workmanship is rough.

472
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,380
They're not decent.

473
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,980
I knew you would say that,

474
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:01,980
so I didn't buy yours.

475
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,380
It saved me five strings of coins.

476
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,740
Why are you so stingy?

477
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,900
I gave you so many things,

478
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,580
Why do you have to save money on this?

479
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:08,860
I'm responsible for the finances.

480
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,380
Of course, I need to be careful when planning and budgeting.

481
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,180
Let's go.

482
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,500
Colored figurines.

483
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,020
Come buy colored figurines.

484
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,020
Young Master, do you want a colored figurine?

485
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,020
Boss.

486
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,140
Was there a little girl

487
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,660
who bought three colored figurines here?

488
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,620
Young Master,

489
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,420
there were many girls

490
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,490
who bought colored figurines

491
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,460
from my stall.

492
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,300
Which one are you talking about?

493
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,620
Her face is round.

494
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,660
She has big eyes.

495
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,300
She looks pretty when she smiles.

496
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,700
Wait for me.

497
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,100
Here.

498
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,580
That girl

499
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,620
asked me to give this to you.

500
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,060
For me?

501
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,100
Yes, that's right.

502
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,300
It's for you.

503
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:54,900
She also said

504
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,140
if a young master

505
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,580
comes to buy colored figurines with drooping eyes,

506
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,260
just give this to him.

507
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,820
She also asked me to tell you that,

508
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:02,740
in the future,

509
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,700
don't frown

510
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,540
and don't be downhearted.

511
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,260
When you're free,

512
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,020
take this

513
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,140
joyful colored figurine

514
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:07,780
and smile more.

515
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,980
All your worries will be gone.

516
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,100
Okay.

517
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,820
Is this the last one?

518
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,580
I think so.

519
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,620
Miss Chun.

520
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,100
My lord.

521
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,380
Is Lord Kang looking for me?

522
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,260
Lord Kang hasn't finished the trial.

523
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,490
He won't see outsiders for the time being.

524
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,810
Lord Han has a gift

525
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,540
for Miss Ayili.

526
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,180
For me?

527
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:34,940
Yes.

528
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,700
Miss Ayili.

529
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,410
This jade is priceless.

530
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,460
His Highness had it on him everyday.

531
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,060
Now he gave it to you.

532
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,660
Miss Ayili, please keep it

533
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,700
carefully.

534
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:50,940
Maybe,

535
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,220
there will be use for it in the future.

536
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,660
Okay, I got it.

537
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,940
Please thank Lord Han for me.

538
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,060
I will keep it carefully

539
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,060
with me.

540
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:01,700
Goodbye.

541
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,300
Han Wuwei has such good taste.

542
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,980
Since he carried it everyday,

543
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,570
it must be valuable.

544
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:11,940
When we can't

545
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,900
make ends meet,

546
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,300
let's take it to a pawnshop.

547
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,780
We will certainly get a lot of money.

548
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:17,660
Brother.

549
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,220
Did you find a job?

550
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,010
What is this?

551
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,660
It's a gift from Han Wuwei.

552
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,260
Didn't Lord Han just give you

553
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,340
a bunch of toys?

554
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,300
Why did he give you

555
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,220
such an precious thing again?

556
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,100
What?

557
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,660
Is this very precious?

558
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,140
Leave him alone.

559
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,420
He's not smart.

560
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:44,740
He’s weird every day.

561
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:45,940
Li.

562
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,100
Lord Han is older than you.

563
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,460
Besides,

564
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,380
he helped you

565
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,860
escape from the Grand Secretary's chase,

566
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:52,700
and brought you

567
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,580
out of

568
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,260
the Mowu Pavilion case.

569
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,300
You owe him a lot.

570
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:56,900
Don't just call him

571
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:57,980
by his full name.

572
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:58,660
Got it?

573
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:00,500
Yes, brother.

574
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,220
I'll call him Lord Han from now on.

575
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,340
Take it.

576
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,540
You said he was acting weird.

577
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:10,940
What made you think that?

578
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,500
How should I put it?

579
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,100
He is quite a contradictory person.

580
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,460
He doesn't get along well with me,

581
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,700
but if I'm in trouble,

582
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,740
he will help me.

583
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,820
Sometimes he's quite mature.

584
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:21,860
Sometimes,

585
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,420
he do things without discretion.

586
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,500
What did he do to you?

587
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,980
Not to me.

588
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,860
Last time when father was cremated,

589
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,380
I saw

590
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,140
him secretly pressing on

591
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,820
an acupoint on father's neck.

592
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,100
I shouldn't have asked him for help.

593
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,620
He was so careless.

594
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:46,940
He pressed him so hard.

595
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,460
Which acupoint did he press?

596
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:50,620
Brother.

597
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:51,900
Do you mean somewhere

598
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,300
near Fengchi acupoint?

599
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:54,820
Which acupoint?

600
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:55,740
Fengchi acupoint

601
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,730
is a necessary acupoint for facial disguise.

602
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,180
Are you suspecting tha Lord Han

603
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,380
was checking whether your father's body

604
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,460
was fabricated?

605
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,420
Maybe he's particularly meticulous.

606
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:08,740
Brother.

607
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,460
Any news about the Grand Secretary?

608
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,820
As long as he's still at large,

609
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,460
my heart will beat quickly.

610
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,180
Don't worry.

611
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,060
If there's any news,

612
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:18,860
Lord Kang and Lord Han

613
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,780
will inform us.

614
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,100
Isn't this the reward notice?

615
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,100
What are you doing with it?

616
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,250
To make money

617
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:31,060
and buy you legal books.

618
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,220
Sister.

619
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:43,980
This is for you.

620
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:44,940
I saw that

621
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:45,900
you wanted to read it yesterday.

622
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,220
There is military emblem on it.

623
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,580
What Lord Han gave you

624
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,260
was not a jade?

625
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,780
Then what is it?

626
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,180
This is Prince Xian's seal.

627
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,260
Anyone with this seal

628
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,140
can get through without impediment

629
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,020
between the regions.

630
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,490
If this is so useful,

631
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,780
why did he give me this?

632
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,580
We live in Luoyang now,

633
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,580
and we don't go far.

634
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,980
Even if I go far,

635
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,060
no one will stop me.

636
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,060
Although this jade

637
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:16,980
is useless now,

638
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,210
my brother said

639
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,180
when I see Lord Han next time,

640
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,500
I'll thank him face to face.

641
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,900
Did Ye say where he went

642
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,700
when he left just now?

643
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,060
He said he went to discuss things with Lord Han.

644
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,660
My lord, Yaksha is here to see you.

645
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,100
How did you know?

646
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:09,780
Fengchi acupoint?

647
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,940
Did Ayili tell you?

648
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,340
She is naive.

649
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,780
She may be carefree,

650
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,140
but

651
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,340
she can find

652
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,540
what we can't notice.

653
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,740
You are a good brother.

654
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,340
You are so cautious.

655
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,900
The task

656
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,940
wasn't Mowu Pavilion,

657
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,460
but my father.

658
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,570
Did you really send my father's skeleton

659
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,740
to Liurong Temple?

660
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,740
You interrogated the Grand Secretary yourself

661
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,940
and gave the important seal to Li,

662
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,260
because you knew I had something to do with it,

663
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,660
so left us a way out.

664
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Since you guessed it,

665
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,980
you shouldn't have come.

666
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,620
You should have escaped.

667
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,900
With your martial arts skills,

668
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,460
where in this wide world

669
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,420
can't you go?

670
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,460
I knew it.

671
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,220
Father is dead.

672
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,300
I'm the only one you want.

673
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,420
I just don't understand.

674
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,370
The late emperor abolished a Crown Prince.

675
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,060
He was wise and easygoing.

676
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,700
Later, he was abolished because he made a mistake

677
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,020
and angered the late emperor.

678
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,020
This dethroned Crown Prince

679
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,780
should have spent his life

680
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:48,900
in the confinement.

681
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,420
But one night

682
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,340
decades ago,

683
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,700
the Eastern Palace was on fire

684
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,420
and he disappeared.

685
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,700
If there was such a person,

686
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,660
do you think

687
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,220
he will be the sore point

688
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,340
of the successor?

689
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,650
Later I learned that

690
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,980
after the dethroned Crown Prince disappeared,

691
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
he changed a lot.

692
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,170
Unfortunately,

693
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,020
such a wise

694
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,620
and easygoing person

695
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,580
didn't reflect on his faults.

696
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,340
Instead, he built his own army

697
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,620
and wanted to take everything back.

698
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,420
Although he is dead now,

699
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,140
his children are implicated.

700
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,260
The winner takes all.

701
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,420
He's not worthy of sympathy.

702
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,170
I just pity his children.

703
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,260
His children are innocent.

704
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,740
His children didn't know

705
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,940
what he did.

706
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,050
So what?

707
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,460
If we don't destroy the roots,

708
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,460
there will be a big trouble.

709
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,540
If you were the successor,

710
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,650
what would you do?

711
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,060
Will you let Li go?

712
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,380
Will you run away?

713
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,740
In the past,

714
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,060
I would.

715
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,100
It's not the life I chose.

716
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,260
It has nothing to do with me.

717
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,580
From now on,

718
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,220
I'll live an ordinary life,

719
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,450
isn't that great?

720
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,180
But now,

721
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,660
I have a family I want to protect

722
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:48,940
and someone I love.

723
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,460
I can't run away.

724
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,380
If I run away,

725
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,900
I won't have the chance

726
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,140
to stand by their side this life.

727
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,820
You were born into the trap.

728
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,820
You'll die for sure.

729
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,020
Lord Kang.

730
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,010
You know Yaksha is innocent.

731
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:14,300
This is unfair to him.

732
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:15,860
You signed the arrest warrant

733
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,460
but you didn't release it.

734
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,700
That means you hesitated.

735
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,100
You thought he still has hope,

736
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:19,660
right?

737
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,860
I want to fight for it.

738
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:26,980
If you trust me

739
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:28,860
and the law,

740
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,780
it is more important than anything.

741
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,660
Please help me.

742
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,260
You have no choice but to run.

743
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,780
Forget everything in the past.

744
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,620
Go east or west.

745
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,530
Don't show your identity as Yaksha.

746
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,300
Going away

747
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,260
is your only way to live.

748
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:49,940
Tumi's dream

749
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,860
is to be a litigator.

750
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,180
If I run away,

751
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,500
what should she do?

752
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,660
Forget her.

753
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,260
You part ways from now on.

754
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,860
I can let Ayili go

755
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,170
and help you persuade Chun Tumi.

756
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,660
I have a clear conscience.

757
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,620
I don't need help.

758
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:13,180
Why are you here?

759
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,180
Ayili can't get

760
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,100
the seal Lord Han gave to Ayili.

761
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,020
Your tasks

762
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,140
are mostly related to the imperial court.

763
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,820
You must know.

764
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:25,860
Why didn't you say anything?

765
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,180
You told me not to think too much.

766
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,580
There's always a way.

767
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,860
Do you want to bear it by yourself again?

768
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:35,820
No.

769
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,620
You want to turn around, leave

770
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,740
and face it alone, again?

771
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,660
Since I met you,

772
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,100
I only have you in my heart.

773
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,460
There are things

774
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:46,740
I don't want you to

775
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,860
bear with me.

776
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:54,980
I finally

777
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,900
can stand beside her openly.

778
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:58,820
I will never destroy everything

779
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,820
with my own hands.

780
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,050
So you want to go to Chang'an for trial?

781
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,620
Since you want to interrogate me,

782
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,020
it means I have

783
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,180
things

784
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,140
you want to know.

785
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,260
As long as I have a chance to defend myself,

786
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,130
I still have a chance to survive.

787
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,700
Let's see if what I can give you

788
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,220
is more than

789
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,820
the interests I will bring you if I die.

790
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,980
The Supreme Court is in charge of the Mowu Pavilion case.

791
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,140
Lord Kang ordered me

792
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,420
to act for Yaksha, the main criminal.

793
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,860
Please allow us

794
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,020
to go to Chang'an.

795
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,060
Juzi is dead.

796
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:46,820
The Grand Secretary thought of Yaksha as

797
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,780
the only person in charge of Mowu Pavilion.

798
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,100
All the actions of Mowu Pavilion

799
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,490
was instructed by Yaksha.

800
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,380
All the evidence

801
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,690
has been sent to Chang'an.

802
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,300
You have no chance

803
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,140
to reverse the case.

804
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,370
I won't let you get involved in this mess.

805
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,220
This case is different.

806
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,900
It's not a court trial as you imagined.

807
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,780
Since it's a court trial,

808
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,220
it means the imperial court

809
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,500
still cares about reputation.

810
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,780
I must fight for it.

811
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,300
It's only natural to pay with your life for murder.

812
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,300
Mowu Pavilion took money

813
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,100
to eliminate disasters for people.

814
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,340
Legally speaking,

815
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,460
Yaksha is not intentioner

816
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,420
but the executor.

817
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,220
A crime committed by a powerful person can be mitigated.

818
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:26,820
As long as it's not a death sentence,

819
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,220
I can make up for my mistake.

820
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,500
The people Mowu Pavilion

821
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,620
assassinated or bribed

822
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,660
were not ordinary people.

823
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,580
There were many dignitaries

824
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,700
and officials among them.

825
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:43,020
If he violated any one,

826
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,740
he would die for sure.

827
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,100
Why were they bribed?

828
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,330
Why were they killed?

829
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,340
If the victim was a high-ranking official,

830
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,660
it proved that the person who had a conflict of interest with him

831
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,220
was also an important official of the imperial court.

832
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,300
If we can find a moth of the country

833
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,260
and bring him to justice,

834
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,340
it's a contribution.

835
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,180
The more cases

836
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:00,460
like this there are,

837
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,900
the lesser the punishment.

838
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,220
Chun Tumi,

839
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,660
the road you choose is the hardest one.

840
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,460
The path that makes everyone suffer.

841
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,180
I want to take the difficult path.

842
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,860
The darker it is, the more righteous it should be.

843
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,980
If you fight evil with evil,

844
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,020
you will never

845
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,170
live under the sun.

846
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,620
In the name of law,

847
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:20,940
I'm willing to

848
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,460
argue and get Yaksha and Ayili

849
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,700
upright identities.

850
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,980
Let them live in an upright manner

851
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,740
under our dynasty's law.

852
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:31,940
Tumi,

853
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,180
you want to fight

854
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,500
against the Supreme Court

855
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,140
and His Majesty alone?

856
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:43,940
The one you want to fight

857
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:45,460
is the side

858
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,100
that you wanted to serve all along.

859
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,780
If they want to destroy your faith,

860
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,260
it will be as easy as pea.

861
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,660
The laws you believe in

862
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,340
are made by them.

863
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,380
You won't regret it

864
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,980
even if your faith is subverted?

865
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,740
There are no choices in life.

866
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,690
But you will become someone else's pawn,

867
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,500
are you willing?

868
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,780
Knowing that the one holding the pawn

869
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,060
is His Majesty,

870
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,540
are you afraid?

871
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,260
Okay.

872
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,500
Then, I'm not afraid either.

873
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,739
We choose our own path.

874
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,540
Ridiculous.

875
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,699
I shouldn't have

876
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,900
take you on patrol

877
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,900
and let you have such a delusion.

878
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:40,260
Without me

879
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,210
or Kang Zhengyuan,

880
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,620
do you think you can

881
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,020
solve so many cases smoothly?

882
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:45,820
Lord Han is right.

883
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,020
You shouldn't have

884
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,409
taken me on patrol.

885
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,860
You shouldn't let me get involved in the cases,

886
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:51,820
or let me know

887
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,940
I can do it myself.

888
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,020
The first thing you shouldn't have done

889
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,100
is to praise me

890
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,900
when I defended innocent people

891
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,340
with law.

892
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,220
I studied law since I was a kid.

893
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,540
I studied day after day. I never slack off.

894
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,780
Lord Han, I'm a girl.

895
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,420
I didn't study women's virtues or needlework.

896
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,460
Why?

897
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,100
For scholarly honor or official rank?

898
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,020
It's because I believe

899
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,700
if the law was broken, social order will be in chaos.

900
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,220
The law is the foundation of a country.

901
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,660
It is the only support

902
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,340
for people to have a good life.

903
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,420
The laws I copied

904
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,220
is taller than

905
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,220
Lord Han.

906
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,500
I've memorized

907
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,060
the laws you made.

908
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,260
So when Luo Li threatened

909
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,660
to kill me

910
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,180
and my family,

911
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,220
I didn't back down.

912
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:46,660
Lord Han,

913
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,140
have you ever thought that

914
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,900
I didn't back down when things went your way,

915
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,940
would I back down

916
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,620
when things didn't go your way?

917
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,820
Since people are willing to risk their lives

918
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,580
to protect,

919
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:00,740
abide by

920
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,180
and defend the law,

921
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,660
they won't compromise

922
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,140
to anyone.

923
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:10,860
That's who I am.

924
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,620
I'm willing to risk everything

925
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,700
to act for Yaksha on court.

926
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,860
Naive!

927
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,580
So naive.

928
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,540
You can say I'm naive and ignorant.

929
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,300
I'm not afraid of manifold ordeals.

930
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,460
I left a letter before this trip.

931
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,140
If the result is bad,

932
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,820
I won't contact my family.

933
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,020
I won't implicate them.

934
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,140
Yaksha treated me with sincerity.

935
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:42,900
If I abandon him

936
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,020
because he's facing

937
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,140
powerful opponents,

938
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,420
how can I face him?

939
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,420
Someone has to have no regrets

940
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,620
even if he loses his head.

941
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,020
Only then can people believe that

942
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:56,980
the law is not just

943
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,140
cold clauses,

944
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,260
it's the guarantee to protect their lives

945
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,860
when they are in danger.

946
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,980
Those who protect the dignity of the law

947
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,860
have affection and faith.

948
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,900
They abide by the law but are not afraid to fight authority.

949
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,580
Lord Han,

950
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,130
please take me to Chang'an

951
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,540
to defend Yaksha.

952
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,500
Are you sure

953
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,340
you can handle the consequences?

954
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,500
As long as Yaksha's trial is in public,

955
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,700
as long as you don't deprive

956
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,900
our last chance,

957
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,540
we can.

958
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,940
I'm not afraid of taking the responsibility.

959
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,060
I'm not afraid

960
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:45,860
of any consequence.

961
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:50,980
Fine.

962
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,660
Let's see

963
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:58,460
how far you can go.

964
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:16,660
Guards!

965
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,900
Arrest the prisoner, Yaksha.

966
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,980
Take Chun Tumi

967
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,860
to Chang’an for trial.
