Ye,

5
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,460
this place looks quite nice

6
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,700
after cleaning up.

7
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,140
I have brought you food.

8
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,780
These are cheese, honey, and ca san.

9
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,940
Wait a minute.

10
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,540
It's all crushed.

11
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:24,060
It is delicious.

12
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,340
That's good.

13
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,380
Are you feeling better?

14
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,540
Much better.

15
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,140
Ye,

16
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,540
why did you suddenly come to Youzhou

17
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,100
and get badly injured?

18
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,300
Why did you come to me?

19
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,700
I...

20
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:41,970
My identity is suspicious.

21
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,579
Since you have known it,

22
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:45,860
why did you come to me?

23
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,329
Because we had an appointment.

24
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,579
We said it casually.

25
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,060
Is it that important?

26
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:53,340
Of course.

27
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,140
Although I'm a woman,

28
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,140
I know that since a promise is made,

29
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,660
I can't break my promise.

30
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,740
I'm injured

31
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,300
because I'm a criminal

32
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,340
wanted by the court.

33
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,900
This can't be a joke.

34
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,700
Do you regret not getting me arrested?

35
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,690
You're not a bad person.

36
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,140
Why did you break the law?

37
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,500
I didn't break the law.

38
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,700
I said I'm a criminal

39
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,820
wanted by the court.

40
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:34,980
But I didn't say that

41
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,540
I'm a burglar who kills or robs.

42
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,140
Then why do they

43
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,130
want you?

44
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,900
People only know the height of the temple,

45
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,180
but they don't know how dirty it is.

46
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,980
I don't have to do anything.

47
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,540
Since I was born,

48
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,060
my identity can't be exposed.

49
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,100
You won't understand.

50
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:22,300
I understand.

51
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,930
It's like there are unjust cases.

52
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,460
What you just said

53
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,300
may exist in this world.

54
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,580
If someone

55
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,820
is born to be guilty,

56
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:32,780
there will be no justice

57
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,020
in this world.

58
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:34,980
Justice?

59
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,620
You should leave.

60
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,780
Ye,

61
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:57,820
it is cold in the mountain.

62
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,820
I have brought you some clothes.

63
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,740
You can wear it when you're cold.

64
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,140
Then I'm leaving.

65
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,900
If you didn't break the law,

66
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,260
you are innocent.

67
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,100
There's no reason for them

68
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,220
to arrest you.

69
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,860
If you want to tell me the truth,

70
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,060
I can help you.

71
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,260
If I can't distinguish

72
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,380
right or wrong,

73
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:39,820
I would tell Lord Kang and Lord Han

74
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,260
things about you

75
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,580
after I went back last time.

76
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,580
But I didn't.

77
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,580
You helped me many times.

78
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,060
I know you're warm-hearted but look cold.

79
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,340
So if you say you're innocent,

80
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,580
I believe you.

81
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,020
Because we are friends.

82
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,580
Have a good rest.

83
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,010
I'll visit you next time.

84
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,060
Little girl,

85
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,460
have you seen Zheng?

86
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,780
Isn't Lord Kang here?

87
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,659
When Lord Kang comes back,

88
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,659
come and inform me.

89
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,460
Yes.

90
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,100
When Lord Kang comes back,

91
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,340
let him stay in the room.

92
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:57,380
Yes.

93
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:02,980
Why are you laughing?

94
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,020
Do you think that I used to be careless,

95
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,460
and Zheng took care of me?

96
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,580
I think

97
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,060
you are rough but meticulous.

98
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,340
You are a good brother.

99
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,380
You also think that I have many advantages,

100
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:14,980
right?

101
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:15,770
Tell me.

102
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,020
You're skilled in martial arts.

103
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,180
Yes.

104
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:22,860
What else?

105
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,860
What other advantages do I have?

106
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,260
Besides,

107
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,580
Lord Han, you are noble,

108
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,540
but

109
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,740
every time I tell you what to do,

110
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,940
you don't get angry.

111
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,700
A great person is large-hearted.

112
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,780
I really admire your grace.

113
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:36,940
Little girl,

114
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,140
why do you sigh with emotion like this

115
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,180
all of a sudden?

116
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,659
Because today I suddenly realized something.

117
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,659
I used to think that women being litigators

118
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,290
is the hardest thing in the world.

119
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,700
But later I found that

120
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,810
someone's destiny

121
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,700
can't be changed

122
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,900
since they were born

123
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,540
On the contrary,

124
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,900
a person like me who can choose what to do

125
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,780
is the lucky one.

126
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,900
Besides, meeting

127
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,100
reasonable lords like you

128
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,660
is the luckiest.

129
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:02,580
In this world,

130
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,860
most people

131
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,460
have no choice.

132
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,820
You too?

133
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,620
Lord Han,

134
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,740
are things not going well with Luo Li?

135
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,100
We can't know it

136
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,100
until Zheng comes back.

137
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,220
Then what are you worried about?

138
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,020
I don't know

139
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,380
what will be involved.

140
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,740
I don't know

141
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,020
to what extent Luo Li will do.

142
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,980
I can't control anything.

143
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,179
I don't like

144
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,500
this feeling.

145
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,100
Lord Kang

146
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,340
is in charge of the case.

147
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,059
I don't think Luo Li

148
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,100
can intervene anymore

149
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,980
Will he continue to put pressure on it?

150
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,500
He won't be so crazy

151
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,300
as to harm Lord Kang?

152
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,300
Don't worry.

153
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,900
I trust Zheng's ability.

154
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:49,700
I also believe that

155
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,820
I can protect Zheng

156
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,700
He can't hurt us

157
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,060
unless Luo Li rebels.

158
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,940
Then you don't have to worry anymore.

159
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,300
Do you have any new clues?

160
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:01,860
No.

161
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,740
Miss Chun,

162
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,140
where does your confidence

163
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,180
come from?

164
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,100
Law book again?

165
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,260
Of course.

166
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,860
No matter what conspiracy it is,

167
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,220
it can't escape the law.

168
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,580
No matter how rude Luo Li is

169
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,220
he has to be restricted by the law.

170
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,980
We've one principle when doing things.

171
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,940
That's following the law.

172
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:28,860
Zheng?

173
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:29,940
I told you to stay in the room,

174
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,700
and I would go find you.

175
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:31,860
Don't catch a cold again.

176
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,860
You may leave.

177
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,060
Yes, sir.

178
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,620
Zheng,

179
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,860
what's wrong?

180
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,140
I went to Governor's Office

181
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,340
and planned to

182
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,340
investigate Shan Yi's case.

183
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,540
I didn't expect to hear

184
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,540
big news.

185
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,500
What news?

186
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,300
Shan Yi's grandfather's tomb was robbed.

187
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,860
Robbed?

188
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,180
After he was arrested,

189
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,820
shouldn't the tomb be guarded by soldiers?

190
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,980
How could it be robbed?

191
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:00,930
Yes.

192
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:04,020
Luo Li is so scheming.

193
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,220
He knew that Shan Yi's case

194
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,380
would be handed over to you,

195
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,140
so he made the first move

196
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,020
and robbed the grave

197
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:09,900
to open the coffin without permission.

198
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:10,900
Steal what was entrusted to his care.

199
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,060
This is a good trick.

200
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,330
Is this how he governs Youzhou

201
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,340
for His Majesty?

202
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,340
What's worse,

203
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,500
I knew it was him,

204
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,780
but there is no evidence.

205
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,140
Then, he only needs to punish the soldiers

206
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,700
guarding the tomb hastily.

207
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,260
After all, negligence

208
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,460
is not fatal.

209
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,460
It's not a big crime either.

210
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,260
What's more ridiculous is that

211
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,580
these soldiers all said that

212
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,500
the grave was haunted last night.

213
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,940
They were enchanted

214
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,100
and were unconscious.

215
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,380
That's why this happened

216
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,420
Do you know what Luo Li said?

217
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,020
Actually

218
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,700
it can't be called weird.

219
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,380
My place

220
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,340
has been haunted several times.

221
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,020
In Yanwu Hall

222
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:49,890
and the private prison.

223
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,340
soldiers passed out one after another.

224
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,220
After passing out, they fell to the ground.

225
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,940
They didn't remember anything.

226
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,300
Zhengyuan,

227
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,780
my place is always haunted,

228
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,100
let alone

229
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,540
the grave where

230
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:11,980
demons always appear.

231
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,220
If you don't believe me,

232
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,540
question them as you like.

233
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:23,860
By the way,

234
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,780
I invited Master Zhang

235
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,780
to perform the ritual

236
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,700
to pray for Youzhou.

237
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,300
I won't talk to you in detail.

238
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,340
He did it on purpose.

239
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,220
I...

240
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,860
I was upholding justice.

241
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,340
But he stabbed me in the back.

242
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,180
It is better to believe in its existence

243
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,660
than to believe in its absence.

244
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,180
This is most people's attitude

245
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,820
towards ghosts and gods.

246
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,420
But the most important thing now is

247
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,180
To know what is in the coffin.

248
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,620
What do you mean?

249
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,060
Don't you know

250
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,180
or haven't you found it?

251
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,260
There were no bodies

252
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,300
or any stolen goods.

253
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,580
The coffin is empty.

254
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,060
Empty?

255
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:14,620
Then

256
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,700
what should we do next?

257
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,220
Luo Li is not smart this time.

258
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,980
He's used to being a governor of a region.

259
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,260
He's not used to showing weakness.

260
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,060
In this way,

261
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,700
isn't it beneficial to us?

262
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,260
Why?

263
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,540
Think about it.

264
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,980
If I were a thief

265
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,620
seeing Luo Li's reaction,

266
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,740
I must know that the stuff

267
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,660
is extraordinary.

268
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:35,660
Then,

269
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,300
I either don't dare to act rashly,

270
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,420
or take the risk

271
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,500
to threaten him.

272
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,100
In this way,

273
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,540
it's not good for finding stolen goods.

274
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,060
Maybe those closely involved cannot see

275
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,420
as clearly as those outside.

276
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,700
The longer it takes and

277
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,020
the more people know it,

278
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,100
the more powerful people

279
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,860
will get involved in this mess.

280
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,180
It'll be harder to find the stolen goods.

281
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,810
Tell me.

282
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:57,740
Don't keep us guessing.

283
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,580
Lord Kang is only passing by Youzhou

284
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,500
on a patrol.

285
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,300
He only cares whether anyone's framed.

286
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,940
Unable to find the stolen goods only means

287
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,690
the case is not finished perfectly.

288
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,900
When water is full, it overflows.

289
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,980
When the moon is full, it begins to wane.

290
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,730
It's not necessarily good to be all-rounded.

291
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,660
Whoever loses the thing

292
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,090
gets worried.

293
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,620
How about

294
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,290
letting Luo Li and those bandits...

295
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,940
Let them fight with each other first.

296
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:22,900
We only need to wait for

297
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,060
the evidence to come out.

298
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,420
Yes.

299
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,020
This is indeed a solution.

300
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,340
Tomorrow,

301
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,420
you question Shan Yi again directly.

302
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,780
Make sure there is no false case.

303
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,260
Then we'll set off

304
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:33,900
to Luoyang

305
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,300
and leave this troubled place.

306
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,940
I'll let someone keep an eye on this place

307
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,380
and wait for the right time.

308
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,020
Not tomorrow.

309
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,660
Since I want to order a retrial,

310
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,660
someone has to speak for Shan Yi.

311
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,820
I'm afraid I'll have to trouble Tumi.

312
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,140
What?

313
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,860
Don't you want to go to court?

314
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,500
No...

315
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,500
That's...

316
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,530
Just tell me.

317
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:02,740
Say it.

318
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:03,980
Appealing instead of others,

319
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,260
I will be flogged,

320
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,820
or I need to pay some ransom.

321
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,260
My father used to pay for it.

322
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,060
Now I work for the government.

323
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,700
Can the government pay for it?

324
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,540
Why didn't I realize

325
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,220
you were a little money-grubber?

326
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,380
-I... -Fine.

327
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,660
Leave it to me.

328
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,660
As long as you work hard for the court.

329
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,020
Thank you, Lord Kang.

330
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,020
Please delay for a few more days.

331
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,420
I'll study the files.

332
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,780
I need some people

333
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,060
to investigate it for me.

334
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,380
But Lord Kang's men

335
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,700
will be targeted by Luo Li

336
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,100
Then Lord Han, please send some people

337
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,290
who are useful and inconspicuous

338
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,820
to come and help.

339
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:44,860
No problem.

340
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,540
Those secret guards...

341
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,220
Unless facing people you trust

342
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,180
and the people you are close to,

343
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,100
you won't mention the guards

344
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,900
in public.

345
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,340
And now

346
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,300
you even let her use them directly.

347
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,860
Your attitude toward her

348
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,340
is getting more and more different.

349
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,260
I teased her before

350
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,620
because I thought she was interesting.

351
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,700
I pay more attention to

352
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,220
interesting girls.

353
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,700
Now when I'm fighting side by side with her,

354
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,420
I forgot about these.

355
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,380
I just thought that she is

356
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,340
a reliable comrade.

357
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,180
So,

358
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,420
if she wants to fight,

359
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:27,980
I will provide her

360
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,260
the best weapon.

361
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:32,860
Zheng,

362
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:34,900
if there are more people

363
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:35,780
like her,

364
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:37,820
it will be lucky

365
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,940

366
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,380
Where did this feeling

367
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,460
come from?

368
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,180
After I know more

369
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,580
about ruling the country with the law.

370
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,140
But

371
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,420
this is not the time to talk about this.

372
00:15:59,140 --> 00:15:59,660
What's wrong?

373
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,300
His Majesty's secret edict has arrived.

374
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,330
Don't punish Luo Li.

375
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,060
Stay away from Youzhou.

376
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,690
The location of Youzhou

377
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,900
is really important.

378
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,740
It's an important line of defense

379
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,740
to resist the barbarians in the north.

380
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,260
For His Majesty,

381
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,060
punishing Luo Li

382
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,770
may affect the whole situation.

383
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:34,660
Are you willing to give up?

384
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,780
I wasn't.

385
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,780
We were born into the royal family.

386
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,140
We've been

387
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,220
in the whirlpool of power since childhood.

388
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,540
We have seen everything.

389
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,540
Luo Li is just an official of two dynasties.

390
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,690
His promotion

391
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,900
was not that glorious.

392
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,620
But His Majesty has some concerns about him.

393
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,460
Of course, I'm not convinced.

394
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,380
You've always been proud.

395
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,740
No matter what happens,

396
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,780
you won't back down.

397
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,620
The harder it's, the more eager you proceed.

398
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,540
And you want to do my best.

399
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,300
You are willing now.

400
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,099
Is it because of Tumi?

401
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,700
Instead of fighting with Luo Li,

402
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,780
we'd better let him

403
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:15,780
fight with those bandits.

404
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,140
He won't stop

405
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,210
until he gets the stuff.

406
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,339
He will expose himself during the fight.

407
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,060
Investigating in chaos will be easier.

408
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,660
I will hit it in one shot.

409

really amazed the person in the dream.

everyone could find it.

446

I borrowed

447
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,060
Lord Han's law book before.

448
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:17,260
He was afraid I couldn't finish reading

before I returned it,

450
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,180
so he copied one for me.

518
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:44,660
My lady,

519
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,660
you can eat it

520
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:47,540
with the lily and ginkgo salad.

521
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,580
I put codonopsis pilosula

522
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,980
in the soup.

523
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,690
Eating them both can replenish qi and blood,

524
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,580
and you won't get heaty.

525
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,700
It's the most nourishing

526
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,620
Is it so nutritious？

527
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,180
I don't need it.

528
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,820
I'm not hurt or sick.

529
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,540
What?

530
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:02,820
Last time when going to the court,

531
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,900
who directly passed out

532
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,180
after

533
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:05,970
the lawsuit?

534
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,580
Master said

535
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,180
if you faint again,

536
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,780
I will be punished.

537
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,220
My Lady,

538
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,380
please take pity on Guo.

539
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,340
You must eat

540
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,740
all the soup.

541
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,740
Okay.

542
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,580
Guo,

543
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,340
did you make all these?

544
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,540
Since this pigeon soup is so delicious,

545
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,180
you must have a secret ingredient.

546
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,460
Of course.

547
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,220
For example,

548
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,220
the pigeon soup

549
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,900
must be made with fresh materials.

550
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,180
Especially this pigeon...

551
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,100
It must be

552
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,500
newly bought.

553
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:48,780
Hello.

554
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:49,700
I want to ask

555
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,940
where you put

556
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,900
your cooking ingredients?

557
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,100
My lady,

558
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,140
our ingredients are all over there.

559
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,380
Thank you.

560
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,060
What is this?

561
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,130
Proper fruit.

562
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,060
The Double Seven Festival is coming.

563
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,540
Yes.

564
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,620
It will come in a few days.

565
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,860
We need to prepare for it in advance.

566
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,180
Time flies.

567
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,340
Watch out!

568
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,540
Don't do that.

569
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,860
I've done more dangerous things

570
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:52,700
than this.

571
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:55,580
Right.

572
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:58,020
You dare to get along with me

573
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,540
without knowing my name.

574
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,900
When will you tell me

575
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:02,810
your name?

576
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:08,740
Forget it.

577
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:09,700
I won't ask you anymore.

578
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,940
There is much time.

579
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,620
You will tell me one day.

580
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,460
What is this?

581
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:15,410
It's food therapy,

582
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,420
pigeon soup.

583
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,220
Try it.

584
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,140
Is the soup good?

585
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:02,860
Let me try.

586
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,420
It tastes terrible.

587
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,180
Stop eating it.

588
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,740
I wanted to make a pot of good soup

589
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,420
for you.

590
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,860
Because I can't visit you

591
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,170
in the next few days.

592
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,460
Will you be busy?

593
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,420
I'm appealing instead of a suspect.

594
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,540
We have to save him from

595
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,100
Luo Li, the regional commander of Youzhou.

596
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,500
I'm afraid if I can't do it well,

597
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,100
I will disappoint those who believe me.

598
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,860
I also fear that

599
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,580
punishing vice and rewarding virtue I said

600
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,500
will be only words.

601
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,970
If you do it,

602
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,140
you will make it.

603
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,380
You can do

604
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,100
what others can't do.

605
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,500
Why?

606
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,420
When you went to the court before,

607
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,060
people

608
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,380
doubted you

609
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:05,540
and opposed you.

610
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,020
They thought you couldn't do it,

611
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,020
but you made it.

612
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,140
How did you know it?

613
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,340
Bianzhou is not big.

614
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,180
They

615
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,060
must be gossiping about me.

616
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,420
No.

617
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,300
Those commoners

618
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,500
praised you after hearing about you.

619
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:29,820
Because of you,

620
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,060
even if they were wronged,

621
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,500
they could redress an injustice.

622
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,060
Because what you did

623
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,580
is related to

624
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:38,930
how they live

625
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,220
and their lives.

626
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,380
Only when someone upholds justice

627
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,340
can they live decent lives.

628
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,660
Those who suffer injustice

629
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,980
are grateful to you.

630
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,740
You should be happy.

631
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,540
I see.

632
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,260
What's so scary about Luo Li?

633
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,900
I'll watch you on the day of the court.

634
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,700
Can you enter Youzhou?

635
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,540
Anything else?

636
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,660
Nothing.

637
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,300
I'll see you in court then.

638
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,780
Ye,

639
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,180
can you promise me something?

640
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:54,820
Sure.

641
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,580
Why don't you ask me what it is?

642
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,500
You'll tell me when you want to.

643
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,460
Fine.

644
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,580
I'll tell you after I win the trial.

645
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,060
Sir,

646
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,260
are you okay?

647
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,540
I'm fine.

648
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,300
Miss...

649
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,420
Thank you.

650
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,100
Take this.

651
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,100
Thank you.

652
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,620
Miss,

653
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,380
I want to ask you something.

654
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,660
Is there an inn called

655
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,220
Laizhong Inn?

656
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,220
It's over there.

657
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,220
It is over there...

658
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,820
Miss,

659
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,020
where do you live?

660
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,340
I'll wash it

661
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,740
and return it to you.

662
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,220
It's just a handkerchief.

663
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,380
You don't have to return it to me.

664
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,540
Miss,

665
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,460
you are so nice.

666
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,580
See you again.

667
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,220
I'll leave then.

668
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,340
Greetings, Grand Secretary.

669
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:35,860
Grand Secretary,

670
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,580
why are you here in person?

671
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,100
Can I ask others to deal with

672
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,380
Young Master's matters?

673
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,660
I'm incompetent.

674
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,340
We were trapped by Han Wuwei.

675
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,890
I'm afraid Young Master has died.

676
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:49,820
What?

677
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,820
I've been looking for him for days,

678
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,770
but I haven't found him.

679
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,940
I'm willing to be punished.

680
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,340
Pass my order.

681
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,750
The theft case involves

682
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,180
the regional commander's personal property.

683
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,050
It can't be heard in private.

684
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,980
It can't be heard in private?

685
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,660
This is against the rules.

686
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:17,660
Fine.

687
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,660
I'll go back to report it.

688
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:21,580
Two lords,

689
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,200
goodbye.

00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,380
Why did you agree

692
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,380
so easily?

693
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:32,220
Stop messing around.

694
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,460
Who's messing around?

695
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,660
Think about it.

696
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,660
If no commoners are watching,

697
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,020
won't there be fewer people

698
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,980
commenting on Tumi?

699
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:42,890
Yes.

700
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:44,940
You are so considerate

701
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,380
I didn't expect Luo Li

702
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,620
to do good things with evil intentions.

703
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,820
We have to

704
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,420
find a way to

705
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,140
frustrate him in advance.

706
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,700
What have you thought of?

707
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,020
Luo Li is a high-ranking official.

708
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,420
If he wants Tumi

709
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,500
to suffer a loss,

710
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,380
we can't protect her.

711
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:01,980
What should we do?

712
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,500
Take the initiative.

713
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:05,260
Why hasn't

714
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,820
Khrom Luo's treasure

715
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,340
been found yet?

716
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,500
I don't know.

717
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,100
His lordship's hair on legs

718
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,140
is thicker than our waist.

719
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:14,700
I forbid you

720
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:15,860
to say that about Khrom Luo.

721
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,940
For Youzhou.

722
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,860
Khrom Luo became sallow and emaciated.

723
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:20,820
He even looked swollen,

724
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,980
but you said that about him.

725
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,380
Do you have any conscience?

726
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,540
Where is your conscience?

727
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,900
I didn't say anything.

728
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,020
Damn it.

729
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,500
This young man is right.

730
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,060
Do you remember

731
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,860
the case of the young scholar?

732
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,460
The sentence was changed because

733
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,580
Khrom Luo intervened

734
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,900
too.

735
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:37,900
Yes.

736
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,100
The scholar

737
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,460
was filial.

738
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,900
Thanks to Khrom Luo,

739
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,980
he was not beheaded.

740
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,980
Now he...

741
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,140
What's the matter with him?

742
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,660
That suspect,

743
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:54,970
Shan Yi...

744
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:56,020
You all know him, right?

745
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:56,980
I know.

746
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,420
His ancestors

747
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,460
were all doctors.

748
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,660
They often

749
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,380
treated the poor for free.

750
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,340
The Shan brothers are kind-hearted.

751
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:04,900
Seriously.

752
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:05,780
Yes.

753
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:07,140
He's a good man.

754
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,300
Yes.

755
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,620
One more thing.

756
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:11,420
The litigator who guided Khrom Luo

757
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,860
to sentence

758
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,700
in the case of the scholar

759
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,540
was invited by Khrom Luo personally

760
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,940
to appeal instead of

761
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:17,980
the Shan brothers

762
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,500
this time.

763
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,940
It is good.

764
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,330
This is a good thing.

765
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,420
This time, Shan Yi

766
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,340
will be saved.

767
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,540
Yes, of course.

768
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,980
Khrom Luo cares about

769
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,580
the Shan brothers.

770
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,060
If the officials in Youzhou

771
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,050
don't care about the people of Youzhou,

772
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,940
who else will care about us?

773
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,060
Right.

774
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:38,250
Right?

775
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,540
Khrom Luo

776
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,020
is good.

777
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,700
Let's drink tea instead of wine

778

to show respect to Khrom Luo.

Come on.

Come on.

Propose a toast to Khrom Luo.

784

There have been many comments on you

785

lately.

786
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,300
How did they frame me?

787
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,900
They have been praising you.

788
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,420
They said you worked so hard

789
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:00,740
to clear Shan Yi's name.

790
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,340
You even invited

791
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,860
the litigator who gave advice

792
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,060
in the scholar's case

793

to plead for the people again.

794
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:13,820
She is afraid that she can't

795

get along well with me on the court,

796
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:16,690
so she retreated to advance.

797
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,739
Since she likes to play tricks,

798
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,860
I'll send her off.

799

800

Luo Li's secret vault

803

so that he can't expend his energy

804
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,100
and can be restricted in court.

805

talking about him.

I won't eat your rice

864
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,980
whether I am hungry or not.

865
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:19,820
Where my parents are

866
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,540
is none of your business.

867
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:22,700
This girl

868
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,660
is really eloquent.

869
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,180
Yes.

870
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:24,860
She has a temper.

871
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,260
Yes.

872
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:25,900
Yes.

873
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,300
Zheng.

874
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:38,660
Zheng.

875
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,300
You look much better.

876
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,380
You just got better.

877
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,700
You should be careful.

878
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:52,780
Wuwei,

879
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,020
I, Kang Zhengyuan,

880
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,100
am not a pushover.

881
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,940
I know you have the ability,

882
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,860
but Luo Li and I are both generals...

883
00:36:59,140 --> 00:36:59,500
It will be better if I am...

884
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,540
Don't you believe that

885
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,290
I can handle this case?

886
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,260
Since childhood,

887
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,330
I trust you the most.

888
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,220
You've done a good job.

889
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,380
I'll do

890
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,500
the rest.
