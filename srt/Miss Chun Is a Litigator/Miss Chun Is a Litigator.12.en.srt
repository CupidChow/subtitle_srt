It's too much of an honour.

My lord,

92
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,500
I have two appeals.

93
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,660
First,

94
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,180
Shan Yi was implicated

95
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,540
in the burglary case of the secret vault.

96
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,460
He was wrongly imprisoned and confessed to false charges under torture.

97
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,340
Second,

98
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,340
the grave of Shan Yi's Grandfather grave was stolen.

99
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,940
The body has not been found yet.

100
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,140
I'm innocent.

101
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,740
I'm innocent!

102
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,330
My lord.

103

We're in a peaceful country.

104
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,380
Justice and human relations

105
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,740
are the foundation of our dynasty.

106
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,940
Now both are broken.

107
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,180
My lord, please investigate it.

108
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,530
Give Shan Yi justice.

[Fair and honest]

110
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,020
Lord Kang.

111
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,260
Miss Chun's appeal is ridiculous.

112
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:49,409
The use of torture in interrogation

113
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,300
is permitted by law.

114
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,860
As for the tomb being dug,

115
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,290
it was done by the grave robbers.

116
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:56,420
What does it have to do

117
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,460
with the burglary case of the Governor's Office?

118
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,020
How do you know it wasn't the lack of talent and moral integrity

119
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,740
of the Shans' ancestors that caused this trouble.

120

You're just a girl.

121
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:06,820
How dare you

122
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,020
come here

123
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,700
to speak of law?

124
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,420
Do you know when you write a complaint for others,

125
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,540
if the circumstances of the case

126
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,780
are inconsistent with the actual situation,

127
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,060
you will be flogged 50 times.

128

If the crime is aggravated after supplementary information,

129

you will be punished by a reduction of one degree for false accusations.

can represent me.

143

What about

144
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,740
your confession?

145
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,740
I request a retry

146
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:47,780
and reverse my confession.

147
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,380
Other matters

148
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,500
will be decided by Miss Chun.

149
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:53,940
Okay.

150
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,140
Since you're seriously injured,

[Fair and honest]

155
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,700
Thank you, my lord.

156
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,820
Scholar Tian,

157
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,220
Shan Yi requested a retry.

158
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,940
Do you admit the appeal?

159
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,780
Of course not.

160
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,140
He reversed his confession

161
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,659
and disrespected the law of our dynasty in court.

162
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,300
You should punish him severely.

163

Mr. Tian.

164
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,659
Are you sure the confession that day

165
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,659
is the truth?

166
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,780
Of course.

If it doesn't make sense,

171
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,180
even if he admitted it,

172
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,500
it may not be true.

173
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,420

purpose, means and results.

176
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,460
But these three things didn't make sense.

177
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,700
There are contradictions and flaws.

178
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:07,700
Obviously,

179
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:08,900
he spoke nonsense

180
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,020
under torture.

181
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:11,820
Lord Kang.

182
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,940
Although the law of our dynasty has rules

183
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,180
that he can be tortured in court.

184
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,780
But torturing blindly

185
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,500
is not the attitude to pursue the truth.

186
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,540
Okay, tell me.

187
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,700
Which part doesn't make sense?

188
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:24,140
First is the purpose.

189
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,100
Why did this thief steal?

190
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,460
For money, of course.

191
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:30,820
But Shan Yi's family is poor.

192
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,020
He needed to rent ou the house

193
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,260
to support his family.

194
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,100
Mr. Tian,

195
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,940
you've never investigated the Shans, right?

196
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,100
Shan Yi's grandfather

197
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,260
opened a clinic.

198
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,340
After Shan Yi grew up,

199
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,500
he inherited the clinic.

200
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,020
They were very kind

201
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:43,940
to help people.

202
00:08:44,179 --> 00:08:45,780
They even gave free medical service to the people.

203
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,940
Even though their life is bitter,

204
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,740
they still did good things.

205
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,660
How could

206
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,260
such a person steal?

207
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,020
Maybe he despises small money,

208
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,620
but likes big money.

209
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,540
Copper and silver things are attractive.

210
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,660
Maybe he is hypocritical.

211
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,020
He did those things for fame.

212
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,860
Mr. Tian, do you have proof?

213
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:04,980
If not,

214
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,740
you would have wronged two nice people.

215
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,940
I have evidence.

216
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:13,500
My lord.

217
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,500
This is the testimony

218
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,700
of Shan Yi's neighbors.

219
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,620
According to the neighbors,

220
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,640
[Hua Tuo's incarnation]

221
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,660
Mr. Shan.

222
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,180
Shan Yi and his grandpa are charitable.

223
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,660
When seeing poor patients,

224
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,170
they don't even charge them medical fees.

225
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,130
[Benevolent and kind doctors]

226
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:24,700
Thank you.

227
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,070
[Healing force]

228
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,060
Such a person

229
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:28,940
has no motive.

230
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,820
He couldn't commit

231
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,780
such a big case.

232
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,140
Although there is no motive

233
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,140
known to outsiders,

234
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,220
all signs

235
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,620
point to this person.

236
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,860
It's hard to know a person's heart.

237
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,340
Miss Chun, don't forget that

238
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,860
the secret tunnel found

239
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,380
in the Yanwu Hall in Governor's Office

240
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,860
leads to the Shans.

241
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,540
Your evidence is just a statement.

242
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,850
And this evidence

243
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,580
is the only hard evidence.

244
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,020
This is what I want to say.

245
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,260
Second

246
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,340
is means.

247
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:58,980
Yes.

248
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,180
The secret tunnel leads to Shan's Clinic.

249
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,900
But Shan Yi's statement also said

250
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,820
the room was rented

251
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,260
to a traveler who does business.

252
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,500
And his house

253
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,860
is divided into two courtyards.

254
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,300
In order to avoid disturbance,

255
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,620
there was a wall built in the middle.

256
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,900
What a coincidence?

257
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,300
They didn't build the wall sooner,

258
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,660
but built it

259
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,300
when the travelers came.

260
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,540
Let's forget about what's on the ground.

261
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:18,980
Let's talk about what's under the ground.

262
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,740
Digging such a big secret passage,

263
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,900
there must be earthwork, right?

264
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,210
Where did

265
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,260
the earthwork go?

266
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,660
From the Shans' house to Yanwu Hall,

267
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,540
the terrain is complicated.

268
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,420
You need a map to dig the secret tunnel.

269
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,340
Where did the map come from?

270
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,740
As far as I know,

271
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,340
the travelers living in the Shans' house

272
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,980
were living by selling snacks.

273
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,860
Three people went out to sell.

274
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,130
Seven people stayed at home.

275
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
They got up late

276
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,620
and they didn't go out for business until afternoon.

277
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,140
So they spent most of the time

278
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,380
digging a tunnel at home.

279
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,260
But,

280
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,220
to get the earthwork out,

281
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,100
how can they hide it from others?

282
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:51,700
Although Youzhou

283
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,020
has no curfew,

284
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:53,820
there are

285
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,100
guards on patrol, right?

286
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,300
There should be patrol soldiers

287
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,380
in the Luo residence.

288
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,740
Commander Luo.

289
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,460
Don't you think it's strange?

290
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,140
My lords,

291
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,620
can one person be convicted

292
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,260
only by a confession?

293
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,460
There is no lost property

294
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,500
of Commander Luo

295
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,780
in Shan Yi's house.

296
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,100
His grandfather's grave

297
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,940
was empty too.

298
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,060
How can you convict him?

299
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,300
My lord.

300
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,740
My grandfather has done good deeds all his life.

301
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,580
In the end,

302
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,860
his corpse was exposed in the wilderness.

303
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,090
So far,

304
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,700
we can't even find the body.

305
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,100
God is merciless.

306
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,900
God is blind!

307
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,500
God is blind.

308
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,220
But, my lord, you can see it.

309
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,490
Justice can see it.

310
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,420
If Shan Yi didn't refuse to open the coffin,

311
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,380
things wouldn't have

312
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,460
been like this.

313
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,580
He was secretive

314
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,740
which made the tomb raiders think

315
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,740
there's treasure inside,

316
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,940
that's why they dug it out secretly.

317
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:48,980
After all,

318
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,050
The reason his grandfather couldn't rest in peace after he died

319
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,940
is all Shan Yi's fault.

320
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,700
In this case,

321
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:59,220
even the people think Shan Yi is guilty.

322
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,420
So many

323
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,300
rich people's graves were not stolen,

324
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:05,180
why did they dig the Shans' grave?

325
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,780
Mr. Tian.

326
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:09,900
Commander Luo.

327
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,780
May I know the result?

328
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:14,940
There's nothing

329
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,380
in his grandfather's tomb, right?

330
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,180
Besides, what Commander Luo said is inappropriate.

331
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,140
Did you investigate

332
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,740
the opinions of every citizen?

333
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,340
You...

334
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,090
Chun Tumi, don't be rude.

335
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,500
Since Lord Luo asked,

336
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:29,820
you must have done

337
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,020
a thorough investigation.

338
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,900
Otherwise, he wouldn't have said it without evidence.

339
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:34,860
Yes.

340
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,580
Lord Kang is right.

341
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,860
You must be careful in the criminal investigation.

342
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:39,740
Otherwise

343
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,780
it might ruin

344
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:41,740
a person's future and fate.

345
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,460
How can we make a false guess

346
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,140
behind closed doors

347
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:46,140
like Mr. Tian?

348
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,340
Pat our head and say that

349
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,140
we understand everything.

350
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,740
Wouldn't that be a betrayal of

351
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:50,540
national laws and human principles?

352
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:51,820
Don't be proud when you get an official position,

353
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:52,620
and don't be ashamed when you lose it.

354
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,660
Don't say that an official is useless,

355
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,020
all matters of the locality depend on him.

356
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:55,940
What an official eats comes from the people,

357
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,940
as well as what he wears.

358
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,020
Don't think that people can be bullied,

359
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,380
you are also one of them.

360
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,900
Please look up.

361
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,260
You slaughtered people at your disposal.

362
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,860
How can you call yourself an official?

363
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,540
You...

364
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,060
Everyone knows who opened the coffin.

365
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,500
They just don't say it.

366
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,620
So there's nothing we can do with bad guys?

367
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,060
I want to sue Luo Li

368
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,180
for digging the tomb and stealing the coffin.

369
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:17,620
But not now.

370
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,180
The court is a kind of balance of

371
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,380
interests

372
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,460
and result.

373
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,060
Making Luo Li bear the crime of dereliction of duty

374
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,450
is the best result.

375
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,940
About earthwork...

376
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,900
Miss Chun, what's your opinion?

377
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,740
This is my third point.

378
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,260
In the end,

379
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,620
it will take a long time

380
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,140
to cover up earthwork.

381
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,820
Mixing the earth and wood together

382
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,900
and letting it corrode like a nibble

383
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,260
is the only way to make it invisible.

384
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,100
After digging the secret tunnel,

385
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,620
if they want to transport the earthwork out,

386
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,540
they must be familiar with the terrain of the Luo residence.

387
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:50,540
Besides,

388
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,580
they need to find out

389
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,780
the schedule of the patrol soldiers.

390
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,420
Lord Luo,

391
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,580
how do outsiders

392
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,340
know these things?

393
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,740
There is a saying that

394
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,300
it is difficult to prevent domestic thieves.

395
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,940
Since it's my family matter,

396
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,140
it has nothing to do with you.

397
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,780
Shan Yi.

398
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,300
Come with me

399
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,260
to the Governor's Office

400
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,180
and continue to cooperate with me

401
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,900
to investigate the burglary.

402
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,540
Miss Chun。

403
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,100
You're so insightful.

404
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,780
Just stay here.

405
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,740
Lord Kang will allow it.

406
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,780
This is the first time

407
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,820
that I have encountered

408
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,570
such a great difficulty.

409
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,180
If His Majesty knows,

410
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,460
he will

411
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,580
praise you

412
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,260
for helping him

413
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,610
share burdens for me,

414
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,420
a veteran of the two dynasties.

415
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:54,980
How shameless!

416
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,380
How dare he threaten me in court?

417
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,380
What's that sound?

418
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:31,120
[Fair and honest]

419
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,220
Now people outside know that

420
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,140
a female litigator is in Youzhou

421
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,460
to punish the evil and praise the good

422
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,660
for the people.

423
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,300
What?

424
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,220
Are you going to give up

425
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,890
when you're involved?

426
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,500
If you want me to stay,

427
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,940
I have nothing else to say.

428
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,500
But you have to tell me

429
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,180
what's in the secret vault.

430
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,900
Did the thief do it

431
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,770
for fame or for profit?

432
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:47,020
Only by knowing the purpose

433
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,060
can I tell his background.

434
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,020
Only by knowing his background

435
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:50,180
can I narrow the scope.

436
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,380
But no matter what,

437
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,660
it has nothing to do with Shan Yi.

438
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,170
It's useless to keep Shan Yi.

439
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,460
Just let me stay.

440
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,140
That makes sense.

441
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,020
Then, Chun Tumi stays.

442
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,420
I'll tell His Majesty the truth.

443
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,660
Chun Tumi,

444
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,100
you should report the case

445
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,860
to the capital in detail

446
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,740
so that His Majesty can rest assured.

447
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,260
How is your grandfather doing

448
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,020
in Bianzhou recently?

449
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,620
Why don't you bring him over?

450
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,300
When your family is reunited,

451
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,900
you can work in peace

452
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,540
with me.

453
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,420
Thank you, my lord.

454
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,540
Grandfather is very healthy at home.

455
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,780
The Chun family is quite famous

456
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,380
in the army in Bianzhou.

457
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,500
But

458
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,100
if the Chun family moved away,

459
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,900
I'm afraid the neighbors won't forget it.

460
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:38,740
Forget?

461
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,620
What does it matter if they forget it or not?

462
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,140
We are from a small family.

463
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,220
Of course it doesn't matter.

464
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,540
Bianzhou will be fine

465
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,380
without our family.

466
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,500
Youzhou won't be any different,

467
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,540
if we moved here.

468
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:50,980
But

469
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,500
Commander Luo made Bianzhou

470
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,500
lose a household of government soldiers.

471
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,500
Is there something hidden?

472
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,700
What the people is concerned about

473
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,860
is not the missing Chun family,

474
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,660
but

475
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,410
Commander Luo who made the Chun family disappear.

476
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,060
Lord Luo,

477
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,740
we are here

478
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,780
to investigate wrong convictions.

479
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,500
We won't interfere in

480
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,819
other things.

481
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:12,329
I invited Chun Tumi

482
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,020
to check the files.

483
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,859
As for catching thieves,

484
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:17,540
it is not her specialty.

485
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,300
What if I

486
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,700
insist on keeping them?

487
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,260
Shan Yi and I

488
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,260
are willing to do anything.

489
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,339
How about you, Lord Luo?

490
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,460
Shan Yi is filial and kind.

491
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,340
He's firm and upright.

492
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,500
As for me,

493
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,420
I just don't want to let

494
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,300
punishing evil and promoting good

495
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,660
become empty talk.

496
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,460
You must be

497
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,780
very impatient and angry.

498
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,060
You must think

499
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:38,820
I'm seeking death.

500
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,260
How dare I go against you?

501
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:41,940
But

502
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:42,780
if I

503
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,900
can't even save

504
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,620
such a kind person.

505
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,380
How can I

506
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,540
talk about law and morality?

507
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,100
My mother's wish is to punish vice and reward virtue.

508
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,060
I didn't understand

509
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:54,980
what she meant.

510
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,420
After this case,

511
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,860
I finally understand.

512
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:00,100
It simply meant

513
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,340
protecting good people

514
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,770
so that more people

515
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,220
dare to do good deeds.

516
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,140
Shan Yi is extremely filial.

517
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,500
He didn't violate the law.

518
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,500
You can't find the result on him.

519
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,220
So please show mercy.

520
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,220
Actually,

521
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,820
this case has already been closed.

522
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,180
However,

523
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,060
Lord Kang is meticulous.

524
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:20,540
He found something strange about the case,

525
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,660
so it was reinvestigated.

526
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,740
Since Shan Yi reversed his confession,

527
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,700
let's follow the law.

528
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:31,980
Thank you, Lord Luo.

529
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,450
Commander Luo,

530
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,820
for the sake of Shan Yi's filial piety,

531
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:35,700
please punish those guards

532
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,810
who neglected their duty

533
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,820
and help Shan Yi find his grandfather's body.

534
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,100
Okay.

535
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,340
Then

536
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,260
arrest all the guards

537
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,620
guarding the coffin that night.

538
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:48,900
Punish...

539
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,380
Punish them by military law.

540
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,260
Yes.

541
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,260
Youzhou's case

542
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,060
is best tried by

543
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,660
us Youzhou people.

544
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:00,900
Lord Kang.

545
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,860
You should hit the road as soon as possible.

546
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,460
I won't see you off.

547
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,180
Okay.

548
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:09,900
I hereby

549
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,140
acquit Shan Yi

550
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,330
and return his property.

551
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:13,980
Thank you, my lord.

552
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:22,760
[Fair and honest]

553
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,420
Thank you, my lord.

554
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:22,900
Get up.

555
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,980
I'm just a commoner.

556
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,020
That's all I can do for you.

557
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,180
When you find the body,

558
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,300
bury him well.

559
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:28,860
For the sake of safety,

560
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:29,660
I advise you

561
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,820
leave Youzhou as soon as possible.

562
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:31,980
Miss Chun.

563
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,740
I thought I would die here.

564
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,490
I didn't expect...

565
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:37,780
Please accept my bow.

566
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,500
Don't. Please get up.

567
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,300
Tumi,

568
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,300
you did a good job this time.

569
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,380
It's all thanks to

570
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,700
Lord Kang and Lord Han.

571
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,300
If you had no evidence,

572
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,660
we wouldn't be able to protect you.

573
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:50,980
Thank you, my lord.

574
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,180
Where is Lord Han?

575
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,340
Can I see it?

576
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:09,940
Who are you?

577
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:11,980
Are you crazy?

578
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,820
What are you doing?

579
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,780
What are you doing?

580
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,220
Where was I?

581
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,300
I forgot.

582
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,780
Forget it. Count again.

583
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,780
You're getting better.

584
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,220
You haven't recovered.

585
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,980
How dare you fight with

586
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,620
Han Wuwei downtown?

587
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,580
You're badly injured.

588
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,540
Why didn't you contact the Pavilion

589
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,980
and take some medicine first?

590
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,460
What?

591
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,940
You want me to serve you?

592
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,450
I'll get some water

593
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,900
for you to take the medicine.

594
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:39,940
I found the young master.

595
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,300
Where is him?

596
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:10,940
Don't move.

597
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,410
I'm exhausted.

598
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:15,900
Ye.

599
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,290
I thought you left.

600
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,500
How dare you

601
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,020
Luo Li?

602
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,100
Weren't you afraid?

603
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,060
Yes.

604
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,300
I didn't want to implicate my grandfather and father.

605
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,780
But thinking that you're here,

606
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,860
I was not afraid anymore.

607
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,220
All I thought about was

608
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,380
what you said.

609
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,700
Then I realized

610
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,340
my persistence is worth it.

611
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,300
I promised you

612
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,100
if you win,

613
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,540
I'll do one thing for you.

614
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,220
Tell me now.

615
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,380
Can you celebrate Double-Seventh Day (Chinese valentine's day) with me?

616
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,340
Sure.

617
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,980
See you then.

618
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,100
See you.

619
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,780
Are you blind?

620
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,380
I'm sorry.

621
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,740
The people of Youzhou are really kind and good-natured.

622
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,490
Thank you.

623
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,620
Miss.

624
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,460
What would you like?

625
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,580
Have you had enough fun?

626
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,490
Juzi just started to have expectations of you,

627
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,940
but you let him down.

628
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:23,980
Juzi intended to come in person.

629
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,340
Father...

630
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,420
I stopped him.

631
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:30,980
Do you know

632
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,540
the reason

633
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,620
why I came first?

634
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,380
The ink stone in Youzhou is fake too.

635
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,540
Juzi already knew.

636
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,980
He didn't trust you at first

637
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,380
and entrusted the mission to others.

638
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:49,860
In order to let you

639
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:50,620
take this mission,

640
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,140
do you know

641
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,140
how many words it took?

642
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,780
I won't fail.

643
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,500
Go back.

644
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,980
Your wound needs to be bandaged again.

645
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,260
Which quack

646
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,700
treated your wound?

647
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,620
So clumsy.

648
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,810
After learning for so long,

649
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,100
I still can't dress it.

650
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,620
It won't hurt anymore.

651
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,140
It's not well dressed,

652
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:36,220
but

653
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,860
I didn't feel any pain.

654
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,020
You've never been afraid of pain.

655
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,140
It should be dressed

656
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,540
like I did.

657
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,690
It's better this way.

658
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,340
You are good at medicine.

659
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,540
Do you know

660
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:57,900
how this medicine was made?

661
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:58,860
I have never studied

662
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,060
the antidotes in the pavilion.

663
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,660
I usually

664
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,740
study

665
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,660
how to crack poison.

666
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,660
But now we have the antidote.

667
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,980
Why are you still studying it?

668
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,140
I don't think it's right.

669
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,530
Your injury got worse.

670
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,180
Did you hurt yourself

671
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,380
in your previous rampage?

672
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:20,740
No.

673
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,340
Go back to the pavilion when you have time.

674
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,380
I think this medicine is strange.

675
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,380
I had clearly

676
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,100
curbed the mania.

677
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,450
But I still can't use my power.

678
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,380
Besides...

679
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,580
What?

680
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,620
If I didn't take the medicine,

681
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,300
after I get through it,

682
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,500
I can clearly feel

683
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,740
a lot of differences.

684
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:47,890
What differences?

685
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,260
Just tell me.

686
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,300
I'm so worried.

687
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,860
I can hear my heartbeat.

688
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,340
There's always

689
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,660
a warm feeling in my organs.

690
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,970
I almost caught him.

691
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,980
You were so close last time too.

692
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,260
Since you know

693
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,460
he's following us for the ink stone,

694
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,100
then you...

695
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,140
I'm sure

696
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,180
that person

697
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,170
came for Tumi.

698
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,340
Think about it.

699
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,340
If not,

700
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,660
why would he show up

701
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:14,900
near the court at that time?

702
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:15,740
Zheng.

703
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,890
Don't you think it's strange?

704
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,780
What do you want to do?

705
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,180
Are you going to investigate Chun Tumi

706
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,220
or use Chun Tumi

707
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,340
to lure him out?

708
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,380
Am I that despicable

709
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,460
in your heart?

710
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,820
Every time you face this person,

711
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,860
you lose your cool.

712
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:28,940
This is the reason

713
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,020
you keep losing to him.

714
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,490
Miss.

715
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,780
Where have you been?

716
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,260
I'm really afraid that

717
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,300
people from the Governor's Office will put a sack over your head.

718
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,020
We've only been in Youzhou for a short time.

719
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,380
You even know about the sack?

720
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,740
Lord Han taught me that.

721
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,380
Lord Kang.

722
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:54,700
Lord Kang.

723
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:55,620
At ease.

724
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,580
Lord Kang, what's the matter?

725
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,020
Have a good rest today

726
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,540
and start packing tomorrow.

727
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,940
Let's get ready to go.

728
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:03,780
Okay.

729
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,460
Although you offended Luo Li today,

730
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,460
you work for the imperial court.

731
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,100
Don't be afraid.

732
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,580
I'm not afraid.

733
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,220
I work for the people.

734
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,180
I'm just afraid...

735
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,380
I'm not afraid.

736
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,740
I'm not afraid either.

737
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:17,580
Don't worry.

738
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:18,820
I have a plan.

739
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,660
Luo Li has a high position.

740
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:21,860
It was not easy for us

741
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,140
to escape unscathed.

742
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,700
I'm just a little worried about Shan Yi.

743
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,580
What's your plan, Lord Kang?

744
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,380
I'll write a couplet myself

745
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:30,740
to praise his filial piety.

746
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,260
As long as my brush and ink are here,

747
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,700
even if Luo Li wants to do something,

748
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:34,850
he wouldn't dare to act too fast.

749
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,100
After Shan Yi

750
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,140
bury his grandfather,

751
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,420
I'll send a decree

752
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,620
to summon him to practice medicine in Chang'an.

753
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,260
I thank Lord Kang on behalf of Shan Yi.

754
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,570
Why are you so polite with me?

755
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,780
I'm just working

756
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,660
for the people.

757
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:52,020
[Double-Seventh Needle Threading Contest]

758
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,780
Come on.

759
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,660
Listen up, ladies.

760
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,820
Our store is holding a Needle Threading Contest

761
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,220
on Double-Seventh Festival.

762
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,140
The first prize is a brocade handkerchief.

763
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,900
For anyone who participates,

764
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,540
no matter if you success or fail,

765
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,380
our shop

766
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,980
have a small gift for you.

767
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,620
Welcome.

768
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,860
Take your love to compete.

769
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:14,860
Those who want to participate

770
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,700
come in and register.

771
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:17,860
How much for one?

772
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,180
Ten pence.

773
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,500
I want to register.

774
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,740
Waiter.

775
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,940
Bring the girl in.

776
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:23,620
Okay.

777
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,420
Please.

778
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,980
Lord Han! Lord Han!

779
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:27,940
Zheng.

780
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,780
How did the packing go?

781
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:35,820
I've sealed

782
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,980
work supplies.

783
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,420
I've returned the files of Youzhou

784
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,620
to the local government.

785
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:41,860
After confirmation

786
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:42,860
and the signing of a few documents,

787
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:43,860
we can leave.

788
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,220
Just pack up

789
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:45,940
work supplies.

790
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,060
Don't pack up

791
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:47,770
what you need daily.

792
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:48,660
We won't leave until the day after tomorrow.

793
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,380
How's your packing going?

794
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,660
There's nothing to pack up.

795
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,100
Before we leave, just ask Han Feng

796
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,660
to throw them all in the carriage.

797
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,420
Then the dark guard you put on my side

798
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,740
should also be removed.

799
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,220
Don't worry about that.

800
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,980
I'll make arrangements.

801
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,540
We have our own specialty.

802
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,300
If you don't have anything else,

803
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,660
I'll go check on Tumi.

804
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:09,580
Wait.

805
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,300
I'm going out too.

806
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,860
Where are you going?

807
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,020
We're on patrol.

808
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,660
We have expense quotas.

809
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:18,820
This time, Luo Li

810
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,300
hosted us in his residence.

811
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,780
The original intention is to save us from

812
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,020
the inconvenience of staying at the post.

813
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,220
If all goes well, there is nothing to worry about.

814
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,020
But now,

815
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,530
I have to clear

816
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,780
the finances with him.

817
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,540
Let me do it.

818
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,500
Leave it to me.

819
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,100
As a patrol officer,

820
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,580
stay away from money as far as possible.

821
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,380
If something really happens in the future,

822
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,060
it's not good to pin it on you.

823
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,180
Then will it be

824
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,620
pinned on you?

825
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,260
I'm good at martial arts.

826
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,130
I will dodge if they pin it on me.

827
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,380
Unlike you,

828
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,180
who will stand there

829
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,820
and reason with them.

830
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,300
Let's go.

831
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,180
Lord Han.

832
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,580
Lord Luo

833
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,300
appreciated your kindness.

834
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:01,660
In that case,

835
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,620
please clear them

836
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,140
one by one

837
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,380
and pay the money.

838
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,220
Tell me the total amount.

839
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,300
Consider the extra amount

840
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,420
a gift, okay?

841
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,140
How can I do that?

842
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,860
Lord Luo said

843
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,260
Youzhou has always been rich.

844
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,500
We can't take advantage of

845
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,140
Lord Han.

846
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,620
Rich？

847
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,340
On my way here,

848
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,180
we only met thieves in Youzhou.

849
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:28,860
Who knows

850
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,420
who stole

851
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,780
Lord Luo's secret vault?

852
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,300
I mean

853
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,340
I met a thief on the street.

854
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,340
The thief stole my wallet.

855
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,020
I was thinking

856
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,220
the Youzhou people are so poor.

857
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,540
I'll consider it a gift to him.

858
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,060
That's why I didn't ask people to find it.

859
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,260
Come here.

860
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,580
What exactly was stolen

861
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,420
in your secret vault?

862
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,900
You went through so much trouble, but didn't find it.

863
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,140
If you really can't find it,

864
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,300
you can be like me.

865
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,620
Take it easy.

866
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,860
Just think of it as

867
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,340
spend what's taken from people on people.

868
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,900
Yes, Lord Han.

869
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,770
There are many accounts.

870
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,940
Please take care of your eyes.

871
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:12,940
Guards!

872
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,860
Bring a candlestick to Lord Han.

873
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,740
He's still working on the accounts.

874
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,500
Don't be afraid.

875
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:12,980
It's me.

876
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,140
Cold needle.

877
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:40,940
Miss.

878
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,540
I brought the quilt you want to change.

879
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,260
Miss.

880
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,420
Miss.

881
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,060
You're awake.

882
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,690
Ye.

883
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:14,260
Watch out!

884
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,060
You are poisoned.

885
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,780
I'll take you out to detoxify.

886
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,219
I'll send you back later.

887
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,300
When will you stop

888
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,060
looking at each other?

889
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,580
Have you had enough?

890
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:51,860
Turn around.

891
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:58,940
He...

892
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,900
He can cure the poison from the cold needle.

893
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,060
That's ridiculous.

894
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,740
You exposed

895
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,140
our hideout to her.

896
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,540
Her father is a soldier.

897
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,660
People around her are either rich or powerful.

898
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,500
If she knows

899
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,210
our identities...

900
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,300
She won't.

901
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,060
All these years, you went through so much

902
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,140
and finally made it this far.

903
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,860
If we fail...

904
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,060
This is my business.

905
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,460
It has nothing to do with her.

906
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:00,900
In Bianzhou,

907
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,850
she treated me well.

908
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,170
I don't want to think of her

909
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,300
with the heart of a villain.

910
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,460
But you have to know

911
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,300
people like us,

912
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,380
the farther away we are from her, the better for her.

913
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:13,380
If anything happens in the future,

914
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,250
she won't be implicated.

915
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,700
Think about it.

916
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,540
Why was she poisoned by the cold poison?

917
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,900
And why would anyone want to kill her?

918
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,500
After we leave Youzhou,

919
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,700
I'll focus on my mission.

920
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,340
Ye.

921
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,580
Did I cause you trouble?

922
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,380
You saved me.

923
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,140
I owe you three lives.

924
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,500
Three lives?

925
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,180
But I only saved you once.

926
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:03,370
You just need to remember

927
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:04,940
I will save you three times

928
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,180
to pay you back.

929
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,260
How did you know someone wanted to kill me?

930
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,180
I happened to pass by the post

931
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,060
and saw a man in black sneaking in,

932
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,340
so I followed him.

933
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,660
What do you want to do

934
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,460
to celebrate the Double-Seventh Day tomorrow?

935
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,940
On the Double-Seventh Day,

936
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,140
people usually go to the fair and watch the stars.

937
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,370
I usually spend Double-Seventh Day

938
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,210
with my family.

939
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,100
Wait.

940
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,860
You just brought me out

941
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,260
without telling my father?

942
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,860
My father would be so worried.

943
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,220
Luckily, you came to find me.

944
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,420
Otherwise, I would still

945
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,180
be there checking the accounts.

946
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,420
His Majesty ordered us

947
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,140
to leave Youzhou as soon as possible

948
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,260
and stop tangling

949
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,100
with these people.

950
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:53,900
Okay.

951
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:55,580
Have you taken care of

952
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,460
the patrol regulations?

953
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,420
Don't leave any grip

954
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,620
to that person.

955
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,500
Don't worry.

956
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,340
There is one last section left before I wrap up.

957
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:02,980
Thank you.

958
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,340
Your Highness.

959
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,300
Something happened.

960
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:07,980
Hurry up.

961
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,620
Ye.

962
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,580
Don't worry.

963
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,100
I won't tell anyone

964
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:21,900
you saved me.

965
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,180
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

966
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,340
I'm leaving.

967
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:27,540
Be careful.
