4
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,620
My lord.

5
00:01:57,539 --> 00:01:58,940
The sheep ate the food in the basin

6
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,300
and rolled all over the floor in a moment.

7
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,860
The sheep soon died.

8
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,260
How did the sheep die? How did the sheep die?

9
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,620
Miss Chun.

10
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,139
What's going on?

11
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:08,979
My lord.

12
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,780
I went to Zhao Laoqi's house.

13
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,380
And I found something strange.

14
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,380
There's an empty beehive

15
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,620
under the eaves of his house.

16
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,300
In the corner, there're cut flowers and plants.

17
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,420
I asked the florist.

18
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,380
The place was once a field of redbud.

19
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,579
Redbud, fish soup and rice

20
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:22,980
are incompatible.

21
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,980
When mixed together,

22
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,370
they're highly toxic.

23
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:32,900
Zhao Wanruo,

24
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,540
what do you have to say?

25
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,660
Say what?

26
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,380
It was just that Zhao Laoqi's family

27
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,340
once had redbud.

28
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,060
Maybe

29
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:40,820
Madam Fang secretly observed

30
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,220
and saw Zhao Laoqi's redbud

31
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,740
and decided to poison him.

32
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,740
Since there is no concrete evidence,

33
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,900
let's not drag our feet any longer.

34
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,180
You are kind

35
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,700
and a good wife.

36
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,300
But Zhao Laoqi not only abused you,

37
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,700
but also your parents.

38
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,460
We all feel sorry for you.

39
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,380
Madam Fang is innocent.

40
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,540
She's a woman.

41
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,980
She worked hard to earn money

42
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,820
and shouldered the burden of Linshui Pavilion.

43
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,940
All the workers depend on her

44
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,500
to make a living.

45
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,620
Zhao Qianqi was mean to you.

46
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,100
But what did Madam Fang do?

47
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,140
You let her die for nothing,

48
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,460
taking the fall for you.

49
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,700
What's the difference

50
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,180
between you and Zhao Laoqi?

51
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,780
My lord.

52
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,220
I plead guilty.

53
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,579
It was Zhao Laoqi who tried to frame

54
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,180
Linshui Pavilion's Madam Fang first.

55
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,060
And it was me.

56
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,579
I poisoned my husband

57
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,140
with the poison of redbud.

58
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:39,820
My lord.

59
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,420
The victim was induced by Chun Tumi.

60
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:41,980
She... She...

61
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,500
The last few days of my trial,

62
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,740
I've been able to live a human life.

63
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,740
I'm content.

64
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,900
Instead of being panic all day

65
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,420
and bringing others into trouble,

66
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,900
I'd rather admit it.

67
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,940
Since you have pleaded guilty,

68
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,020
I can pass sentence directly.

69
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,060
But everything has to end.

70
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,180
You have to tell me

71
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:06,460
how and why this happened.

72
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,020
This... This...

73
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,340
Is this a human thing?

74
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,019
I have

75
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:19,420
wounds all over my body.

76
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,060
But that's not the worst of it.

77
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,380
I was gonna take him to court.

78
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,100
But Zhao Laoqi was always domineering.

79
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,060
No litigator

80
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,740
would take my case.

81
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,010
When he found out I went around,

82
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,820
he was even worse.

83
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,420
Not only did he beat and scold me,

84
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,420
he also drugged me

85
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:41,780
and made me

86
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:45,500
wait on his cronies.

87
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,260
At first, I had no choice but to accept my fate.

88
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,290
I didn't see myself as a person.

89
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,620
I was just a handy object.

90
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,700
I did

91
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,900
whatever he wanted me to do.

92
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,140
The other day

93
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,860
he told me that he had hit on a way

94
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,660
to blackmail Linshui Pavilion.

95
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,460
Don't forget.

96
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,100
As soon as I hit the floor,

97
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,780
you will be the victim

98
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,140
in court with me.

99
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,460
Otherwise,

100
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,340
Madam Fang is too sophisticated

101
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,500
to be fooled.

102
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,660
I added redbud to the rice

103
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,420
when he wasn't looking.

104
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,260
I'll just do it.

105
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,780
What's the point

106
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,820
of living like this?

107
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,780
My parents saved his life.

108
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,780
But he beat and swore at us

109
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,690
and refused to give us food.

110
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,940
My father had a fight with him.

111
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,140
He pushed my father to the ground.

112
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,980
My father's head hit the stone steps,

113
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,060
bleeding.

114
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,220
From that day on,

115
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,900
he got sicked

116
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,140
and just died.

117
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,580
My mother was angry and resentful.

118
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,860
She didn't dare to say anything for me

119
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,620
and sulked herself to death.

120
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,050
My uncle

121
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,220
had his hand cut off

122
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,820
and he still has no recourse

123
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,300
No litigator took my case.

124
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,500
County Magistrate Zhang was notoriously confused.

125
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,540
Yamen? I had no place to complain.

126
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,140
My lord.

127
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,420
I plead guilty.

128
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,650
Guards, stop her!

129
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,700
Get her medical attention first.

130
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,300
Yes.

131
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,220
The court is adjourned.

132
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,300
Yes.

133
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,220
Lord Yuan.

134
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,780
Zhao Wanruo may have a grievance,

135
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,580
but that's not

136
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,820
why she killed someone.

137
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,580
My Lord.

138
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,580
Are you going to plead for her?

139
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,460
I think

140
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,580
there're doubts about this case.

141
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,820
What doubts?

142
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:38,300
Redbud is very common in this town.

143
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,060
I grew up in this town,

144
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,780
but I've never heard of

145
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,220
this redbud being toxic.

146
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,690
So your question is...

147
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,860
If Zhao Wanruo had known about

148
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,620
this undetected method,

149
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,100
she would have done it long ago.

150
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,300
Your grace is wise.

151
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,620
So I think

152
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,460
there must be someone

153
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,980
behind Zhao Wanruo.

154
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,540
What do you think about this person?

155
00:07:57,659 --> 00:07:59,380
They should be here soon.

156
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,580
Here comes Lord Han.

157
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,460
I brought him here.

158
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,980
Am I here at the right time?

159
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,060
Lord Han.

160
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,460
The woman you brought with you is...

161
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,180
I had eyes on

162
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,250
Zhao Laoqi's house.

163
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:25,860
This woman was sneaking around,

164
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,980
trying to get away.

165
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,540
I detained her

166
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,460
and brought her here.

167
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,820
As for the rest,

168
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,620
let's just hear what Chun Tumi asks.

169
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:42,500
My lord.

170
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,300
The first criminal

171
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,260
of the case of Linshui Pavilion

172
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,980
is Zhang Wuniang.

173
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,700
You're lying! What evidence do you have?

174
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,020
Zhao Wanruo already confessed.

175
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,460
You still want to deny it?

176
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,860
She has cheated again.

177
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,660
Zhao Wanruo is a loser.

178
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,060
She's more of a loser than a success.

179
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,620
It serves her right that

180
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,020
Zhao Laoqi doesn't treat her like a human being.

181
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,100
It serves her right to let her parents die.

182
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,860
Why is Zhang Wuniang like this?

183
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,300
How could she talk like that?

184
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:17,820
She's gone too far.

185
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:18,660
Quiet.

186
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,700
Miss Chun.

187
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,420
What's going on?

188
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,620
My lords.

189
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,340
Zhang Wuniang framed for no reason.

190
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,810
After my father's case was closed,

191
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,420
she left Bianzhou the next day.

192
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,820
Of course, someone paid for her

193
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,300
and put her somewhere.

194
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,660
In order to save himself,

195
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,900
that man refused to show his face.

196
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,860
So she had to go out alone.

197
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,340
Unfortunately, she met Zhao Laoqi.

198
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:39,700
Zhao Laoqi was

199
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,900
a bastard.

200
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,700
He wanted to kidnap you

201
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,140
and schemed against you.

202
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,700
Of course you're not like Zhao Wanruo.

203
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,660
There're many ways to protect yourself.

204
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,100
Not only did you protect yourself,

205
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,860
but also colluded with Zhao Laoqi.

206
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,780
You knew he had a thing for Madam Fang.

207
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,940
So you're deliberately trying to get back at

208
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,860
Madam Fang you've hated for so long.

209
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,260
You have neither Madam Fang's looks

210
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,980
nor Zhao Wanruo's meekness.

211
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,980
Surely Zhao Laoqi wouldn't

212
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,060
bite you

213
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,260
as he bit them.

214
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,580
Of course he'd be happy

215
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,570
to make a fortune

216
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,700
out of your plan.

217
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,580
A fly does not bite cracked eggs.

218
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,140
Madam Fang relied on her appearance,

219
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,420
flirting around.

220
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,980
She's got all the men

221
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,260
hoping for her,

222
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,970
[Clean, cautious and diligent]

223
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,220
circling her.

224
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,700
It serves her right that Zhao Laoqi sexually harassed her.

225
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,980
Unfortunately.

226
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,580
Why didn't she get poisoned?

227
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,220
I did give Zhao Laoqi some advice.

228
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,780
What?

229
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,700
Can't I talk?

230
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,340
You're unrepentant.

231
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,300
You used Zhao Wanruo

232
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,820
to kill two birds with onestone.

233
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,020
This trick framed Madam Fang

234
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,380
and poisoned Zhao Laoqi.

235
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,540
Do you think

236
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,060
the lord can't do anything to you if you don't do it?

237
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,620
How did you know?

238
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,500
Do you have evidence?

239
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,380
No.

240
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,740
I just knew

241
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,460
they lived in Zhao Qianxi's house.

242
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,140
Everything else

243
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,420
is just my own extrapolation.

244
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,940
Who knew this woman confessed to herself?

245
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,180
You!

246
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:58,140
Zhang Wuniang.

247
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,100
You can't make a scene in court.

248
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,980
Zhang Wuniang had a chance to leave,

249
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,940
but she chose to stay.

250
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,980
I think

251
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,100
we should ask Officer Fu.

252
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,940
Bring Fu Gui up to me.

253
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,460
It's him. It's him.

254
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,060
You mean him?

255
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:22,820
Yes.

256
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,580
It's time to straighten out

257
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,220
the Bianzhou barracks.

258
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,180
Officer Fu.

259
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,500
May I ask

260
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,780
what's your relationship with Zhang Wuniang?

261
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,300
Do you know about this case?

262
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,780
Fu Gui.

263
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,220
Do you have anything to say?

264
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,100
Lord Han.

265
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,660
It's my fault.

266
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,300
Please punish me, Lord Han.

267
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,500
Officer Fu only worships Lord Han,

268
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,340
not Lord Yuan,

269
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,300
which means you had an affair with Zhang Wuniang,

270
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,780
but had nothing to do with this case?

271
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,060
Yes.

272
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,100
Okay.

273
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:56,940
In that case,

274
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,620
Zhang Wuniang's guilt is conclusive,

275
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,450
and she should be executed according to the law.

276
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,740
Zhang Wuniang, do you know

277
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,460
why I want to get to the bottom of this case?

278
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,900
Because you framed my father.

279
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,100
This is how children treat their parents.

280
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,340
As for parents treating their children,

281
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,020
I'm afraid the degree will be deeper.

282
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,660
If anything happened to me,

283
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,730
my father would risk his life to save me.

284
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,620
So what do you do with your kids?

285
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,900
Zhao Laoqi deserved to die.

286
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,340
But no one

287
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,260
can do anything outside the law.

288
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,220
That's what the law is for.

289
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,980
You are the principal perpetrator of this crime. You should be executed according to the law.

290
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:43,780
Although

291
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,100
you could be executed a month after giving birth,

292
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,420
have you ever thought about your child?

293
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,500
Can you count on

294
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,220
that man?

295
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,020
If you will tell me

296
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,340
what happened in this case,

297
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,460
I will promise

298
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,460
to find a good family for your child.

299
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:05,260
At least let him grow up safely.

300
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,020
And if you have a confession,

301
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,500
the penalty can be reduced,

302
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,100
from beheading to hanging,

303
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,300
leaving the body intact.

304
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,340
And when it happens,

305
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,540
you don't have to go to the execution field,

306
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,740
and there's no crowd watching.

307
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,980
At least save the kid some face.

308
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,700
Is that true?

309
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,860
There are no false words in court.

310
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,260
All the people in the room

311
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,380
witnessed it.

312
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,020
Think about it. Is this man

313
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,300
really worth it?

314
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,300
He used you against my father.

315
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,580
When you're no longer useful,

316
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,660
he'll kick you out.

317
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,620
And you still want to

318
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,250
have children for him?

319
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,620
Officer Fu was good at scheming.

320
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,940
Unfortunately,

321
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,740
if you had treated her well,

322
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,500
she wouldn't have been kidnapped by Zhao Laoqi

323
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,500
and wouldn't have been found by us.

324
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,660
Nonsense.

325
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,500
Yes.

326
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,980
She's slandering me.

327
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,700
My lord.

328
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,580
It has nothing

329
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,380
to do with me.

330
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:06,820
This bitch!

331
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,740
This bitch!

332
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:08,780
She did the whole thing all by herself, my lord!

333
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,860
She has nothing to do

334
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,140
with me!

335
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,940
My lord!

336
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,060
-My lord, please look into it! -Silence.

337
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,640
[Clean, cautious and diligent]

338
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,180
Please look into it, my lord!

339
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,700
Don't rant in court.

340
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,450
My lord!

341
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,860
I framed Chun Dashan

342
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,220
on Fu Gui's orders.

343
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,820
I took one wrong step,

344
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,060
then another,

345
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,220
and finally committed the unpardonable sin.

346
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,220
I would tell you everything.

347
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,380
All I ask is that my lord have mercy

348
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,660
and save my child.

349
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,460
Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!

350
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,660
I'm gonna kill you!

351
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,460
Bring him down!

352
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,060
Don't

353
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,140
let him embarrass us here.

354
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,100
I'll kill you!

355
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,450
My lord, Zhang Wuniang is pregnant.

356
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,820
Please give her a seat.

357
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,260
Grant.

358
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,300
Fu Gui was jealous of Chun Dashan's talent

359
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,140
and was afraid of losing his job.

360
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,740
He was jealous of Chun Dashan's close relationship

361
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,020
with Madam Fang.

362
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,540
So,

363
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,500
he sacrificed my reputation

364
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,820
and framed Chun Dashan.

365
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,300
If

366
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,820
I lose my job,

367
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:19,500
it's gonna be tough

368
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,020
for you and the baby.

369
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,460
Wuniang,

370
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,210
why don't you help me?

371
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,890
I agreed.

372
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,940
But I found out later that

373
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,340
he was thinking about

374
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,300
another woman.

375
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,740
You dyed your nails again?

376
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,260
I've told you many times that

377
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,860
the mixture of

378
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:39,460
redbud, fish soup and rice

379
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,620
is highly toxic.

380
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,860
You spend all day in the kitchen.

381
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,820
Why do you need

382
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:43,900
all this fancy stuff?

383
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,780
Look at Madam Fang.

384
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,460
She's clean. How nice.

385
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,460
All this

386
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,380
is because of Madam Fang.

387
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,620
If Fu Gui

388
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,300
wasn't obsessed with her,

389
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,780
how did I end up here?

390
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,780
The only chance I had

391
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,820
was to frame her and put her in jail

392
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:04,980
so that

393
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,460
Fu Gui could stop thinking about her

394
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,780
and focus on what's best for me

395
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,540
and our child.

396
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,700
So...

397
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,580
So I cajoled Zhao Laoqi

398
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,740
to blackmail Linshui Pavilion.

399
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,020
Zhao Wanruo

400
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,300
was working for me, too.

401
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,780
All the blame

402
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,740
falls on me.

403
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,420
My lord.

404
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,300
I know I'm guilty

405
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,660
and unforgivable.

406
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,810
All I ask is for your lordship

407
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,940
to let me have my baby

408
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,220
and die in peace.

409
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,340
Anyone

410
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,580
who kills for any reason

411
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,980
should be punished according to the law.

412
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,060
Guards.

413
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,140
Bring the criminals,

414
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,250
Zhao Wanruo and Fang Fei, to court.

415
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,020
I...

416
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,780
Now pass sentence...

417
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,900
Wait, my lord.

418
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,660
What's the matter with you?

419
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,220
Before you read the verdict,

420
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,339
I'd like to speak for the two killers,

421
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,660
Zhang Wuniang

422
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,060
and Zhao Wanruo.

423
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,810
What else is there to say?

424
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,140
-The verdict is in. -Yes.

425
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,540
They've already confessed.

426
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,260
What else is there to say?

427
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,500
Is there anything in the law that says

428
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,020
I can't do that?

429
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,420
No.

430
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,060
Since it's in accordance with the law,

431
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,330
just say it.

432
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,860
Although Zhang Wuniang committed the murder,

433
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,260
she turned herself in

434
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,940
and revealed who was behind it.

435
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,020
According to the law, her punishment should be reduced, from beheading to hanging.

436
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,060
And she plotted to murder Zhao Laoqi,

437
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,260
in the case of

438
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,660
loss of personal liberty,

439
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,180
which can be counted as half coercion.

440
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:52,780
So it's discretionary.

441
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,540
There was a similar case before.

442
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,500
The prisoner was commuted to three thousand miles of exile.

443
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,340
Zhao Wanruo should be hanged

444
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,500
for murdering her husband according to the law.

445
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,100
But she did it

446
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,900
to avenge her parents.

447
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,580
It is stipulated in the law of our court that

448
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,620
the ten evils of conspiracy, insurgency, rebellion,

449
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,940
treason, immorality, inharmony,

450
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,140
disobedience, disloyalty, impiety

451
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:13,980
and civil unrest

452
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,540
are the first of all evils.

453
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,460
Although Zhao Laoqi died,

454
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,700
his crime cannot be counted out.

455
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,300
The punishment of the killer related to ten evils

456
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:22,940
should be reduced.

457
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,220
So Zhao Wanruo's crime

458
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,580
should be reduced by third class penalty

459
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:28,780
or even fourth class.

460
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:30,780
May I ask

461
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,460
your lordship what you think?

462
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,980
There are such provisions

463
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:35,460
and there is no mistaking

464
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,620
the punishment.

465
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,060
Okay.

466
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,140
I hereby declare.

467
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,100
The criminal Zhang Wuniang

468
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,660
was instigated

469
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,900
to frame Chun Dashan in the first

470
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,900
and then murdered Zhao Laoqi.

471
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,940
She was punished for the first crime

472
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,420
and the second crime she committed should be executed according to the law.

473
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,220
But due to her confession,

474
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,820
her sentence was reduced to hanging.

475
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,020
And because she was first threatened,

476
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,220
her punishment was reduced to

477
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,300
3,000 miles of exile.

478
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,300
No return without amnesty.

479
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:18,000
[Clean, cautious and diligent]

480
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,930
The criminal Zhao Wanruo

481
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,300
was instigated

482
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,140
to murder her husband Zhao Laoqi.

483
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,780
But because Zhao Laoqi was a blight on the village,

484
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,100
it makes sense.

485
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,060
The sentence was commuted to three years' imprisonment.

486
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,100
The criminal Fang Fei's crime

487
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,820
is completely false.

488
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,020
She will be released in court.

489
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:27,780
But because of

490
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,260
her poor management of the restaurant,

491
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,460
she was used by others.

492
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,980
She was made to pay for

493
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,060
medicine and health care for the affected diners.

494
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,860
If you are not satisfied

495
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,780
with the above sentence,

496
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,740
you can request a review within ten days.

497
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,380
Court adjourned.

498
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,380
Good!

499
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,490
Good job, Miss Chun!

500
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,100
Please get up, Madam Fang.

501
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,380
Tumi, thank you.

502
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,340
Thank you for your kindness.

503
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,900
Please accept our salutation.

504
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,300
Please get up.

505
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,780
Miss Chun.

506
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:00,420
Miss Chun.

507
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:01,220
Chun Tumi.

508
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,460
Chun Tumi.

509
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,380
Chun Tumi!

510
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,140
You're awake.

511
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,100
Grandfather.

512
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,100
My Lady, you're awake.

513
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,700
Where is my father?

514
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,300
Your father was here

515
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,420
with you all night.

516
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,220
Now,

517
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,860
he's making chicken soup for you.

518
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,620
Guo, tell him

519
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,900
Tumi is awake.

520
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,700
Yes.

521
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,860
Grandfather, what's wrong with me?

522
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,740
Your father told me

523
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,420
you fainted in court yesterday.

524
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,180
You scared him.

525
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,380
Then he asked a doctor to see you.

526
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,540
He said it wasn't fainting.

527
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:51,940
It's because

528
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,900
you finished your errands

529
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:57,660
and you relaxed and went straight to sleep.

530
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,660
I fell asleep in the courtroom?

531
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,290
Wasn't that disrespecting the court?

532
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,460
Don't worry.

533
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:04,780
The county magistrate

534
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,580
only praised you.

535
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,860
We all know it's not easy for you.

536
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,220
Your father

537
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,500
has told me everything about you

538
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,220
these days.

539
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,050
Our Tumi

540
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,940
is really good right now.

541
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,740
Thanks to the cases

542
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,420
my grandfather told me about as a child.

543
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,380
I've been listening to it since I was a kid.

544
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,780
Isn't that cool?

545
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,340
This is ten years of sharpening a sword,

546
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,580
very overwhelming.

547
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,700
You...

548
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,380
I thought you've improved

549
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,740
in every aspect.

550
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,330
But your literature is still so poor.

551
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,100
Then grandfather, don't go on business trips.

552
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,860
Help me study poetry at home.

553
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,580
We are military.

554
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,180
Your father serves in the army.

555
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,820
I have to work in the government office.

556
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,540
When I have the chance

557
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,300
to get out of the army,

558
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,580
I'll have more time to spend with you

559
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,660
and I won't let you

560
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,020
suffer at home alone.

561
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,340
You... What are you doing?

562
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,660
Let me see.

563
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,780
Let me see if grandfather's wish

564
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,140
can come true.

565
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:13,820
God said

566
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,780
grandfather's wish would come true.

567
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,220
You...

568
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:24,820
Don't always drink

569
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,260
in the yard in the middle of the day.

570
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,580
This is the government office.

571
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,300
Behave yourself.

572
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,220
Zheng.

573
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,780
You're too straightforward.

574
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:33,940
On our way here,

575
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,100
your mother specifically told me

576
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,820
to have more fun with you along the way,

577
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,460
so that

578
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,820
you can smile a little.

579
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:40,500
When you go back,

580
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,260
you should ask your chef

581
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,940
to prepare a few dishes for me.

582
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,300
If people in the Duzhong are worried,

583
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,140
they're just playboys.

584
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,180
We're here for business.

585
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,020
You still have time

586
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,220
to tell my mother about these?

587
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,330
Zheng.

588
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,700
How can you be so heartless?

589
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:57,860
Who

590
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,700
your mother and I are worrying about?

591
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,340
It's all for you.

592
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,780
Your mother asked you to write a letter every three days.

593
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,820
Did you write it?

594
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,660
Of course I did.

595
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,180
That's right.

596
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,900
Someone was worried about you going out.

597
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,820
Someone would take care of you.

598
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,380
She wants to take care of everything

599
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,930
for you.

600
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,460
This must be the intention of a mother.

601
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,980
Let's get down to business.

602
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,940
I just received a secret edict.

603
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,300
In three days,

604
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,260
you and I will go to Youzhou.

605
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,220
I haven't finished

606
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,100
the files here.

607
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:37,940
Are you here

608
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,780
to patrol the prison?

609
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:39,620
Didn't I give

610
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,740
the inkstone to you?

611
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,060
It's fake.

612
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,660
Fake?

613
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,540
I only have three days left.

614
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:51,980
What are you doing?

615
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,740
Take Chun Tumi away.

616
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,540
Youzhou?

617
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,060
Grand Secretary said

618
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,220
another secret edict

619
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,140
was sent to Han Wuwei.

620
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,380
They asked us to keep an eye on him

621
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,060
and Kang Zhengyuan's prison patrol team.

622
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,340
Grand Secretary wants you to leave as soon as possible.

623
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:07,420
Okay.

624
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,780
Jinyi.

625
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,700
Get a car.

626
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,860
The landlady is going out.

627
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,980
It's done. I'm waiting.

628
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,780
Okay.

629
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:23,860
Why did Xiaoqin

630
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,860
dragged Master away again?

631
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:26,820
She has been

632
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,700
waiting for Master in our yard.

633
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,940
Are you angry about this?

634
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,460
Why does a lady

635
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,340
always

636
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,900
take over Master with you?

637
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,540
Harmony brings prosperity.

638
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,700
Just bear with it.

639
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,340
Let's do it for my father.

640
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,580
Do you think

641
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,860
if you endure it and everything will be okay?

642
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,660
My lady.

643
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:46,900
Madam Fang is here.

644
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,820
Master wants to see you.

645
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,020
Madam Fang?

646
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,300
What is she doing here?

647
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,140
It's been a long time

648
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,180
since I saw you last time.

649
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,860
Mr. Chun, how are you?

650
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,820
Not bad. Thank you.

651
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,820
Madam Fang, why are you here?

652
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,020
I'm here to see you.

653
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,020
Madam Fang is here.

654
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,700
Sister-in-law of the Chun family.

655
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,300
Prepare some tea.

656
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,580
Guo.

657
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,300
Didn't you hear what Master said?

658
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,740
Go soon.

659
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,020
Master, I'll go make tea first.

660
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,060
Okay.

661
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,580
Long time no see.

662
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,180
Is it Linshui Pavilion again?

663
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,420
I'm here today

664
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,540
to talk about some business

665
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,690
with Mr. Chun.

666
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,540
Could you please excuse us?

667
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,060
In that case,

668
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,900
Tumi, your father wants to talk business.

669
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,500
Don't stay here.

670
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,860
Miss Tumi.

671
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,700
Stay and listen.

672
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,540
First, I want to thank her

673
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,220
for helping me get out of jail.

674
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,100
Second, Linshui Pavilion

675
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,820
is the business of my sister-in-law.

676
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,420
The business

677
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,940
is related to her.

678
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,140
Okay.

679
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,460
In that case,

680
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,820
let's get down to business.

681
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,340
Madam, please go back to your room

682
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,580
and wait for me.

683
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:15,980
Here.

684
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,220
Please come in.

685
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,740
What happened?

686
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,340
Did someone go to Linshui Pavilion to make trouble?

687
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:26,820
Mr. Chun.

688
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,460
Linshui Pavilion is fine.

689
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,180
I'm here today

690
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,300
to say goodbye with you.

691
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,260
Why

692
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,380
are you leaving so suddenly?

693
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,780
Tell me the truth.

694
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,460
What happened

695
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,500
to you

696
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,060
that you didn't want to do business?

697
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,940
I'm fine.

698
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,260
Don't worry. Everything is fine.

699
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,780
My case that Tumi helped me

700
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,020
was such a hit.

701
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,780
I'm afraid not only Bianzhou,

702
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:58,260
but also Duzhong, even the south

703
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,620
is gonna talk about my case.

704
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,260
It's my honour

705
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,580
to make friends with Mr. Chun

706
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,900
in Bianzhou.

707
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,740
I've

708
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,020
had a

709
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,820
good time of it.

710
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,020
Let me tell you the truth.

711
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:17,820
Actually,

712
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,420
I have a secret background.

713
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,100
I can't get everyone involved.

714
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,820
So I have to go.

715
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,260
Fine.

716
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,340
If you have any difficulties,

717
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,660
come back to us anytime.

718
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,860
Here, I'll get some money.

719
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,020
Mr. Chun.

720
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,420
No need.

721
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,460
I appreciate your kindness.

722
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,540
Tumi.

723
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,420
This is for you.

724
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,060
Thank you for helping me win the lawsuit.

725
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,020
Thank you.

726
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,420
Please stay.

727
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,100
Don't worry about me.

728
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,660
That's all.

729
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,460
Farewell.

730
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,130
Actually

731
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,300
my name is not Fang Fei.

732
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,060
Linshui Pavilion used to be so popular,

733
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,060
but now it's empty.

734
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,500
In this world, parting

735
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,940
is inevitable.

736
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,380
But it may not be a bad thing.

737
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:08,100
Just like when you get married,

738
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,660
you will leave your home.

739
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:11,220
But this is a happy event.

740
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,900
I didn't say I'm getting married.

741
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,660
You're saying this

742
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,620
because you haven't

743
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,860
met the right person.

744
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,780
That's what the stories say.

745
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,140
The ladies said

746
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,260
they would never get married.

747
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,220
But when they meet a good man,

748
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,940
they will go through fire and water for their beloved.

749
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,060
Or...

750
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,460
They couldn't understand

751
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,620
the true heart of a man in the first place.

752
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:30,860
Later they realize

753
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,140
the value of people around them.

754
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,580
I think

755
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,220
you should be the latter.

756
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,620
Lord Han is the value

757
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,460
that you didn't notice.

758
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,060
If you keep talking nonsense,

759
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:40,980
I'll take out your stories

760
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,300
and burn them.

761
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:46,120
[Tong Yun House]

762
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,740
My lady!

763
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,140
I just think

764
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,620
Lord Han is quite nice.

765
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,620
He's young and handsome. And he's from a noble family.

766
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,500
That's not lovers.

767
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,340
If you really love someone,

768
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,570
you can go through fire and water,

769
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,140
let alone family background.

770
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:57,700
Little girl.

771
00:29:57,910 --> 00:29:59,300
Who are you in love with?

772
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,380
Lord Han.

773
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,940
Come with me. I need to talk to you.

774
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,020
Look, my mouth works.

775
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,180
Whoever I mention will come.

776
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,540
Lord Han,

777
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,580
there is no case today.

778
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,820
I can't go with you.

779
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,340
And men and women are different.

780
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,690
In public,

781
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,420
please forgive me that I can't talk to you.

782
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,860
My lady!

783
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,500
My lady!

784
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,980
I think Lord Han is quite nice.

785
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,340
What do you know?

786
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:25,940
Lord Kang.

787
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:26,900
Miss Chun.

788
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,180
I wanted to visit you at your house.

789
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,580
I didn't expect

790
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,620
I met you here.

791
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:32,700
What's the matter, Lord Kang?

792
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,620
Miss Chun,

793
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,460
can we have a chat?

794
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,420
What happened today?

795
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,140
Are you all here to talk to her ladyship?

796
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,580
What's the matter, Lord Kang?

797
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,260
I saw you had insight into the law

798
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,860
in the court.

799
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,380
So I want to talk to you.

800
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,460
In that case,

801
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,900
-I... -Even if I let her follow you,

802
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,020
I proposed this.

803
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,500
I have to do it.

804
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,060
Zheng, don't try to take credit.

805
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,700
My lady!

806
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,100
Lord Kang!

807
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,180
How could Lord Han

808
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,660
kidnap her ladyship in public?

809
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:04,620
Don't worry.

810
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,580
Go home and wait.

811
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,980
I will definitely bring your ladyship

812
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,580
back home safely.

813
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,060
This... This...

814
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,220
Lord Kang!

815
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,620
Lord Han!

816
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,740
It is illegal

817
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,020
to forcibly rob a woman in the street.

818
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,460
I will never rob you.

819
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,460
Are you feeling better?

820
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:34,820
Did your family

821
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:35,700
make you some dishes

822
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,020
to replenish your energy?

823
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,740
With your small body,

824
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,020
how can you handle big cases

825
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,460
in the Grand Court?

826
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,500
I'm fine.

827
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,540
Don't worry about me.

828
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,420
Little girl,

829
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,300
do you know

830
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,660
what I was thinking

831
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,820
when you got angry in court?

832
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,460
I just wanted to wake Zhang Wuniang up.

833
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,460
I didn't yelled at the court.

834
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,340
If you want to take it seriously...

835
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,220
You got angry

836
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,700
because she did something wrong.

837
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,500
You got angry

838
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,820
because she's a poor person

839
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:11,860
and bullied Zhao Wanruo

840
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,020
who's worse than her.

841
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,660
I understand you.

842
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,380
I thought

843
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,540
why Chun Tumi was so naive.

844
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,900
A lawsuit need to

845
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,140
face so many bad guys.

846
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,780
You're so ignorant.

847
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,820
I can't believe you get angry over a trivial matter.

848
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,820
No, I...

849
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,980
I must protect you.

850
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:34,660
I can't let

851
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,260
a kind girl like you

852
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:38,820
be bullied by others.

853
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,060
This...

854
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,220
Lord Han

855
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,780
asked you to bring them to Tumi?

856
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,420
Yes.

857
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,940
There's one more thing.

858
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,540
Lord Han asked me to inform you in advance

859
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,740
to get ready.

860
00:32:59,380 --> 00:32:59,940
What is it?

861
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,980
I want you

862
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,660
to go on patrol with us.

863
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,820
I...

864
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,300
Patrol?

865
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,340
Thank you, Lord Han.

866
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,540
As the saying goes,

867
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,810
if parents are alive, don't travel far.

868
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,140
I'm sorry

869
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,100
for the patrol.

870
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,940
Don't reject me so soon.

871
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,340
Listen to me first.

872
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,420
What's the benefit of patrolling with us?

873
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,020
I...

874
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,020
I haven't finished yet.

875
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,060
Can you give us

876
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:36,860
some time

877
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:38,380
to spend together？

878
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,420
Lord Kang.

879
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,620
What brings you

880
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,020
to see me?

881
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,740
What are you doing?

882
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,300
Lord Han, what are you doing?

883
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,340
You...

884
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,050
And Lord Kang...

885
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,580
Why do you have two faces?

886
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,980
Lord Han,

887
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,460
please behave yourself.

888
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,100
Why are you following me?

889
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,420
Since you want to follow me,

890
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,380
I can't just sit here.

891
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:10,900
Fine.

892
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,540
Just this once.

893
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,219
What are you talking about?

894
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,340
Under His Majesty's order,

895
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,500
I, on behalf of the emperor,

896
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,739
will be in charge of Youzhou.

897
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,699
We'll head north from now on.

898
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,820
Do you want to go to the prison with me?

899
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:26,260
Lord Kang.

900
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,610
This is a serious matter.

901
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,500
I don't know much about the world.

902
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:32,620
Why are you taking me there?

903
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,540
Miss Chun,

904
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,060
you underestimate yourself.

905
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,780
Your understanding of the law

906
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,210
is unique and accurate.

907
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,580
Your judgment and actions

908
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,060
are unique, too.

909
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,100
Although His Majesty

910
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,659
has always governed the country with virtue,

911
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,730
and he cares a lot

912
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,900
about the prison,

913
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,100
there are

914
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,659
still injustice.

915
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,020
This is also the main purpose

916
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:50,900
for this job.

917
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,300
And you...

918
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,739
Even though you are a girl,

919
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,060
I believe

920
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:56,020
you can help me

921
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,300
make a lot of judgements.

922
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,580
And I have a lot of work to do.

923
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:00,700
I need someone

924
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,660
reliable

925
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,540
to help me look into

926
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,860
every file,

927
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,900
sorting out false cases.

928
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,300
But I'm a girl.

929
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,580
A criminal officer

930
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,260
is either confused or clear.

931
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:12,140
It directly concerns

932
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,730
the lives and death of the people.

933
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,180
And it is more important to the law and justice.

934
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,540
This has nothing to do with men and women.

935
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,180
It's only about the law.

936
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,740
Since you have a great understanding

937
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,860
of the law,

938
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,580
don't belittle yourself.

939
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,700
I'm not belittling myself.

940
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,660
I'm not married yet.

941
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,580
Even if I can wear men's clothes,

942
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,380
my father and grandfather won't agree.

943
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,860
Since you're sincerely inviting me,

944
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,940
I believe Lord Han

945
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:33,620
will consider this

946
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,900
for you.

947
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,940
As the Commandant of Zhechong,

948
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,940
I sent your father to follow Lord Kang

949
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,340
to protect him along the way.

950
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,580
Naturally, it's

951
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,060
very suitable.

952
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:43,940
Do you think

953
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,500
there are less soldiers with me

954
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,820
to worry about my safety?

955
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,340
After all, you'll offend many people

956
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,580
for investigating wrongful convictions.

957
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,180
Chun Dashan is serious in training.

958
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,780
And he's quite famous in the team.

959
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:54,940
I will make him

960
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,620
the leader.

961
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,940
In this way,

962
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,140
you can

963
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,060
use the excuse of visiting your relatives

964
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,380
to come with us.

965
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,900
It seems unreasonable, but quite reasonable.

966
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,420
As long as you stay away from Bianzhou,

967
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,500
I'll say you're my servant

968
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,460
who served brush and ink.

969
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,540
The soldiers

970
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,740
won't say anything.

971
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,660
You don't need to worry

972
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,140
unnecessary trouble.

973
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,940
What do you think?

974
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:20,660
Your Excellencies.

975
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,810
Since we've come to this point,

976
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,300
if I refuse again,

977
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,580
it seems that I don't know good or evil

978
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,700
and being ungrateful.

979
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:26,820
But

980
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,180
if I agree to this trip,

981
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:29,980
shouldn't there be

982
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,140
my own discipline?

983
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,220
Just tell me.

984
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,420
I have plenty of jewelry.

985
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,780
If you want anything,

986
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,660
I won't ask for anything

987
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,140
or ask for anything else.

988
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,820
But,

989
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,660
could you please

990
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,980
help my family get out of the military status

991
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:44,780
and become a good citizen?

992
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,460
This can be my discipline.

993
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,580
It's inappropriate.

994
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,220
But you

995
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,140
makes sense.

996
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,420
Why are you laughing?

997
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,780
I'm laughing.

998
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,860
it's a deal.

999
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:01,860
Father.

1000
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:03,820
Lord Han has gone too far this time.

1001
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,340
If you think the gift is not suitable,

1002
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,620
you can send it back.

1003
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,860
But the patrol is your mission

1004
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,220
and my mission.

1005
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,580
Your mission?

1006
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,860
I had no choice

1007
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,260
for the last two times.

1008
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,900
The appeal has damaged your reputation.

1009
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,420
You still want to go on patrol?

1010
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,530
After all, I got you into trouble.

1011
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,900
If I hadn't caused trouble,

1012
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,260
you wouldn't have... Father.

1013
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,700
Not only for

1014
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,260
your appreciation,

1015
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:31,380
I have my own plans.

1016
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:34,220
I want to help our family get out of the military registration.

1017
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:36,740
What are you talking about?

1018
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,380
They promised me today.

1019
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,220
If we work hard

1020
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,100
and make achievements,

1021
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,340
they will plead for us

1022
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,490
and leave the military.

1023
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,300
Father,

1024
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,740
aren't you happy?

1025
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,060
Is this grandfather's wish

1026
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,060
for a long time?

1027
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:51,860
Enough.

1028
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,140
No matter how incompetent I am,

1029
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,220
I wouldn't have to rely on my daughter

1030
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,980
and use her happiness and reputation

1031
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,300
to leave military.
