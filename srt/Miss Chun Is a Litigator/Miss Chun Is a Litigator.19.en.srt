we're ready.

We can't fail again tonight.

I also tried to persuade Juzi.

8
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:12,060
After all, Ayili

9
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,820
is his daughter.

10
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,180
But he has made up his mind.

11
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,690
But Young Master...

12
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,780
Young Master is young.

13
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,250
He is unlike Juzi who cares about the big picture.

14
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,300
We are loyal to

Juzi.

It is not Mowu Pavilion that

wants to kill Ayili.

18

It's Han Wuwei

who wants to kill Ayili.

20
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,020
Are you scared?

21
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,220
Of course not.

22
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,700
Don't worry.

23
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,820

Is he the person you've been meaning to look for?

Yes.

00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,980
I just want to see him soon.

how the criminals feel in court.

Why do you say that, Lord Han?

85

I was always on your side in court

before.

about what happened to you tonight.

100
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,540
You helped Ayili,

101
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,260
recalled the troops in time,

102
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:35,580
and found a place

103
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,140
to let them chat.

104
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:38,900
You meant well.

105
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:40,860
Why do you describe yourself

106
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,740
as a villain?

107
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:43,900
Your friend has saved you many times.

108
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,420
He's loyal.

109

I wanted to catch him.

110
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,540
He also saved me.

111
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,659
If he didn't do anything

112
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,260
and let the assassins of Mowu Pavilion and I

kill each other,

114

with his ability,

115
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,860
he could easily save his sister.

116
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,660
But he saved me

117
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,500
and put himself in trouble.

118
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,180
Such a good friend

119
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,140
treats me as his enemy.

120
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,580
What?

121
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,460
In your heart,

am I not a villain?

123
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,700
You are also my friend.

124

Besides,

125
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,580
Yaksha has never said that

126

he treated you as his enemy.

127
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,220
He just

128
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,340
had no choice.

129
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:26,940
Lord Han,

130
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,380

Do you believe

132
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,500
he's not a vicious man?

133
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,140
Will you help me?

134
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,260
That depends on what you want me to do.

135
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,980
I want you to tell me

136
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,100
all about Mowu Pavilion

137
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,300

What do you want to do?

139
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,620
Do what I'm good at.

140
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,500
There are many powers

141

in the martial arts world now.

142

Mowu Pavilion

143

is the leading one.

144
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,700
It has always been well-organized,

145
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:10,940
and it has many disciples.

146
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,490
In terms of its actions,

147
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,060
it's hard to tell whether it's good or evil.

148
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,660
It's hard to tell whether it's good or evil?

149
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:16,780
Yes.

150
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,940
They rob the rich and help the poor.

151
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,690
They kill robbers.

152
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,420
They also rob money and kill people.

153
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,460
They protect corrupt officials and profiteers.

154

155
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:28,620
I know you want to prove that

156
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,700
Yaksha is innocent,

157
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,650
but Mowu Pavilion has been targeted by the court

158
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,380
because they advance by committing armed offenses

159
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,419
They have adopted orphans for so many years,

160
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,380
trained orphans into killers,

161
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,820
colluded with corrupt officials

162
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,340
and colluded with bandits.

163
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,820
It can be considered as

164
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,180
a rebellion.

165
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,020
Adopt orphans?

166
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,460
It's more like

167
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,740
searching.

168
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,420
Among these children,

169
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,700
many have

170
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:56,940
family and parents.

Ayili and Yaksha

173

admitted that they are

174
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,860
Juzi's children.

175
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,940
Not to mention Ayili,

176
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,020
as the top assassin in the Pavilion,

177
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,140
Yaksha can't be found innocent.

178
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,220
What if he did as he was told?

179
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,340
Has he committed

180
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,060
any major crimes himself?

181
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,100
No.

182
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,420
The crimes Yaksha has committed

183
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,660
are all related to

184
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,460
Mowu Pavilion.

185
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,700
In other words,

186
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,900
if I can prove that

187
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,140
he wasn't willing to do so,

188
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,300
I probably can reverse the verdict.

189
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,180
Reverse the verdict?

190
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,020
As the future leader

191
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,380
of Mowu Pavilion,

192
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:32,940
no matter what difficulties he has,

193
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:34,900
with his identity,

194
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,820
it's impossible for him to reverse the verdict.

195
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,180
If when the court punishes Mowu Pavilion severely,

196
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,700
he is willing to contribute,

197
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,100
he can reduce his sentence

198
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,460
if he works for the court.

199
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,180
He's skilled.

200
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,220
He can contribute to the people

201
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:50,380
and make amends in the future.

202
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,540
What do you think, Lord Han?

203
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,740
After all, Mowu Pavilion is

204
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,290
where he grew up.

205
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,460
Is he really willing to

206
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,620
serve the court?

207
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,220
I heard that the person who killed his father

208
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,420
is from Mowu Pavilion.

209
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,220
Now he can escape from the darkness,

210
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,060
and give his sister a stable life.

211
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,050
Why would he refuse?

212
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:15,620
Lord Han,

213
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,820
I'll ask him

214
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,020
after Yaksha talks with Ayili.

215
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,300
Now,

216
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,140
you have to tell me

217
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:23,980
what you know.

218
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:25,940
Brother.

219
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,300
Grand Secretary looks kind,

220
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,540
but in fact, he is treacherous.

221
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,180
He has been giving orders

222
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,100
in the name of our father.

223
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,420
I came out this time

224
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,580
to tell you

225
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,140
not to be used by him again.

226
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,540
But when I came out,

227
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,700
I forgot to take the key with me.

228
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:40,980
Grand Secretary must have seen it

229
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,340
so he wanted to kill me.

230
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:46,820
Brother,

231
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,420
if you go now, you're going to die.

232
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,780
Then I will also kill him.

233
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,580
I have an idea

234
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,020
to kill Grand Secretary.

235
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:01,940
Han Wuwei,

236
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:02,900
does what you said before

237
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,740
still count?

238
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,380
What I said

239
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,020
always counts.

240
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:07,980
Fine.

241
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,700
You said you'd help me destroy Mowu Pavilion.

242
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,860
Then I will tell you that

243
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,300
only one person can help you.

244
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:13,620
That's my brother.

245
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:14,820
Your brother?

246
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:19,620
Let's go!

247
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,060
Stop!

248
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,220
Yaksha, what do you want?

249
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,580
I'm going to find the Grand Secretary.

250
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:29,940
Brother, don't be like this.

251
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:31,300
I've convinced Lord Han.

252
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:31,900
If you join hands,

253
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,780
you will definitely kill Grand Secretary

254
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,700
and avenge our father.

255
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:35,020
I don't need others' help

256
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,020
to take revenge.

257
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,340
Get your men out of my way,

258
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,940
or I'll kill you.

259
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:40,740
Even if you kill me,

260
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,340
you can't avenge your father.

261
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:48,220
Ye,

262
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,620
if you kill Grand Secretary now,

263
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,100
is it really taking revenge?

264
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,100
Have you ever thought that

265
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:53,900
if Grand Secretary is dead,

266
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,300
you will be responsible for

267
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,500
all the crimes of Mowu Pavilion?

268
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,140
Even if you don't care about

269
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,100
your reputation,

270
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,500
can you bear to see your father

271
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,660
and Ayili be framed?

272
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,900
They are both innocent.

273
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,780
The most important thing now

274
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,500
is to catch Grand Secretary and make him plead guilty.

275
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,940
As you can see,

276
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,980
Lord Han helped Ayili.

277
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,060
He's not your enemy.

278
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:15,620
Calm down.

279
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,820
We'll discuss it later.

280
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,020
If you two work together,

281
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,620
you can definitely eliminate Mowu Pavilion.

282
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,940
This is the real revenge.

283
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,180
When I eliminate Mowu Pavilion

284
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,620
and arrest the major criminals this time,

285
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,780
I won't hurt the innocent.

286
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,700
If it is proven that

287
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,660
Grand Secretary deceived the assassins,

288
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,540
the court will give you a chance

289
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,180
to make amends.

290
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,180
I have a brother

291
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,460
who grew up with me together.

292
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,220
He had no parents,

293
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,540
so he was adopted by Mowu Pavilion.

294
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,500
If as you said,

295
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:51,820
the case of missing babies

296
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,060
is related to Mowu Pavilion...

297
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,300
He will have a chance

298
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,580
to find his parents

299
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,580
and reunite with them.

300
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:02,820
Then listen to my arrangement.

301
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:06,980
You ambush here.

302
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Wait for my signal

303
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,740
and then take action.

304
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,580
Grand Secretary.

305
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,820
Young Master has sent news.

306
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,420
Tomorrow noon, at the stronghold outside the city,

307
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,420
he wants to see you.

308
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,780
You're back.

309
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,220
I have seen Li.

310
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,940
How is Ayili?

311
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,740
You haven't killed her yet.

312
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:11,860
Young Master,

313
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,140
I was just following orders.

314
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,420
I had no choice.

315
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,410
If you blame me,

316
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,100
just kill me.

317
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,180
When did my father die?

318
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,580
Who said Juzi died?

319
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,180
Li heard it with her own ears.

320
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,380
Young Master,

321
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,260
calm down and think about it.

322
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,980
Ayili has never been out.

323
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,300
She has never experienced anything.

324
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,860
She must have been deceived

325
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,780
by Han Wuwei.

326
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,220
Do you know

327
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,620
Han Wuwei's real identity?

328
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,180
The emperor has no children.

329
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,260
Among the royal family,

330
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,610
he wants Han Wuwei to inherit the throne.

331
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,860
Mowu Pavilion

332
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,660
is related to the palace.

333
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:02,740
Mowu Pavilion has been

334
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,500
feared all the time.

335
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,420
Now,

336
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,980
the emperor is going to pave the way

337
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:08,740
for Han Wuwei.

338
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,180
But you,

339
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,300
Juzi's children,

340
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,300
don't believe Juzi.

341
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,100
You trust your enemies sowing discord.

342
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,260
Young Master,

343
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,700
I have

344
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,460
a letter from Juzi.

345
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,220
My father is dead.

346
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,940
How can he write a letter?

347
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,180
Listen up, White Ghosts.

348
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,580
Yaksha has betrayed Juzi

349
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,100
and tries to assassinate me to cover up his crime.

350
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,500
Arrest him.

351
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:25,860
Why do you

352
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,180
kill my father

353
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,460
for your own personal desire?

354
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,420
Personal desire?

355
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,900
In this world,

356
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,180
who doesn't have personal desires?

357
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,260
Don't you have any?

358
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,380
Do you think Juzi was clean?

359
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,860
Mowu Pavilion

360
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,260
was his personal desire

361
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,220
because he wanted to rebel.

362
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,940
Your father

363
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,580
has always been

364
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,140
a selfish person.

365
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,740
He only values

366
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,780
the supreme power.

367
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,660
You,

368
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,060
I,

369
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,500
and Ayili

370
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:04,660
are just pawns

371
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,900
that he could use.

372
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,780
He was not that kind of person.

373
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,380
You're still

374
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:13,380
lying to yourself.

375
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,380
You deserve to be manipulated.

376
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:18,980
Did the drug take effect?

377
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:22,060
Is it very painful?

378
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,339
You can't control myself, right?

379
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,860
I forgot to tell you that

380
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,740
this medicine

381
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,540
was also made

382
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,900
by your father who you miss all the time.

383
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,180
Now,

384
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,820
just accept your fate.

385
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,740
Jinyi...

386
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,340
You traitor.

387
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,580
I underestimated you.

388
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,690
Stay back!

389
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:19,980
Stop!

390
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,380
Break your own veins.

391
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:26,820
Otherwise,

392
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,340
I'll kill him immediately.

393
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,610
Hurry up!

394
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:36,970
I...

395
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,660
Even if I lose all my martial arts,

396
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,580
I'll kill you

397
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,100
wherever you go.

398
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,100
Jinyi.

399
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,580
Jinyi.

400
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:14,900
Jinyi!

401
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,180
Jinyi!

402
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:27,860
Jinyi!

403
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,500
Jinyi!

404
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:37,780
Jinyi...

405
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,700
Why didn't you send a signal?

406
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,690
Didn't we agree last night?

407
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,740
I will take you home.

408
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,580
My lord,

409
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,210
Mowu Pavilion has been checked.

410
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,020
But we don't know what to do with

411
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:15,860
the corpse we've found

412
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,980
in the secret room.

413
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:18,860
Where is Ayili?

414
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,700
Ms. Chun is on her way here

415
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,020
with Ayili.

416
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,140
Brother.

417
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:41,900
Father...

418
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,340
[The mountain is not here.]

419
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:42,740
[Auspicious Light and Blessed Land]

420
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:49,620
Brother.

421
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:50,380
Brother.

422
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,710
[Auspicious Light and Blessed Land]

423
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:50,900
Ye.

424
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:53,940
Ye.

425
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,620
Brother's poison can't be suppressed.

426
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,090
Ye.

427
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,300
This happened before.

428
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,660
He can get through it.

429
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,340
Give me some time.

430
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,780
I can make it this time.

431
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,180
This drug

432
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:16,780
distracts people,

433
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,740
and it gets more and more

434
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,460
terrible every time it attacks.

435
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,300
Trust him.

436
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,540
He can make it.

437
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,060
Don't worry.

438
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,340
Care makes you confused.

439
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,140
Let's go.

440
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,940
Ye.

441
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,340
Ye.

442
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,380
Ye.

443
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,700
Ye,

444
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:48,820
I'm here.

445
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,300
I'm here.

446
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,700
Ye. Ye.

447
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:58,780
Ye.

448
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,570
You must feel awful.

449
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,260
Do you think that

450
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,420
you've been living in a lie since you were a child?

451
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,500
You think everything

452
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,860
is torturing you.

453
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,100
You think your fate is unfair

454
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,260
to you.

455
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,140
Listen.

456
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,060
You don't have to live like this anymore.

457
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,420
I’ll teach you how to live like Chun Tumi.

458
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,980
Chun Tumi doesn't

459
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,340
care about

460
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,540
people who she doesn't love.

461
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:37,980
She only spends her energy

462
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,100
on the person she likes.

463
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,620
If the world is against me,

464
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,820
I have to live.

465
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,820
Listen to me, Ye.

466
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,780
My way of living may be hard.

467
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,740
Probably

468
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,820
I can't keep the person I like.

469
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,700
But there are benefits too.

470
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,420
The benefits

471
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,820
are

472
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,020
when I fall in love with someone,

473
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,900
I will be very brave.

474
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,580
Even if everyone objects,

475
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,580
and no one understands me,

476
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,100
I will stay by his side

477
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,020
unswervingly,

478
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,940
just like now.

479
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,700
So you must wake up.

480
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,340
Ye,

481
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,620
you must wake up.

482
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,260
I want to be with you forever

483
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,700
and always love you.

484
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,340
A lifetime is not enough.

485
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,460
I want to meet in my every life.

486
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,980
Chun Tumi will

487
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,100
will stay with Yaksha forever.

488
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,220
You don't have to worry anything,

489
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,500
or to flatter anyone.

490
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,780
I like you

491
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,300
only because you are you.

492
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:25,860
Ye!

493
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,380
Tumi...

494
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,140
I'm here,

495
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,380
Ye.

496
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:35,860
It's great

497
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,900
to have you.

498
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,060
Stop walking.

499
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,900
It makes me dizzy.

500
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,660
If my brother died,

501
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:09,940
I wouldn't live either.

502
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,860
He won't die.

503
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,220
Don't always

504
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,250
say this word.

505
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,100
You don't understand.

506
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,100
In this world,

507
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:22,540
he is my only family.

508
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,540
Trust me.

509
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,420
No one in this world

510
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,340
knows it better than me.

511
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,700
When you feel upset,

512
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,660
hold it tightly

513
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,220
and recite the Buddhists' names

514
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,260
All the Buddhists in the sky

515
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,220
will bless the person

516
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,340
in your heart.

517
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:19,970
See?

518
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,460
Am I right?

519
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:23,700
Brother.

520
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:27,900
Alright, everyone is watching.

521
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,140
Prime Minister of Supreme Court, Kang Zhengyuan, accept the decree.

522
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,060
Mowu Pavilion is involved in the court

523
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,500
and deceived me.

524
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,260
The people suffered a lot because of it over the years.

525
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,620
I order Kang Zhengyuan, Prime Minister of Supreme Court,

526
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,420
to take charge of the case of Mowu Pavilion

527
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,100
and reveal its crime to the world.

528
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,620
Punish it severely

529
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,020
as a warning to others.

530
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,940
Everyone, implement it.

531
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,820
I, Kang Zhengyuan, accept the decree.

532
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,620
Please go to the side hall

533
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,380
and take a rest.

534
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,220
Thank you, Lord Kang.

535
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,210
Lord Han.

536
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:29,980
Wuwei...

537
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,660
I know.

538
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,580
I've received a secret order

539
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,700
to assist you with the case of Mowu Pavilion.

540
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,620
Fine.

541
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,130
You've participated a lot.

542
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,100
With you around,

543
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,420
it'll be easier

544
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,340
to interrogate Yaksha.

545
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,740
What's difficult is

546
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,660
interrogating Grand Secretary

547
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,300
should be after His Majesty's heart.

548
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,260
Grand Secretary is sinister and cunning.

549
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,980
Have you ever thought

550
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,340
what if this is

551
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,140
his another trick?

552
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,300
At this time,

553
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,820
why should he lie to us?

554
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,500
He used the herbs

555
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,900
to preserve

556
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,820
our father's body well.

557
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,260
Did he predict

558
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,580
what would happen today?

559
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,260
Can Father still be alive?

560
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,580
The wounds that Father once suffered

561
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,540
were also the same.

562
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,700
If you

563
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:37,900
still have doubts,

564
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,540
please confirm it for us

565
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,180
when interrogating Grand Secretary.

566
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,180
Okay.

567
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:45,860
Let's go.

568
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,740
Do you have any other concerns?

569
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,580
I'm thinking about follow-ups.

570
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,580
Although Mowu Pavilion has been destroyed,

571
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,450
we have to investigate

572
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,500
what they have done

573
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,740
all these years,

574
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,140
There is much time

575
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,460
when we need them

576
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:00,100
to cooperate with the government.

577
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,140
He is free now.

578
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,460
He's no longer anyone's puppet.

579
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,940
He is supposed to cooperate more than anyone else.

580
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:25,940
Yaksha,

581
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,580
how are you going to arrange for

582
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,900
your father's funeral?

583
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,540
I wander around.

584
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:34,940
Of course,

585
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,900
he will be with me and Li.

586
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,540
Wandering around is

587
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,100
not a solution.

588
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,140
If you are willing,

589
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,980
I can send your father's ashes

590
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,380
to Liurong Temple

591
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,060
and hand it to Abbot Yuanxuan.

592
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,970
If he performs the ritual during the period,

593
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,020
all the crimes in the past will be eliminated,

594
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,650
and the deceased can be happy earlier.

595
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,340
Lord Han.

596
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,140
Please take care of

597
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,340
my father's ashes.

598
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,740
Ayili, let's go back first.

599
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,300
Let's go.

600
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,740
Grand Secretary will be interrogated.

601
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:41,940
He's cunning,

602
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,540
and he has run Mowu Pavilion for many years.

603
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,780
I'm afraid many people are loyal to him.

604
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,780
If the court doesn't have the testimony

605
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,660
you provided

606
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,140
as decisive evidence,

607
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,500
it will be hard to interrogate

608
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:52,900
Grand Secretary.

609
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,180
For many things,

610
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,780
now is just the beginning.

611
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,140
I'm afraid

612
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,180
you won't go away so easily.

613
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:05,940
I know.

614
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,500
I'm just worried about Li.

615
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,020
Li is a daughter,

616
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,260
and she knows nothing.

617
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,980
She won't get involved.

618
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,260
Don't worry.

619
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,900
If everything goes well,

620
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,220
I will record your testimony in person.

621
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,530
I won't give you a hard time.

622
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:27,780
Okay.

623
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,380
Han Wuwei,

624
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,580
why did you take my brother's sword?

625
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:44,780
If you dare to bully my brother,

626
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,100
I'll poison you to death.

627
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,020
Shut up!

628
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:52,780
I...

629
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,100
Tumi,

630
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,140
I will send more people

631
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:56,890
to protect you these days.

632
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,460
Take her.

633
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,900
Don't let her make trouble.

634
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:01,780
Lord Han,

635
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:02,900
do you need Yaksha

636
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,380
to go back to Mowu Pavilion with you to finish up?

637
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,540
I want to go with my brother.

638
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,580
No need.

639
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,260
I can't leave him alone.

640
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,139
You following him

641
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,739
is his biggest trouble.

642
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,940
I'm the trouble?

643
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:15,659
Han Wuwei,

644
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:16,260
did you have any conscience

645
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,179
when you said that?

646
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,340
If it hadn't been for me this time,

647
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,540
could you have gone so smoothly?

648
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:21,100
Now you dislike me?

649
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,139
Don't worry.

650
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,340
We'll pick you up

651
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,380
after we finish.

652
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:25,699
Go.

653
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:27,699
Pick me up?

654
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:28,780
What is picking me up?

655
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,090
Han Wuwei, what do you mean?

656
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,130
Am I trash?

657
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,659
Tumi will take good care of her.

658
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:44,980
Don't worry.

659
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:47,940
You go first.

660
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,060
I'll be right there.

661
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:56,980
I understand.

662
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,180
you're worried about your brother.

663
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,500
But since Lord Han

664
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,620
excluded you,

665
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,780
he must have his reasons.

666
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,220
What is his reason?

667
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,060
We finally meet.

668
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,060
What if something happens again?

669
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,140
There's no such thing.

670
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,260
They will just record testimony. It's not dangerous.

671
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,620
If you follow your brother,

672
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,780
he'll be worried about you.

673
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:13,980
Why don't you wait until he comes to you

674
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:14,820
after he records his testimony?

675
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,020
Okay.

676
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:17,860
I'll wait for him.

677
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,700
I won't let him worry.

678
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,340
Everything will be fine.

679
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,820
Amitabha.

680
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,380
Abbot.

681
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:43,980
Lord Han.

682
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,820
Abbot, why are you here?

683
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,460
Can you foresee and

684
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:48,980
know that I will come here?

685
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,060
I am waiting for an old friend.

686
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,380
An old friend?

687
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,290
Amitabha.

688
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:01,620
The long clouds look far away.

689
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,220
I suspect that it may be an old friend's smoke.

690
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:07,420
I miss him when seeing the view.

691
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:10,820
The sunset falls down the sky.

692
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:17,820
Amitabha.

693
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,930
Amitabha.

694
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,740
So the old friend you're waiting for

695
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,260
is Juzi of Mowu Pavilion.

696
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,980
I met him several times back then.

697
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,540
Although meeting each other is fate,

698
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,780
I treat him as my friend.

699
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,210
The last time we met,

700
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:40,980
I foretold his life.

701
00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:43,140
I learned that he was destined

702
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:45,220
to be unable to die naturally.

703
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,860
So when the news of Mowu Pavilion's collapse

704
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,020
was spread out,

705
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,060
I waited here.

706
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:53,860
Actually,

707
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,700
he passed away

708
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,580
a few years ago.

709
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,100
People living in the world are no different from mayflies.

710
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:04,900
It's the same whether it's a few years earlier or later.

711
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,980
I didn't believe in fortune-telling.

712
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,260
This time, you foresaw.

713
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,900
I have to believe that

714
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,660
in this world, there may be mysteries.

715
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,860
I'll leave Juzi to you.

716
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,020
See you.

717
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:34,980
Wait.

718
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,780
If you have any questions,

719
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,940
I can also foretell

720
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:47,220
what you want to ask.

721
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:49,740
No.

722
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,140
Compared to divination,

723
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,740
I believe in myself.
