[Episode 4]

4
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,259
My lord.

5
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,220
Come in.

6
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,380
What is it?

7
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,100
My lord,

8
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:02,860
Miss Chun

9
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,140
came to the government office early this morning.

10
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,460
and went to the lounge with money.

11
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,900
I heard from the guards at the gate that

12
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,580
she even went to the prison to see Madam Fang.

13
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,539
I didn't ask you to send any message.

14
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,020
Did Wuwei send you here?

15
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,540
My lord,

16
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:14,940
I can't tell you.

17
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,260
Then you can tell me

18
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,170
where Wuwei is, right?

19
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,850
His Highness is fishing in the backyard.

20
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:28,700
Lord Han,

21
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,020
what are you doing?

22
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,020
Linshui Pavilion was shut down.

23
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,180
If you want fish soup, you have to do it yourself.

24
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,260
Which one do you like?

25
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,220
Let's cook it tonight.

26
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,020
If you make soup

27
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,860
with Zhang Hongtu's treasures,

28
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,420
he will yell inordinately.

29
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,900
It doesn't matter.

30
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,980
Zhang Hongtu is careless and perfunctory.

31
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,180
He upset you.

32
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,050
I'll help you vent your anger.

33
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,730
Don't scare him

34
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,500
like yesterday.

35
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,860
He even didn't dare to take a breath.

36
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,940
His Majesty has always praised you for being calm and collected.

37
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,820
He said I was impatient.

38
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,420
When I go back to the capital,

39
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:03,780
I'll take you to court

40
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,060
with this.

41
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:06,860
No.

42
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,620
What did I do to offend you?

43
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,820
Chun Tumi is here.

44
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,420
Are you happy now?

45
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:16,980
What am I happy about?

46
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,579
You tried your best to hint at Madam Fang's disadvantages

47
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,380
in front of Chun Dashan.

48
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:21,340
You also put a lot of evidence

49
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,060
that can convict her of a felony

50
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,300
in the file.

51
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,900
Didn't you want her to get involved?

52
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,300
Didn't you arrange

53
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,340
some soldiers

54
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,460
to send her home and give her hints?

55
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,620
We are

56
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,610
as broad as it is long.

57
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,660
I just think

58
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:34,940
she is very cute

59
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:35,970
when thinking about things.

60
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,260
And letting her know that I'm helping her

61
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:37,940
at the right time

62
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,220
makes it easier for her to like me.

63
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,700
But you incited her to go to court.

64
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,620
Do you really want a girl

65
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,540
to be a litigator?

66
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,780
What about her reputation?

67
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,300
I, Kang Zhengyuan, want a maid I like

68
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,820
by my side.

69
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,020
There is nothing strange with it, right?

70
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,180
Are you crazy?

71
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,220
The more you beat iron, the harder it grows.

72
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,300
Whether I'm crazy or not

73
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,300
depends on

74
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,380
what she's capable of.

75
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,820
Have you really made up your mind?

76
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:00,700
Yes.

77
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:01,860
I also prepared an opponent

78
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,820
for her.

79
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,340
Who is it?

80
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,580
Scholar Sun.

81
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,140
Didn't you say that Scholar Sun broke his promise

82
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,980
with Chun Tumi on Chun Dashan's case?

83
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,500
So this girl

84
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,260
took the deposit back

85
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,540
nonchalantly.

86
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,180
She got beaten in the face,

87
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:16,820
she must be waiting for a chance to take revenge.

88
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,140
I'm leaving.

89
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,100
Where are you going?

90
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,860
Help Scholar Sun.

91
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,140
I don't want Chun Tumi

92
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,340
to be your maid.

93
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,660
I haven't finished my business.

94
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,220
Where is Lord Yuan,

95
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,060
whom I asked you to bring for me?

96
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,980
He will arrive in Bianzhou tomorrow.

97
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,170
This is the testimony

98
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,010
of Zhao Laoqi's neighbors.

99
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,060
Thank you, Jiu.

100
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,260
Miss Chun is bustling about

101
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,620
for our Madam.

102
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,180
I should try my best too.

103
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,050
Bad news!

104
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,500
What's wrong, Guo?

105
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,409
Master.

106
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,060
there's a notice in front of the government office

107
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,540
saying that the case of Linshui Pavilion

108
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,980
will stand the second trial tomorrow.

109
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,740
Lord Han, Commander of Zhechong Prefecture

110
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,860
and Lord Kang, Prime Minister of Supreme Court

111
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,940
will come to the trial.

112
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,420
Besides,

113
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,300
other than Miss Chun,

114
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,460
who's acting for Madam Fang...

115
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,220
And...

116
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:02,580
And...

117
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:03,780
And what?

118
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,820
Scholar Sun's name is also on it.

119
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,660
According to the notice,

120
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,540
he's acting for Zhao Laoqi's family.

121
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,420
How could they afford

122
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,540
to hire Scholar Sun?

123
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,060
There must be something wrong.

124
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,500
He

125
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,570
is eloquent

126
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,620
and unscrupulous.

127
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,660
He could say anything

128
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,900
in the court.

129
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,340
Let's forget about it.

130
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,700
Didn't we agree that

131
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,130
we could even risk our reputation

132
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,540
for Madam Fang's life.

133
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,700
Don't worry.

134
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,100
Prepare some money for me.

135
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,500
What money?

136
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,060
Someone with no scholarly honor or official rank acting for others,

137
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,700
unless it's for family,

138
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,620
will be flogged

139
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,020
regardless of gender.

140
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,100
Although I'm righteous,

141
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,540
I'm afraid of pain.

142
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,620
So I need you

143
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,060
to pay the fine for me.

144
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,500
Here, take them all.

145
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,460
I have more if it's not enough.

146
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,810
[Clean, cautious, and diligent]

147
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,780
Who are you?

148
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,820
I’m Fang Fei.

149
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,140
I'm Zhao Wanruo,

150
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:55,540
the widow of Zhao Laoqi,

151
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,020
I, Sun Yucun,

152
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,850
on behalf of the widow of the Zhao family,

153
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,780
am here to sue Fang Fei, the boss of Linshui Pavilion,

154
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,620
for poisoning Zhao Laoqi to death.

155
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,180
I, Chun Tumi, am acting for Fang Fei.

156
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,380
In my opinion,

157
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,100
the case Scholar Sun said about

158
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,900
Fang Fei poisoning Zhao Laoqi

159
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,540
was not true.

160
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,580
So

161
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,140
you're here to reverse the case?

162
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:13,980
Of course.

163
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,660
This is a court.

164
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,180
Scholar Sun,

165
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,860
You are the plaintiff. You go first.

166
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:22,860
I'm afraid I can't say.

167
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:23,900
Sun Yucun.

168
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,700
It's not your first day here.

169
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:26,940
What are you doing?

170
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,260
Please forgive me.

171
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,540
I had no choice.

172
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,890
The court is a serious place.

173
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:33,900
I don't want to be placed on a par

174
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,860
with the defender of a lawbreaker.

175
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:37,820
My lord,

176
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,740
Madam Fang poisoned the innocent

177
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,580
and caused Zhao Laoqi's death.

178
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,940
And Chun Tumi

179
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,180
instigated this lawsuit

180
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,620
for self-interest.

181
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,300
She intends to obstruct the legal judgment

182
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,260
and distort right and wrong.

183
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,380
I think

184
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,740
it should be strictly handled.

185
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,780
According to the previous example,

186
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,980
A shyster like her

187
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,900
should be flogged 1000 times

188
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,140
and locked up for 15 years.

189
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,820
When she served her time, we'll check and decide her fate.

190
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,050
What a joke.

191
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,220
If that's the case,

192
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,060
does it mean all defendants can't even appeal?

193
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,540
If that's the case,

194
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,780
when my father was framed,

195
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:07,900
I asked you for help.

196
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:08,940
Why did you

197
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,100
take the deposit?

198
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,300
It’s different.

199
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,420
The case of Chun Dashan is a false accusation.

200
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,460
There are many doubts.

201
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,260
As for Madam Fang's case,

202
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,860
we have both witnesses and evidence.

203
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,780
You think

204
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,010
it worked last time,

205
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,740
so you're being unreasonable.

206
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,220
You're the one being unreasonable.

207
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,100
I did things with due procedure.

208
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,380
Who are you putting on airs for?

209
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,500
You want to convict Madam Fang before the trial?

210
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,300
Chun Tumi,

211
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:30,860
you can’t roar at the court.

212
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:32,500
My lord.

213
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,860
I'm sorry.

214
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,300
Please investigate it.

215
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,100
Scholar Sun,

216
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,220
how dare you contradict me

217
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,780
in the court?

218
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,100
Do you admit your crime?

219
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,260
Yes.

220
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:50,070
[Clean, cautious, and diligent]

221
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,980
Considering your dedication to

222
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,500
the justice of the law,

223
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:50,620
I'll let it go.

224
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,740
Chun Tumi,

225
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,740
considering your filial devotion to save your father,

226
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,420
I didn't punish you last time.

227
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,090
I didn't expect you to go too far this time

228
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,180
to retract testimony for a murderer.

229
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,820
You should be punished severely.

230
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,620
But considering you're a little girl

231
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,580
and immature,

232
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,940
I'll let it slide.

233
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,230
[Clean, cautious, and diligent]

234
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,340
Guards!

235
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,340
Yes.

236
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,860
Drive her out.

237
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,580
Yes.

238
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,100
My lord,

239
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,340
the case is not closed yet.

240
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,420
Since my notice is in the court,

241
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,220
you should interrogate first.

242
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,300
My lord.

243
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:21,860
My lord!

244
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,570
I'm innocent!

245
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,300
My lord.

246
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,300
The prison guards are here.

247
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,340
I didn’t know you were coming,

248
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,020
so I failed to welcome you.

249
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,300
Please forgive me.

250
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,580
Lord Zhang is busy with the case.

251
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,140
Of course you don't need to be so formal.

252
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,060
We want to listen to the trial.

253
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,380
Are we late?

254
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,220
You've closed the case.

255
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,380
Let me see the document.

256
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,460
How did the female litigator do?

257
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,660
My lord,

258
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,940
she intended to reverse the case for a murderer

259
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,700
for her own benefit.

260
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,220
His Majesty always said to stop and hold the lawsuit.

261
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,460
A shyster like her should be severely punished

262
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,820
according to the law.

263
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,980
Since she's a little girl,

264
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,660
I'll just kick her out.

265
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,660
Lord Zhang,

266
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,300
you deserve your reputation.

267
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,220
I'm flattered.

268
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,570
As a parent-like official,

269
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,820
I should have His Majesty in my heart

270
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,340
and the people in my eyes.

271
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,300
If you really care about the people,

272
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,380
how could you get

273
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,620
the nickname of Zhang Muddle?

274
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,140
Someone must have framed me.

275
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,490
Please investigate.

276
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,700
I only believe what I see with my own eyes

277
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,980
and what I hear with my own eyes.

278
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,740
You solve cases by blackmailing.

279
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,860
You take bribes, and the highest bidder wins.

280
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,980
Your verdicts are perfunctory.

281
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,780
You just want to end them quickly so as to drink and have fun.

282
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,140
Do you dare to say that

283
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,940
these are not what you usually do?

284
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,020
My lord,

285
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,660
someone must have framed me.

286
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,300
Do you dare to say

287
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,900
the reason you kicked out Chun Tumi

288
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,620
is not that you are afraid

289
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,260
she will find evidence and be seen by me,

290
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,660
thus affecting your official evaluation?

291
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,420
I was just muddled.

292
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,290
Muddled?

293
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,420
At this point,

294
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,540
you're still trying

295
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:59,460
to find excuses

296
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,540
instead of repenting for

297
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,740
what you did

298
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,420
which caused the people of Bianzhou to be bullied

299
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,340
and have nowhere to redress?

300
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,660
You're so corrupt

301
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,370
and reckless about human life.

302
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,050
You're a sinner!

303
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,580
If all officials are like you,

304
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,100
how can the people live and work in peace?

305
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,340

306

I'm innocent!

[Prison Guard]

312
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,380
I was ordered to go on patrol.

313

[Prison Guard]

314
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,780
This badge

315
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,140
can promote good officials

316
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,380
and remove corrupt officials.

00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,580
took bribes and bent the law.

320

You'll be immediately dismissed.

321

Yes.

323
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,940
Take off his official robe

324
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,570
and put him in jail.

Magistrate Yuan is familiar with the law.

344
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,740
He has done a lot of things

345
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,540
for the people of the neighbor county.

346
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,820
I now appoint him

347
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,980
the magistrate of Bianzhou.

348
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,980
He will take over the case of Linshui Pavilion immediately.

349
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,100
Your Excellencies.

350
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,220
Please listen to the trial.

351
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:40,930
Court begins.

352
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,260
Master.

353
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,180
Bring me the records of the first trail.

354
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,300
Yes, my lord.

355
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,260
My lord, please have a look.

356
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:53,550
[Court Record]

357
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:56,150
[The first trail of the case of Linshui Pavilion]

358
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:05,220
[Avoid]

359
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,980
She's in a new Hu outfit.

360
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,100
I won again.

361
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,420
I'll give you the money later.

362
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,580
Of course.

363
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,020
But we agreed to win two out of three.

364
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:09,860
If I win,

365
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,060
no matter what she is like,

366
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,220
she can't be your maid.

367
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,460
Let's get down to business first.

368
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,660
Are you the litigator of the widow of Zhao Laoqi?

369
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,020
Yes.

370
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,420
What is your appeal?

371
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,380
My lord,

372
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,180
I have solid evidence

373
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,500
on my two appeals.

374
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:28,580
Please allow my witnesses

375
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,900
to come to the court.

376
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:32,820
Dr. Wen,

377
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,700
what was the customers

378
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,540
poisoned with that day?

379
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,700
I think

380
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,220
they were poisoned by scomber japonicus.

381
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,380
The patients I treated that day

382
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,220
have different degrees of symptoms

383
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,100
of vomiting and dizziness.

384
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,260
It's similar to the symptoms

385
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,020
of scomber japonicus poisoning.

386
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,020
I didn't suspect your medical skills.

387
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,180
I just want to convince

388
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,900
people who claim otherwise.

389
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:53,860
So,

390
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,300
please make it more clear.

391
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,580
Scomber japonicus

392
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,420
is a kind of fish that people often eat.

393
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,940
Sometimes, due to mishandling,

394
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,420
it can cause poisoning incidents.

395
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,380
Over the years,

396
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,740
I've treated dozens of cases.

397
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:05,810
If you don't believe me,

398
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,340
you can ask the doctors from neighbor counties

399
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,060
to cross check.

400
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,260
Are you a coroner in our county?

401
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,460
Yes.

402
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,370
I was in charge of checking

403
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,620
the vomit of those poisoned customers.

404
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,940
Is there anything else poisonous

405
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,900
in the vomit?

406
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,940
I have checked several times,

407
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,620
but I didn't find anything else poisonous.

408
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,260
Did you examine

409
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,300
Zhao Laoqi's body for

410
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,140
any other fatal diseases?

411
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,500
Zhao Laoqi had

412
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,740
no other diseases.

413
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,420
There is only

414
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,500
a little fish and some vegetables

415
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,850
in his vomit.

416
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:40,660
It's the same as

417
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,020
what he ordered that day.

418
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,300
Young Master Huang, right?

419
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,180
Yes.

420
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,020
You're a representative of

421
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,620
the poisoned customers that day.

422
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:48,980
Do you know

423
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,500
how many people were poisoned?

424
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:53,380
There should be nine people poisoned.

425
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,900
No, ten.

426
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,740
There is one more,

427
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,340
Zhao Laoqi, who's dead.

428
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,300
Do all of you

429
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,700
know each other?

430
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,540
Of course not all.

431
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,580
But there were some familiar faces.

432
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,060
I didn't talk to them

433
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,340
then.

434
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,850
Did you all order

435
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:09,740
Lotus Fish Soup?

436
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,940
Of course.

437
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,060
Otherwise,

438
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,860
how could we all be poisoned?

439
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,300
How unlucky.

440
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:15,980
Chief Bailiff Hong,

441
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,060
it was you who led people to do the investigation

442
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,260
at Linshui Pavilion, right?

443
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:20,940
Yes.

444
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,620
According to your investigation,

445
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,780
has the Lotus Fish Soup

446
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,740
ever been touched by others

447
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,540
from the time it was cooked to the time it was served?

448
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,300
No.

449
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,900
We've investigated it carefully.

450
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,860
From beginning to end,

451
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,420
it was handled by Madam Fang alone.

452
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,100
Even Madam Fang has admitted it.

453
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,180
These are supported by confessions.

454
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,580
Okay.

455
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,900
Then there are witnesses and evidence.

456
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,540
Everyone who ate the fish soup

457
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,420
showed symptoms

458
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,260
of poisoning by scomber japonicus.

459
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,260
And scomber japonicus

460
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,220
is the main ingredient of the soup.

461
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,140
Even Madam Fang admitted

462
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,420
she made the soup all the way.

463
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,980
She didn't have help.

464
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,980
These four witnesses can prove

465
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,460
the death of Zhao Laoqi

466
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,420
was done by Madam Fang.

467
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,500
She knew the raw materials were poisonous,

468
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,820
but sold them for interests.

469
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,660
She deliberately violated the law

470
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,540
and attempted murder.

471
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,540
She should be beheaded.

472
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,740
How is that possible?

473
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,220
What do you think, young lady?

474
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,140
I think it's a big mistake.

475
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,060
Chun Tumi,

476
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,460
do you dare to repeat

477
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,460
what you just said?

478
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,100
Your voice was too low.

479
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,740
Just say it.

480
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,260
You're just a little girl.

481
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,660
Even if you can't beat me,

482
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,820
if you cried in front of them,

483
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,980
they won't punish you.

484
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,300
Want a bet?

485
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:40,660
Will she cry?

486
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,180
Boring.

487
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,220
How about we bet

488
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,380
when she will be stumped?

489
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,780
What's the bet?

490
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,460
Call me grandpa.

491
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,460
You just called me

492
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,460
master once.

493
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,340
Seriously?

494
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,660
I admit defeat. I won't regret it.

495
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:56,900
I bet

496
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,060
the motive.

497
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,420
I bet

498
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:02,660
she will never be stumped.

499
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,900
Scholar Sun,

500
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,740
even a little girl like me

501
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,020
understands that in this court,

502
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,100
only the judge

503
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,340
can decide the case.

504
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,300
You just appealed.

505
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,820
But I haven't responded yet.

506
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,100
When is it your turn

507
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,140
to make a conclusion

508
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,660
and divide the result for the three lord?

509
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,220
Now I have solid evidence.

510
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,420
Even if you try to talk back,

511
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,220
it won't help.

512
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,180
My lord,

513
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,420
I still have a question

514
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,540
for the witness.

515
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,460
May I...

516
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,340
Yes.

517
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,500
Dr. Wen has excellent medical skills and medical virtues.

518
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,900
Therefore, I don't doubt

519
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,620
your judgment.

520
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,700
I believe

521
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,660
they were poisoned

522
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,500
by eating scomber japonicus.

523
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,740
But what I want to know is

524
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,580
even if those people were poisoned

525
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,380
because they ate fish soup,

526
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:46,620
are you sure

527
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,220
Zhao Laoqi's death

528
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,620
was also caused by fish soup?

529
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,020
Now that you mention it,

530
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,780
I'm really not sure.

531
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,180
Thank you, Dr. Wen.

532
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:55,950
[Avoid]

533
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,700
My lord,

534
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,300
I have a request.

535
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,580
Can I ask Dr. Wen to

536
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,180
check Young Master Huang's

537
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,500
body?

538
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,220
My Lord.

539
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,980
This is unnecessary.

540
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,300
Since Scholar Sun thinks

541
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,540
Zhao Laoqi must have died

542
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,290
after eating the fish soup,

543
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,020
then

544
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,140
Young Master Huang who ate the fish soup

545
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,060
must be in danger too.

546
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:11,819
It's a matter of life and death.

547
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,180
I think it's necessary.

548
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,099
Granted.

549
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:18,420
My lord.

550
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:20,619
Dr. Wen.

551
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,140
Young Master Huang, how is he now?

552
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,740
Young Master Huang is very healthy.

553
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,940
He's fine now.

554
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,580
[Avoid]

555
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,579
Young Master Huang,

556
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:29,660
what were your symptoms after you were poisoned?

557
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,620
I vomited so much.

558
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,180
I even wanted to dig out my intestines

559
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:33,860
and wash them.

560
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:34,620
You felt really bad?

561
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,580
I felt really bad.

562
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,100
You didn't die?

563
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,220
How could you say that?

564
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,220
You asked the doctor to feel my pulse

565
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,420
and asked me if I was dead.

566
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,020
Will I stand here if I died?

567
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,500
After I vomited,

568
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,580
I felt nauseous for quite a while.

569
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,380
Luckily,

570
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,540
I ate the antidote soup prescribed by Dr. Wen.

571
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,900
That's why I got better.

572
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:49,820
This afternoon,

573
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,740
I had a big bowl of

574
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,580
mutton noodle soup.

575
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,260
I just wanted

576
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,340
to be prepared for all eventualities.

577
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,900
Dr. Wen,

578
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:56,900
why don't you

579
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:57,900
check

580
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,980
all the poisoned people?

581
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,700
What if someone end up like Zhao Laoqi?

582
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,500
What if the poison attack later?

583
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,860
I know you meant well.

584
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,340
But one of the poisoned people

585
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,220
was an old man in his 70s.

586
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:07,820
So,

587
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,100
after I prescribed the antidote soup,

588
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,420
I checked them carefully again.

589
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,500
Even the elderly

590
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,220
came home after nothing happened.

591
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,140
Don't worry about that.

592
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,370
They are fine

593
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,620
doesn't mean Zhao Laoqi is fine.

594
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,380
People are different.

595
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,700
Zhao Laoqi had

596
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,940
no other diseases.

597
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:22,940
Now he's dead.

598
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,980
There's no other reason

599
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,300
except the soup.

600
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,780
Right, coroner?

601
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,140
May I ask

602
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,260
what do you usually do

603
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,100
as a coroner?

604
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,420
You don't even know that.

605
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,700
How can you be a litigator?

606
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,100
I have no experience.

607
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,580
Please tell me in detail.

608
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,500
The main work is to check the body

609
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,620
or the injuries

610
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,180
in cases.

611
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,460
May I ask

612
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,700
if the victim has a unmentionable disease,

613
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,460
such as heartache,

614
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,460
if it attacks,

615
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,820
he might even die.

616
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,100
Can you find that?

617
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,220
I'm a coroner,

618
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,380
not a miracle doctor.

619
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,500
What I can see

620
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,380
is what kind of wound,

621
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,380
how many wounds

622
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,780
and how much blood was shed.

623
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,060
Things that actually exists.

624
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,780
But since it is called an unmentionable disease,

625
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,060
I can't tell it.

626
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,940
What if Zhao Laoqi is really poisoned,

627
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,780
but the poison is not solid?

628
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:10,860
For example,

629
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,860
it's powder melted into the wine.

630
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,980
Can you find that?

631
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,300
I tested it with a silver needle,

632
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,460
but nothing was wrong.

633
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,300
But if it's a poison

634
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,620
that cannot be tested with a silver needle,

635
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,500
just like what you said about the unmentionable disease?

636
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,300
Of course not.

637
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,700
Thank you.

638
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,500
Madam Fang,

639
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,700
did you handle the fish

640
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,020
from buying to putting it in the pot?

641
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:30,700
Yes.

642
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,220
What about before cooking?

643
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:33,380
I just bought fish.

644
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,260
I don't know

645
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,380
what happened before.

646
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:36,940
However,

647
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,100
all these years,

648
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:38,980
I only purchased

649
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,420
from one fish dealer.

650
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,890
Nothing has ever happened.

651
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,220
Okay, thank you.

652
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,220
My lord,

653
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,610
I have finished all the questions

654
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,380
I wanted to ask.

655
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,460
I'm more certain now.

656
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,020
What Scholar Sun said just now

657
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,220
can't stand ground.

658
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,700
Don't be arrogant.

659
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,700
You just said

660
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,460
you have witnesses and evidence.

661
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,700
But no witness

662
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,900
said anything sure.

663
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,380
Besides,

664
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,820
Linshui Pavilion has been running

665
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,100
in our county for seven years.

666
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,300
Lotus Fish Soup is famous far and wide.

667
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,140
I once met a master.

668
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,420
He said his hometown

669
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,730
is the origin of scomber japonicus.

670
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,180
When the locals eat this fish,

671
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,900
they will also be poisoned.

672
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,420
If you have any doubts,

673
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,180
you can send someone to ask the locals.

674
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,740
There are people poisoned in the origin of this fish.

675
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,980
For seven years,

676
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,300
there has never been any cases

677
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,060
in Linshui Pavilion.

678
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,850
It shows that Madam Fang was careful in cooking.

679
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,580
There was no accident on the day of the incident

680
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,020
that affected Madam Fang's mood.

681
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,060
How could she

682
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,300
make poisonous fish soup unexpectedly?

683
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,940
What if she found out

684
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,060
there's something wrong with the fish soup,

685
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,540
for the reputation of the restaurant,

686
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,540
she should have destroyed it immediately

687
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,380
and stopped selling.

688
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,900
Linshui Pavilion has business to do.

689
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,660
I don't think she wanted to

690
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,610
ruin her reputation.

691
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,140
She used to be careful.

692
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,580
But it doesn't mean she didn't make a mistake this time.

693
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,780
This is also an uncertain evidence.

694
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,450
How can you prove that

695
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,780
the poisonous fish soup was her fault?

696
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,460
It's a matter of life and death. You want to deny it?

697
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,540
So many people had fish soup.

698
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,820
They just vomited and had stomachache.

699
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:54,220
Even Dr. Wen proved that

700
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,700
Young Master Huang has recovered.

701
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,140
On the day of the incident,

702
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,140
Lord Han and Lord Kang

703
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,060
were at the scene.

704
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,660
Judging from the situation,

705
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,060
it was a sudden death.

706
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,500
It didn't seem like it was caused by drinking poisonous fish soup,

707
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,340
but looked like drinking arsenic.

708
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,780
You're being unreasonable.

709
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,380
This is a question.

710
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,740
The coroner said

711
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,260
he didn't find any unmentionable disease

712
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:12,450
on Zhao Laoqi.

713
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,780
I think

714
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,220
he must have something

715
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,300
that can't be cured.

716
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,060
Mrs. Zhao,

717
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,340
did Zhao Laoqi have any unmentionable disease?

718
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,340
Did he have a stubborn disease?

719
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,300
The kind that he had since he was young.

720
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,540
He had been carrying it

721
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,900
without cure.

722
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,300
He's usually fine,

723
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,980
but felt weak when it attacks.

724
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,340
If there is,

725
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,140
you have to tell the lord.

726
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,020
My lord,

727
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:44,220
my husband has always been strong.

728
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,820
He rarely had any minor illness.

729
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,460
Everyone knew it.

730
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,180
I was wrong

731
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,300
Zhao Laoqi was in good health.

732
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,210
Since he was so healthy,

733
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,540
why were so many people

734
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,380
fine

735
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,540
after eating the fish soup,

736
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,220
including a 70-year-old man,

737
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,380
but he died on the spot?

738
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,140
That makes sense.

739
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,220
But what you said is all questionable.

740
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,500
So far,

741
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,980
there is no actual evidence.

742
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,100
Scholar Sun,

743
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,260
what do you think?

744
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:15,980
My lord,

745
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,540
although Chun Tumi is eloquent,

746
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,460
it can’t change the fact.

747
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,460
Chun Tumi said so much just now.

748
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,580
She just wanted to distract everyone.

749
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,180
She can't prove Madam Fang's innocence.

750
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,420
Neither can I prove

751
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,140
Madam Fang is guilty.

752
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,500
Then this matter

753
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,260
can either conclude without conclusion

754
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,900
or we can verify that

755
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,970
it was Madam Fang's negligence.

756
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,540
But according to my investigation,

757
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,500
the death of Zhao Laoqi

758
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,060
was indeed done intentionally by Madam Fang.

759
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,460
I'm curious.

760
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,660
Intentional?

761
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,220
In public,

762
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,740
in her own restaurant,

763
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,540
Madam Fang is not crazy or stupid.

764
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,300
Why would she

765
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,300
commit a matter of self-destruction?

766
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,220
Will she still do business in Linshui Pavilion?

767
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,860
This is the cleverness

768
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:00,060
of Madam Fang.

769
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,700
She wanted to

770
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,970
deceive people like this

771
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,500
and make people think

772
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,580
she wouldn't do this evil deed

773
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,620
blatantly in her restaurant.

774
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,300
It can clear herself up.

775
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:12,740
She didn't know

776
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,420
justice has long arms.

777
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,140
With this little trick

778
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,940
and plan,

779
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,660
how long can she hide it?

780
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,300
Then why did Madam Fang do that?

781
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,700
Why would she risk the future of the restaurant

782
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,220
and the rest of her life

783
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,020
for an irrelevant life?

784
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,540
My basis is

785
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,620
motive.

786
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,820
Madam Fang and Zhao Laoqi are old friends.

787
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,980
They even had a conflict.

788
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,740
Madam Fang once said

789
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,500
to let Zhao Laoqi die.

790
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,740
Am I right, Madam Fang?

791
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,140
I did say that.

792
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,900
That's because he came to blackmail me

793
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,540
and kept harassing me.

794
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,980
That's why I threatened him.

795
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,980
You're not honest.

796
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,020
As far as I know

797
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,500
Zhao Laoqi

798
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,500
not only blackmailed you,

799
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,540
the grudge between you two

800
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,260
were deeper.

801
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,330
Scholar Sun.

802
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,180
If you have evidence, show it.

803
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,660
What you're doing now

804
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,060
is to lure Madam Fang

805
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,540
to say what you want her to say.

806
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,460
I wanted to save you some face,

807
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,900
but you didn't appreciate it.

808
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,740
Do you really think I have no witness?

809
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,380
My Lord.

810
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,460
I would like to ask the witness.

811
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:22,820
Summon the witness.

812
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,660
My lord.

813
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,260
the witness is in the court.

814
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:29,330
It's Chun Dashan.

815
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,380
Summon Chun Dashan.

816
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,620
Greetings, my lords.

817
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,740
Chun Dashan.

818
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,340
Hurry up and explain

819
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,460
to the lords.

820
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,780
How you and Madam Fang

821
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,100
know each other?

822
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,100
Chun Dashan.

823
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,980
Tell the truth.

824
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,220
Seven years ago,

825
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,340
on my way home from the army,

826
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,100
I passed by a wasteland.

827
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,100
I vaguely heard something strange.

828
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,180
Help!

829
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,980
Help!

830
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:14,780
What are you doing?

831
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:20,780
Miss.

832
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,020
Miss.

833
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,460
Miss, are you all right?

834
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:24,660
My lord.

835
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,980
That's what happened.

836
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,780
I think for the sake of reputation,

837
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,020
she didn't take Zhao Laoqi

838
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,140
to court.

839
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,540
So,

840
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,900
why did you stop before

841
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,220
the most important thing?

842
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,740
Fine.

843
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,900
Even if Zhao Laoqi is evil,

844
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,100
he is worse than a pig or a dog.

845
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:47,340
Let me ask you.

846
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,330
Did Madam Fang say

847
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,220
she want to kill Zhao Laoqi?

848
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,420
Just one word, yes or no?

849
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,820
Yes, but...

850
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,660
That's it.

851
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:09,660
My lord.

852
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,500
Madam Fang was humiliated.

853
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,460
She has long held a grudge against Zhao Laoqi.

854
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,900
If what I said before can't prove

855
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,740
her motive,

856
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,860
then what he said

857
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,380
plus this experience,

858
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,460
now we have solid evidence.

859
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,220
You brat.

860
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,620
Litigation

861
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,380
is not just showing cleverness or petty tricks.

862
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,860
You want to fight me?

863
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,300
Do you deserve it?

864
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,580
What do you think?

865
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,380
Don't waste

866
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,340
the lords' precious time.

867
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,380
Hurry up...

868
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,180
Wait.

869
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,700
Lord Han.

870
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:46,860
My abdomen

871
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,420
suddenly

872
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,980
hurts.

873
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,900
Lord Han! Lord Han!

874
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,780
Lord Han! Lord Han!

875
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:56,780
Lord Han!

876
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,100
Dr. Wen.

877
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,060
How is Lord Han?

878
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,700
His pulse is fine.

879
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,220
Maybe it's getting cold recently,

880
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:12,500
it's toilsome to handle cases,

881
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,220
and he's not eating on time, so his abdomen hurts.

882
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,380
Keep warm

883
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,020
and have some rest. He'll be fine.

884
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:21,780
Thank you.

885
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,020
Lord Yuan,

886
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,260
please take Dr. Wen to prescribe medicine.

887
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,340
I'm here.

888
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,500
Shameless!

889
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,300
I didn't cheat.

890
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,100
You didn't say you wouldn't let me help.

891
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,900
I said she won't be stumped.

892
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,300
Of course I'll keep my promise.

893
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:52,700
A bet is a joke.

894
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,020
But you are so frivolous.

895
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,460
Where do you put the dignity of the court?

896
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,540
The case is changing rapidly.

897
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,660
At this time,

898
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,580
if any side do something

899
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,180
during the time...

900
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,060
Scholar Sun has the advantage.

901
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,450
He won’t do anything.

902
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,740
What about Chun Tumi?

903
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,540
She won’t do anything either.

904
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,260
Don't worry.

905
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,490
Listen.

906
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:09,780
Chun Tumi

907
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,900
is not an honest person.

908
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:11,850
Look at her

909
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:12,940
in the court today.

910
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,460
Scholar Sun was careless.

911
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,860
He almost fell into her trap.

912
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:16,740
Look at you.

913
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,140
Now you gave her time,

914
00:28:18,570 --> 00:28:19,410
she might have

915
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,020
another bad idea.

916
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,500
Can you say that you don't look forward to

917
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,500
her bad idea?

918
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,380
Then why do you care about

919
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,500
her legal opinion?

920
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,580
Just find another nerd

921
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,500
like you.

922
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,420
I'm not joking.

923
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,220
You must follow the rules.

924
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,460
The court is no joke.

925
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,620
A piece of rough jade

926
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,260
can't come out good

927
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,220
without time and space

928
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,740
to polish it.

929
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,940
If one technique

930
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,060
can both grind the jade

931
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:40,220
and find the truth,

932
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,100
isn't that better?

933
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:41,940
Are you still planning

934
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,300
to kill two birds with one stone?

935
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,940
From what she did in the court today,

936
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,500
she had no preparation for this.

937
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,940
Even if the court is closed for an hour,

938
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,460
do you think she can find a way?

939
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,460
That depends on her fate.

940
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,220
After all, you're the one who is polishing her.

941
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,860
I just don't want to have another grandpa.

942
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,460
Zheng.

943
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,180
How about

944
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,540
we forget about the bet?

945
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,050
I'm sorry.

946
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,410
It hurts.

947
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,380
Prime Minister of Supreme Court hit me!

948
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,460
I didn't even touch you.

949
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:17,660
I dare not mess with Prime Minister of Supreme Court anymore.

950
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,660
Listen.

951
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:19,820
From now on,

952
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:20,940
no joking or bet

953
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,780
on the court anymore.

954
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,700
Never.

955
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,700
Later,

956
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,460
listen to the trial in good behavior.

957
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,690
All right.

958
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,060
Don't be angry anymore.

959
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:43,790
[Tea]

960
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,380
Take care.

961
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,940
I didn't expect

962
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,980
Scholar Sun would know about this.

963
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,780
Scholar Sun's so-called motive

964
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:48,980
put us in a very unfavorable situation.

965
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,540
Scholar Sun

966
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,700
really deserves his reputation.

967
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,580
He changed the situation several times in court.

968
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,020
No wonder his charge

969
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:56,740
is so expensive.

970
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,940
You can say that again.

971
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,060
I heard that Scholar Sun

972
00:29:59,340 --> 00:29:59,940
has been relying on

973
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,020
his tongue

974
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,300
to make a big fortune.

975
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,060
Yes.

976
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,900
If it weren't for the high profit,

977
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,020
why would Ms. Chun sacrifice her reputation

978
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,460
to litigate in court?

979
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,860
Why don't you become a litigator too?

980
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:14,410
[Tea]

981
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,420
I heard that Scholar Sun

982
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,620
not only makes a lot of money,

983
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,260
but also has a beautiful concubine.

984
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,420
You have no idea.

985
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,220
After Scholar Sun

986
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,340
took in a concubine,

987
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,860
his wife wouldn't let go,

988
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,540
she chased him three blocks with a knife

989
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,780
and said she wanted to kill him.

990
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:23,540
Kill him?

991
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,650
You don't believe me?

992
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,100
Fine. Let's drink.

993
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,900
Come on.

994
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,220
I have an idea.

995
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:31,940
My lord.

996
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,580
Madam Fang

997
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,700
admitted

998
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,820
in court that

999
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,980
she had a motive to kill.

1000
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,340
So I think

1001
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,180
the evidence is irrefutable

1002
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,580
that she killed him intentionally.

1003
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,740
No need to say more.

1004
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,860
Since the evidence is solid,

1005
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,620
why are you still standing here?

1006
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,100
What do you mean?

1007
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,140
Are you threatening me?

1008
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,260
Chun Tumi.

1009
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,170
In the court,

1010
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,420
you can't make threats.

1011
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,460
My lord, this is not a threat.

1012
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,660
It's the truth.

1013
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,860
I heard that

1014
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,500
Scholar Sun enjoys the joy of Qi people.

1015
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,380
He has a wife and a concubine.

1016
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,060
The wife of Scholar Sun

1017
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,900
has a strong personality.

1018
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,220
She threatened to kill him

1019
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,780
because he took a concubine.

1020
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,260
She even chased him with a knife

1021
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,460
for three blocks.

1022
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,140
Nonsense!

1023
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,700
That's not true.

1024
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,260
She made it up.

1025
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,260
My lord.

1026
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,740
This matter is known in the street.

1027
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:21,740
There are many witnesses.

1028
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,700
You'll know if you ask around.

1029
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,140
Yes.

1030
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,300
She chased three blocks.

1031
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,180
I'm not the only one

1032
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,540
who saw it, right?

1033
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,140
Yes.

1034
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,580
Scholar Sun even lost his pants.

1035
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,300
Yes.

1036
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,020
Silence!

1037
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,260
Scholar Sun,

1038
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,940
is it true?

1039
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,090
You can't hide it.

1040
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,020
My lord.

1041
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:37,770
This...

1042
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,700
Just because she suddenly

1043
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,460
brought an irrelevant scandal

1044
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,660
to the court.

1045
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,580
I...

1046
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,300
I spoke without thinking.

1047
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,220
Please forgive me.

1048
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,820
Why is it irrelevant?

1049
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,540
According to you,

1050
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,340
if she wanted to kill someone, then she will kill.

1051
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,420
Why are you still alive?

1052
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,380
Why are you standing here?

1053
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:57,780
Scholar Sun,

1054
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,060
your wife didn't

1055
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,140
just say it.

1056
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,500
She even chased you

1057
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,660
with a knife for three blocks.

1058
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,100
She was so angry.

1059
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,580
How could you be safe?

1060
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,780
Madam Fang is a businesswoman.

1061
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,900
It's inevitable that

1062
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,420
she would meet some rude people.

1063
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,740
If she kills all of them,

1064
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:12,780
will the front of Linshui Pavilion

1065
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,500
be filled with corpses?

1066
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,220
You...

1067
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,500
I...

1068
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:20,700
How can you

1069
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,300
compare these two things?

1070
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,940
How can my personal matter

1071
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,250
be used as

1072
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,260
the refutation of the murder?

1073
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:28,900
Nonsense.

1074
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,220
It's so far-fetched.

1075
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,980
Everything in the world

1076
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,620
is nothing reason.

1077
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,180
You can deduce

1078
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,620
Madam Fang's motive for murder.

1079
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,140
Why can't I?

1080
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,580
Does it mean that

1081
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,660
if you hate someone

1082
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,900
and threaten to kill him,

1083
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,300
you will definitely kill him?

1084
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,660
I dare ask everyone in court

1085
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:47,380
who doesn't have a person you hate so much

1086
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,860
and want him or her to disappear?

1087
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,020
Who

1088
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,780
really killed someone?

1089
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,060
Speaking of nonsense,

1090
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,020
it all started with you.

1091
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,740
Ms. Chun is right.

1092
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,060
I understand what Ms. Chun said.

1093
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,100
What did Scholar Sun say?

1094
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,020
It's already half of the time in the court tonight.

1095
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,460
The trial of the case of Linshui Pavilion

1096
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,340
will continue the day after tomorrow.

1097
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,500
You two

1098
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,620
have one day

1099
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,780
to find evidence again.

1100
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,740
It'll be better than

1101
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,140
repeatedly pestering each other like today.

1102
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,180
Yes.

1103
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,940
I hereby announce

1104
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,140
the trial will be held the night after tomorrow.

1105
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,220
The criminal will be put in prison for now.

1106
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,300
Court adjourned.

1107
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,740
Why are you eating so fast?

1108
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,740
To save the beauty.

1109
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,980
You said you won't interfere with the court anymore.

1110
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,060
Of course.

1111
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,500
I won't interfere in court.

1112
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,260
In private, it depends on our capabilities then.

1113
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,180
Chun Tumi is capable.

1114
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,540
She can find out the truth.

1115
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,220
Since you lost the bet,

1116
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,060
I'm telling you.

1117
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,060
Zheng.

1118
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,220
If you do this,

1119
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,820
no girls will like you.

1120
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,580
Of course Chun Tumi is capable.

1121
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,610
But investigating the case

1122
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,380
is too difficult

1123
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:58,580
for a girl like her.

1124
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,700
Didn't you see her pale face

1125
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,860
when the court was adjourned today?

1126
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,340
She's not feeling well.

1127
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,780
After all, she's a girl.

1128
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,530
She's so delicate.

1129
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,780
How can I not help her?

1130
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,139
Are you so sure

1131
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:13,699
she will take action?

1132
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,060
She's not you.

1133
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:17,460
As soon as you speak,

1134
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,780
the most skilled constable

1135
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,699
will find evidence for you.

1136
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,739
Who else can she rely on besides herself?

1137
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:23,580
So,

1138
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:24,659
just do your job.

1139
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:26,260
I'll help you to investigate Chun Tumi.

1140
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,460
If she is capable,

1141
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,540
you can have more help

1142
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,139
for prison guard.

1143
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:31,330
Besides,

1144
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,940
we still have a mission.

1145
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:34,659
You can't always be distracted.

1146
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,940
My Lady,

1147
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,620
you've written so much

1148
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:49,260
since you came back.

1149
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,100
Burn it all.

1150
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,940
It's useless anyway.

1151
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,820
How is it useless?

1152
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,820
Every stroke is written

1153
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,340
by you earnestly.

1154
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,860
Every stroke?

1155
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,140
In the court,

1156
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,780
in the real case,

1157
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,260
it's useless.

1158
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:17,620
My Lady.

1159
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:18,660
What are you looking for?

1160
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,460
I'll help you.

1161
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:20,260
No need.

1162
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,260
I'll prepare myself.

1163
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,860
Everything has to start over.

1164
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,780
Start over?

1165
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,740
My Lady.

1166
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,690
What do you mean?

1167
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,100
Find the evidence again.

1168
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,580
Victory or defeat will be decided in the next trail.

1169
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,340
If you start now...

1170
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,740
It's getting dark.

1171
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:37,930
I thought

1172
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,340
I've prepared enough.

1173
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,540
I didn't expect that Scholar Sun

1174
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,700
to find out Madam Fang's motive

1175
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,860
from what happened so many years ago.

1176
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,420
You've refuted it.

1177
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:47,810
Father and Madam Fang

1178
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,980
kept it a secret.

1179
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,380
Zhao Laoqi is dead.

1180
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,850
He can still find it.

1181
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,460
It means he really went out of his way

1182
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,300
to find it.

1183
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,300
Look at this clothes.

1184
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,460
I won't be easily recognized

1185
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,220
if I wear it at night, right?

1186
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,530
Lord Han.

1187
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:24,940
I knew

1188
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,540
you can't help it tonight.

1189
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,620
Tell me.

1190
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:28,980
Where do you want to visit at night?

1191
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,820
I just came out

1192
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,220
to get some wine for my father.

1193
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:32,860
Chun Tumi,

1194
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,140
you really can’t lie.

1195
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,020
You look

1196
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,020
prepared.

1197
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:36,980
If I don't believe it,

1198
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:38,020
you'll find another excuse

1199
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,260
and keep fooling me, right?

1200
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,820
How could I?

1201
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,060
Father.

1202
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,100
You learned a new move again?

1203
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,460
Who taught you that?

1204
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:01,420
How is it?

1205
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:02,420
Nothing happened, right?

1206
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,420
No.

1207
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,290
Nothing strange.

1208
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:04,980
That's good.

1209
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,380
I didn't expect that

1210
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,940
even the back door of Linshui Pavilion was guarded.

1211
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,460
What should we do?

1212
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,100
It's almost time, right?

1213
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:14,700
Yes.

1214
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,700
Let's change shifts.

1215
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,220
Okay.
