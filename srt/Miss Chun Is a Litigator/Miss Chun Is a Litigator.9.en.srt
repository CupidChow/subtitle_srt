Wang Dazhuang is from this county.

My cow wasn't stolen. Great.

Youzhou is an important military town in the North.

It's not surprising that it's different.

and has 10 entrances.

It's one of the top cities.

156
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,780
Lord Kang said

157
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,020
because this is an important town,

158
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,060
there may be many case files to review.

159
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,659
We may stay longer.

160

It is said that Lord Han

as long as you ask,

171
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,020
they'd love to.

00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,700
That's what the stories say.

175
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,170
A young master and a young lady

176
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,460
go hiking in the mountains.

177
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:16,580
There will be

178
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,460
waterfalls

179
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,380
or creeks.

180
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,980
Then the two of them

181
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,900
would have a lovely romance story.

182
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,780
[Youzhou]

183
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:34,850
[Youzhou]

184
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,419
What are you doing?

185
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,929
Get out of the way!

186
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,100
The lords from the capital are here.

187
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,140
Get out of the way.

188
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:37,700
Sir.

189
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:38,820
This won't do.

190
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,860
If we miss the auspicious time for the burial,

191
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:41,780
it will bring bad luck.

192
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,169
I said move.

193
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,100
Cut your crap.

194
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:44,780
Move! All of you!

195
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:45,780
Sir,

196
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,460
my grandfather's body can't wait.

197
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,380
If the burial is delayed,

198
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,300
I'll be unfilial to him.

199
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:52,700
Shut up.

200
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,100
If you offended the lords,

201
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,140
you'd have to worry that

202
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,460
Khrom Luo may arrest you all.

203
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,460
Please.

204
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,420
Let us go!

205
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,220
Get out of the way!

206
00:08:59,300 --> 00:08:59,740
If we don't go to bury him now,

207
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,780
we'll be missing the auspicious time.

208
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,660
Are you disobeying the order?

209
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,060
Sir,

210
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,460
please let us pass.

211
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,700
I said no.

212
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,380
Move.

213
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:06,940
Wait.

214
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,020
Wait!

215
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:08,780
Let us pass.

216
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,620
I'm Lord Kang Zhengyuan's bodyguard.

217
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,420
Lord Kang ordered me to deliver a message.

218
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,980
The deceased is the most important.

219
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,500
Thank you, Sir.

220
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:25,940
Go ahead.

221
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,820
Youzhou is indeed prosperous.

222
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,820
This place

223
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,250
is so grand and luxurious.

224
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,780
This is the mansion of Khrom Luo.

225
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,220
He has served two emperors.

226
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,620
His residency certainly should suit his position.

227
00:09:59,420 --> 00:09:59,900
Tumi,

228
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,660
have a good rest tonight.

229
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,940
You can

230
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:03,980
sleep well here.

231
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:05,780
Captain Chun.

232
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:08,980
Was it Lord Han and Lord Kang?

233
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,940
Do they need something?

234
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,420
I'm here to deliver the invitation.

235
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,700
Khom Luo?

236
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,140
Yes.

237
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,300
He asked me to hand this

238
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,500
to you and Miss Chun.

239
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,500
Khrom Luo invites us

240
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,900
to his family feast.

241
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,740
A family feast?

242
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,700
Lord Han, Lord Kang,

243
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,660
honorable guests,

244
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,340
you came all the way here.

245
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,220
I've prepared a family feast

246
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,940
to welcome you all.

247
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,580
I'll drink first.

248
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,060
Lord Han,

249
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,770
you usually drink

250
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,300
liquors from the palace.

251
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,220
I wonder

252
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,340
if you'd give the honor to drink

253
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,140
this liquor, the Three Drunk Flowers,

254
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,940
from Youzhou?

255
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,620
You must be joking.

256
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,380
Lord Luo,

257
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,340
let me have a blast tonight.

258
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:30,940
Great.

259
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,660
Please.

260
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,880
[Three Drunk Flowers]

261
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,540
Tumi, pour less.

262
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,740
The lords are watching.

263
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:39,980
Father,

264
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,460
I don't think

265
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,780
this is about drinking.

266
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,460
We just have to help ourselves.

267
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:45,820
Don't talk nonsense.

268
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,780
You know Luo Li is up to no good.

269
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,900
Why did you take her here

270
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,140
to get through all these?

271
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,460
You did it on purpose.

272
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,460
If she encounters bigger cases in the future,

273
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,340
sooner or later,

274
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,730
she'd have to face these political bigwigs.

275
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,220
She has been doing a great job

276
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,580
before this.

277
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,140
Consider this as training.

278
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,100
You're putting a lot of effort into training her, aren't you?

279
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,660
It was not enough to bring her to  this patrol.

280
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,700
You're preparing her for bigger cases.

281
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:17,940
What about you?

282
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,260
You knew someone

283
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,420
is really into you,

284
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,540
you still took her here.

285
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,340
Back in the capital,

286
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,180
Luo Li used his position

287
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,220
to force me to marry his daughter

288
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,660
during a drunk talk.

289
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,220
His Majesty almost agreed.

290
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,740
I have to make him give up.

291
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:48,740
Lord Luo,

292
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:49,980
a toast to you.

293
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,620
I thought you couldn't really drink.

294
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,100
I can't drink much.

295
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,580
But it's my first time here.

296
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,140
I have to try

297
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,140
your Three Drunk Flowers.

298
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,220
You are

299
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,540
the regional commander of Youzhou,

300
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,500
let me drink first as a toast.

301
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,380
Thank you for your help in advance.

302
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,060
Save all the courtesies.

303
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:10,980
Please.

304
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,220
The lady of the Chun family.

305
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,060
I'm here.

306
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,820
This is my home.

307
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,140
Save the courtesy.

308
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,740
Sit down.

309
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,220
Yes.

310
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,580
I've heard about

311
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,220
what you did in Bianzhou.

312
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,540
It surprised me that

313
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,220
a little girl like you

314
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,060
could be so courageous,

315
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,380
meticulous,

316
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,420
and eloquent.

317
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,140
Also, you are very familiar

318
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,700
with our laws.

319
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,420
You can use them

320
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,260
however you want.

321
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,780
Just like how we use the weapons

322
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,100
in military.

323
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:06,820
My lord,

324
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,460
you're embarrassing me.

325
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,660
Please stop complimenting her.

326
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,540
Usually, my daughter

327
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,980
has a soft personality.

328
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,100
She likes to read.

329
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,460
But I couldn't find

330
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,780
other books for her.

331
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,820
That's why she read some law books.

332
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,060
When I was framed, she had to go out there

333
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:25,380
and show up in court

334
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,420
to seek justice for me.

335
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,090
It was my fault

336
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,460
that I brought her so much trouble.

337
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,940
How come it was your fault?

338
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,420
She has a talent

339
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,740
and it was the right time.

340
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,340
Father, what you said is inappropriate.

341
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,940
You're leaving him no space

342
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,060
to reply.

343
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,420
He can't just admit it proudly

344
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,820
that his daughter is a genius,

345
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,890
nor can he pretend to be humble

346
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,540
and admit that his daughter is an idiot.

347
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,060
How dare you!

348
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,820
How rude!

349
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,380
This is a family feast,

350
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,340
but we have guests here.

351
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,580
You two

352
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,180
behave yourselves.

353
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,860
I spoiled them.

354
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
Have a seat.

355
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:12,980
By the way,

356
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,780
you've met the two lords,

357
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,220
but you haven't greeted them yet, have you?

358
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,020
Hello, Yuqin.

359
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,700
Before I came, Mother often asked about you,

360
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,380
and that when you'd return to the capital.

361
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,660
We'll stay here with Father for a while.

362
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,460
Why don't you stay for a few more days?

363
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:27,260
So we can

364
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,700
go back together.

365
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,420
It depends.

366
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:30,860
I'm afraid he can't.

367
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,540
He can't

368
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,380
go back to the capital for now.

369
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,220
He has to finish the patrol under His Majesty's order.

370
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,580
After that, he has to leave with me.

371
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,980
Yuqin and Yulan

372
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,820
know us since we were kids.

373
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,300
We grew up together in the capital.

374
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,860
They came back this time

375
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,300
to celebrate the Chinese New Year with Lord Luo.

376
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,580
Speaking of which,

377
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,100
if we didn't come back to stay with Father,

378
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,820
we wouldn't have had the chance to meet

379
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,940
such a legend like Miss Chun.

380
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,100
Miss Chun.

381
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,900
I'm really curious

382
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,460
how you defend.

383
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,300
I can't even

384
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,420
argue with others.

385
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,050
I can't imagine

386
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,380
how come a girl like you and me

387
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,380
would have the guts to go to a grimy place

388
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,940
like the court?

389
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,540
If it was for your father,

390
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,610
you could have

391
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,500
hired a litigator.

392
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,700
Miss Luo, how could you say that?

393
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,460
Was my sister wrong?

394
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,980
The world is big

395
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,620
but justice matters more.

396
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,100
The court is under the emperor's command

397
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,540
and managed by the officials.

398
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,900
It is the fairest place.

399
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,860
How can you say it's grimy?

400
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,730
Besides,

401
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,860
it's routine for His Majesty to have prison patrol every year.

402
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:44,660
Lord Kang was appointed to be in charge this year.

403
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,060
It shows how much His Majesty cares about this.

404
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,340
Unless you think otherwise?

405
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,980
Speaking of the laws,

406
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,980
His Majesty personally issued them.

407
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,740
Nothing can be done without rules.

408
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,380
If there is no law in this world,

409
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,580
it will be chaotic, won't it?

410
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,780
There will be no difference between our country and the barbarian areas.

411
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:08,020
What you just said

412
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,660
sounds like slander to...

413
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:11,500
I...

414
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,450
You have a sharp perspective.

415
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,540
You should tell these to His Majesty.

416
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:21,380
You two should learn.

417
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,300
Don't always

418
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,780
get stuck in your rooms

419
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,140
and play with the girly stuff.

420
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,940
You learn nothing

421
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,300
but poems and songs all day long.

422
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,420
It's not good for your eyes.

423
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,180
What are you talking about, Father?

424
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,500
You wouldn't even allow me

425
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,700
to get out of my room.

426
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,060
Now you're blaming me

427
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,100
for being ignorant.

428
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,700
My room was my everything,

429
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,660
how could I become eloquent

430
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,220
like Miss Chun?

431
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,340
By the way,

432
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,380
we learned about

433
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,460
Miss Chun's reputation.

434
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,420
So we specially arranged someone

435
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,460
for a shadow play

436
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,020
based on the most famous case in Youzhou recently.

437
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,100
We would like to invite Miss Chun to watch it.

438
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,180
This case

439
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,580
has been bothering the officials here

440
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,940
for a long time.

441
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,740
It's still open.

442
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,540
Miss Chun

443
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,180
must have a good perspective.

444
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,900
Mother,

445
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,220
the rice went bad.

446
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,660
How can I eat it?

447
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,660
Your biological mother died early.

448
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:44,140
For your father's sake,

449
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,420
I feed you and dress you.

450
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,540
What else do you want?

451
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,180
Miss,

452
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,500
come in with me.

453
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,500
No one is around.

454
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,260
It's getting late.

455
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,060
Why don't we...

456
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:19,020
Someone is here.

457
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,620
Mother!

458
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,700
Mother, what are you doing?

459
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,050
Who is he?

460
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,220
How dare you cheat on my father

461
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,660
right in front of him?

462
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,700
Your father is paralyzed in bed.

463
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,420
You can't earn any money.

464
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,260
How can I survive

465
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,980
if I don't find another man?

466
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,340
You unfaithful bitch.

467
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,900
I'll kill you.

468
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,580
It's not over yet.

469
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,020
What happened later

470
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,380
is the best part.

471
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,740
This scholar

472
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,740
killed his stepmother

473
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:55,420
and was sentenced to be beheaded.

474
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,140
But now,

475
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,420
people in the city

476
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,620
have presented a letter with their petitions,

477
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,420
asking the court to change the verdict.

478
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,460
The officers

479
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,740
are in a dilemma.

480
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,170
Actually, it's understandable why he did it.

481
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,540
He could have been hanged to death instead of being beheaded.

482
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,620
But...

483
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,010
A stepmother is also a mother.

484
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,460
Killing one's mother is unfilial.

485
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,340
Besides, the law is serious and solemn.

486
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:19,940
It's not appropriate

487
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,740
to change the verdict just because people made petitions.

488
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,580
So this case

489
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,300
has been in a stalemate ever since.

490
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,260
Miss Chun, you...

491
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:26,900
Tumi,

492
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,460
what do you think?

493
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,540
Lord Han, I'm flattered.

494
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,100
I'm inexperienced.

495
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,380
I don't know much.

496
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,340
I only heard Miss Luo

497
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,820
talking about him being unfilial.

498
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,300
Maybe we can find a solution

499
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,740
from there.

500
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:41,780
Tell us more.

501
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,140
His stepmother

502
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,370
abused and betrayed his father.

503
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,860
She committed one of the Seven Sins.

504
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,500
His father could have divorced her according to the law.

505
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,410
Although his father

506
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,340
can't speak nor move,

507
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,620
as the eldest son,

508
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,300
he could divorce his stepmother on behalf of his father.

509
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,900
His father can't talk,

510
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,620
but he must want this

511
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,860
in his heart.

512
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,740
As for this stepmother,

513
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,810
she's no longer a qualified mother.

514
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,860
Because the moment

515
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,980
she cheated on his father,

516
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,860
she became a stranger to this family.

517
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,540
In this case,

518
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,140
a son did not kill his mother.

519
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,020
It's just an ordinary murder case.

520
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:11,940
In this way,

521
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,660
the fact that him being unfilial is gone,

522
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,380
and the other evidence is solid.

523
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,020
As long as the litigator does his work,

524
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,540
it's absolutely possible

525
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,780
to change the sentence to exile or imprisonment.

526
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:21,740
Miss Luo,

527
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,060
do you get it?

528
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,180
Awesome.

529
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,420
Miss Chun,

530
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,740
you're undoubtedly eloquent

531
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,140
with rigorous logic.

532
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,020
Let me propose a toast to you.

533
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,140
My lord.

534
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,780
My lord, bad news!

535
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,700
The vault was broken in and stolen.

536
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:48,940
What?

537
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,860
What did we lose?

538
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:54,860
It's gone.

539
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,220
All gone.

540
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:56,810
Well...

541
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:00,460
Zheng,

542
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:01,820
something like this happened

543
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,980
at the regional commander's residence.

544
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,900
I think you may have to go.

545
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,420
You're right.

546
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,340
Lord Kang

547
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,540
is in charge of the Criminal Investigation Bureau.

548
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,300
He must be more experienced

549
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,180
dealing with theft

550
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,660
than I am.

551
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,300
Luckily, you're here.

552
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,900
You're welcome, Lord Luo.

553
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,540
This is my duty.

554
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,500
Sorry, everyone,

555
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,260
please forgive me for not entertaining you well.

556
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,500
Don't worry.

557
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,260
Lord Luo, you do what you gotta do.

558
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,540
I'll take them

559
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,620
back.

560
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,460
Lord Luo,

561
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:35,860
according to the rules,

562
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,700
I should go to your vault first.

563
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,460
Okay.

564
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,260
Please wait a moment, Lord Kang.

565
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,420
I'll get the cart ready.

566
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:46,900
Let's go.

567
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,700
Send someone to watch all the gates.

568
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,580
Arrest anyone suspicious

569
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,820
who tries to get out of the city.

570
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,100
Don't let these thieves

571
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:01,900
leave Youzhou.

572
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:02,700
My lord,

573
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,580
why don't we seal the city?

574
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,620
No.

575
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,780
The lockdown is too big a move.

576
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,770
Kang Zhengyuan and Han Wuwei

577
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,980
will immediately notice something went wrong.

578
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,900
But it seems like these two lords

579
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:17,220
are trying to intervene in this case.

580
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,130
It doesn't matter.

581
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,540
They just arrived here.

582
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,700
They are not familiar with

583
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,100
the situation nor the people here.

584
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,060
You can send someone to follow them

585
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,900
and send out some fake information

586
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,980
to distract them.

587
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,260
As long as we

588
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,580
catch the thief and take our things back

589
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,620
before they

590
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,220
find any clues,

591
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,260
we'll leave them no chance to investigate further.

592
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,380
Yes.

593
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:41,980
Father,

594
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:42,820
from tomorrow onwards,

595
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,500
please

596
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,300
don't talk about what happened today

597
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,780
in front of Lord Kang.

598
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,330
Why?

599
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,260
I'm afraid that Lord Kang would ask me for help.

600
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,980
But I can't say no.

601
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,100
Just now at the feast,

602
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,300
I saw the way how they behaved,

603
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:56,370
I really despise them.

604
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,140
I don't want to meddle in their family matters.

605
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:00,780
Okay.

606
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,740
I know.

607
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,540
Plus, it would be difficult

608
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,460
to solve the case.

609
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,140
What I want is to be a litigator.

610
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,860
But if we want to catch the thief,

611
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,740
we'll have to

612
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,900
do the work of a constable.

613
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,580
I'm a girl after all.

614
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,940
So my daughter knows

615
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,660
she's a girl.

616
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:28,900
Go take a look.

617
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,540
Lord Kang.

618
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,380
Good morning, Lord Kang.

619
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,220
Miss Chun.

620
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,140
About last night...

621
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,100
You must be busy with it.

622
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,060
You may be busier later.

623
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,220
I can't help with what happened last night.

624
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,740
But you can leave me

625
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,340
the case files of the Criminal Justice Bureau here.

626
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,700
I'll do my best to review them.

627
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,420
Okay.

628
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,380
Since you don't want to get involved,

629
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,460
I won't ask for more.

630
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,780
As long as it's within my duty,

631
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,100
I won't refuse.

632
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,340
I will

633
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,780
do my best to review the files.

634
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:05,620
Okay.

635
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:22,150
[Robbery]

636
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:26,000
[Reviewed and everything is clear.]

637
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:36,080
[Bian Wenli]

638
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,460
Young Master,

639
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,290
you're having another poison attack.

640
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,420
It's okay. You go first.

641
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,500
No, let's go together.

642
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:35,900
White Ghost!

643
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,020
Young Master.

644
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:38,900
Take him and leave.

645
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,740
Yes, Young Master.

646
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,500
I'm not leaving.

647
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,620
Long time no see.

648
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:26,260
Yaksha.

649
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,820
You must be curious about how I know you?

650
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,340
You probably don't know

651
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,100
I was there

652
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,020
at the Supreme Court battle.

653
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,500
The scene of that battle

654
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,660
is still fresh and vivid now I think about it.

655
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:38,540
Well,

656
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,620
you came here from Bianzhou,

657
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,900
is it me that you're after?

658
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:46,700
Your Highness.

659
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,580
Stop there.

660
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,900
Leave us.

661
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:27,380
Your Highness.

662
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:28,940
Go get him.

663
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,260
Yes.

664
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,500
He ran this way.

665
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:58,780
No matter how skilled he is,

666
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,500
he can't go far with injury.

667
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,380
Go!

668
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:03,740
Let's go. Yes.

669
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,220
My lady,

670
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,780
are you done?

671
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,540
I can take a break for now.

672
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,980
It's a great day today.

673
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:30,860
Is it?

674
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,380
Let's go out for a walk.

675
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,500
Let's go hiking in the mountains where you've always wanted

676
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,260
and enjoy the scenery.

677
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,660
You are the best.

678
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,500
Go tell Father.

679
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,380
If he agrees,

680
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,140
we'll set out.

681
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,180
Okay.

682
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,940
Lord Kang and Lord Han

683
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,340
are busy with the theft case these days.

684
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,940
Master is with them,

685
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,700
he won't have time to mind your business.

686
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,500
In that case,

687
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:51,780
let's go now.

688
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,650
[Xi Liu Pavilion]

689
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:23,900
Guo, come here.

690
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,500
If it is properly repaired and maintained,

691
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,900
it will become a place

692
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,700
for poets and writers.

693
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,500
You're right.

694
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,140
My lady,

695
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,580
this place is so beautiful.

696
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,220
Look over there.

697
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,300
The mountains and water are all green.

698
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,380
I just saw

699
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,780
many water birds.

700
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,020
Some are white.

701
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,300
Some have colors.

702
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,260
They flew from the water

703
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,580
and they flew so high.

704
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,740
When we were in Bianzhou,

705
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,770
we also went out a lot.

706
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,420
But I've never seen this.

707
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:59,380
I've never seen this before.

708
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:00,700
I've only seen it in the painting.

709
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,970
But the sun is going down.

710
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,820
I wish we could stay a little longer.

711
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,860
You're right.

712
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,820
We should go back.

713
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,100
Otherwise, if it's getting late,

714
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,660
they will worry.

715
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,260
It's fine.

716
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,260
Let's stay a little longer.

717
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,420
When I came here,

718
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,660
I saw people taking the path here.

719
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:18,890
Let's take a shortcut and go back.

720
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,860
I've seen this tree for

721
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:44,730
the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth times.

722
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,060
Why are we back here again?

723
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:47,820
My lady,

724
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,820
is this the shortcut you were talking about?

725
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,940
Don't worry.

726
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,420
Someone must have walked this way.

727
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,540
It's just that we didn't come here often,

728
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:55,580
so we don't know much around here.

729
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,020
Let's make a mark first.

730
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,020
Oh no.

731
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,260
What if we get lost?

732
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:04,420
Once it gets dark,

733
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,780
we can tell directions

734
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,010
after the Dubhe and Merak come out.

735
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,620
Stop sighing.

736
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,660
There's always a way.

737
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,420
Let's go.

738
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:16,740
My lady,

739
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,620
why are you having this stick?

740
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,420
This is to beat the grass and frighten away the snake.

741
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,780
We are in a mountain,

742
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,100
what if there are snakes?

743
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,140
My Lady, there's a snake!

744
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:25,820
Where?

745
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,780
Don't turn around.

746
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,100
Which side?

747
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,420
On your left.

748
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,780
My lady.

749
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,100
My lady.

750
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:57,740
I can't lose.

751
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,580
I can't lose.

752
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,540
Guo.

753
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,340
Guo.

754
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,940
Guo.

755
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,220
Guo.

756
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:50,700
Ye.

757
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,060
Ye.

758
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,699
Ye.

759
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,179
Ye.

760
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,219
Ye.

761
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,020
Hang in there.

762
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:25,690
Be careful.

763
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:35,820
Ye,

764
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,380
what happened to you?

765
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,100
I'll get you some water.

766
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,060
Wait for me.

767
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,260
Here.

768
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,900
Have some food.

769
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,740
Get some strength.

770
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,220
Here.

771
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,540
Eat slowly. Don't choke yourself.

772
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:03,940
My Lady.

773
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,860
My Lady, where are you?

774
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,300
My Lady.

775
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,460
You don't want others to know

776
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,340
you are here.

777
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,180
My Lady, where are you?

778
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,220
How about this?

779
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,580
My Lady.

780
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:17,890
I'll hide you there.

781
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,220
I'll come to visit you tomorrow.

782
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,410
Let's go. Let me help you.

783
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,060
My Lady.

784
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,700
Get up, Ye.

785
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,340
Come.

786
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,340
Be careful.

787
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,220
Over there.

788
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:53,580
Be careful.

789
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:56,940
Hide yourself well.

790
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,450
I'll come to visit you tomorrow.

791
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:24,660
That was dangerous.

792
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,380
I've been looking for you for so long.

793
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,260
Luckily, you didn't get hurt.

794
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,500
Otherwise, I wouldn't know

795
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,740
what to say to Master Chun.

796
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,060
Next time,

797
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,060
I dare not go out with you again.

798
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:35,780
Guo,

799
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,060
I'm a little tired.

800
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,100
Rest early, my lady.

801
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,180
Who was the man

802
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:54,700
that was with you last night?

803
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,180
Ye.

804
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,460
When did you meet?

805
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,580
Last month.

806
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,620
What does he do?

807
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,460
He's a carter.

808
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,220
Do you know

809
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,500
any carter who's so good with martial arts?

810
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:03,380
No, I don't.

811
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,300
Well,

812
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,980
it's normal

813
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,020
for people to know some to survive in Jianghu, in this pugilistic society.

814
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:10,820
Looks like it's true that Ye

815
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,300
is more than just a carter.
