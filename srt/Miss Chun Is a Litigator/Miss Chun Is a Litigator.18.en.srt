The dead man

39
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,300
was my distant cousin.

40
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,420
I'm the owner of this house.

41

For the sake of my relatives,

45
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,220

Unexpectedly,

47
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,780
he went to eat, drink, see a prostitute, gamble

48
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,500
and owed a lot of money.

49
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,970
A few days ago,

50
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:36,980
he came to me

51
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,420
and asked me to pay his debt.

52
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:39,940
I didn't agree.

53
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,740
He threatened me

54
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,020
if I didn't give the money to him,

55
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,900
he'd hang himself in front of our house

56
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,860
and made me suffer

57
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,579
and let my son take the fall,

58
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,500
blocking his way to the office.

59
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,900
I took it for granted.

60
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,940
But he really...

61
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,130
What should we do?

62
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:00,540
There's no sign of a struggle

63
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,460
on this body.

64
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,540
I think he's just trying to scare you.

65
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,220
But he hung himself.

66
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,460
-Yes. -That's right. That's right.

67
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:05,940
That's right.

what should we do?

71

Since it has nothing to do with you,

72
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,260
then report it to the government.

73

Let them find out what happened and clear your name.

74

No, no, no.

75

No, we can't report it.

If we do,

78
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:21,019

Since it has nothing to do with you,

82
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,260
why would it affect your son?

83
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,380
Gossip is a fearing thing.

84
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,100
I'm telling the truth.

Please help me.

86
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,900
Don't report it to the government.

99

You did everything you could for your nephew.

100
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,820
It's just that he wasn't grateful

101
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,380
and took it for granted.

102
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:03,420
When you decided to let go,

103
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,940
he thought he had lost out

104
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,500
and wanted to pull you on his back.

105

How can a man with no conscience

106
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,180
be so righteous?

107
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,340
It's all my fault.

108
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,740
It's all my fault.

If I hadn't been soft-hearted,

This had nothing to do with you.

114

Go stop him at the intersection.

Tell him

119
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,660
we want to talk about this privately.

120
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,820
But he won't be short-changed.

121
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,740
Don't let him in.

122

Yes, yes, yes.

No.

133

It's just me and my wife.

134
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,180
I think no one saw it.

135

Otherwise,

136
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,300
he must have reported it to the government.

143
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,980
Did the cut mark come before?

144
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,810
I didn't see it yesterday.

145
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:26,700
Is that knife yours too?

146

No.

There will be no firewood knife.

Did anyone see you

152

when you were talking to him?

153
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,740
I ran down the alley

154
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,740
to the Toothman.

155
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,220
No one should have seen me

156
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,140
back and forth.

157
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,420
I can help you.

158
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,980
Will you do what I say?

159
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,140
Okay, okay, okay.

160
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,380
You must be careful.

161
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,300
Remember.

162

Don't let anyone see you.

When people hang themselves,

164
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,420
their body will struggle instinctively,

165

plus their weight,

166
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,420
there will be marks on the door beam.

167
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,780
So when you tie the rope again,

[Feng Mansion]

make sure it matches the impression.

170
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,100
The edge of the rope

171
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,020
should also be straight.

172

And then get rid of the chair.

You can't hide in this house.

When you have done this,

and pretend not to know anything about it.

Tomorrow morning,

182
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,740
someone will find the hanged body

and report it to the government.

184

His Majesty will come for you.

185
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,700
You have to tell him you don't know.

186
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,180
You can talk about

187
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:32,860
your nephew's vendetta against you.

188
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:33,659
But...

189
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,100
You can't say anything

190
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:35,900
about him threatening to

191
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,020
hang himself on your doorstep.

192
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,820
It's only when the Yamen found you

193
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,330
that you found him hanged.

194
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,260
You do what I say.

195
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,180
He'll have two strangulation marks

196
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,180
on his neck,

197
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,180
one deep and one shallow.

198
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,300
The second one

199
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,020
is the key to your clearance of suspicion.

200
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,340
Because a dead man

201
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,700
cannot hang himself twice.

202
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,659
So there must be

203
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,700
a third person out there

204
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,060
trying to frame you,

205
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,260
which can prove that you're innocent.

206
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,860
But he killed himself.

207
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:02,660
Yes.

208
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:03,780
So the Yamen

209
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,860
couldn't find a third person.

210
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,780
But you are innocent.

211
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,020
In which case,

212
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,340
they'll have to release you in court.

213
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,020
This case would be

214
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,020
a minor cold case.

215
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,940
You said your nephew had no family,

216
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,180
so no one will sue.

217
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,620
Over time,

218
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,660
it'll get lost

219
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,700
in the daily grind.

220
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,100
You are very smart.

221
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,290
You've cleared us of all wrongs

222
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,900
and saved us from all worries.

223
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,220
We don't know

224
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,100
what to say.

225
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,020
You're welcome.

226
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,060
But there's one more thing

227
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:31,780
you need to remember.

228
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,299
You have to talk about

229
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:35,380
our meeting today.

230
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:36,740
But when we were talking,

231
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,140
we didn't see any dead people.

232
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,419
Do you understand?

233
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:40,620
I...

234
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:43,980
I understand. I understand.

235
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:45,860
Let's go.

236
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,700
My lady.

237
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,060
Do you really believe them?

238
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,780
The knife marks on the door

239
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,820
look fresh.

240
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,260
You think Mr. Feng needs a knife

241
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,260
to get back to his house?

242
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,020
So...

243
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,460
Mr. Feng's nephew

244
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,730
must have hacked the door

245
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,900
to break into the Feng's house.

246
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,340
His nephew tried to scare him

247
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,020
by hanging himself,

248
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,180
so they couldn't sell the house.

249
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,060
Unexpectedly,

250
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,420
he hanged himself.

251
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,500
Well, what law did you use

252
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,820
to get Mrs. Feng

253
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,660
to restore the crime scene.

254
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,060
It's not the law. It's the antilaw.

255
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,140
Think of it as dark justice.

256
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,260
You can't get rid of

257
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,660
this kind of blackmailer.

258
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,820
And it's even worse when they bite the hand that feeds them.

259
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:30,620
Yes.

260
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,500
But...

261
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,860
You are really amazing.

262
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,700
I still have the shivers

263
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,140
in my legs.

264

How do you know I don't shiver?

265
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,020
I'm just not like you.

266
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,140
I didn't say it.

267
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,060
I...

268
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,380

may be wrongly died

So,

277
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,050
I've discussed it with my wife

278
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,500
to give the house

279
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,860
to your family.

280

But...

281
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,060
I'm afraid you'll dislike it.

282
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,180
After all, there was a dead man.

283
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,860
It's really unlucky.

However,

your son is a military official.

286

And I heard that

287

you used to be a government official.

288
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,260

to keep the evil spirits at bay.

So...

Anyway,

292

That's right. That's right.

The Chun family does good deeds.

307

Why would they fear those dirty things?

308

Instead, they should take a detour.

00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,020
He is worried about you.

347
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,580
Can you take responsibility

348
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,980
for Xiao Li's safety?

349
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,620
Let me tell you.

350
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,740
If anyone dares to hurt my sister,

351
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,300
I'll kill you! Get lost!

352
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,060
Let's go.

353
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:09,900
How is it?

354
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,020
Did you catch him?

355
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,340
No one showed up.

356
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,700
I told you.

357
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,020
People in Mowu Pavilion are very cautious.

358
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,330
Without me as the bait,

359
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,660
I wouldn't have lured them out.

360
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,980
At this point,

361
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,860
you should tell me the truth.

362
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,220
Who are you

363
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,860
at Mowu Pavilion?

364
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,020
Why did Mowu Pavilion

365
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,460
want to kill you?

366
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,820
You want the truth?

367
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,590
I'm the daughter of Juzi,

368
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,260
Mowu Pavilion's young lady.

369
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,020
Mowu Pavilion made an enemy of the court.

370
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,900
If you were the daughter of the Juzi,

371
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,140
why do you dare to stay with me?

372
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,020
Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you

373
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,060
and destroy Mowu Pavilion?

374
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,100
If the court can really destroy Mowu Pavilion,

375
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,620
you wouldn't have to wait until now.

376
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,500
For decades,

377
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:22,940
you didn't even find

378
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,170
any trace of us.

379
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:25,740
Besides,

380
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,300
since ancient times,

381
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,740
fighting and killing

382
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,340
should have reasons.

383
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:31,940
His Majesty

384
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,380
is a law-abiding man.

385
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:34,860
I'm afraid

386
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,020
you don't even have

387
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,660
a shred of evidence

388
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,380
that we're against the court.

389
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,780
If you send troops to eliminate us,

390
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,180
the world will laugh you.

391
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,780
Little girl.

392
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,380
You have a lot of excuses.

393
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,570
Who told you that?

394
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,250
Well...

395
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:06,740
It's none of your business.

396
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,300
In that case,

397
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,100
why are you still willing to tell me

398
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,300
the secret of Mowu Pavilion?

399
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,940
To me,

400
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,740
Mowu Pavilion is just a place of filth.

401
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,540
That place is no longer my home.

402
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,300
I know a big secret

403
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,220
in the pavilion.

404
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,180
No one wants me to live.

405
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,220
But it has nothing to do with you.

406
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,180
You just need to know

407
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,300
I want to destroy the Mowu Pavilion

408
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,540
more than anyone.

409
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,660
Is that true?

410
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:50,500
Yes.

411
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,300
Okay.

412
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,140
What?

413
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,140
I'll marry you.

414
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,260
Marrying Ayili

415
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,420
is indeed a good idea.

416
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,660
But your mission this time is the inkstone.

417
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,940
Don't waste your time

418
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,380
to deal with Mowu Pavilion.

419
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,940
What if His Majesty blames us...

420
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,540
I've already told His Majesty

421
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,420
about this.

422
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,820
The emperor should be cautious, or he'll lose the support of officials.

423
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,740
The officials should be cautious, or they'll lose their lives.

424
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,380
Things in progress will fail if they are not careful.

425
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,100
Zheng.

426
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,300
I've told you everything.

427
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,540
As for the rest,

428
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,780
I'll explain to you

429
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,300
when everything is settled.

430
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,620
I don't have to ask.

431
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,300
But there's one thing

432
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,100
you need to think about it in advance.

433
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,740
What is it?

434
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,740
Do you remember you told me

435
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,420
that Tumi is special to Yaksha?

436
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,580
Tumi is a rare talent.

437
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:47,180
Yaksha is the assassin of Mowu Pavilion.

438
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,100
I don't want her

439
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,380
to be affected.

440
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,660
She was partial to Yaksha

441
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,100
because she didn't know

442
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,100
who Yaksha was.

443
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,220
You just need to tell her

444
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,540
Yaksha is a killer

445
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,140
and a criminal.

446
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,660
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

447
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,460
Although Tumi has

448
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,339
a unique understanding of law,

449
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,500
she's a human being.

450
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,460
Yaksha saved her life.

451
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:12,740
Just like Ayili

452
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:13,859
saved your life.

453
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:15,460
Now you are anxious

454
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,859
to set a trap with your marriage.

455
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:18,380
Is it really because of

456
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:19,339
the necessary situation

457
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:20,780
or because

458
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,900
you want to protect Ayili?

459
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,420
I'm talking about Tumi.

460
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,980
Why did you talk about me again?

461
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,010
Ayili and Yaksha

462
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:28,580
are different.

463
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,460
I have to protect her now.

464
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,340
And I can't explain it to you now.

465
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:36,900
Anyway,

466
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,660
you're not the only one who wants to help Tumi.

467
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,540
I will find a way.

468
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,420
I'll support whatever you want to do.

469
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,610
But there's just one thing.

470
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,620
The peace of you and Tumi

471
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,780
is the most important thing for me.

472
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,730
Lord Han.

473
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:06,300
What are you doing here?

474
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,580
Lord Kang said

475
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,620
you helped us

476
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,500
a lot

477
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,340
in discharging from the military.

478
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,140
So I was thinking

479
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,100
I should thank you in person.

480
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:12,980
It's nothing.

481
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,300
You just did

482
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,290
what you should do.

483
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,060
We did what we should do.

484
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,580
Lord Han seems to have something on his mind today.

485
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,260
How do you know?

486
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,300
In the past,

487
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,900
Lord Han would make jokes.

488
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,860
But he looked so serious today.

489
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,460
What would I say

490
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:33,940
in the past?

491
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,860
In the past,

492
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,580
you would say

493
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,140
little girl,

494
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,780
I can't believe you managed to

495
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,450
discharge from the military.

496
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,780
I do have something to ask you.

497
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,700
Just say it.

498
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,570
The person

499
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,260
who has been helping you in Bianzhou

500
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,620
and the person

501
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,060
who saved your life in Youzhou

502
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,620
are the same person, right?

503
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:07,900
I'm confident

504
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,260
if I told you.

505
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,420
You don't have to answer me.

506
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,740
So you are trying to say

507
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:15,820
what you wanted to say

508
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,500
has already been said in Bianzhou.

509
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,020
Are you trying to persuade me

510
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,300
to stay away from him?

511
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,380
Tumi.

512
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,300
Things have changed.

513
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,700
You didn't listen

514
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,580
what I said back then.

515
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:29,980
But now I want you to

516
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:30,930
listen to me once.

517
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,100
You once told me

518
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,540
this man was a kind man.

519
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,420
And he's good.

520
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,260
But you don't know him.

521
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,380
His background is complicated.

522
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,700
He's not like you.

523
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,180
Even if he treats you really well,

524
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,620
he will become your rival

525
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,180
because of different standpoints.

526
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,220
If you are too close, you will be hurt.

527
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,980
Why don't you just take care of yourselves?

528
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,540
Lord Han is right.

529
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,100
But I have my own ideas.

530
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,140
Lord Han,

531
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,780
is it our choice

532
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,140
to meet by chance?

533
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,020
No,

534
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,580
neither is understanding.

535
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,330
I don't think

536
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,380
he's a good man for no reason.

537
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,820
But because I went through

538
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,060
some things with him.

539
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,820
I can understand him

540
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,140
because I saw it

541
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,460
and felt it.

542
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,380
So I wanted to protect him.

543
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,580
I didn't do it on impulse.

544
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,060
I understand what you mean.

545
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,180
But the situation has changed.

546
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,700
It's different

547
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,460
in Youzhou.

548
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,540
If I choose someone,

549
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,500
I won't change my mind

550
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,620
with the situation.

551
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,500
Okay.

552
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,260
Let me ask you.

553
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,940
You value the law so much.

554
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:47,940
If one day

555
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,090
you are a soldier, but he is a thief.

556
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,620
You stand in the court

557
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,540
with four words hanging over your head.

558
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,540
But you can't defend him.

559
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,660
You must condemn him.

560
00:20:56,450 --> 00:20:57,540
Will you still be so determined?

561
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,980
What would you do then?

562
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,260
At that time,

563
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,260
I'll check if he's guilty.

564
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,380
If he is guilty,

565
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,260
he's the main culprit

566
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,260
or accomplice?

567
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:08,460
And then?

568
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,980
Then let the law decide.

569
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,540
That's it?

570
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,340
Don't you regret it?

571
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,620
There are still favors outside the law.

572
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:18,660
I know

573
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,300
what kind of person he is.

574
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,260
So instead of resentment,

575
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,580
we should fight for the truth.

576
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,180
If both of us

577
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,100
have a clear conscience,

578
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,020
even if we join the army,

579
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,420
I want to bear it with him.

580
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,020
The situation

581
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:31,900
and the stance have changed.

582
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,340
But people never change.

583
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,300
As long as

584
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,100
I’m determined,

585
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,220
no matter how hard it is,

586
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,820
or no one understands,

587
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,460
I'll stick to it.

588
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,380
You're really stubborn.

589
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,620
And you've thought it through.

590
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,780
Lord Han is a man of the heart and the soul.

591
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:57,860
So I think

592
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,220
you must understand.

593
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,660
I would rather not.

594
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,180
Forget it.

595
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,900
Think about it.

596
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:11,700
I won't say anything else.

597
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:12,980
Just promise me that

598
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,540
don't do anything dangerous.

599
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:16,940
Okay.

600
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,500
Ye, what are you doing here?

601
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,460
Today is the 15th.

602
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,060
Yes.

603
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,540
We need to set off lanterns on the 15th.

604
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,140
Ye, please sit down.

605
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,340
Ye.

606
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,260
These are Luoyang snacks.

607
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,500
You're just in time.

608
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,300
I specially prepared this for you.

609
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,300
Try it.

610
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,260
And this.

611
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,620
Wait.

612
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,820
Guess what this is.

613
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,060
I can't guess.

614
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,330
After brushing jasmine,

615
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,220
and flushing the boiled water in,

616
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,340
it's just a cup of honey water.

617
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,180
It's so sweet.

618
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,180
Have a try.

619
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:27,730
Is it good?

620
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,500
It's sweet.

621
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:32,500
By the way,

622
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:34,740
this is for you.

623
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:35,980
What is this?

624
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,500
Open it.

625
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,380
What a beautiful hairpin.

626
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,460
Do you like it?

627
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,020
And this.

628
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,380
This is cleanser.

629
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,860
How did you get it?

630
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,860
I just took a stroll.

631
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,740
Ye, you're amazing.

632
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:05,940
When I went to the shop,

633
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,300
the shopkeeper said it was sent to the palace.

634
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,580
You can go and take a look and buy it.

635
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,020
If you don't like it,

636
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,180
give it back to me.

637
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,540
There's no reason to take it back

638
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,780
after you gave it to me.

639
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,780
You just said

640
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,180
we're gonna lift the lantern on the 15th?

641
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,540
Well...

642
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,340
I'll show you around.

643
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,260
Sure.

644
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,260
Let's go.

645
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,140
Let's go.

646
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,820
What wish did you make?

647
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,100
What about you?

648
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,620
I won't tell you.

649
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,060
Just keep it to yourself.

650
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,020
Tumi,

651
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,780
I need to go out.

652
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,460
Go out again?

653
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,340
Have you finished

654
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,340
your last errand?

655
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:23,140
No.

656
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,820
This is an urgent matter.

657
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,740
In a few days,

658
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,020
or a few months,

659
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,460
I'll be back as soon as possible.

660
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,500
Do I look good?

661
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,420
I spent so much money

662
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,460
in making it.

663
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,810
Of course it looks good.

664
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,620
After this,

665
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,380
you can take these jewels

666
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,140
with you.

667
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,060
Consider it a gift from me.

668
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,340
I don't want it.

669
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,100
When I get married,

670
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,140
I can only accept

671
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,380
the jewels from the one who treats me sincerely.

672
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,900
But when I met someone who truly treats me,

673
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,340
these formalities

674
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,860
are not important.

675
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,580
If I treat you with my heart,

676
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,780
after we worship the heaven and earth,

677
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,700
and our parents,

678
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,170
we'll be together forever.

679
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,220
I don't have parents.

680
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,620
I only have my father.

681
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,580
Rumor has it that

682
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,820
he was cruel

683
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:26,980
and killed the innocent.

684
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,020
Nonsense.

685
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,100
My father

686
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,660
is the best person in the world.

687
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:45,860
Where did you

688
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,140
hear these nonsense?

689
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,530
I just heard it from others.

690
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,140
Three people become a tiger.

691
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,260
How can you say things

692
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:54,260
like this

693
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,380
when you haven't seen them yourself?

694
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,380
Because of these

695
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,500
irresponsible people,

696
00:27:59,260 --> 00:27:59,660
my father

697
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,980
was misunderstood by so many people.

698
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,460
I lost my mother when I was young.

699
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,260
My father has been taking care of me.

700
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,420
He taught me to read and write.

701
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,380
And he taught me medicine.

702
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:18,780
No matter how complicated things are

703
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,210
in the pavilion,

704
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,540
he found time

705
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,940
to be with me every day,

706
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:26,740
teach me,

707
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,340
and encourage me.

708
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,900
How can such a good father

709
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,340
be the innocent killer

710
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,580
you say he is?

711
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,900
Your father treated you so well.

712
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,260
My father

713
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,740
gave me a lot of

714
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,060
money,

715
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,300
reputation,

716
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,140
and status.

717
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,580
But he gave me no company and recognition.

718
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,780
He was always busy with work.

719
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,540
So since I was young,

720
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,940
I can only work very hard

721
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,220
to do everything well,

722
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,700
so as to get

723
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,220
his approval.

724
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,580
But every time I made progress,

725
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,140
I can never achieve

726
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,020
his praise.

727
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,660
He only has endless requirements for me.

728
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,140
He wants me to be excellent and work harder

729
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,020
and harder.

730
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:50,980
It seems that

731
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,940
both of you are the same.

732
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,100
Who?

733
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,700
He's the one who you've been looking for, right?

734
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,300
You're going to marry me,

735
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,220
but you still think about others.

736
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,140
I'm not really marrying you.

737
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,740
Besides,

738
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,620
how can you compare with him?

739
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,980
You admire him so much?

740
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,700
I must meet him

741
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,900
if I get the chance.

742
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:35,400
[Han Mansion]

743
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,260
There you are.

744
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,140
Congratulations.

745
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,100
Please come in.

746
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,020
Okay. Come on, come on.

747
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:33,820
Please, please.

748
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,780
Okay.

749
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,890
[Han Mansion]

750
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,500
Congratulations.

751
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:39,060
Congratulations.

752
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:39,660
Congratulations.

753
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:40,620
Congratulations.

754
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,500
Come in, please.

755
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,740
Is it true?

756
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:44,740
Yes.

757
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:45,980
I've sent someone to check out

758
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,660
the side lady's custom dress shop.

759
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:48,780
The wedding dress size

760
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,220
is exactly the same as Her Ladyship.

761
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,580
Do it when you're ready.

762
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,300
Hurry up.

763
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,260
Yes.

764
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,300
Should I inform the young master to come back?

765
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,300
No need.

766
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,140
Juzi didn't want the Young Master to get involved.

767
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,500
I will report to Juzi

768
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,540
before making plans.

769
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,740
You may leave.

770
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:09,940
Yes.

771
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,980
No wonder I couldn’t buy the red cloth

772
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,580
and the red paper.

773
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,420
I'm afraid all the goods in Luoyang

774
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,900
must have been transported

775
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,940
to Lord Han's villa.

776
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,340
It's obvious that there's a happy event.

777
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:26,540
Someone is getting married

778
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,620
in Lord Han's villa?

779
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,260
Please wait, Lord Kang.

780
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,380
I'll see myself out.

781
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,580
Lord Kang.

782
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,300
Tumi.

783
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,740
How is everything going at home?

784
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,690
Thanks to you,

785
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,580
everything goes well.

786
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,660
Why don't you rest for a few more days?

787
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,220
Why are you in such a hurry to come back to work?

788
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,860
Lord Kang is so considerate of me.

789
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,220
When I was away,

790
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,090
you were so busy.

791
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:58,860
Those who came to visit you

792
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,660
were Luoyang officials?

793
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:01,980
Yes.

794
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,300
We need to discuss something.

795
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,620
I can start reading the files now.

796
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,780
What can I do for you?

797
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:07,660
Tumi.

798
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:08,900
Luoyang

799
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,220
is the last stop of the patrol.

800
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,940
The files are very simple.

801
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:15,660
I don't think you need to come.

802
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,540
How about this?

803
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:19,980
I didn't expect

804
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,860
the patrol would end so quickly.

805
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,700
Although the patrol is over,

806
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,220
you can do

807
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,540
whatever you want.

808
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,220
I want to stay in Luoyang as a litigator.

809
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:30,860
Okay.

810
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,580
Your father

811
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,540
is also working nearby.

812
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,540
It's safer for you to stay here.

813
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:37,700
By the way, Lord Kang,

814
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,140
I wrote a contract.

815
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,020
I borrowed a set of law books

816
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,100
from Lord Han.

817
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,660
And I promised to return it after the patrol.

818
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:43,860
Well...

819
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,420
You can talk to him later.

820
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,700
He went out?

821
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,980
I saw lanterns in the mansion,

822
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,060
so you're going to get married?

823
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,540
Yes.

824
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:55,900
Lord Han is going to have a concubine.

825
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,140
Concubine?

826
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,460
That's

827
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,740
a pretty big deal.

828
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:00,700
He didn't mention it

829
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,140
during the patrol.

830
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,220
Wuwei's condition

831
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,340
has relapsed.

832
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,700
He's still recuperating in the room.

833
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,740
When he recovers,

834
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,340
you can ask him face to face.

835
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:11,940
Only he

836
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,460
can explain it himself.

837
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,700
My lady, what's wrong?

838
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,500
Guo.

839
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,380
If someone tells you

840
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,460
he's going on a long trip,

841
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,380
but he didn't leave

842
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:33,490
and he avoided you.

843
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,420
Why?

844
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,620
Maybe,

845
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,900
he doesn't want to see you.

846
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,100
Or,

847
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,500
he has something to hide from you.

848
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,410
He has something to hide from me?

849
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:53,320
[Wenying Pavilion]

850
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,180
Tumi, you must be tired.

851
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,660
Sit down and have some soup.

852
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,020
What's the arrangement for the patrol?

853
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,420
Lord Kang said the patrol was almost over.

854
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,500
By the way, grandfather,

855
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,460
I heard that

856
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,820
Lord Han wanted to have a concubine.

857
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,060
It'll be too late to prepare a gift.

858
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,020
Do you have anything

859
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,699
that can be delivered?

860
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,300
Concubine?

861
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,460
How could Lord Han

862
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,900
be so absurd?

863
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:17,780
It's indeed a bit hasty.

864
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:18,860
But a concubine

865
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,860
is not a legitimate wife.

866
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:21,260
It's not ridiculous.

867
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,139
You don't understand.

868
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,820
People like Lord Han

869
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,940
has an imperial edict.

870
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,380
He was ordered to protect the guards.

871
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:32,500
It's inappropriate to marry

872
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,139
in the middle of the wedding.

873
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:37,100
If someone tells on him

874
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,409
and he gets fired,

875
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:40,980
it would be a disgrace

876
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,940
and neglect official duties.

877
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,060
Lord Han is

878
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,580
a little casual,

879
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:50,420
but he's kind of tolerant.

880
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,580
Why?

881
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,580
Is there anything special about her?

882
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,820
When I left the villa,

883
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,180
I asked around.

884
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,180
They said the concubine

885
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,060
was born into

886
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,620
a mysterious society.

887
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,300
But until now,

888
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,620
no one has seen her.

889
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,580
A woman of the world?

890
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:11,700
Well...

891
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,460
That's even more inappropriate.

892
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:15,740
It's not appropriate to hear that.

893
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,460
Lord Han has always been willful.

894
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,940
But Lord Kang shouldn't

895
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,620
let him do whatever he wants.

896
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,860
Is there another reason?

897
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:33,980
I need to go out.

898
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,260
Go out again?

899
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:38,020
Did you finish

900
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:38,980
your last errand?

901
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:39,700
No.

902
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,220
This is an urgent matter.

903
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,300
It needs a few days,

904
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,620
or a few months.

905
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,580
Is Ye's task

906
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,140
related to Lord Han?

907
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,220
No, I have to check it out.

908
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,740
Don't go.

909
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,100
You lied to me.

910
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,780
That night

911
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:39,540
I told you a lot,

912
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:40,780
but you didn’t take it to heart.

913
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,220
Tumi.

914
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,380
We can't stay here for long.

915
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,780
I'll explain it to you later.

916
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,820
If you enter Han Mansion with a weapon,

917
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,140
you'll either be caught or killed.

918
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,860
You can be mad at me,

919
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,820
but I must go today.

920
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,980
I'm not trying to stop you.

921
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,100
I want to go with you.

922
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:57,780
Let's go.

923
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:58,860
Let's go now.

924
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,460
I'll take you to Han Mansion.

925
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,100
But you have to tell me

926
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:10,740
what you want to do.

927
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:13,100
Tumi,

928
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,180
you are a good citizen.

929
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,210
You have a father

930
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:17,140
and grandfather.

931
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,220
I don't want you to

932
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,060
get involved in my business.

933
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,500
I've already been involved.

934
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,340
You didn't say anything.

935
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,380
Can't you be honest

936
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,340
to me once?

937
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,100
It is so hard for you to tell the truth?

938
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,140
My worrying

939
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,580
and ignoring my father's instructions are harder

940
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,620
than waiting for you day and night?

941
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,860
The person Han Wuwei's gonna marry

942
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,180
is my sister.

943
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,980
I came from Mowu Pavilion.

944
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,380
I'm the son of the leader.

945
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,780
I lost my mother since I was young.

946
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,740
I can't see my father easily.

947
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:54,820
In his eyes,

948
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,340
I'm not his son.

949
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,460
I'm just his fastest knife.

950
00:37:59,140 --> 00:37:59,860
Since young,

951
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,820
I only lived with my sister.

952
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,620
I don't know why

953
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,500
this time she left the home

954
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,660
and stayed with Han Wuwei.

955
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:07,740
Mowu Pavilion and the court

956
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,940
have always been on different sides.

957
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,780
It has been on bad terms with each other in recent years.

958
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,570
Han Wuwei didn't want to marry her,

959
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,180
but to kill her.

960
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:20,620
This is my life.

961
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,540
Today,

962
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,500
no matter what,

963
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,460
I'll save her.

964
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,940
I won't stop you from saving your sister.

965
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:29,460
But...

966
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,220
When you settle down,

967
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,860
come back to me.

968
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:34,660
Okay.

969
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:35,820
Sure.
