4
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,900
Sir.

5
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,780
Why are you here?

6
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,370
I was just passing by.

7
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:33,620
Well,

8
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,860
can you help me get inside?

9
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,660
Come up.

10
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,060
Come down.

11
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,660
Let me help you.

12
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:27,100
Thank you.

13
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,300
My surname is Ye.

14
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,820
I'll inform Lord Han.

15
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,579
Keep an eye on him.

16
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:57,820
Yes.

17
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,660
Be careful, it's hot.

18
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,060
Look at the wooden shelf.

19
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,100
Judging from the way it is, someone broke it again

20
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,220
before it was fixed.

21
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,820
Is this fabric?

22
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,580
What is the stain

23
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,540
on it?

24
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,700
It's blood.

25
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,380
Human blood.

26
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,659
How can you smell that?

27
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,380
Ye,

28
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,780
you know a lot.

29
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:58,940
Can you help me check

30
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,780
if there're other bloodstains

31
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,460
in the kitchen?

32
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,420
Okay.

33
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,340
No, there isn't.

34
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:31,740
That means

35
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,500
someone came in through the window.

36
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,940
He didn't notice this,

37
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,020
bumped into the shelf,

38
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,180
and got hooked by the wooden stick.

39
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,900
And he was injured.

40
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,450
So there was blood on the fabric.

41
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,140
But

42
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,500
we don't know

43
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,659
when he came in.

44
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,180
Without a timeline,

45
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,940
Scholar Sun won't admit it.

46
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,180
Within the last three days.

47
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,020
This wooden stick

48
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,500
has a fresh smell of blood.

49
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,540
It means it got stained within the last three days.

50
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,940
The day of the incident was the 24th.

51
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,460
Today is the 26th.

52
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,420
That's right.

53
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,420
Ye,

54
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,260
can you help me to take it off?

55
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,020
This is an important exhibit.

56
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,460
Your house is right in the front.

57
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,660
I've gotta go.

58
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,020
Ye.

59
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:37,460
What?

60
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,300
There's something I didn't understand.

61
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,140
How come you were around

62
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,500
since it was so late?

63
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,900
Jinyi and I just came back.

64
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,220
I came out

65
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,620
to grab some food.

66
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,740
After that, I went home.

67
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,700
I happened to pass by the back alley of Linshui Pavilion on my way home,

68
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,340
and saw you.

69
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,420
Actually,

70
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,220
we're not even close.

71
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,380
But you helped me several times.

72
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,260
It seems that you are also into punishing those who do wrong and commending those who do right,

73
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,420
just like me.

74
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,420
Actually, I...

75
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,940
Actually, you look like you're a cold person, but you're warm-hearted.

76
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,820
Do you trust strangers

77
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:19,700
so easily?

78
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,140
It's nothing.

79
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,380
From now on,

80
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,140
I'll be like you,

81
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,220
helping others

82
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,460
and sticking to my principles.

83
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,740
Ye, see you around.

84
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,660
I've gotta go too.

85
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:30,780
Take care.

86
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,260
Who is it?

87
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,020
Little girl.

88
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,860
You escaped quite fast.

89
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,220
Let go of me!

90
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,460
Who helped you to get away?

91
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,740
I got away by myself.

92
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:58,340
Now, try again.

93
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,860
What on earth do you want?

94
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,740
Zhao Laoqi and his wife were the only people lived there.

95
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,179
Zhao Laoqi is dead.

96
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,700
His woman is the victim's family

97
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,380
and should be grounded in the government now.

98
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,020
How could there be someone in their house?

99
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,500
What woman?

100
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,700
She has a name.

101
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,060
Show her some respect.

102
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,460
What's her name?

103
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,660
It's...

104
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,210
I found that

105
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,620
you set a high bar for me.

106
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,300
Someone came out.

107
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,620
Why is there a woman?

108
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,300
Didn't you just say

109
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,060
Zhao Laoqi's wife was grounded by the government?

110
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,740
Who is this woman?

111
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,140
How could I know?

112
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,060
I can't see clearly. It's too far away.

113
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,540
But this man

114
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,300
should be from the military.

115
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,220
What do you mean?

116
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,020
He is familiar with riding horses

117
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,860
and climbing over the wall.

118
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,540
The most senior military officer in Bianzhou

119
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,340
is you.

120
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,340
So

121
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,660
he's one of your subordinates.

122
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,580
Let's go.

123
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,020
I'll send someone to escort you.

124
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,140
I'll keep an eye on it here.

125
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,220
You

126
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,860
escort her back.

127
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:00,420
Yes.

128
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:00,980
Yes.

129
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:01,860
Thank you, Lord Han.

130
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,540
Lord Han.

131
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:04,660
I don't think

132
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,980
you'd take seriously what I said.

133
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,380
But you have to

134
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,220
tell Lord Kang

135
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,060
exactly what happened today.

136
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,140
I won't have any objections no matter how he decides to sentence or punish me.

137
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,940
It was my business to help you.

138
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,420
Why would Zheng punish you?

139
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,060
You're the Commander of Zhechong Prefecture.

140
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,140
You should try to stay out of anything

141
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,100
involving the court,

142
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,220
and you shouldn't have helped me.

143
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,900
You should take a detour when you see me.

144
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,740
Where did you learn all these

145
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:23,900
useless things

146
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,700
at such a young age?

147
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,300
Nothing can be done without rules.

148
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,220
Are you lecturing me?

149
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,700
You have no fear

150
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,940
and care about nothing,

151
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,140
But I dare not.

152
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,460
If I can't even

153
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,980
stick to the basic principle of the law,

154
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,820
my life would turn into a joke after all these years.

155
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,620
I...

156
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,860
Lord Han,

157
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,340
as a commander,

158
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,420
don't you

159
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,900
hold the law in awe?

160
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:04,780
My lady,

161
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,180
why did you come back so late?

162
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,460
I was so worried.

163
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:08,860
I'm thirsty.

164
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,020
Let me drink some water.

165
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,580
You scared me.

166
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,460
I was worried something might have happened to you.

167
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,820
Have you investigated

168
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,700
what I asked you to?

169
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,740
Yes.

170
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,820
So Zhao Laoqi

171
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,140
was really a horrible person.

172
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,900
His last name was not Zhao.

173
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,180
After he got married,

174
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,580
he took his wife's last name.

175
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,020
He was matrilocal, wasn't he?

176
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:27,700
Yes.

177
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,500
He was not born here.

178
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,660
One year, he was frozen on the street

179
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,900
and almost died.

180
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,220
Zhao Wanruo found him

181
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,540
and helped him.

182
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,380
Zhao Wanruo

183
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,780
is the only child in her family.

184
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,140
Her parents found that he was not a local

185
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,100
and had no other family,

186
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,340
so they took him in as their son-in-law.

187
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,660
Unexpectedly,

188
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,700
after he got married,

189
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,180
he changed his attitude immediately.

190
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,860
He bummed around all day long

191
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,180
and often abused

192
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,340
Zhao Wanruo.

193
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,740
What did her parents

194
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,380
do about this?

195
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,700
I heard that they

196
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,660
had fought against him.

197
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,260
But somehow,

198
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,340
they were threatened by him

199
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,500
and withdrew the lawsuit.

200
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,340
After that,

201
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,780
the parents passed away one after another.

202
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,140
They all passed away

203
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,900
in less than a month.

204
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,860
After that,

205
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,060
Zhao Laoqi became worse.

206
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,740
If he was not matrilocal，

207
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,340
he would have

208
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,700
divorced his wife long ago.

209
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,740
So

210
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,780
this couple

211
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,300
was not in the same boat.

212
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,780
Although he was thin and poor,

213
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,580
he was a martial artist.

214
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,700
He pretended to be vulnerable

215
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,700
so he could

216
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,380
take his wife's property

217
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,900
with little effort.

218
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,300
Some neighbors

219
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,860
couldn't stand what he did

220
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,180
and spoke out,

221
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,090
but ended up being hurt badly.

222
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,140
My lady,

223
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,860
have you figured out what to do?

224
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:44,860
He was

225
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,140
such a villain and evil person.

226
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,740
When he was alive, he hurt people.

227
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,700
Now that he's dead, he got Madam Fang in trouble.

228
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,140
The law of our country is based on the presumption of guilt.

229
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,780
If both sides can't provide

230
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,820
conclusive evidence,

231
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,460
the defendant will be found guilty and sentenced.

232
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:00,660
Then...

233
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,500
What should we do?

234
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,620
You're being ridiculous.

235
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,820
Why are you all

236
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,060
blaming me?

237
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,450
How many times have I told you?

238
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:12,980
Do not

239
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,220
behave in court

240
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,540
in the way how you maneuvered the army.

241
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,020
You should hold the law in awe.

242
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,060
Chun Tumi was right.

243
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,180
She's a litigator,

244
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,620
while you're the commander of Zhechong Prefecture,

245
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,140
your break-ins mean different.

246
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,420
You can pick your side as an official,

247
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,140
but you can't

248
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,340
get involved in the case.

249
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,540
This is the rule.

250
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,860
I'll punish her.

251
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:37,860
Zheng,

252
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,420
don't punish her.

253
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,020
Just punish me.

254
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,540
I don't understand your rules.

255
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,540
Then explain them to me until I do.

256
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,580
My lady,

257
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:14,700
I didn't know you have

258
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,820
a photographic memory.

259
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,980
Of course, I don't.

260
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,340
You know

261
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,100
how difficult it was for me

262
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,020
to recite those poems, don't you?

263
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,380
Yes.

264
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,100
But how did you manage to

265
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,500
remember these?

266
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,900
At first,

267
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,620
I was confused too.

268
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,460
Later,

269
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,220
I started from the first line,

270
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,740
followed the logic,

271
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,140
and deduced one sentence after another.

272
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,420
In that way, everything just popped out.

273
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:37,620
I didn't have to try to memorize everything.

274
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,380
As long as I sort out

275
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,420
the connections and the logic,

276
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,020
I'll know it

277
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,060
if anything unreasonable happens in court.

278
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,500
Father.

279
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,620
Let me do it, Master Chun.

280
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,810
Father, you want to see me?

281
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,500
You've been working hard lately, my daughter.

282
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,140
I brought you some soup.

283
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,820
Do you have any new clues

284
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,420
about this case?

285
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,380
Yes.

286
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,890
But I need to think about it

287
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,730
so I can leave Scholar Sun

288
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,980
no place to refute.

289
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,780
Master Chun, my lady.

290
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,500
Lord Han is here.

291
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:24,940
My lord.

292
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,380
Save the courtesies, my lord.

293
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,860
We are not outsiders.

294
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,260
You mean,

295
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,340
both you and my father are from Zhechong Prefecture,

296
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
so you are not outsiders,

297
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,900
don't you?

298
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:36,820
Of course not.

299
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,820
Vice-captain Chun knew

300
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,540
about what happened between us last night.

301
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,460
Father.

302
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,380
Last night,

303
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,580
I went to Zhao Laoqi's house to investigate the case.

304
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,220
I didn't expect to meet Lord Han.

305
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,810
Lord Han helped me.

306
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,780
I didn't tell you this

307
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,180
because I didn't want you to worry.

308
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,500
Don't do it again,

309
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,620
you kid.

310
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,060
You want to tell on me.

311
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,020
No way.

312
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,860
So, Lord Han,

313
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:01,940
who was the man

314
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:02,980
in Zhao Laoqi's house?

315
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,820
Telling from your expression,

316
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,300
Vice-captain Chun, you didn't know.

317
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,260
No, I didn't.

318
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,340
About the man in Zhao Laoqi's house last night,

319
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,900
you'd know him better than I do.

320
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,340
Zhang Wuniang.

321
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,500
Fu Gui.

322
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,780
It's easy for me to find someone in the military.

323
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,940
But what I don't understand

324
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,020
is why he did it.

325
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,860
No wonder.

326
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,620
That was why Scholar Sun knew

327
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,020
about what happened between

328
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,420
Madam Fang and Zhao Laoqi.

329
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,980
I see.

330
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,460
If that's the case,

331
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,780
it would be easier to explain.

332
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,820
But why were they doing

333
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,860
in the house?

334
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,220
I'll leave you to deal with

335
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,460
the court.

336
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,180
Since I've told you everything,

337
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,180
it's your turn

338
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:02,500
to answer my questions.

339
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,050
What do I have to answer?

340
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:04,819
Who was the man

341
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:06,260
that was with you last night?

342
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:09,619
Ye.

343
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:10,940
When did you meet?

344
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:12,980
A few days ago.

345
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,020
What does he do?

346
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,819
He's a carter.

347
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,579
Do you know

348
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:16,980
any carter who's so good with martial arts?

349
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,780
No, I don't.

350
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:19,660
Well,

351
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,180
it's normal

352
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,329
for people to know some to survive in Jianghu, in this pugilistic society.

353
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,300
Do you know what Jianghu is?

354
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,780
I...

355
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,300
I read in books that

356
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,340
those who are in Jianghu

357
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,780
are just like Ye.

358
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,570
Besides, I didn't bring any money

359
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,180
when I was dealing with my father's case.

360
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,340
It was him who lent me the money.

361
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,180
He always helped us without no hesitation.

362
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,700
This young man

363
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,900
is willing to help people.

364
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,420
I think he should be a good person.

365
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,340
I found that

366
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,420
people in Bianzhou

367
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,780
are really simple.

368
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,620
Lord Han,

369
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,540
if there's nothing else,

370
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,580
I'll see you next time.

371
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,100
Little girl.

372
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,260
You want me to leave

373
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,660
now that you've used me, don't you?

374
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,890
Lord Han,

375
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:03,820
what on earth do you want

376
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,060
being here?

377
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,220
I want to tell you

378
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,180
to be careful.

379
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,900
Do you worry that man will harm me?

380
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,130
The court will open tomorrow.

381
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,420
He will be convicted.

382
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,180
So he won't be able to

383
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,060
continue to commit any evil.

384
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,340
I'll arrange some people

385
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,540
to protect you around your house.

386
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,180
I wanted to do it secretly,

387
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,540
but I always do things

388
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,740
fair and square.

389
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,620
Chun Tumi,

390
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,900
don't let me down.

391
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,180
Alright.

392
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,940
Nothing else.

393
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,140
I'm leaving.

394
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,090
By the way,

395
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,770
about last night,

396
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,740
Lord Kang

397
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,780
said the same thing as you did.

398
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,290
Lord Kang never let me down.

399
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,700
I realized that

400
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,780
you could always see

401
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,740
the good sides of other men.

402
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,380
You must be joking.

403
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,340
We have to investigate to appeal.

404
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,140
Lord Kang must

405
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,100
think likewise.

406
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,980
If you need anything,

407
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,580
you can send those who protect you

408
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,340
to run errands for you.

409
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,700
I don't want to rely on you.

410
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,140
It's not that I don't appreciate it.

411
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,100
If you are capable to

412
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,500
let everyone in the country rely on you,

413
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,220
I'll do so without any hesitation.

414
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,380
Otherwise,

415
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,020
instead of relying on you,

416
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,350
I'd rather rely on myself

417
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,330
and do something realistic

418
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,900
to let more people rely on me.

419
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,100
One day,

420
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,060
what if I become capable to

421
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,700
let all the people rely on me?

422
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,740
Of course, I'll rely on you.

423
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,060
Keep in mind what you said today.

424
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,780
Why are you sighing?

425
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,580
Well, I'm just curious.

426
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,820
Why Bianzhou people

427
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,180
trust others so easily?

428
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,340
Did you go to Chun Tumi again?

429
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,900
Last night, my men

430
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,300
found that

431
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,420
the carter is quite skilled in martial arts.

432
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,580
You met a love rival.

433
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,940
I was not kidding.

434
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:19,020
I suspect I made a mistake.

435
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,740
The person who visited Chu You's study room

436
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,060
and fought with me that night

437
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,900
is still in Bianzhou.

438
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,300
Are you suspecting this carter was that man?

439
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,780
If he is

440
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,420
who I think he is,

441
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,700
our stories will

442
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,900
trace far back.

443
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,420
Did you go to the Chun family

444
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,140
to remind Chun Tumi of this?

445
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,700
I dare not.

446
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,540
She believes that the carter

447
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,100
is a good older brother who explores Jianghu.

448
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,180
Do you think

449
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,940
if someone may arrange Chun Tumi

450
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:52,900
by our side

451
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,100
as bait?

452
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,860
I think you are paranoid

453
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,170
again.

454
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,740
I've investigated

455
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,900
the background of Chun Tumi.

456
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,740
She grew up in Bianzhou.

457
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,940
Her life is simple.

458
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,100
There's nothing wrong with it.

459
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,540
It's indeed complicated

460
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,060
if the person who stole the inkstone found her

461
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,460
in order to come to me.

462
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,980
Not to mention that

463
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,450
you have no proof

464
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,340
about your speculation about him,

465
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,900
even if you do have the proof that

466
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,780
he is the one

467
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,460
you are after,

468
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,940
you can't prove

469
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,540
Chun Tumi was involved in this.

470
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,420
Besides,

471
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,380
she is an ordinary girl

472
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,460
grew up in Bianzhou.

473
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,180
The fact that she knows you, Han Wuwei,

474
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,820
sounds more bizarre

475
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:34,620
than the fact that she knows

476
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,410
a martial artist, doesn't it?

477
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,900
Are you defending her?

478
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,140
You know nothing about

479
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:42,820
people's relationships,

480
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,610
it's surprising that you were defending her.

481
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,700
Are you still the Zheng that I know?

482
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,810
I'm talking about things, not people.

483
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,180
You have anything else?

484
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,540
Leave if you don't.

485
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,300
Leave quickly.

486
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,300
Yes.

487
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,780
Yes, I do.

488
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,100
Last night I found a military personnel

489
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,540
in Zhao Laoqi's house.

490
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,660
He's related to the case of Linshui Pavilion.

491
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,700
Who is it?

492
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,340
You'll know

493
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,500
in court tomorrow.

494
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,460
This way, please.

495
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,180
Wanruo.

496
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,940
I brought you some snacks.

497
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,780
The fillings were made from persimmon. They are soft and sweet.

498
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,180
Don't be nervous.

499
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:34,580
I just want to talk to you.

500
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,660
Thank you for your kindness.

501
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,500
You seemed so surprised

502
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,220
because you didn't expect me to come.

503
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,740
Actually, you are the victim's family.

504
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,500
I'm the litigator.

505
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,420
It's my responsibility to ask you some questions.

506
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,380
You have the right to refuse.

507
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,340
It will be the same later in court.

508
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,260
It's been a long time

509
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,460
since I was called by my own name.

510
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,100
I almost forgot about it.

511
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:02,740
Right.

512
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,700
People usually call you sister-in-law

513
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,300
or Mrs. Zhao.

514
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,460
But

515
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,540
Zhao Laoqi

516
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,980
did so many evil things when he was alive.

517
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,300
Now that he's dead,

518
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,460
I don't think

519
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,700
you want to

520
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,460
be called

521
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,540
after his name anymore.

522
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,860
Actually, you are an important witness.

523
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,620
That's why you are grounded here.

524
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:24,380
Otherwise,

525
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,020
I'd want to invite you to the dessert shop.

526
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,100
We can have some tea

527
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,380
and snacks there.

528
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,740
We don't need to buy the snacks in kilos.

529
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,060
We can choose any flavor we want.

530
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,700
You'll feel more comfortable there.

531
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,420
I'm fine

532
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,780
and comfortable here.

533
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,580
Thank you, Miss Chun.

534
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,820
Magistrate Yuan

535
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,660
is nice to you.

536
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,500
When I interrogated Zhang Wuniang,

537
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,020
I had to visit her at the prison.

538
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,140
Magistrate Yuan is nicer

539
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,380
than Magistrate Zhang.

540
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,060
He'd let us go out for a walk

541
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,180
in the daytime.

542
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,620
Wanruo, you are so skillful.

543
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,210
The embroidery design is beautiful.

544
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,530
So is the that on your clothes.

545
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,580
It's popular

546
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:05,780
in Linlang Pavilion recently, isn't it?

547
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,940
Yes.

548
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,380
Zhao Laoqi bullied and abused you

549
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,540
when he was alive.

550
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,780
It's surprising that he would spend money

551
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,980
on such good cloth for you, isn't it?

552
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,020
Now that he's gone,

553
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,620
what's there to hide?

554
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,340
What are you afraid of?

555
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,860
Or did someone threaten you?

556
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,500
No, no one did.

557
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,010
He used to be nice to me.

558
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,530
Otherwise, he wouldn't have taken me

559
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,300
to Linlang Pavilion for dinner.

560
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,820
Actually, I found

561
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,820
some new evidence.

562
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,180
I've asked the coroner to investigate.

563
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,700
The result should be out soon.

564
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,020
What evidence?

565
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,020
Do you know

566
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,660
Zhao Laoqi's leg was injured?

567
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,220
My lady, what's wrong?

568
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,780
I have a stomachache.

569
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,740
Let's find a doctor.

570
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,500
I'll go get the doctor.

571
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:05,860
Miss Chun.

572
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:06,980
Did you

573
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,250
eat something?

574
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:10,780
I just had some snacks.

575
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,300
Anything else?

576
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,420
And some eggs.

577
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,420
Persimmon-and-egg combinations can make you sick.

578
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,780
Eating them together will cause diarrhea.

579
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,060
Zhao Wanruo.

580
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,380
It's time.

581
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,540
Let's go back.

582
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,100
Dangerous food combinations.

583
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,540
One.

584
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,220
Two.

585
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,140
Three.

586
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,220
Four.

587
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,460
Five.

588
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,020
Captain.

589
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,940
Why isn't Chun Dashan here?

590
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,500
Captain,

591
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,780
Vice-captain Chun has a lawsuit.

592
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,580
He asked for leave today.

593
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:17,060
He's living an easy life.

594
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,700
He was arrested a few days ago.

595
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,580
And he took a few days off.

596
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,420
Now he's taking days off for

597
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,380
some tenant's lawsuit

598
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,340
which has nothing to do with him.

599
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,020
Tell him to come to me when he comes back.

600
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:24,700
Yes.

601
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,100
-Continue the training. -Capatain Fu.

602
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,980
Lord Han.

603
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,220
Lord Han.

604
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,180
You guys have been training very hard.

605
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,500
I'm here to reward you.

606
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,420
No need for these courtesies.

607
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,860
Thank you, Lord Han.

608
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,180
We will do our best.

609
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,580
Good.

610
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,980
I need you to help me with something.

611
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:47,500
Come with me.

612
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,060
Yes.

613
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,300
Keep going.

614
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,500
-Lord Han! -Lord Han!

615
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,780
You must have asked me here

616
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,060
for something important.

617
00:26:59,260 --> 00:26:59,980
As long as you say it,

618
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,740
I, Fu Gui,

619
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,860
will do anything

620
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,140
at any cost.

621
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,500
Lord Han,

622
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,380
what's this for?

623
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,860
Cleaning my army.

624
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,060
Your stomachache

625
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,260
was caused by eating eggs and persimmons together.

626
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,660
Luckily, you didn't eat much.

627
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,180
Otherwise, it would be more dangerous.

628
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,100
Thank you, Dr. Wen.

629
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,620
I have another question.

630
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,580
Go ahead.

631
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:30,740
What food combination

632
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,780
with fish soup

633
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,020
would cause people sick?

634
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:36,100
I once read from a medical book that

635
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,570
someone was poisoned

636
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:41,660
by eating Chinese redbuds, rice, and fish soup together.

637
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,020
But

638
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,450
I have never seen anything like it myself.

639
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,260
The Chinese redbud?

640
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:54,880
[Bianzhou Prefecture]

641
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,010
The third hearing of the case of Linshui Pavilion opens now.

642
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:56,420
After one day,

643
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,340
have you two

644
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,690
found any new evidence?

645
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,620
My lord,

646
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,850
I reviewed

647
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,220
all the evidence again.

648
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,860
Madam Fang had the motive,

649
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,890
the conditions, and the time for committing the crime.

650
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,860
I only ask you, my lord, to punish the murderer

651
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,340
and give Zhao Laoqi justice.

652
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,250
I will give you justice.

653
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,980
The defendant's litigator, what do you have to say?

654
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,100
My lord,

655
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,860
I had been thinking about

656
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,940
how to clear Madam Fang's name yesterday.

657
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,330
All the evidence

658
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,660
can't prove her guilty,

659
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,850
nor can it prove

660
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:27,820
her innocence.

661
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,780
Later, I figured it out.

662
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,690
If I want to prove her innocence,

663
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,500
I just need to find the real murderer

664
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,860
to clear her name.

665
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,620
On that day in Linshui Pavilion,

666
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,140
many guests were food poisoned and vomited.

667
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,260
Zhao Laoqi even died from it.

668
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,660
Because the scomber japonicus

669
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,500
would cause food poison

670
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,620
if it was not cleaned properly.

671
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,930
So people would think

672
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,180
there was something wrong with the fish.

673
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:46,940
In this case,

674
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,460
the responsibility goes to

675
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,020
Madam Fang who sold the fish soup.

676
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,700
It's undoubtedly.

677
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,700
No.

678
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,700
The fish soup was poisonous, but it doesn't mean the fish was.

679
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,500
Maybe there was something else

680
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,900
in the soup.

681
00:28:59,180 --> 00:28:59,940
Even Madam Fang

682
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,180
didn't know what it was.

683
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:02,660
My Lord,

684
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,020
I request to call the witness,

685
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:05,860
Dr. Wen.

686
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,780
Send him in.

687
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,100
My lord.

688
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:14,740
Dr. Wen,

689
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,180
did the customer

690
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,260
vomit

691
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,380
due to poisoning?

692
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,500
You've already asked this question.

693
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,700
Why repeat it?

694
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,540
Question allowed.

695
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,780
Go on.

696
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,100
My lord,

697
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,100
they vomited due to poisoning.

698
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,980
Were they poisoned

699
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,460
because of the fish?

700
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,500
Not necessarily.

701
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,220
Some herbs

702
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,620
can cause similar symptoms.

703
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,060
The symptoms could be diagnosed as poisoning.

704
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:39,820
Can you give us an example?

705
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,260
For example, the melon pedicel, the Veratrum nigrum L,

706
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,020
the Dichroa and the oleander.

707
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,500
Chinese herbs usually smell like medicine.

708
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,580
Everyone knows

709
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:48,180
the Lotus Fish Soup of Linshui Pavilion

710
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,980
is fragrant with flower smell.

711
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,140
It doesn't make sense

712
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,900
if there were herbs inside.

713
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,300
But if there was a small portion of herbs,

714
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,420
people wouldn't mell it.

715
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,500
If the portion was small,

716
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,530
it would only cause vomit,

717
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,580
not death.

718
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,020
Why did

719
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,500
Zhao Laoqi died on the spot?

720
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,260
Scholar Sun, slow down.

721
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,100
Let's find the reason for the poison first.

722
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,580
Then we'll find the reason for his death.

723
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:10,660
My lord,

724
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,540
I want to call another witness,

725
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,620
the coroner.

726
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,500
Allowed.

727
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,460
Send the coroner in.

728
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,130
My lord.

729
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,300
Coroner,

730
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:24,420
did you examine other exhibits

731
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,980
after the body?

732
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,420
Under Lord Yuan's order,

733
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,330
I also examined

734
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,010
the fish soup and the vomitus.

735
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,300
Do you still have them?

736
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,140
Yes, I do.

737
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,580
I can't guarantee

738
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,890
they are exactly the same as they were on that day.

739
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,980
But they didn't go bad.

740
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,460
My lord,

741
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,580
I called the coroner

742
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,060
to provide you with new evidence.

743
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,660
Can I have your permission to ask the coroner and Dr. Wen

744
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,460
to examine

745
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,500
Zhao Laoqi's vomitus again?

746
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,180
My lord,

747
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,580
there's no need for that.

748
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,860
They were examined

749
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,100
on the day of the first hearing.

750
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,820
She's just being unreasonable.

751
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,460
My lord,

752
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,420
it was inevitable to neglect some facts that day.

753
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,620
If we examine it again today,

754
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,330
we can bring the murderer to justice

755
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,860
and clear the name of the innocent.

756
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,060
Chun Tumi,

757
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,340
if they can't find anything,

758
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,340
you'll be sentenced to disturbing the court,

759
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,460
and delaying the case.

760
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,740
You will be punished.

761
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,460
I believe in my own judgment.

762
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,300
If nothing was found,

763
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,060
I'm at your disposal.

764
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,660
Coroner, Dr. Wen.

765
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,300
Do it now.

766
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,460
-Yes. -Yes.

767
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:20,940
My lord,

768
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,620
we have finished the second examination.

769
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:24,500
How was it?

770
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:25,740
My lord,

771
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,380
after the second examination,

772
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,540
we found that in the fish soup,

773
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,140
there was shredded melon pedicel

774
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,020
mixed in something like shredded ginger.

775
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:32,980
They were soaked

776
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,660
in the fish meat that was marinated for a whole night,

777
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:37,050
so it was hard to distinguish it from the color and shape.

778
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,940
We had to be careful

779
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,220
to be able to distinguish it.

780
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,820
Madam Fang used it

781
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:42,780
instead of ginger

782
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,220
which was why people were poisoned

783
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:45,540
and Zhao Laoqi died.

784
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,140
You and Dr. Wen discussed

785
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,980
about this, didn't you?

786
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,220
You can only smell it

787
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,100
if it was a big portion.

788
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,940
Only when its portion was small can its smell be covered.

789
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:53,180
Since it was a small portion,

790
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,580
how could it cause death?

791
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,260
That day, all the guests were gastronomes.

792
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,180
If the fish soup smelled weird,

793
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,300
how could they not know it?

794
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,980
No matter what portion it was,

795
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,620
it was attemped murder.

796
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,900
Although I can't be sure that

797
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,220
whoever tried to mix the herb was the culprit,

798
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,820
he was closely related to this case.

799
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,300
We must find him.

800
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,580
Anyone who wanted to do it

801
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,180
must have entered the kitchen.

802
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,100
He had to do it after Madam Fang cooked the fish

803
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,420
and chopped it into mince.

804
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,020
He had to do it that night.

805
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,020
Because it would take a whole night for the fish to be marinated

806
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,820
and taste good.

807
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,100
Only by being marinated would the melon pedicel's color change,

808
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,700
so that people would confuse it for ginger.

809
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,260
Also, he knows some kung fu.

810
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,300
If not,

811
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,620
the wall of Linshui Pavilion is very high,

812
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,220
it would be impossible to get in

813
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,100
without alerting the workers.

814
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,660
It was Madam Fang

815
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,740
who drugged people.

816
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,580
There would be no need for her to climb over the wall.

817
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,620
Scholar Sun,

818
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,980
I was trying to explain everything

819
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,620
to the lords.

820
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,380
Why did you keep interrupting me?

821
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,700
Do you have connections with the murderer?

822
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:41,820
You...

823
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,860
If you keep interrupting,

824
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,900
I'll sentence you to be slapped.

825
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:47,940
Go on.

826
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,100
My lord,

827
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,700
The investigation was very clear that day.

828
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,020
There was no sign of

829
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,740
forced entry in the kitchen.

830
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,980
That means the criminal has the skill to unlock.

831
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:57,900
Here comes the question.

832
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,620
Why did he do that?

833
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,300
Was he the competitor of Linshui Pavilion

834
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:02,820
that he wanted to ruin their reputation?

835
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,340
Did he frame Madam Fang

836
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,980
because he has a grudge against Madam Fang?

837
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:07,020
Scholar Sun,

838
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,820
Zhao Laoqi died the next day.

839
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,820
Don't you think

840
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,020
it was surprisingly coincidental?

841
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,380
I told you.

842
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,740
She knows what she's doing.

843
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,300
Yeah, it was strange.

844
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:18,940
Right.

845
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:20,860
My lord.

846
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,940
I'm guilty.

847
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,300
What did you do wrong?

848
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,180
I broke into Linshui Pavilion last night.

849
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,740
But please reconsider punishment to me

850
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,010
considering that I did it

851
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,140
to find the clues.

852
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:33,940
It doesn't matter.

853
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,020
You can rise.

854
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,020
Thank you, my lord.

855
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:39,660
My lord.

856
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,380
May I present another exhibit?

857
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,420
Bring it over.

858
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,300
What is this?

859
00:33:58,780 --> 00:33:59,330
My lord,

860
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,380
this is the wooden shelf

861
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,580
from Linshui Pavilion.

862
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:02,780
To be exact,

863
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,140
it's the wooden stick from the shelf.

864
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:05,700
There are some rags on it.

865
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,820
The rags were broken

866
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,130
and stuck to the wooden stick.

867
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,940
I believe this is the trail

868
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,980
left by the criminal.

869
00:34:12,219 --> 00:34:13,540
It can prove who he is.

870
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,100
-How? - Yeah, how?

871
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:16,940
Madam Fang,

872
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:19,020
was the wooden shelf damaged on that day?

873
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:19,820
Yes, it was.

874
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,500
The wooden shelf was smashed

875
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,260
by something really heavy.

876
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,380
The crossbeam at the bottom

877
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,330
was broken and stuck out.

878
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:25,900
I was too busy

879
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,179
to fix it right away.

880
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,420
That's right.

881
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:29,380
My lord.

882
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:30,780
The stick on the wooden shelf

883
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,860
is three inches long,

884
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,699
sharper than a knife.

885
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,659
I believe that the criminal was panicked.

886
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:38,460
After the criminal

887
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,420
drugged the soup,

888
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,340
he was in a hurry to run away.

889
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:42,260
It was dark at night and he was not familiar with the roads.

890
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,699
So he bumped into the wooden stick,

891
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,300
got his pants torn off, hurt his leg,

892
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,420
and left the rags and blood on the stick.

893
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,580
My lord,

894
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,300
ask the coroner to examine it and you'll know.

895
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,780
Coroner.

896
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,139
My lord,

897
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,180
there was a wound

898
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,660
on Zhao Laoqi's thigh.

899
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,620
And there were splinters of the wood

900
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,380
in his muscles.

901
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,420
The wound was not even.

902
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,380
Judging from its edge,

903
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,100
looks like the dead was stuck.

904
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,140
Judging from the situation it was healing,

905
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,180
the dead got injured one or two days before his death.

906
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,580
I just

907
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:12,940
examined the wood stick carefully.

908
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:13,930
I can conclude that

909
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,980
the wound on his leg

910
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,940
was caused by that wooden stick.

911
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:18,100
In this case,

912
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,940
it was Zhao Laoqi

913
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,420
who drugged people.

914
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,940
My lord.

915
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,020
Even if

916
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,380
that explained his wound,

917
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,690
it can only prove that he was in the kitchen.

918
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,620
Zhao Laoqi had always been sneaky like that.

919
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,460
How do you know he was there to poison people,

920
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,980
not to steal?

921
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:36,980
My lord,

922
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,580
please allow me to call the third and fourth witnesses,

923
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,140
Yan Hua and Bu Dalang.

924
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,780
On the night of the 23rd of this month,

925
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,580
Zhao Laoqi bought melon pedicel

926
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:45,900
and the Dichroa from our shop.

927
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,260
Because we have records

928
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,100
for all our sales.

929
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,940
So we can check the records.

930
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,660
Are you sure the buyer was Zhao Laoqi?

931
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,940
Yes, I am sure.

932
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,020
Because he

933
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,220
often harassed the neighbors.

934
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,140
Yan Hua Tang

935
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,180
is not far from his home.

936
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,540
He often bought medicine

937
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,340
without paying.

938
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,540
So I know him too well.

939
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,100
Did he pay you that time?

940
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,020
Yes, he did.

941
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,380
But

942
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,860
he looked very strange.

943
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,500
Sir, your medicine.

944
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,700
It seemed that

945
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,090
he was afraid

946
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,140
to be seen by others.

947
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,020
My lord,

948
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,340
Yan Hua testified that Zhao Laoqi

949
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,290
bought melon pedicel.

950
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,420
Bu Dalang can testify that

951
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,580
Zhao Laoqi was capable to climb over the wall.

952
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:23,620
Bu Dalang,

953
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:24,740
tell our lord what you know.

954
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,340
My lord,

955
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:29,020
I'm Zhao Laoqi's neighbor.

956
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,300
I was foolish that

957
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,580
I admired him because he knew some kung fu.

958
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,100
He was my best friend.

959
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,100
He also showed me

960
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,340
his skills.

961
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,460
Although he was not capable of flying over the walls,

962
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,860
climbing over the wall in Linshui Pavilion

963
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,940
was no problem for him.

964
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,100
Besides, he had the skills to unlock the doors.

965
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,340
To unlock an ordinary broze lock,

966
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,100
all he needed was a small broze stick.

967
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:52,290
He could unlock it in one second

968
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:53,940
without leaving any trace.

969
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,140
Now we have witnesses and exhibits

970
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,540
which proved that Zhao Laoqi

971
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,540
was the one who poisoned people.

972
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,660
It has nothing to do with Madam Fang.

973
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,500
No.

974
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,860
There's still something suspicious about this case.

975
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,100
Dr. Wen,

976
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,460
can melon pedicel poison people to death?

977
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,460
I don't think so.

978
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,620
No matter how big the portion is,

979
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,300
right?

980
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,780
I've never verified that.

981
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,180
But melon pedicel has a strong smell.

982
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,220
The smell could be covered

983
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,540
only if the portion is small.

984
00:37:18,770 --> 00:37:20,300
So there were not much of it

985
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,060
in the fish soup.

986
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,900
Even if Zhao Laoqi did it out of personal revenge

987
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,900
to frame Madam Fang,

988
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,260
it could only

989
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:28,940
cause vomit and diarrhea.

990
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,660
Chun Tumi also questioned this.

991
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,580
Why the 70-year-old

992
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,740
only showed symptoms of vomiting after eating the fish soup,

993
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,780
while Zhao Laoqi, as strong as he was,

994
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,700
lost his life

995
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,460
after eating the fish soup?

996
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,020
This is indeed

997
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,300
an unsolved point.

998
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,020
Besides, Zhao Laoqi

999
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,740
is dead and there's no way for him to confront it.

1000
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,500
Yes.

1001
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,060
Unless Chun Tumi provides

1002
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,460
conclusive evidence that Zhao Laoqi was poisoned

1003
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,780
by himself,

1004
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,060
or a new murderer shows himself,

1005
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:58,660
confesses and tells us how he did it,

1006
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,060
otherwise,

1007
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,370
Madam Fang

1008
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,340
is still a major suspect.

1009
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,300
What if she knew

1010
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,460
what Zhao Laoqi did,

1011
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,340
and she conspired his conspiracy and killed him,

1012
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,460
so that she could get away with it.

1013
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,020
Scholar Sun was right.

1014
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,220
This is indeed the biggest mystery

1015
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,130
of this case.

1016
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,100
So you want to give in?

1017
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:24,580
My lord,

1018
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,580
I would like to ask for a pot of fish soup,

1019
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,540
a bucket of rice,

1020
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,140
a sheep to be killed,

1021
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,340
and a bucket of

1022
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,860
Chinese redbuds.

1023
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,100
What do you need these for?

1024
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,980
