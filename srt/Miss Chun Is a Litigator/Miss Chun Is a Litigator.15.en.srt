[Episode 15]

4
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,140
Madam,

5
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,940
I know regarding me, a girl,

6
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,940
being a litigator,

7
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,020
you have many views.

8
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:00,500
But my grandfather and my father

9
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,620
had many opinions too.

10
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,060
They were also old-fashioned.

11
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,100
They thought I shouldn't show up in public.

12
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,420
But if someone

13
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,900
said something bad about me outside,

14
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,610
they would still

15
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,900
protect me for no reason

16
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,580
because we are

17
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,860
a family.

18
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,300
The same goes for Her Ladyship.

19
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,260
If I have siblings later,

20
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,980
I'll also protect them outside

21
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,460
because we are a family.

22
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,260
A family should be united.

23
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,220
Mother,

24
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,460
my husband is highly valued now.

25
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,020
And Tumi is sensible.

26
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:32,579
And we are a family.

27
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,020
They will help us

28
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,940
regarding family affairs.

29
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,220
Besides,

30
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,340
it's such a big matter.

31
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,420
We are women.

32
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,780
What should we do?

33
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,540
What do you mean by "such a big matter"?

34
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,060
There is nothing serious.

35
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,060
I'll be fine too.

36
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,260
Take her away

37
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,660
after you have a meal.

38
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,340
Now Tumi is capable,

39
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,060
Your husband is also capable.

40
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,140
Follow them

41
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,700
and never come back.

42
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,220
Madam,

43
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,180
everyone has heard about it.

44
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:01,620
Why are you acting tough like this?

45
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,180
I'm not.

46
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,460
Just treat my daughter well.

47
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,060
Take her as your family.

48
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,490
Take good care of her

49
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,420
and the unborn child

50
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,820
in her belly.

51
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,540
Don't worry about anything else.

52
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:15,860
Leave quickly.

53
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,579
Mother,

54
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,700
the Fan family

55
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,540
has thrown dead chickens and ducks

56
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,020
into the yard,

57
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,100
but you said you were fine.

58
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,180
I am a good citizen.

59
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,820
No one can frame me.

60
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,340
Mother,

61
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,260
my husband is here to help.

62
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,540
The Fan family has always been barbaric.

63
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,660
It's hard to escape

64
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,020
if one gets involved with them.

65
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,810
Tumi,

66
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,900
you always have ways

67
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,140
in the court,

68
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,100
right?

69
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,500
The Fan family is made such a big mess.

70
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,690
The government won't ignore it.

71
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,020
Fine.

72
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,700
If the Fan family wants to make a scene,

73
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,890
I can hire a few strong local men

74
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,340
to guard Xu's house.

75
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,540
If they want to go to court,

76
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,140
there are litigators in Laishui.

77
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,820
Otherwise, I can spend a lot of money to

78
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,460
hire someone from Youzhou.

79
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,900
There's always a way.

80
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,610
Madam,

81
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,860
since everything has been arranged,

82
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,220
we won't interfere.

83
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,660
I...

84
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,460
Of course, I have ways.

85
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:05,820
If I want to find a litigator,

86
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,490
I will spend a lot

87
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,700
to hire the best person.

88
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,540
Mother,

89
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,860
they only want your money.

90
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,740
Tumi is better.

91
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,180
She is familiar with

92
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,019
those high officials.

93
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,899
Maybe the magistrate

94
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,380
can be lenient.

95
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,100
Tumi,

96
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:22,380
you have promised me that

97
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,780
you would help me, right?

98
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,220
I thought we were a family.

99
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,020
But Madam

100
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,620
doesn't think so.

101
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:31,700
Since we are two families,

102
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,300
we should be clear about settling accounts.

103
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:34,420
Madam,

104
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,580
I charge when working as a litigator.

105
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,820
It's a litigation fee.

106
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,100
According to the ability of each litigator,

107
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,580
the price is different.

108
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,340
It turns out that you are

109
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,890
for my money too.

110
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,420
Sure.

111
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,220
How much is it?

112
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:48,250
Tell me.

113
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,780
Considering that I have worked for

114
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,540
Prime Minister of Supreme Court,

115
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,020
a case will be charged 500 taels.

116
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,700
If I win, give me another 1,000 taels.

117
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,740
1,500 taels?

118
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,060
With these 1,500 taels,

119
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,060
I can hire the best litigator in Laishui

120
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,180
and even in Youzhou.

121
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,260
Why should I waste it

122
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,820
on you, a little girl?

123
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,420
Look at you.

124
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,340
You even set

125
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,140
me up.

126
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,100
You are daydreaming.

127
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,540
Tumi,

128
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,100
don't care what my mother says.

129
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,180
I accept the price of 1,500 taels.

130
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,260
I'll pay for it.

131
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,700
You must save my mother.

132
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,980
She was really wronged.

133
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,220
Your Ladyship,

134
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,060
Guo is helping out

135
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:25,980
in the team of patrol.

136
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,540
I need someone to serve me.

137
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,380
Can you let Xiaoqin follow me?

138
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,620
Okay.

139
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,980
Go look for him outside.

140
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,100
Yes.

141
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,620
Did you follow me?

142
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,220
You knew

143
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,420
I was hiding under the bed.

144
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,220
I didn't expect that

145
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,780
you wouldn't know the way.

146
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,650
You've been running for so long,

147
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,020
but you didn't even get out of the woods.

148
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,580
Come on.

149
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:55,860
It's none of your business.

150
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,020
Put me down!

151
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,740
I order you to put me down!

152
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,740
Let go of me!

153
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,420
You're crying over such a minor injury?

154
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,060
I thought you were great.

155
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,020
I'm not crying.

156
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,460
Isn't it called crying?

157
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,980
I have said I'm not crying.

158
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,620
This wound is nothing

159
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,540
to me.

160
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,740
Okay. You are not crying.

161
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,620
Remember to apply medicine every day.

162
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,860
Take it.

163
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,299
I said I'm not crying.

164
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,780
Okay. You are not crying.

165
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,020
Young Master,

166
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,380
I've sent

167
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,420
the message.

168
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,700
Young Master,

169
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,140
you know that

170
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,020
Mowu Pavilion

171
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,460
is Juzi's lifelong effort.

172
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,460
He still hopes that

173
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,740
you can finish the task first.

174
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,020
You are young. It's normal that

175
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,620
you have feelings for someone.

176
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,580
But now is not the time

177
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,420
for love.

178
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:23,060
Young Master, I think Juzi

179
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,140
is entrusting you with important tasks

180
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,100
so that he can hand Mowu Pavilion

181
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,660
to you in the future.

182
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,500
Don't let

183
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,100
Juzi down.

184
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,100
This is

185
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,500
a letter from Juzi.

186
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,100
There is no news about the inkstone.

187
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,860
The great cause in the future depends on it.

188
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,180
As a member of the Pavilion,

189
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,020
you should contribute to the Pavilion.

190
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,380
This is also your mission.

191
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,740
Only those who take great responsibility

192
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,540
can control themselves.

193
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,770
When you succeed,

194
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,580
you and I will meet.

195
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,200
[After marrying into the Xu family,]

[Jufu Inn]

197
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,620
I've spent a lot to hire Litigator Wu

198
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,340
from Chang'an.

199
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,260
He has handled several cases

200
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,580
that impressed the capital.

201

202
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,530
Honey,

203
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,700
Her Ladyship must have done it

204
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,140
for her own good.

205
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,570
How about this?

206
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,740
You can stay in your maiden home first.

207
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,940
When this matter is settled,

208
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,180
I'll pick you up.

209
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,460
If anything happens,

210
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,260
find someone

211
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,100
to send a message back.

212
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,460
Madam is a person who cares about her face.

213
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,740
With we staying here,

214
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,380
she is unhappy.

Honey, I don't think it's a good idea.

218
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,260
Madam.

219
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,570
Madam! Bad news!

220
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,860
Madam! Madam!

221
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,700
Why are you panicking?

222
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,260
How inappropriate!

223
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,180
There are officers outside.

224
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,660
What are they doing here?

225
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,220
The government of Laishui has accepted

226
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,180
your case.

227
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,900
So according to the law,

228
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,620
both parties

229
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:37,860
will be confined.

230
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,620
Who is criminal Xu Qing?

231
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,690
I am.

232
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,100

Are you okay?

242
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,620
Xiaoqin,

243

help Her Ladyship back to her room.

244

[Rich and Powerful Family]

246
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,780
After this,

247
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,860
Her Ladyship's not feeling well,

248
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,620
and Madam has been detained.

249
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,340
The Xu family

250
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,140
is in chaos now.

251
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,060
Your grandfather and I

252
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,060
will stay and help.

253
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,460
Tumi,

254
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,020
after you arrive at the inn,

255
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,020
you need to rest more.

256
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,460
If it's not something important,

257
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,940
just let Xiaoqin do it.

258
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,780
Don't always do it yourself.

259
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,740
Got it.

260
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,940
What about the Xu family's trial...

261
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,340
It seems that

262
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,500
Madam doesn't want us to interfere.

263
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,940
But I want to listen to it.

264
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,380
After all, there are many doubts in it.

265
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,970
We're accompanying Lord Kang to patrol.

266
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,260
If there's injustice,

267
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,740
I can report it to Lord Kang.

268
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,220
Okay.

269
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,700
On the day of the trial,

270
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,420
I'll go with you.

271
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,180
Do you remember that day

272
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,340
the shop owner said

273
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,020
there were some funny places by the lake.

274
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:07,700
Many scholars

275
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,860
liked to come here.

276
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,900
Old Master was once a scholar.

277
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,860
He liked to hold poetry meetings here.

278
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,620
I thought the man who fell into the lake

279
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,140
didn't float up before.

280
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,980
Old Master went missing too.

281
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,620
We haven't found him yet.

282
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,940
Do you mean that

283
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,130
in the two cases, the dead was the same person?

284
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,420
I think it's possible.

285
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,380
But it's just a guess.

286
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,460
I am not sure yet.

287
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,010
I need to go to the crime scene to find out.

288
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,220
Let's go.

289
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,060
Ye,

290
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,140
this is the crime scene.

291
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:38,890
Look,

292
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,570
there are so many things up here.

293
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,060
And this bag

294
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,090
can block the sight

295
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,180
from the shore.

296
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,900
So...

297
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:51,660
Ye,

298
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:52,740
was this

299
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,810
cut by a knife?

300
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,700
It was not a knife.

301
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:55,980
It was a blunt weapon.

302
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,100
A blunt weapon?

303
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,250
I got it.

304
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,580
What is it?

305
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,220
The truth.

306
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,500
But you have to find someone for me first.

307
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,380
Here we are.

308
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,820
Miss Chun...

309
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,020
Why are you hiding here

310
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,220
instead of serving the Xu family?

311
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,060
Miss Chun,

312
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,180
although I'm just a servant,

313
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,340
I can't stay with the Xu family

314
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,660
forever.

315
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,700
I'm old.

316
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,060
My health

317
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,380
is not as good as before.

318
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,740
So I retired and returned to my hometown.

319
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,850
Is that wrong?

320
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:54,740
Then why did you

321
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,660
leave

322
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,380
when Madam got into a lawsuit？

323
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,060
Maybe it was a coincidence.

324
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,540
I told Madam before

325
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,220
and she agreed.

326
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,100
Coincidence?

327
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,620
Then I'll go visit Madam tomorrow

328
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,740
by coincidence.

329
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,220
How about me asking her?

330
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:14,140
Miss Chun.

331
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:15,940
Miss Chun,

332
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:16,940
don't tell Madam

333
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,100
my whereabouts.

334
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,620
I am begging you.

335
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,940
Miss Chun, I am begging you.

336
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,140
I am begging you.

337
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,100
I...

338
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,180
Answer

339
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:33,900
what I ask you.

340
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,620
What happened to the Xu family

341
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,180
a few days ago?

342
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,020
Old Master

343
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,980
liked to meet friends with poems.

344
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:47,620
He often didn't go home

345
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,460
because of poetry meetings.

346
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,500
A few days ago,

347
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,260
Old Master didn't go home.

348
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,020
Madam was anxious,

349
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,260
so she sent people to look for him.

350
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,300
But there was no news.

351
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,300
Madam cared about face,

352
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,900
so she kept it a secret.

353
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,180
She just said that

354
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,420
Old Master went out to play.

355
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,900
But no secrets can be hidden forever

356
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,740
in this world.

357
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,700
The Fan family is poor and greedy.

358
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,700
All these years, Old Master

359
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:20,619
secretly gave them money.

360
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,700
After Old Master got lost,

361
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,819
the Fan family doesn't have money anymore.

362
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,380
They thought the source of money

363
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,540
has disappeared, so they messed around

364
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,060
and asked Madam to pay some money.

365
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,020
Miss Chun,

366
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,300
I didn't want to betray my master.

367
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,260
I had no choice.

368
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,260
So,

369
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,530
you also think that Madam

370
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,980
killed Old Master?

371
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,580
No.

372
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,700
I'm just saying if...

373
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,060
Mrs. Wang has followed Madam

374
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,100
for so many years,

375
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,700
but she still ran away after getting money

376
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,140
when Madam was in trouble.

377
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,170
But I understand her.

378
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,340
She finally got her son out of

379
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,300
slave registration.

380
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,140
And her son married a good woman.

381
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:08,940
Her grandson can take part in

382
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,460
the imperial examination.

383
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,540
If Madam is convicted,

384
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,540
she can't escape responsibility either.

385
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,460
In that case,

386
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,340
her grandson's future will be ruined.

387
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,500
For the sake of her family,

388
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,460
it's understandable

389
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,100
to keep away from this trouble.

390
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,220
I'm just afraid that

391
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,540
she might be used by someone

392
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,860
with ulterior motives and say something

393
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,020
against Madam by then.

394
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,620
She escaped from the Xu family

395
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,780
because she didn't want to be involved.

396
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,260
If the Fan family comes to her,

397
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,540
she will still run away.

398
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,980
I hope so.

399
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,980
Why is it out?

400
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,660
Don't be afraid.

401
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,100
It's fine.

402
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,700
It's just a toad.

403
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,420
Let's go.

404
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:39,980
Ye,

405
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,420
do you think that

406
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,060
we will be together

407
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,740
like this in the future?

408
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,380
Yes.

409
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,100
But we need to wait for some time.

410
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,220
Why?

411
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,180
I need to go out for some business.

412
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,100
I'll be back in a few days.

413
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,700
Are you leaving?

414
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,530
Why didn't you tell me before?

415
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,820
I promise you that

416
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,220
I will come back soon.

417
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,580
Is there anything

418
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,940
that you need my help?

419
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,580
Nothing.

420
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,940
When I heard you were leaving,

421
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,740
I felt empty inside all of a sudden.

422
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,420
It's not just because of this, right?

423
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,580
If you meet any difficulties,

424
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,540
just tell me. I'll help you.

425
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,580
I didn't meet any difficulties.

426
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,860
Since you have something important to do,

427
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,340
get back to business.

428
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,980
Let me help you one last time.

429
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,100
I will get back to business

430
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,660
after I finish this.

431
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,820
Okay.

432
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,420
Have some watermelons.

433
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,500
Gentlemen,

434
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:40,980
try my watermelon.

435
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:41,900
Come on.

436
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,180
It tastes good and sweet.

437
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,660
It's free if it's not sweet.

438
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,620
Not bad.

439
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,540
Why are you here selling watermelons

440
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,180
at night?

441
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,060
I can't sell them all,

442
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:54,740
so I can't go back

443
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,460
to report to my wife.

444
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,660
Please be kind

445
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,420
and buy all my watermelons.

446
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,060
I'll give you a discount.

447
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:03,740
OK.

448
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,740
We'll buy all of

449
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,500
your watermelons.

450
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,700
Thank you.

451
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,660
This watermelon is really good.

452
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,260
Gentlemen,

453
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,620
are there many officers

454
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,940
in the post these days?

455
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,820
What officers are they?

456
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,260
We're all fated to be busy.

457
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,180
However,

458
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,580
we serve people,

459
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,940
while they surround people,

460
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:26,940
right?

461
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,020
Don't talk nonsense.

462
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,500
Guys,

463
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,220
bring the watermelons to the kitchen.

464
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,140
Okay.

465
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:33,660
Pay him.

466
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,980
Thank you so much

467
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,380
for taking care of my business.

468
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,300
I'll bring them inside

469
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,940
for you.

470
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,220
Have a good rest.

471
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,220
Okay, thank you.

472
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:41,740
Thank you.

473
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,020
Let's go.

474
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:43,940
Let's go.

475
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,340
The dishes in the kitchen have been changed

476
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,100
according to your requirements these days.

477
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,540
At least get up and eat some.

478
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,700
With so many people watching me,

479
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,900
who can eat food?

480
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:15,340
You stay.

481
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,580
The rest of you get lost.

482
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,180
What?

483
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,780
Han Feng

484
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,580
surrounded the post

485
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,020
so tightly.

486
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,620
Someone is even on the roof.

487
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,140
Are you afraid that I'll run away?

488
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,740
No, no.

489
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,060
Let's go.

490
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,620
What are you doing?

491
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,300
I just came back from Lord Kang's place.

492
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:36,140
I'm going back to my room.

493
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:36,980
Hurry up.

494
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,140
You don't have to do that.

495
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,300
I'm going to bed now.

496
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,300
Yes.

497
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,660
Who is it?

498
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,060
It's you?

499
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,020
Yes, it's me.

500
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,340
Why are you in my room?

501
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,100
I came to see you, of course.

502
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,450
Lord Han, don't blame me for being reckless.

503
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,340
You're too busy.

504
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,660
If you don't come to me,

505
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,820
I will come to you.

506
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,220
Nonsense.

507
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,100
You insisted on keeping me

508
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:47,900
here.

509
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,300
If I don't talk business with you,

510
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,060
I will waste

511
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,220
my time.

512
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,700
These days,

513
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,140
I've been accommodating you,

514
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,660
but you didn't tell me the truth.

515
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,700
It's late at night,

516
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:10,060
but you come to my room

517
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,260
to talk business?

518
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,460
Of course.

519
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,020
Can I lie to you?

520
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,380
You poked around my desk.

521
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,100
It wasn't me.

522
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,180
Really?

523
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,860
It really wasn't me.

524
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,980
I would have run away

525
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,500
if I wanted to steal your things.

526
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,300
Let's get down to business.

527
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,300
Before I get down to business,

528
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,420
we haven't dictated terms.

529
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,140
How dare you dictate terms with me?

530
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,540
What are you doing?

531
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,860
In the middle of the night,

532
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,940
a girl

533
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,500
barged into a man's room.

534
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,340
I wonder

535
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:54,580
if you are young and ignorant

536
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,340
or naive?

537
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,380
What are you doing?

538
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,700
Before I run out of patience,

539
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,180
think about what you want to say

540
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,420
before you come to see me.

541
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,180
You...

542
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,300
You evil woman!

543
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,340
You are so cruel.

544
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,220
You are so cruel.

545
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,220
I raised your family.

546
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:34,900
Now,

547
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,300
you still sue me in court.

548
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,220
You old witch!

549
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:38,940
Today I'll let you pay with your life.

550
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,580
You are full of nonsense.

551
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:41,940
I was too blind.

552
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:42,980
How could I

553
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,180
become relatives with someone like you?

554
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:44,940
You...

555
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,220
Go away!

556
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,300
Listen.

557
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,820
If you hadn't had a man out there,

558
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:49,620
Nonsense!

559
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,540
Mr. Fan...

560
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:51,460
Calm down.

561
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,780
You're a family.

562
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,380
Here comes the magistrate

563
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,660
Nonsense!

564
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,460
Mr. Fan...

565
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,580
Calm down.

566
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,420
Who are you?

567
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,620
Tell me your name.

568
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:09,900
Your Excellency,

569
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,180
I'm Xu Qing.

570
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,100
Your Excellency, I am Fan Bai,

571
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,260
the second son of the Fan family.

572
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:17,500
What's your relationship with

573
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,820
Fan Jian?

574
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,220
Fan Jian is my husband.

575
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,460
My lord,

576
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,940
Fan Jian is my brother.

577
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,260
What's the point of making a scene in court?

578
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,860
My lord.

579
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,060
This bitch killed my brother.

580
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,340
I will make her pay with her life today.

581
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,540
Please help me!

582
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,220
How inappropriate you are!

583
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,020
Please forgive them.

584
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,300
Fan Bai misses his brother,

585
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,060
so he acted a bit too much.

586
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:50,220
Since you're the Fan family's litigator,

587
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,540
tell me

588
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,020
why you want to accuse Mrs. Xu.

589
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,100
On behalf of the Fan family,

590
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,460
I have written what I want to say

591
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,700
in the indictment.

592
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:08,860
My lord,

593
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,050
[Indictment on behalf of the Fans]

594
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,100
Fan Jian, the elder brother,

595
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,700
went missing for no reason recently.

596
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,740
The Fan family argued with the Xu family,

597
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,860
but the Xu family refused to see them.

598
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:19,060
The Xus didn't explain, and Fan Jian

599
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:22,460
is missing. Fan Bai was afraid his brother

600
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,300
would have been killed by the wicked woman.

601
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,330
so he reported it to the government.

602
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,980
Please make a wise decision,

603
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,580
clear the victim's name,

604
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,780
and redress the grievances of the living.

605
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,340
Why did you call me, Lord Kang?

606
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,620
I heard there was an accident

607
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:37,660
in the Xu family's trial,

608
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:38,900
so I asked you to come here

609
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:39,660
to know more about it.

610
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,180
Although you are sick,

611
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,380
you're well-informed.

612
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,220
The Xu family is rich in Laishui.

613
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,820
Madam is famous for

614
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:46,940
being powerful and domineering.

615
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,620
Besides, Old Master is missing,

616
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,900
and the Fan family wants to make a big fuss.

617
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,740
It's hard not to know.

618
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,020
This is indeed complicated.

619
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:55,940
The Fan family's litigator

620
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:57,220
found the Xu family's servant

621
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,220
and asked them to testify that

622
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,660
Madam always bullied Old Master.

623
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,980
So, they will conclude that

624
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:04,460
Madam murdered Old Master.

625
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,220
Old Madam

626
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,500
didn't respect her husband.

627
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,700
Although Old Master

628
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,540
was a Master,

629
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,500
he was always

630
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,380
under Madam's control.

631
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,380
Madam's always domineering.

632
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,060
She often cursed servants

633
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:16,380
like us.

634
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,740
She even beat us.

635
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,060
I treated Old Master

636
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,980
that day.

637
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,700
There were many bruises on his body.

638
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,530
The way the couple gets along

639
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,020
with each other

640
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,460
is really unique.

641
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,900
But this can't be the reason

642
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,420
for Madam's murder.

643
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,820
Even an upright official finds it hard to

644
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,860
settle a family quarrel. If a couple doesn't

645
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,060
get along well, Madam shouldn't be

646
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,660
the only one to blame.

647
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,580
Everything has two sides.

648
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,290
We can't just listen to one side.

649
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,740
Fan Jian

650
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,740
is a man of scholarly honor.

651
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,220
But he abandoned the teaching

652
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,490
and coveted wealth and vanity.

653
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,100
With no one forcing him,

654
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,380
he volunteered to marry into the Xu family

655
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,500
when his parents were alive.

656
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,300
Can such a person

657
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,020
be called outstanding?

658
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,100
The litigator of the Xu family

659
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,180
is talking about other affairs.

660
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,980
He is also distracting others' attention.

661
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,180
But the Fan family is suing Madam

662
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,420
related to Old Master's disappearance.

663
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,220
They even thought

664
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:12,860
if Madam

665
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,940
killed him.

666
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:15,900
It's not just about money.

667
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,780
He's using others' strength to fight.

668
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,780
Old Master always tried to

669
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,700
swindle money.

670
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,860
If we refused,

671
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,420
he threatened us that

672
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,100
he would let us take the responsibility

673
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,580
of the loss.

674
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,060
Old Master

675
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,380
always ate and took things away for free.

676
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,220
He often brought the Fans here.

677
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,100
We couldn't do business

678
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,620
anymore.

679
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,300
Old Master

680
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,340
often

681
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,820
made a move on us

682
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:40,980
when Madam was not around,

683
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,300
He even threatened us

684
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,820
if we dared to disobey,

685
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,700
he would sell us to human traffickers.

686
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,180
The Fan family's litigator also mentioned

687
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:47,980
taking a concubine

688
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,900
This is normal.

689
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,180
But Madam

690
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,380
didn't fulfill her duty as a wife

691
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,780
and didn't carry on the child.

692
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,540
It's not beneficial

693
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,940
for Madam.

694
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,660
The case has been about the discords

695
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,380
between the husband and the wife.

696
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,740
But about what happened

697
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,300
on the day when Old Master went missing,

698
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,020
there are no clues.

699
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,380
The litigator of the Xu family

700
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,300
must find

701
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,260
a breakthrough.

702
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,740
Lord Kang,

703
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,580
have you heard that a few days ago,

704
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,900
someone fell into the lake

705
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,940
but has never floated?

706
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:18,380
Did the Xu family's litigator say that

707
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,460
Old Master fell into the lake?

708
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:22,540
He said it for sure.

709
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,780
Magistrate Shan sent someone to investigate

710
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,770
and have salvaged that day,

711
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,220
but he found nothing.

712
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,420
Since the Xu family's litigator is so sure

713
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,900
that the deceased was Old Master,

714
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,700
it shows that he has

715
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,020
a clear witness.

716
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,540
Yes.

717
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:37,940
Before the trial,

718
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,620
I did my best.

719
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,100
I looked for evidence there

720
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,260
with Fan Jian's portrait.

721
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,940
Fan Jian had a nightmare that day.

722
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,100
He was bewitched by a female ghost.

723
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,060
In the middle of the night,

724
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,900
he screamed, ran out of the inn,

725
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,140
and died in the lake.

726
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,090
Many people saw it.

727
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:56,100
A man screamed and ran out

728
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,260
with his hair spread...

729
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,740
The description of these characteristics

730
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,860
are very vague.

731
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,220
And it was dark at that time.

732
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:05,660
How could they be sure that

733
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,460
the one they saw was Fan Jian?

734
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,260
The Xu family's litigator thinks that

735
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:10,980
Old Master

736
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,460
was bewitched by the ghost,

737
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,780
so he jumped into the lake.

738
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,260
But he also said

739
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,740
when Old Master ran out,

740
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:17,580
many people followed him.

741
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,740
With all eyes watching and the lights on,

742
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,020
how can there be ghosts

743
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,820
in such an environment?

744
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,860
This is contradictory.

745
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,460
If the person who jumped into the lake

746
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,740
was really Old Master,

747
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:28,740
I'm afraid this matter

748
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,980
is not that simple.

749
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,220
If it was done by someone...

750
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,100
This was the detail

751
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,260
the litigator of the Fan Family caught.

752
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,340
My Lord,

753
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,180
please summon our witness,

754
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,940
the most trusted

755
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,620
and most reliable, Mrs. Wang, to the court.

756
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:44,900
Send her in.

757
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,580
Your Excellency, the witness is here.

758
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,460
Mrs. Wang,

759
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,340
just tell me

760
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:58,780
what you know.

761
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,900
You're just a servant.

762
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,850
You have nothing to do

763
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,100
masters' behaviors.

764
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,980
You can go home

765
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,420
after you say things clearly.

766
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,260
Otherwise, your family will be doomed

767
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,780
if you are counted as an accomplice.

768
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,500
My lord,

769
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,780
Old Master

770
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,340
likes to travel around.

771
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,490
It's common for him to stay outside.

772
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,740
But Madam doesn't care about it.

773
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,180
But these days,

774
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,340
because Miss

775
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,380
was sent back to her maiden home,

776
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,220
Madam was really angry

777
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,570
and wanted to go to Youzhou

778
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,540
to seek justice from Mr. Chun.

779
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,620
But she didn't expect that

780
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,900
on the way

781
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,460
she would meet Old Master

782
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,420
who attended a poetry meeting.

783
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,460
Somehow,

784
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:47,740
Old Master asked Madam

785
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,220
to agree to take a concubine.

786
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,780
Otherwise, they would divorce.

787
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,370
After Madam heard it, she got furious.

788
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,180
She chased Old Master and beat him up.

789
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,020
Old Master kneeled and begged for mercy.

790
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,860
Madam didn't listen.

791
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,380
She said

792
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,900
you married into my family,

793
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,460
your life belongs to the Xu family.

794
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,980
I will kill you today.

795
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,620
Later, Old Master said

796
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,540
he didn't want to live and ran out.

797
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:13,940
Madam shouted die as you like.

798
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:14,940
I don't believe

799
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,340
you have the guts.

800
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:18,620
But Mrs. Wang's testimony

801
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,580
can only prove

802
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,210
the last person Old Master met

803
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,340
before he went missing

804
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,460
was Madam.

805
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,139
Although they quarreled,

806
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:25,980
Madam

807
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:27,860
has been with the servants.

808
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,460
This is also

809
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,500
her alibi.

810
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,340
But her last words

811
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,460
are enough

812
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,820
to make her continue to be framed.

813
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:35,780
Fan Jian is a man of scholarly honor,

814
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,100
and he is healthy.

815
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,980
And he married into a rich family.

816
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,540
Why did he want to die?

817
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,659
Unless he was insulted

818
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,699
and did it out of anger.

819
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:46,850
Even so,

820
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,530
he jumped into the lake

821
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:50,060
himself.

822
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,500
It can't prove that

823
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,260
Madam killed him.

824
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,699
Did the other party file

825
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,900
manslaughter charge?

826
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,260
According to the law of our dynasty,

827
00:34:58,410 --> 00:34:59,860
there are premeditated murders, killing in

828
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:00,980
playing games and manslaughter. They are

829
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:01,900
all murders.

830
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,060
The Fan family's litigator

831
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,740
used this

832
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,180
to point out that

833
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,420
words can also kill people.

834
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,300
Words are also weapons.

835
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,300
My lord,

836
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,540
although Madam Xu

837
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,300
provide food, drinks, and things to use,

838
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,580
but psychologically

839
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,460
she tortured and oppressed Old Master

840
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,900
for over 20 years.

841
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:19,820
That day,

842
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,820
she humiliated, bullied him,

843
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,140
and made him commit suicide in anger.

844
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,300
Although Madam Xu didn't

845
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,180
push Old Master Xu into the lake,

846
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,220
it's not different from pushing him down.

847
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:32,020
Father and son are the closest.

848
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,980
The couple is the closest.

849
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:34,820
What deep hatred is there

850
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,650
between the two so that

851
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,740
they have to go this far?

852
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,580
There's one more thing I don't understand.

853
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,740
Why doesn't the sinking body

854
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,460
float?

855
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,370
I've heard that

856
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,300
some people are good at swimming

857
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,060
can stay in the water for several hours.

858
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,380
Could it be...

859
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,900
Fan Jian was the one who ran,

860
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,500
but the one who jumped into the lake...

861
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,020
The one who jumped into the lake

862
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,060
might be someone else.

863
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:01,340
My lord,

864
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:04,620
Mrs. Fan has two sons.

865
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,220
The elder son is Fan Jian,

866
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,980
and the younger son is Fan Bai.

867
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,860
I accidentally heard that

868
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,660
Fan Bai is a good swimmer.

869
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,180
It's said that when he competed with fish,

870
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,940
fish failed.

871
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,060
He and Fan Jian have the same mother.

872
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,580
It's normal for them to

873
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,580
look alike.

874
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,300
Maybe

875
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,140
they colluded

876
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,700
to imprison Mrs. Xu

877
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,900
so that steal the property of the Xu family.

878
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,940
Brothers look mostly similar.

879
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,180
Besides, Fan Bai swims well.

880
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,380
This is related to

881
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,700
the case.

882
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,540
That's because you've never seen Fan Bai.

883
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,980
The litigator of the Xu family,

884
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,500
it seems that you don't know

885
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,900
how my brother looks.

886
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,500
You can ask this vicious woman

887
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,540
why she was so eager

888
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:48,930
to marry my brother by then.

889
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,500
That was because my brother

890
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,540
was handsome.

891
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,380
The litigator of the Xu family

892
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,260
didn't know

893
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,290
the situation of the two brothers.

894
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,820
He did it in a hurry.

895
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:58,700
He thought he had

896
00:36:58,900 --> 00:36:59,900
strong evidence,

897
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:00,980
but in fact, he made a scene

898
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,260
and lost credibility.

899
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,500
If someone proposes a possibility,

900
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,940
he has to find solid evidence.

901
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:05,860
If not,

902
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,580
the court won't agree with

903
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,500
his opinion.

904
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,220
Otherwise, the court will believe

905
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,660
the opinions of Fan's litigator.

906
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:11,900
So,

907
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,180
Madam will be sentenced.

908
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,820
The criminal, Mrs. Xu,

909
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,620
since you're a woman

910
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,140
and you said you were wronged all the time,

911
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,130
I'll give you another chance.

912
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,140
If you still can't tell me anything useful,

913
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,700
the law is ruthless.

914
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,020
I am a local official.

915
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,180
I will follow the law,

916
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,100
and I won't tolerate you.

917
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,660
-My lord, I... -My lord.

918
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,260
This vicious woman is vicious.

919
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:35,900
Now we have solid evidence.

920
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:36,700
Please

921
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,340
help

922
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,220
my poor brother.

923
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,260
My lord,

924
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,540
the truth is obvious.

925
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,580
First, Mrs. Xu cornered the dead.

926
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,020
Then, she refused to save the dead.

927
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,580
At last, she hid the truth.

928
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,420
Three crimes shall be punished together.

929
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,060
She can't atone for her crimes with money.

930
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,300
So please punish her severely,

931
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,340
and give Fan Jian justice

932
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:53,780
so that he won't have to sleep at the bottom

933
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,780
of the lake, can see the sun again,

934
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,460
and rest in peace.

935
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,980
Criminal, Mrs. Xu,

936
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,140
murdered her husband

937
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,180
for family disputes.

938
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,730
The evidence is solid.

939
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,180
I hereby sentence

940
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,060
Mrs. Xu...

941
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,140
Wait, my lord.

942
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,690
[Wholehearted Devotion to Public Duty]

943
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,580
Who are you?

944
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:13,700
My lord,

945
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,580
I am Chun Tumi.

946
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,060
I came to the court today

947
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,650
to appeal instead of Madam Xu.

948
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:19,980
So,

949
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,260
did you agree to appeal?

950
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:23,820
Yes, I agreed.

951
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,060
At 1 p.m. tomorrow,

952
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,380
the second trial will begin

953
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,820
by the lake where Fan Jian fell.

954
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,420
In that case,

955
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,140
Then I'll drink tea instead of wine

956
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,740
hoping you

957
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,020
fight well.
