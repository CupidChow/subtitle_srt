[Episode 13]

4
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:55,259
Your Highness.

5
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:55,820
Lord Kang.

6
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:56,940
-My lord. -My lord.

7
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,620
Where are the guards?

8
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,820
They were all killed.

9
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,180
Do you know who did it?

10
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,220
It will take some time.

11
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,940
Send more men.

12
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,220
We can't let this happen again.

13
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:10,780
Yes.

14
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,300
Could it be Luo Li?

15
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,540
That would be too stupid of him.

16
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,380
He could have waited

17
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,380
till we leave Youzhou.

18
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,620
He wanted to show his authority?

19
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,700
Otherwise, who would it be that Chun Tumi offended

20
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,140
that was worth the trouble of an assassin?

21
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,340
Anyway,

22
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,740
I'll send more men

23
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:29,900
to ensure safety.

24
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,180
The latch

25
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,540
was cut off by some sharp weapon.

26
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,660
The cut was extremely smooth.

27
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:48,460
Besides, the latch

28
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,500
was only scratched a bit from the surface.

29
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,540
There were no other major damages.

30
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,579
The killer

31
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,820
killed the patrol guards.

32
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,620
The person who saved her

33
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,300
killed the killer.

34
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,940
It was my fault.

35
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:04,700
Captain Chun.

36
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:05,260
Yes.

37
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,780
You will be in charge

38
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,220
to arrange more men to strengthen security.

39
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,660
Just do it.

40
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,540
Yes, Lord Kang.

41
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:12,780
But

42
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,820
I'm still worried

43
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:17,260
that the killer just got the wrong person.

44
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,460
So please

45
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,780
be careful.

46
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,060
I will do the night patrol in person in the future.

47
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,850
I invited you here

48
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,860
hoping that you

49
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,500
could be more cautious.

50
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,220
Better to catch the real murderer behind it.

51
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,140
Don't worry.

52
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,860
I've sent people

53
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,020
to check it around here.

54
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,140
I wouldn't miss anything

55
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,740
if there's any trail.

56
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,940
This is a good dagger.

57
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,540
The blade is as thin as a cicada's wing.

58
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,260
It can penetrate the smallest crack

59
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,780
and is so sharp that it cuts iron like it were mud.

60
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,980
Such a magical dagger.

61
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,380
Must be hard to get.

62
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,900
Who would take so much trouble to kill me?

63
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,740
That's what I don't understand.

64
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,060
Even if Luo Li hates you,

65
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,860
he wouldn't be so bold to do this.

66
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,460
Besides,

67
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,580
this killer is so skilled.

68
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,380
Killing me

69
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,540
would be like stepping on an ant.

70
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,300
It's not worth his trouble.

71
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,860
He must have wanted to kill you.

72
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,980
But he got into the wrong room.

73
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,019
You really don't know

74
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,649
who saved you?

75
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:22,580
Tumi.

76
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,300
The one who saved you is the key to solving the case.

77
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,700
You trust him

78
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:26,940
more than you trust me

79
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,900
and Lord Kang?

80
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,140
I have no idea.

81
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,580
Have you had any conflict

82
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:43,100
with anyone recently?

83
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:45,860
With someone who can afford to hire the killer?

84
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,020
No, I haven't.

85
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,740
If it was an assassination,

86
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,260
it should be me that they wanted to assassinate.

87
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,780
How could they go to you?

88
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,500
It was not something lucky.

89
00:04:53,659 --> 00:04:55,140
What's there to fight for?

90
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,659
Could it be those thieves?

91
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,100
I must have guessed something right

92
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,260
when we were solving the case

93
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,420
that made them worry.

94
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,540
So they wanted to kill me.

95
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,420
That makes sense.

96
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:05,980
No matter who it was,

97
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,740
Luo Li or those thieves,

98
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,090
we probably were the reason

99
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:09,780
for this trouble.

100
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,860
If I didn't ask you to go to court,

101
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,620
you wouldn't have encountered this.

102
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,140
I knew it must be you who dragged me into this.

103
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,420
But it has happened.

104
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,540
Complaining doesn't help.

105
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,060
We can only try to solve it.

106
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,700
Lord Han,

107
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,260
since you know you were sorry,

108
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,220
remember

109
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,180
what you promised me.

110
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,980
To get my family out of the military registration.

111
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,300
Don't worry.

112
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:33,620
I'll keep my word.

113
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,700
But

114
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,460
I want to know

115
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,140
what Luo Li lost.

116
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,540
If we leave

117
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,980
with all these issues unsolved,

118
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,340
I'll be left hanging.

119
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,140
Youzhou is who's protecting

120
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,340
the capital.

121
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:49,650
Lord Han,

122
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,659
all questions have answers.

123
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,580
If you

124
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,980
don't have the answer now,

125
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,260
that means it's not time yet

126
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,620
to find it.

127
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,220
What are you doing?

128
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,620
Packing.

129
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,180
We'll leave Youzhou

130
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:15,740
after things are finished.

131
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,020
I didn't plan to leave.

132
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,020
Young Master,

133
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,100
think about it.

134
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,060
Everything you liked since you were little,

135
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,620
what happened to them in the end?

136
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:37,980
Do you know

137
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,900
that Chun Tumi

138
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,220
saved me once?

139
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,100
At the Guanting Canyon.

140
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,980
Back then,

141
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,900
I was like a crazy dog.

142
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,060
She was the only one

143
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,060
who saw me that way

144
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,300
but who wasn't afraid.

145
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,300
For my whole life,

146
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,860
everyone respects me,

147
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,780
is scared of me,

148
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:07,780
hates me,

149
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,730
lies to me, blames me,

150
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,620
flatters me,

151
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,060
and pities me.

152
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,900
But no one

153
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,100
understands me.

154
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,140
No one wants to know me.

155
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:23,500
No one cares about who I like

156
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,490
and what I encountered.

157
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,180
Let me ask you.

158
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:38,020
To you, I'm the Young Master,

159
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,020
someone you want to follow all your life.

160
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,980
But other than that,

161
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,740
who am I to you?

162
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,780
Young Master.

163
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,420
No matter who was the killer,

164
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,700
it must be that guy

165
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,100
who saved Tumi.

166
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,860
I don't understand.

167
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:01,620
What exactly

168
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,780
does Mowu Pavilion do?

169
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,100
It has nothing to do with Mowu Pavilion.

170
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,260
He fell in love with Tumi.

171
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,140
I'm not surprised that he saved her.

172
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
I'm surprised

173
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,580
she kept the secret for him.

174
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,420
She trusts him

175
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,100
more than she trusts us.

176
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,380
Why didn't you

177
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
keep asking her?

178
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,020
For the sake of the country,

179
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,260
His Majesty asked us to compromise.

180
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,580
To keep the overall situation steady,

181
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,860
we pushed her to the front.

182
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,900
We owe her.

183
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,260
Although she didn't know

184
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,220
about His Majesty's secret edict,

185
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,140
it was an easy guess for her

186
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,300
to know our concerns.

187
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,260
She put herself out there without hesitation

188
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,140
and defended Shan Yi

189
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,179
for the lawsuit.

190
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,179
I thought I could protect her,

191
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,820
but I let this happen to her.

192
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,220
In court,

193
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,980
we did try to protect her,

194
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,220
but she was capable enough

195
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:47,300
to deal with Luo Li.

196
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,540
Now,

197
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,340
if you ask me to keep pushing her,

198
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,020
I really...

199
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,860
You did the right thing.

200
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,220
I'll take care of the rest.

201
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,100
I'll investigate.

202
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,220
I won't let anything happen to her again.

203
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,020
A lot

204
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:58,940
has happened

205
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,060
during the patrol.

206
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,300
Let me think about it.

207
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,820
What's there to think about?

208
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,020
It's obvious that

209
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,300
it was me that they were after.

210
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,460
They tried to poison you once,

211
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,460
and kill Chun Tumi once.

212
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,060
Do they think I'm dead?

213
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:11,860
Guards!

214
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,220
Wuwei, slow down.

215
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,300
Now that we are here,

216
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,660
don't act rashly.

217

Your Highness.

218
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:19,020
Lord Han.

219
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,860
I called them over

220
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:25,540
to reinforce the security.

221
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,100
Okay.

222
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,660
I'll join you.

223
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:49,740
My lady,

224
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,460
you didn't rest well yesterday.

225
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,460
Why making this? It's not good for your eyes.

226
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,100
This is my entry for the skill competition.

227
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:56,170
If I lose,

228
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,700
I'll give it to the winner.

229
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,140
Of course, you'll lose.

230

how could you win?

233
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,380
I couldn't even make Qiaoguo well.

234
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,060
I won't lose this again,

235
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:10,580
will I?

236
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,140
Wait.

237
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,460
My lady,

238
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,540
Master Chun won't let you go out.

239
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,540
Of course, he won't.

240
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,180
I won't tell him.

241
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,900
I'll go in secret and come back in secret.

242
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,660
Are you out of your mind?

243
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:26,580
What?

244
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,700
You want to rat on me?

245
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,140
My Lady,

246
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,140
can't you just stay here?

247
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,540
If you feel bored,

248
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,540
why don't you ask Lord Kang

249
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,940
for some files to review?

250
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,780
No.

251
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,620
I have something important to do out there.

252
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:42,700
No.

253
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,180
Captain Chun.

254
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,330
Why are you standing outside?

255
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,220
Lord Han.

256
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:58,980
Lord Han.

257
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,820
I feel more assured to keep her company.

258
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,180
Did she sleep well last night?

259
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,020
My daughter,

260
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,940
she looks like she's fearless of nothing.

261
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,620
She comforted me

262
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,580
and joked that the killer went to the wrong room.

263
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,220
But it was her first time seeing blood.

264
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
How could she not be scared?

265

You also pretended to believe

what she said

267

to make her feel better.

268

That's what families do.

Lord Han,

270
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,700
was it Lord Luo who did this?

271
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,540
I know my rank is low.

272
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,220
But she's my only daughter.

273
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:34,980
I'll risk my life

274

to protect her.

275

Please tell me

276

what I should do.

Tumi is a treasure you can't hide.

287

more and more famous in the future.

289

She has the skills.

290
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,300
Do you really want to hide her

291
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,940
from showing the world what she can do?

292
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,860
The more famous and well-known she becomes,

293
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,180
the safer she will be.

294

346
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,380
So fast? Not bad.

347
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,860

although this is not the best,

363
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,740
it's better than mine.

Here.

365
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,660
Madam,

366
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,700
I want to exchange this handkerchief

367

with that lady's handkerchief.

368
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,940
Which lady?

369
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,220
This is against the rules.

370
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,700
You can't do this.

371
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,100
This is against the rules.

372
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:52,980
Right.

373
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,220
I think this one looks better.

374
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,970
But mine is...

375
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:58,540
Stop it.

376
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,380
Let's go.

377
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,380

378

This looks nice.

379

Try this.

380
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,099
Where did you buy this?

381
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,740
Miss, take a look at this.

382
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:07,220
Okay.

383
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,819
Any news about Ayili?

384
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,099
A few days ago,

385
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:12,980
I saw her outside the city.

386
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,819
But I lost her.

387
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,500
If Ayili was just being naughty,

388
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,780
and came out to see Young Master,

389
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,060
it doesn't worry me.

390
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,460
But I'm worried she may be used

391
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,099
and do something bad

392
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,260
to the Pavilion and Young Master.

393
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,290
Don't worry, Grand Secretary.

394
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,579
I'll find her as soon as possible.

395
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,980
Find her fast.

396
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,660
Don't let Young Master worry.

397
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,380
Yes.

398
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,140
Sir,

399
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,260
how about three coppers for five?

400
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,180
Three coppers for five?

401
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,060
Sir, another bowl.

402
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:45,540
Okay.

403
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,740
Look over there.

404
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,420
They are selling embroidery balls.

405
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,620
Actually,

406
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,620
they eembroidered better.

407
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,340
The one I embroidered is ordinary.

408
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,420
As long as you like it.

409
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,820
Ye, do you want candied haws?

410
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:00,300
Have one, please?

411
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,020
You want one?

412
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:02,620
Sure.

413
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:03,980
How much is it?

414
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:04,740
Two coins.

415
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:05,940
Okay.

416
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,300
Here.

417
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:09,740
Thank you.

418
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,060
Here it is.

419
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:12,700
Thank you.

420
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,420
Do you have some?

421
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:19,700
No, thank you.

422
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,140
Really, no?

423
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,860
It's all mine then.

424
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,340
Is it good?

425
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:34,700
Let's go.

426
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,340
Let's go.

427
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,100
The clouds are thick today.

428
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,780
I can't see the stars.

429
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,250
But it's not bad

430
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,300
just watching the lanterns.

431
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,450
Be patient.

432
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:57,660
What?

433
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,340
You can change the weather?

434
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,140
Ye,

435
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,740
you said you owe me three lives.

436
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,300
How did you calculate?

437
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,820
Does it count last night?

438
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,300
Why do you ask?

439
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,940
If it counts last night,

440
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,580
I've already used one.

441
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,180
It's better to make it clear.

442
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,020
Why are you laughing?

443
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,620
I'm not.

444
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,540
You just did.

445
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:33,900
You have the final say.

446
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,980
What do you mean?

447
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,700
It's your say to decide how many are left.

448
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,780
You decide.

449
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,900
Then it's a deal.

450
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,500
I have the final say.

451
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,940
I'd say you owe me three lives.

452
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,420
I'll be your creditor.

453
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,780
I tell you

454
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,060
when to pay me back.

455
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,540
Before I do,

456
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,060
you can't get yourself hurt.

457
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,180
Not even a hair.

458
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,100
I'm leaving Youzhou tomorrow.

459
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,820
I don't know

460
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,740
when we can meet again.

461
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,260
You can't come to visit me every time.

462
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,740
So,

463
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,780
you must stay safe.

464
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:12,900
I promise you.

465
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,940
Ye, hold this for me.

466
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,300
Tumi...

467
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,740
So beautiful.

468
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,060
Tumi.

469
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,580
My name is Yaksha.

470
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,700
Yaksha?

471
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,580
Is it the name

472
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,260
of that ghost in the Buddhist scripture?

473
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,980
Why this name?

474
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,460
Maybe my father thought

475
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,900
ghosts hated me.

476
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,100
Maybe your father

477
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,620
wanted the ghosts to stay away from you

478
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,460
to keep you safe.

479
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:14,890
Give me your hand.

480
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,780
From now on,

481
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,900
I'll protect you.

482
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,860
Do you want some, Miss?

483
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,300
Yes.

484
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,780
Four coins.

485
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:57,860
Thank you.

486
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,020
Miss.

487
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:00,740
Miss.

488
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:01,740
Sir,

489
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,380
how much is this?

490
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,380
Four coins for one.

491
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,100
Four coins?

492
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,540
Yes.

493
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,100
Wait.

494
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,580
Where did you get the wallet?

495
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,660
From the girl just now.

496
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,660
I wanted to wait...

497
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,300
Young Master.

498
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,020
Don't move.

499
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,140
What are you doing?

500
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,780
Are you crazy?

501
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,690
The Jinx?

502
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,900
Who are you talking to?

503
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:43,980
Who is the jinx?

504
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,100
Thank you, you kind man.

505
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,460
Hold on.

506
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:00,540
Ye,

507
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,580
let's buy a windmill.

508
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,180
-Thank you. -Okay.

509
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,500
Sir,

510
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,020
how much is this windmill?

511
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,180
Two coins.

512
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:10,780
Here.

513
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,140
Here you are.

514
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,180
The windmill moves and brings luck.

515
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,140
Miss,

516
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,380
you'll be lucky.

517
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,140
Thank you, sir.

518
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:28,780
Is the assassin

519
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,780
related to Mowu Pavilion?

520
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,060
No.

521
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,940
How do you explain the freezing needle?

522
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,500
Young Master,

523
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,900
do you remember

524
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,380
the bird you kept when you were little?

525
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,980
In Mowu Pavilion,

526
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,540
you can't like

527
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,980
nor love anyone or anything.

528
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,260
This is what you have to accept

529
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,500
growing up in Mowu Pavilion.

530
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,380
Did you

531
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,820
forget everything

532
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,380
Juzi told you

533
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,220
since you were a kid?

534
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,060
I won't forget what my father said.

535
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,850
But when can I meet him?

536
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,940
If it weren't for

537
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,380
that girl, the litigator,

538
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,340
you wouldn't ask to see him.

539
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,860
You've always been obedient.

540
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,460
After we return to the pavilion,

541
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,060
I'll arrange for you to meet him.

542
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,020
But don't forget

543
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,460
to find the inkstone.

544
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,540
Keep a closed eye on Han Wuwei.

545
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:47,580
I will never let Han Wuwei

546
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,780
have it.

547
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,500
How is Li?

548
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:55,860
Good.

549
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,620
She's doing well.

550
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,460
I want to meet her.

551
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,940
I wanted to bring her out to meet you.

552
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,420
But you were injured and missing.

553
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,100
I'll report to Juzi

554
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,940
and see what he says.

555
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,380
Before I meet my father,

556
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,940
I will keep looking for the inkstone.

557
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,460
I hope others from Mowu Pavilion

558
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,100
could stay focused and don't act otherwise.

559
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:43,820
You...

560
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,620
Why did you steal my wallet?

561
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,100
Can you prove I did?

562
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,860
Exhibit? I don't have the wallet.

563
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,860
Witness? Who saw it?

564
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,860
But you,

565
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,100
how dare you to rob a civilian girl

566
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,260
in broad daylight?

567
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,660
At such a young age,

568
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,020
you have a lot to reason.

569
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,490
At such an old age,

570
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,740
you have a lot of evil thoughts.

571
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,100
I wonder if you can still

572
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,380
be so eloquent

573
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,580
in jail.

574
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,580
What do you mean?

575
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:26,980
Paying me back with a hairpin?

576
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,700
This is premium.

577
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,820
It's more than enough to make up for your money.

578
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,500
Can I go now?

579
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:39,980
Wait.

580
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,380
What is this?

581
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:50,620
I don't know.

582
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:52,260
It fell from you,

583
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,340
and you don't know?

584
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,340
I have a bad memory.

585
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,700
I can't remember many things.

586
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:58,980
Eat it.

587
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,380
I'm not sick. Why should I?

588
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:03,100
How do you know this is medicine?

589
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,140
Did you take it before?

590
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,020
No, I don't know what you're talking about.

591
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,740
I've paid you back.

592
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,820
We're even.

593
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,620
I have the exactly same one.

594
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:20,020
I found it

595
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,140
from someone from Mowu Pavilion.

596
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,700
What's your relationship with Mowu Pavilion?

597
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:36,780
What is that?

598
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:37,810
Never heard of it.

599
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,340
I...

600
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,220
I found it.

601
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:41,620
You found it?

602
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:42,660
What?

603
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,690
You found one

604
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,940
but I couldn't?

605
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:46,620
Wait.

606
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:47,980
I've paid back

607
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,140
the money I owed you.

608
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:50,210
I have nothing

609
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,420
to do with anything you asked.

610
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,620
Now,

611
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,540
I'm going home.

612
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,540
Move!

613
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,420
Who asked you to stop me?

614
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,820
You have such a bad memory.

615
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,180
I'm worried

616
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,820
what if you get lost leaving like that.

617
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,100
Let me go!

618
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,820
Let me go!

619
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,580
Let me go!

620
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,380
When you remember who you are,

621
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,220
I'll send someone to escort you back.

622
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,060
Stop!

623
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,380
Let me out!

624
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,180
I was orderd to go with the patrol,

625
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,700
I didn't have time to deal with family matters.

626
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,580
It needs more than a piece of paper

627
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,820
to divorce your wife.

628
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:47,980
In fact, Xu didn't commit any of the Seven Sins.

629
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,660
But she drugged me.

630
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,820
That was a good reason

631
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,980
to divorce her.

632
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,380
But I left in a hurry.

633
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,220
So I asked her to go back to her parents

634
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,340
to think about it.

635
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,380
I wanted to talk about it when I come back

636
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,420
between our two families,

637
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:06,180
cover the scandal,

638
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,500
and find a decent reason for an amicable divorce.

639
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,860
But unexpectedly,

640
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,460
she got pregnant.

641
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,820
How silly.

642
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,500
Now Xu is suing you

643
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,940
for abandoning her

644
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,580
for your career.

645
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,500
Father,

646
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,780
you know

647
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,580
I'd never do that.

648
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,500
I know you're not someone

649
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,980
without conscience.

650
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,340
But what about the others?

651
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,380
I'll go to Lord Kang now

652
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,180
to ask for a leave.

653
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,980
I'll go to Laishui to visit her family

654
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,380
and make things clear.

655
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,300
Did you get anything?

656
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,500
She was very stubborn.

657
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,140
But when I mentioned Mowu Pavilion,

658
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,020
she obviously looked different.

659
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,540
Maybe she has something

660
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,780
to with Mowu Pavilion.

661
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,860
Judging from the way she dresses,

662
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,820
she doesn't look like one from a poor family.

663
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,660
But why did she steal?

664
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,620
From you?

665
00:30:58,610 --> 00:30:59,740
You mean

666
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:01,620
she did it on purpose?

667
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,420
I'm not sure.

668
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,180
But we have to

669
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,780
keep a close eye on this girl.

670
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,020
Lord Kang.

671
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,500
I need to see you.

672
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,100
Come in.

673
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,140
Captain Chun, what's the matter?

674
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,580
I have some family emergencies

675
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,820
to deal with.

676
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,420
My lords, I want to

677
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:26,940
ask for a leave.

678
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,850
From now on,

679
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,020
I'll protect you.

680
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,620
[Graceland]

681
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:42,740
Lord Luo,

682
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,460
sorry for all the trouble during the last few days.

683
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,540
Please forgive us.

684
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,380
It wasn't just Lord Luo

685
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,860
who was troubled.

686
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,340
The whole city

687
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,340
may have been troubled.

688
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,220
Don't say that, Lord Han.

689
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,580
Even my guards

690
00:32:58,780 --> 00:32:59,860
have learned a lot

691
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,340
from what you did here in Youzhou.

692
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,540
I don't know

693
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:05,940
when we can

694
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,100
meet again.

695
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:13,990
[Graceland]

696
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,700
There are many beasts and bandits

697
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,900
on the way in the rural areas.

698
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,740
I hope both of you lords

699
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,820
and the lady from the Chun family

700
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,180
to take care

701
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,340
on the way.

702
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,420
Thank you.

703
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,420
But I believe good people will be blessed.

704
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,500
Lord Luo.

705
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,180
Take care.

706
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:42,420
Let's go.

707
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,310
[Graceland]

708
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:04,860
Young Master.

709
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,020
They left.

710
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,340
Keep following them.

711
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,500
Yes.

712
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,219
It will take at least more than half a day

713
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,699
to get to the post.

714
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,900
If you want to starve to death,

715
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,100
I won't stop you.

716
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:19,260
My hands were tied,

717
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,540
how could I eat?

718
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:23,730
Stop.

719
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,219
With you here,

720
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,940
I can't run away.

721
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,060
This is too shabby.

722
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,140
Don't you have any decent dagger

723
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,820
in Mowu Pavilion?

724
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,140
Or

725
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,260
you were just a maid

726
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,380
who got kicked out after stealing money?

727
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,300
This thing really can't hurt anyone.

728
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,460
Then you'd better be careful.

729
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,850
Don't get hurt by this thing

730
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:45,940
and get laughed at by yourself.

731
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,420
My hairpin is very expensive.

732
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,660
I didn't eat your food for free.

733
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,140
Your father and I can solve

734
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,100
Xu's issue.

735
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,660
Why do you have to come?

736
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:39,980
Xu and her servant

737
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,180
have been holding a grudge against you because your father loves you more.

738
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,780
If you can solve it in private,

739
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,170
I won't come.

740
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,140
But Xu

741
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,860
sued my father in court.

742
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,620
I don't want you two to suffer.

743
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:50,850
So I came.

744
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:53,060
Lord Kang and Lord Han

745
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:54,100
have agreed to my request.

746
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,660
Grandfather, don't think too much.

747
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:56,860
Besides,

748
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,100
if I don't come with you,

749
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,460
I won't be able to eat

750
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,500
or sleep.

751
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,460
You want to see me like that?

752
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,820
You're too eloquent.

753
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,260
Anyway,

754
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,340
we Chun family

755
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,260
can't be bullied

756
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,220
no matter where we go.

757
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:09,540
By the way,

758
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,540
I told you

759
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,060
to be cautious.

760
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,500
Didn't you worry at all

761
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,580
about dealing with Lord Luo's case,

762
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,490
that he may

763
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:17,660
hurt you?

764
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,980
I did.

765
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:19,980
I...

766
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,580
I did worry

767
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,700
that if I failed,

768
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,140
I'd let my grandpa down.

769
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,900
You kid.

770
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,620
Since you two left,

771
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,020
I've been worried

772
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,300
something would happen to you.

773
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,500
I didn't expect it would be your father

774
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,580
who caused such big trouble.

775
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,700
Yes.

776
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,420
An amicable divorce is a big deal.

777
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,700
And we can't just violate

778
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,300
the law.

779
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,340
We need to sort out

780
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,300
the property and the dowry.

781
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,820
The man has to find witnesses

782
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:47,660
and wait for someone

783
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,220
to pick up the woman and her dowries.

784
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,740
These things should have waited

785
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,460
till the patrol is over.

786
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:53,580
The two families should sit down

787
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,220
and discuss it.

788
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,500
No one expected her suing in court.

789
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,140
We'll know

790
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,780
when we get to Laishui.
