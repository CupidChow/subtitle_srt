00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,180
I'll stay here with Zheng for a while.

00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,780
When he gets better,

00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:00,780
we'll go to town.

8
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,410
What are you looking at?

9
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:06,580
Are you going to

10
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,460
see the county magistrate

11
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,259
like this?

12
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,180
It will affect your official image.

13
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,420
Right, Tumi?

14
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,340
Just listen to Lord Han.

15
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,340
You need to rest for a few days

16
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,180
to keep yourself tight.

17
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,940
You should be more careful when you go home.

18
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,220
It's always good to be careful.

19
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,820
We'll meet you

20

Take it easy.

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,530
Just do your job.

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,210
As for the Laishui files,

24
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,180
I'll handle them.

25
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,100
Don't worry.

26
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,700
But Luoyang is an important town.

27
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,900
I hope you can go with me.

28
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,460
If you need anything,

29
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,660
let us know.

30
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,340
It's our duty to do what you do.

Lord Han,

32
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,020
I do have a request.

33

Go ahead.

34
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,579
We go to Xu's mansion.

35
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,420
Mrs. Xu

36
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,500
never really liked me.

37
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:01,940
And Guo has a fierce temper.

38
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,620
I'm sure she won't see me hurt.

39
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,340
I'm afraid they'll talk back.

40
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,660
Could you

41
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,660
just let Guo follow you?

42
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,060
I know how much you love each other.

43
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:12,860
Don't worry.

44
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,060
Let her stay with us.

45
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,180
Thank you so much.

46
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:16,940
You're welcome.

47
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,540
You just need to hurry back.

on patrol.

54
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:34,500
What about you?

55
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,340
Don't you need to go to Luoyang

56
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,700
to arrange the matter of the inkstone first?

57

Madam asked me to wait here.

Did something happen to her?

69

The accusation

70
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,450
was the old lady's idea.

71
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,700
Madam didn't want it.

72
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,740
She just wanted to stay home

73

and waited for you to pick her up.

74

to meet him.

106

You've let him get away the last few times

Didn't you say that girl

114
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,940
wouldn't talk, right?

115
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,860

I was wondering if I could

120

share your room tonight?

121
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:00,740
Madam didn't give you

122

money for the inn?

123
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,580
She did.

124
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,930
But I'm scared.

125
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,500
Then overcome it.

126
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,540
I'm not used to

127
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,460
sleeping in the same room with others.

128

129
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,100
we all live around you.

130
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,260
What's so scary about that?

131
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,130
You must be tired.

132
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,140
Get some rest.

133
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,540
I heard there's a wild lake nearby.

134
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,860
I'll take a walk later.

135
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,010
My lady.

136
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,980
Are you going to

137
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,540
the lake ahead at night?

138
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,900
You can't go there.

139
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,500
Something happened to the lake the other day.

140
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,820
There's evil.

141
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,340
What do you mean?

142
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,460
A man

143
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,260
lived in the Ruyi Inn.

144
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,700
And he didn't know what's wrong with him.

145
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,220
When he slept in the middle of the night,

146
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,780
he seemed to be haunted by a nightmare.

147
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,260
He shouted,

148
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,540
let his hair down and burst out of the house.

149
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,540
He ran barefoot

150
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:42,810
along the road

151
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,460
until he reached the lake.

152
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,380
He jumped in and never came back out.

153
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,820
Really?

154
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,140
I don't have the nerve to make that up.

155
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,140
People have drowned

156
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,300
in that lake before.

157
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,460
But a few days later,

158
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,380
the body surfaced.

159
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,140
It wouldn't have gone so many days

160
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,580
without bleach.

161
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:00,620
And Yamen even

162
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,930
sent someone to get it.

163
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,100
But nothing was found.

164
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,740
Isn't it scary?

165
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:06,660
Yes.

166
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:07,900
So scary.

167
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:08,540
My Lady.

168
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,860
You'll have nightmares if you keep listening to this.

169
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,420
Wait.

170
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,060
Maybe the guy

171
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,260
just swam up and walked.

172
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,700
That's impossible.

173
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:15,940
That's impossible.

174
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,260
When that man

175
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,340
ran out that night,

176
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,780
he screamed along the way

177
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,100
and woke up many people.

178
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
They followed him,

179
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:25,940
and saw him jump into the lake.

180
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,570
But no one saw him

181
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,780
come out of the lake again.

182
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,820
You should go back to your room and rest.

183
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,260
I have to close the shop.

184
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:37,060
Okay.

185
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:43,970
My Lady.

186
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,300
Usually you and Guo

187
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,170
quarrel so loud.

188
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,180
You're scared now?

189
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:49,940
I...

190
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,580
I'm just too timid.

191
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,500
Don't worry.

192
00:07:52,659 --> 00:07:53,540
Even if there is a ghost,

193
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,940
every debt has its debtor.

194
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,980
You've done nothing wrong,

195
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,500
so don't be afraid of ghosts knocking at your door.

196
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,260
Don't worry.

197
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,140
My Lady.

198
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,060
Ye.

199
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:16,860
I knew

200
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,980
you knew what I meant.

201
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,180
By the way, Ye,

202
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,100
we've got some things to do

203
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,660
in Laishui county.

204
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,020
Then I'll meet Lord Kang

205
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,260
and go to Luoyang for a prison tour.

206
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,460
What about you?

207
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,420
Where are you going?

208
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,420
Laishui County.

209
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,580
What a coincidence.

210
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,940
Then we can meet again.

211
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,059
Next time we meet,

212
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,419
you can teach me some martial arts.

213
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,900
Then I can protect myself.

214
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,299
I can protect you.

215
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,299
I don't want to

216
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,860
rely on you to save me every time.

217
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:44,820
I want to protect you too.

218
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,580
You must have many secrets.

219
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,220
Like right now,

220
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,780
when am I gonna see

221
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,180
the real you?

222
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,860
If you don't want to say it,

223
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:02,860
let's talk about

224
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,140
other things.

225
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:05,980
The reason why you became

226
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,340
the Ye I know,

227
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,500
you must have encountered

228
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,980
a lot of warm things.

229
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:10,820
Otherwise,

230
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,340
you won't help me

231
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,060
and save me

232
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,260
without a second thought.

233
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,460
Right?

234
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:19,900
How about this?

235
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,850
Let's exchange.

236
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,820
I'll say one thing about me.

237
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,020
You say one thing about you.

238
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,700
I know everything

239
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,300
about you.

240
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,180
Chun Tumi's most precious thing

241
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,620
is the book of the Law.

242
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,740
She cares about her family the most.

243
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,580
She wants to be the first female litigator

244
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,740
in history.

245
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,860
She was fierce in court.

246
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,060
But in private,

247
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,860
she is a gentle person.

248
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,180
The first time she dressed my wound,

249
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,060
although it's a bad touch,

250
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,540
it didn't hurt at all.

251
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,140
She's the gentlest and kindest person.

252
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,460
I'm not one for words.

253
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,700
I have many secrets.

254
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,220
I'm very dangerous

255
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,540
to deal with.

256
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,580
But she didn't care

257
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,820
and she's willing to be my friend.

258
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,420
If anyone says you can't talk,

259
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,380
tell me.

260
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,340
I'll go get him.

261
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:21,620
Why do you trust me?

262
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,940
I don't know.

263
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,900
Maybe because

264
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,420
you helped me

265
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,020
when we first met.

266
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:32,580
Maybe it was doomed then.

267
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,740
I just trusted you.

268
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:49,820
You eat first.

269
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,780
I?

270
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:51,940
I don't know if there's poison

271
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:52,820
in your food.

272
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:23,220
Wait.

273
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,700
Don't forget to replace me tonight.

274
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:35,900
Stop.

275
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,900
What's that in your hand?

276
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:46,900
My lord.

277
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,580
I'm delivering

278
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,340
the leftovers of today's meal.

279
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Turn around and let me see.

280
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:53,940
My lord.

281
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,500
I have an ugly face.

282
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,660
I don't want to scare you.

283
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,980
Turn around.

284
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,420
No need.

285
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,940
I'm the richest woman in Laishui.

286
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:18,860
I don't need any help

287
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,300
from a small family.

288
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,460
Mother.

289
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,140
I brought Chun Dashan here

290
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,820
so he could take you away.

291
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,060
Just go.

292
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,300
But...

293
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,460
But what?

294
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,660
Chun Dashan is just

295
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:31,140
a lowly military officer.

296
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,660
His daughter

297
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,020
has only a rudimentary knowledge of the law.

298
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,700
What can she do for me?

299
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:36,660
No...

300
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,180
Enough.

301
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,420
It's not up to you to decide what happens to me.

302
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:45,320
[Xu Mansion]

303
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,620
Xiao Qin, go knock on the door.

304
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,900
[Xu Mansion]

305
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:50,820
Yes.

306
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:53,860
Here.

307
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,270
[Xu Mansion]

308
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:02,980
What happened?

309
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:05,780
He was killed.

310
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,220
It's him.

311
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:07,620
That's him.

312
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,540
Why are people

313
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,860
so weird around here?

314
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,330
It's him.

315
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,180
None of this is credible.

316
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,860
[Xu Mansion]

317
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,020
Master.

318
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:13,940
You can go in now.

319
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,700
It's so scary.

320
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,300
Go, go, go.

321
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,340
Her Ladyships.

322
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,300
Young Master is here.

323
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,100
Honey.

324
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,780
Father-in-law. Tumi.

325
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:34,780
You are here too.

326
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:36,980
Mother.

327
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,740
Madam.

328
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,900
Madam.

329
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,620
My in-law is here, too.

330
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:42,980
Please have a seat.

331
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,460
Dashan

332
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,620
is on a prison tour.

333
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,420
Tumi

334
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,260
is visiting

335
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,580
her mother's relatives.

336
00:13:59,300 --> 00:13:59,780
Why are you

337
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,260
all here together today?

338
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,580
That's what I was going to do.

339
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,300
But while Tumi

340
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,260
was with the prison patrol,

341
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,740
she helped Lord Kang

342
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,860
with some desk work.

343
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,140
So Lord Kang

344
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,300
invited her to join him,

345
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,580
When it's over,

346
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,420

348
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,900
But she is a girl.

349
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,540

with you guys.

352

353

her mother died a long time ago.

354
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,460
And you should

355

356

357

361
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,300
Only by marrying well

362
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:45,900
can a girl live comfortably,

363
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,820
so as to

364
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,940
be worthy of her mother who died early.

365

367
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,740
He is about Tumi's age.

368
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,740
He is very handsome.

369
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,980
At such a young age,

370
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,380
he became a scholar.

371

And he has a lot of good fields.

375

Thank you for your kindness.

378

391

392
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:54,940
But naturally,

393
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,380
I won't say

394
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,140

395
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,700

396

and now I can't lift my head.

399
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,460
If she really wants to marry to Liuzhou,

400
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,980
let alone these harsh words

401
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,100

402
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,690
Even if it does,

403
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,100
I can step in

404
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,300
and keep it down.

405
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,530

407

She's not afraid of others' gossip.

408
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,570
You can do whatever you want.

409
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,460
There's no need to be ashamed.

410
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,060
If she's so honest,

411
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,180
why would she

412
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,860
act like this in court?

413
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,420
Who would dare

414
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,980
to marry such a woman?

415
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,540
Since you

care so much about a woman's character,

417
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,020
I would like to ask

418

if she's not filial to your parents

419

and your children,

what should we do

to her?

423

You...

424
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,260
I didn't tell you

425
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,340
what had happened

426
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,140
because I was concerned about the shame of the two families.

427
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,020
Don't

429

Tumi is my life.

430

No one can underestimate her.

431

You don't have to be angry.

432

We appreciate your kindness.

433

Tumi's marriage.

435
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,420
Father, you're right.

436
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,020
My mother did it for the sake of the Chun family.

437
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,810
She humiliated my daughter

438

for the sake of the Chun family?

439

My mother

didn't mean

to make things difficult for you.

how can I let you do this?

522
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,700
I was wondering who it was.

523
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,580
It turns out to be the son-in-law of the Xu family.

524
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,700
Chun Dashan.

525

Even though you are a military officer,

526
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,740
I'm not afraid of you.

Xu Qing is an evil woman.

If there's a man out there,

531
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,260
she couldn't tolerate my brother

532
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,980
and killed him.

533
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,860
And Xu

534
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,460
is not a good person.

535
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,890
You stand up for them?

536
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:16,660
Fine.

They may cheat on you.

hang yourself in front of me right now,

543

I don't care.

let's go to Yamen.

I don't believe it.

you broke into a house.

Do you know what crime this is?

You said Mrs. Xu had killed your brother.

broke into Xu's house.

This is a crime of disturbance.

The one who took the lead just now

597
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,980
was my father's brother, Fan Bai.

many times.

because my mother killed him.

Old Master is missing?

604
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,820
My father just went on a trip.

605
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,500
He didn't contact us for the time being.

606

He's been away for a long time.

Since you've reported it to the government,

did you find anyone?

But...

People in the government trusted my mother.

615
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,980
They also told my mother

616

to shut down for a while.

Old Master used to be very poor

Besides, Her Ladyship

told on my father with the excuse of abandoning his wife

she bore it all by herself.

00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,020
seems to be with

692
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:47,610
one of her maids...

693
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,820
Here's your tea.

694
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:50,380
Really?

695
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,450
There's more than one.

696
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,180
Here's your tea.

697
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:54,700
How many

698
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:55,540
has he sent?

699
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:56,980
Please enjoy.

700
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,500
At this age,

701
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,580
I don't think anyone's gonna get killed again.

702
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,260
Mrs. Xu loves her daughter so much.

703
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,500
How could she kill someone

704
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,140
to threaten her daughter?

705
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,100
Come on. Come on.

706
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,780
My lady.

707
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,730
Why are you here?

708
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:11,660
Old Master.

709
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,060
Master. My Lady.

710
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,460
Didn't I ask you to take care of Her Ladyship?

711
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,540
Why are you here?

712
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,260
Her Ladyship was worried about you,

713
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,770
so she asked me to follow you.

714
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,660
Nonsense.

715
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,900
Why are you still covering up for her?

716
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,060
Madam must be worried that

717
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,180
we leave her alone.

718
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,700
That's why she sent you to keep an eye.

719
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,740
Now that I'm back,

720
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,220
I'll take care of it.

721
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,820
Go back and let her rest assured.

722
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:34,860
Master, no.

723
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,020
Madam is...

724
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,180
Stop talking.

725
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,380
Go back to the Xu Mansion

726
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,140
and tell my words

727
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,570
to Her Ladyship.

728
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:42,300
Father,

729
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,620
Let me help you go upstairs to rest.

730
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,380
I...

731
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,020
Come to my room.

732
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,140
Tell me.

733
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:10,860
What's your relationship with Old Master?

734
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,140
My Lady.

735
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,540
You...

736
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,380
You...

737
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,140
How did you know?

738
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,060
You came to pick us up at the inn that day.

739
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,900
You had a lot on your mind and wanted to stop.

740
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,260
Today in the Xu Mansion,

741
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,540
I found something wrong with you too.

742
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:27,820
You're afraid

743
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,260
someone in the Xu family, right?

744
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,180
But this afternoon, I saw you

745
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,300
get along with Xu this afternoon.

746
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,060
That means you're afraid of Old Madam.

747
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,940
You weren't afraid of the old lady before.

748
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:36,940
Old Master went missing,

749
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,140
and you're scared now?

750
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,460
Is it hard to guess?

751
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,060
My Lady, please save me.

752
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:49,620
Does his disappearance

753
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,700
have anything to do with you?

754
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:51,900
No.

755
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,020
Maybe...

756
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,060
Yes.

757
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,220
What do you mean?

758
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,460
I can't tell you.

759
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,980
I dare not.

760
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,780
You asked me to save you,

761
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,220
but you didn't tell me the truth.

762
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,460
how can I help you?

763
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,260
My Lady.

764
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,540
My Lady, I'll tell you.

765
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,420
I... I'll tell you.

766
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,020
Will you help me if I tell you?

767
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,100
You tell me first.

768
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,980
Since we returned to the Xu Mansion,

769
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,420
the old lady has asked Madam

770
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,100
to accompany her every day.

771
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,140
The old lady doesn't want me

772
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,420
to follow you.

773
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:22,260
So she sent me

774
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,540
to wait on the Old Master.

775
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,980
At first,

776
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,860
I don't care who he is.

777
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,170
But...

778
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,940
Somehow,

779
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,700
I got the Old Master's attention.

780
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,260
He told me

781
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,660
when he came back from his trip,

782
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,980
he'll tell the old lady

783
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,460
he'd take me in.

784
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:39,700
Unexpectedly,

785
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,580
Old Master never came back.

786
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:42,940
They all said

787
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,620
it was Old Madam.

788
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,020
Because the Old Madam hated the Old Master

789
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,220
for drinking wine all day

790
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,180
and fooling around

791
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,020
with many maids.

792
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,020
So...

793
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,180
My Lady,

794
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,940
please save me.

795
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,020
If Old Madam finds out

796
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,330
about me and Old Master,

797
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,580
then the next one to be killed

798
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,420
might be me, My Lady.

799
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,180
So,

800
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,220
you also think

801
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,100
Old Master wasn't missing.

802
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,540
The Old Madam killed him?

803
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,860
I don't know.

804
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,700
I just suspected that...

805
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:15,740
My Lady,

806
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,100
please take me away.

807
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,460
If I keep staying here,

808
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,260
and if Old Madam

809
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,460
finds out,

810
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:21,900
they will beat me to death

811
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:22,660
or sell me to...

812
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,700
Where's

813
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,490
the Old Madam's maid, Mrs. Wang.?

814
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,460
The Xu family is in trouble.

815
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,700
And Mrs. Wang is not here.

816
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,620
Why are all

817
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,060
young maids?

818
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,620
Mrs. Wang suddenly disappeared.

819
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,660
The Old Madam only said

820
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,540
she went out to work.

821
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,860
I don't know anything else.

822
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,980
Other than taking you in,

823
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,300
what else did she give you?

824
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,900
He gave me five taels of silver.

825
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,580
I won't tell anyone

826
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,700
about you and the Old Master.

827
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,100
Since Guo's not here,

828
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,020
I can say that

829
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:52,780
I need someone to serve me.

830
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,820
She'll let you follow us for the time being.

831
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,700
But you have to

832
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,900
make your own decision.

833
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,740
Go back first.

834
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,260
Don't keep Her Ladyship waiting too long.

835
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:13,000
[Uncover the identity of this person. Get the information of Mowu Pavilion as soon as possible.]

836
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,380
Lord Han, I have something to report.

837
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,180
Come in.

838
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:22,460
Lord Han,

839
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,100
please go and see that lady.

840
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,140
What's wrong?

841
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,340
My stomach hurts.

842
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,540
Your stomach hurts?

843
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,420
Go get a doctor.

844
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,340
No, it's too late.

845
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,620
Go find a carriage

846
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,330
and take me to the county

847
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,300
to find the best doctor.

848
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,380
Don't worry.

849
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,020
My doctor

850
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:56,980
is very skilled.

851
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,100
He will be here in a minute.

852
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,060
There're doctors

853
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,180
following us?

854
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,460
Is it strange

855
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,420
to have a doctor

856
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:08,860
with me?

857
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,700
Your doctor

858
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,940
only knows skin wounds.

859
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:12,660
He won't be able to

860
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,980
treat my stomachache.

861
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,060
Find a carriage

862
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,340
and take me to the county.

863
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,340
It's far from the county.

864
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,420
You must have suffered

865
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,580
along the way.

866
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,900
It's okay. I can endure it.

867
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:27,980
I can hold on.

868
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,140
Okay.

869
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,420
Guards.

870
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:40,900
Yes.

871
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,700
Get the carriage ready.

872
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,220
Yes, Lord Han.

873
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,900
When will I recover?

874
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,740
It hurts so much.

875
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,860
Don't worry.

876
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,460
You have to wait

877
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,660
until the horse is full.

878
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,060
How long do we have to wait?

879
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,580
Why is the horse's stomach so big?

880
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,620
The horse is full.

881
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,260
Let's go.

882
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,140
Not now.

883
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,460
Why?

884
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,740
The roof of the carriage is broken.

885
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,140
They are fixing it.

886
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,300
Did you fix the carriage?

887
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,300
Probably.

888
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,780
Can we go now?

889
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,020
No.

890
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,540
Why not?

891
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,220
The horse had diarrhea.

892
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,060
Maybe the food it ate

893
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,180
was not clean.

894
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,340
Tell me everything you know.

895
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,740
Don't pretend to be sick.

896
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,180
I will let you go.

897
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,420
What do you want to know?

898
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:35,780
About Mowu Pavilion.

899
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,020
What is Mowu Pavilion?

900
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,260
I've never heard of it.

901
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,980
Since you don't want to tell me,

902
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,660
I can only

903
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,540
keep you here.

904
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:53,740
You...

905
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,660
What are you shouting at this hour?

906
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,180
Go, go, go.

907
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,180
Yes, yes, yes.

908
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,020
Go, go, go. Let's go.

909
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:13,740
It's them. Let's go.

910
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,420
The Fan family sent someone to do it.

911
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,020
Mother.

912
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,700
We can't go on like this.

913
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,900
Let me beg

914
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,220
my husband and Tumi.

915
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,180
She is good at law.

916
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,460
With her help,

917
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:30,860
she will clear your name.

918
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,060
She's not kind

919
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:37,900
and she had means.

920
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:38,940
The punishment of slap

921
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,100
was light.

922
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,500
Mrs. Xu is so hot-tempered?

923
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,290
Exactly.

924
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:44,300
The Old Madam got caught

925
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,460
drinking wine once.

926
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,860
She smashed the whole shop.

927
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:48,620
She didn't search all the shops

928
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,100
when she found out the Old Madam had been missing?

929
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,460
Well, I've never heard of it.

930
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,100
Waiter.

931
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,300
Okay.

932
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,700
Hey.

933
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,220
The customer wants wine.

934
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,020
Father.

935
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,820
You wanted to go out for a walk?

936
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,620
I've never been here.

937
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,780
I wanted to go out.

938
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,300
I thought you were going out

939
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,940
to investigate the Xu family.

940
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,179
I heard everything.

941
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,580
Why did you want to look into this?

942
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,820
The Old Madam clearly

943
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,540
didn't want us to get involved.

944
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:22,659
She even wanted us

945
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,139
to leave immediately.

946
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,100
Father, I'm just curious.

947
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,100
When I'm curious,

948
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:28,860
I want to figure it out.

949
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,860
It's like playing a game.

950
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,780
We're about to leave.

951
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,420
Please let me do it.

952
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,540
All right. All right.

953
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,219
Go. Go.

954
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,170
Thank you, Father.

955
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,219
Wait.

956
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,420
Don't go too far.

957
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:43,540
Come back early.

958
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:44,540
Be careful.

959
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,340
This is not Bianzhou.

960
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,260
Okay.

961
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,060
I'll get going.

962
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:56,699
Here.

963
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,740
Have you heard of

964
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,340
a case of Laishui

965
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,660
these two days?

966
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:01,700
No.

967
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,260
No.

968
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:02,900
Well,

969
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,260
What about the suicide case?

970
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,740
Did you? Never heard of it.

971
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,580
No.

972
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,100
Did the Yamen notice anything?

973
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:09,740
[Cement Facial Mask]

974
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:08,860
No.

975
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:16,930
[Laishui County Government]

976
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:11,980
Officer,

977
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,020
do you know

978
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,540
about the Xu family case?

979
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,780
No, no.

980
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:16,900
I've never heard of it.

981
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,580
If there's nothing else,

982
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,420
just leave.

983
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,660
Just go, miss.

984
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,940
May I ask

985
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:22,820
how to get to the place

986
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,740
you mentioned?

987
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,100
Go out and turn right.

988
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,060
Go that way.

989
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:26,660
Yes.

990
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,460
Okay, thank you.

991
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,100
Honey.

992
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:34,100
Father.

993
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,300
I was wrong.

994
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,340
It was my fault.

995
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,460
But it's already

996
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,540
to this point,

997
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,140
I beg you two.

998
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,220
For the sake of our relatives,

999
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,140
let Tumi save my mother.

1000
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,580
You saw it yesterday.

1001
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,940
Your mother had her own plan.

1002
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,100
She didn't want us to get involved.

1003
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,370
Now that you're here to ask us for a favor,

1004
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,900
if we agree,

1005
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,460
it'll be troublesome.

1006
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,020
My mother is muddled.

1007
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,380
Don't listen to her.

1008
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,740
I'm not capable.

1009
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:07,980
I can only beg you.

1010
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,020
Please let Tumi

1011
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,780
help me this time.

1012
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,020
Now, my husband is

1013
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,140
a ninth rank official.

1014
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,330
And I'm pregnant with my husband's child.

1015
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,460
If my mother goes to jail,

1016
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:26,140
it will also affect his future.

1017
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,940
Don't talk nonsense in front of my father.

1018
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,700
Listen carefully.

1019
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,260
Even if

1020
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,700
I lose my job,

1021
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:36,740
I don't want my daughter

1022
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,980
to do this.

1023
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,140
Dear.

1024
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,420
Dear.

1025
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,380
Dear.

1026
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,060
Tumi, you are back.

1027
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,020
I'm back, Grandfather.

1028
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:07,660
Grandfather.

1029
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,900
I heard what the Madam said

1030
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,940
just now.

1031
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:13,820
Don't take

1032
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,380
what she said to heart.

1033
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:18,900
Grandfather,

1034
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,740
please calm down.

1035
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,580
Since your father and I

1036
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:30,620
knew that we might be disbanded,

1037
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,460
I was very careful.

1038
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,780
I'm afraid I might ruin this hope.

1039
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:36,940
But the patrol tour

1040
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,220
is very dangerous

1041
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,580
and is very hard.

1042
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,100
But in her eyes,

1043
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,300
this is just a bargaining chip

1044
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,180
for her family.

1045
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,660
How disappointing.

1046
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:50,980
Grandfather,

1047
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,380
I think

1048
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,140
we still have to deal with it.

1049
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,100
Why?

1050
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,580
You don't want me to help

1051
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,500
because you think

1052
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,180
the Old Madam won't be grateful.

1053
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:02,980
And she also thinks

1054
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,540
we take her weaknesses.

1055
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:05,820
And you don't know

1056
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:06,900
what will happen next.

1057
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,820
But I think we should help.

1058
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:09,860
What if

1059
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:10,860
the Old Master

1060
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,140
really had an accident?

1061
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,420
And it really had something to do with the Old Madam.

1062
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,700
No one will care

1063
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,300
whether our families are close or not.

1064
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,140
They will only say

1065
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,460
how the Xu family is.

1066
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,210
Our family is

1067
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,260
at a critical moment.

1068
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,100
we can't let others gossip.

1069
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,860
So not only do we have to do this,

1070
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,260
but also make Old Madam

1071
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,300
can't pick on us.

1072
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,460
Even so,

1073
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:33,900
she doesn't want us

1074
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,460
to help her.

1075
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,140
I have an idea.
