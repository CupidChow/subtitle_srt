174
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:29,580
What should we do?

175
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,940
We need to go back and report to His Highness.

176
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:32,940
There's movement over there.

177
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,700
Go after him!

178
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,700
They say there are many fireflies here.

179
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,220
Where are they?

180
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,100
Are they all asleep?

181
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,060
Who?

182
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,660
Tumi.

183
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,620
Lord Han.

184
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:11,620
Why are you here?

185
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,740
I went out to play behind my father's back.

186
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,580
I lost my way.

187
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,300
What about you?

188
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,380
I...

189
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,780
Catch the thief.

190
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,020
You go first.

191
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:21,660
Yes.

192
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,420
Is your foot okay?

193
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,820
Give me your hand.

194
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,780
Are you still afraid of me?

195
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,700
In the middle of nowhere,

196
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,420
wild animals are scarier than me.

197
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,380
Here.

198
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:44,980
Can you walk?

199
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,220
Yes.

200
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,020
Captain Chun.

201
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,740
Tumi didn't want you to worry,

202
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,220
so she didn't dare to tell you.

203
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,460
Now she's in shock.

204
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:03,900
So it's better not

205
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,020
be too harsh.

206
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,100
You have to pretend

207
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,740
to be more pitiful.

208
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,300
Lord Kang can really persuade my father?

209
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,300
Will I be packed

210
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,450
and sent back tonight?

211
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,130
Zheng has a sharp tongue.

212
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,580
Your father is a piece of cake.

213
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,100
My father is not a piece of cake.

214
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,140
Yes.

215
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,820
Don't worry.

216
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,340
When you play tricks again,

217
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,900
can you think of a way out?

218
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:30,900
I have no experience.

219
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,660
I'll teach you something later.

220
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,380
Captain Chun.

221
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,860
Take Tumi back first.

222
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,420
Thank you, Lord Kang.

223
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,100
Lord Han.

224
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,140
Have a good rest.

225
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,660
Okay.

226
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,500
Be careful.

227
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,700
How did it go?

228
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,340
They all ran away.

229
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,660
When they were in Bianzhou,

230
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,100
they were very careful.

231
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,740
But now, they're...

232
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,980
As long as the bait is tempting enough,

233
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,900
our fish will take the bait.

234
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,300
Once they spread the news,

235
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,700
let's ready to go to Youzhou at any time.

236
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,930
Wind the line and catch the fish.

237
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,060
Since we've alerted them,

238
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,700
I think

239
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,540
we should put the secret edict

240
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,260
aside.

241
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,580
If we keep going,

242
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,340
Han Wuwei might be prepared.

243
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,500
Even if we get the secret edict,

244
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,780
I'm afraid we can't tell

245
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:51,860
whether what's on it is true.

246
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,100
Young Master,

247
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,780
I just ran into Chun Tumi.

248
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,180
Ms. Chun.

249
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,940
She went into this forest

250
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,540
in the middle of the night

251
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,180
and walked without looking.

252
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,820
She's really weird.

253
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,340
Why would a girl go in the forest

254
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,730
in the middle of the night?

255
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,780
I don't think she's weird.

256
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,020
Someone who has never been restrained

257
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,980
since childhood.

258
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:24,940
When she grows up,

259
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,660
she'll grow up with a free mind

260
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,700
like her.

261
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,580
Young Master,

262

Chun Tumi is close to Han Wuwei.

263
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,460
Grand Secretary told me

264
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,740
to be careful with her.

265

I know what to do.

00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:42,940
Great.

267
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,140
I finally have something to do.

you should have a good rest.

[Madam Zhao's poisoning case]

285
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,140
You finished reading so soon?

286
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,740
What's wrong?

287
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,260
There's a case.

288
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,490
I think there are many doubtful points.

289
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,260
Tell me.

290
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,020
It's the Zhou case.

291
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,100
The one who was sentenced

292
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,660
was a 20-year-old widow, Madam Zhou.

293
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,100
She lived with her mother-in-law, Lady Wu,

294
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,660
and depend on each other.

295
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,140
One day, her mother-in-law

296
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,420
hung herself suddenly.

297
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,060
Then she turned herself in.

298
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,500
She said she had an argument

299
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,260
with her mother-in-law the night before

300
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,100
which caused her mother-in-law to hang herself.

301
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,450
Violating filial obligations is a serious crime.

302
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,060
The court closed the case soon

303
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,780
and sentenced her to death.

304
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,180
But I think it should be retried.

305
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,460
Since she turned herself in,

306
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,620
and there is a strong criminal testimony,

307
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,580
why do we have to retry it?

308
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,780
This file says

309
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,740
there was an argument between Lady Zhou and her mother-in-law

310
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,820
two nights ago.

[Neighbors' testimony]

312
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,340
But the neighbors' testimony said

313
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,700
they didn't hear anything.

314
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,090
The next morning,

315
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,180
Lady Zhou found her mother-in-law was dead

316
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,420
so she turned herself in.

317
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,220
The government asked the coroner to examine the body.

318
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,540
The coroner said her mother-in-law died

319
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,780
for more than four hours.

320
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,340
Then it happened late at night.

321
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,660
If it really happened late at night,

322
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:22,340
how could no one hear the quarrel?

323
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:25,420
Besides, it’s written clearly in the file that

324
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,860
when Lady Wu hung herself,

325
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,620
she kicked down the chair

326
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,060
and dropped a shoe.

327
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,380
Lady Zhou

328
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,820
couldn't miss such loud noises, can she?

329
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,090
Maybe she heard it

330
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,340
but because

331
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,660
she argued with her mother-in-law not long ago.

332
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:37,290
So she thought

333
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,780
something was broken,

334
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,740
so she didn't get up to see it.

335
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,340
Since she turned herself in,

336
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,460
why didn't she confess

337
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,420
everything she heard?

338
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,260
Besides that,

339
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,300

00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,380
other three questionable points.

so Lady Zhou never goes out.

345
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,540
Her mother-in-law

346
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,940
went out shopping.

347
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,220
Lady Zhou was responsible for

348
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,060
doing some needlework and laundry

349
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,820
to earn some money to support the family.

350
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,100
They talked things over.

351
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,220
They were on good terms.

352
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,180
Since they were on good terms,

353
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,260
why would they quarrel?

354
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,140
They argued so much that

355
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,940
her mother-in-law hung herself.

356
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,060
Second,

357
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,020
Lady Wu is optimistic.

358
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,780
Naturally,

359
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,940
it is ruled out that

360
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,500
it was an excessive behavior caused by paranoia.

361
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,300
Third,

362
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,340
Lady Zhou confessed too quickly.

363
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,900
She insisted that

364
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,900
everything was her fault.

365
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,700
It makes people feel that

366
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,860
she was trying to hide something.

367
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:34,420
Anyway,

368
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,940
this case is full of questionable points.

369
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,340
We should verify them one by one.

370
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,540
Lord Kang.

371
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,660
The law dead,

372
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,780
but people are alive.

373
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,540
Isn't the law supposed to

374
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,620
uphold justice?

375
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,500
They shouldn't have closed the case hastily.

376
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,420
In that case,

377
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,340
you will be in charge of

378
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,780
the retrial of this case.

379
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,060
If you need manpower to investigate the case,

380
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,220
you can dispatch any soldiers from the Supreme Court.

381
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,660
Yes, Lord Kang.

382
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:00,750
[Wu's Grocery Store]

383
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,850
Why is it closed down?

384
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:05,069
[Wu's Grocery Store]

385
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:02,860
Guo.

386
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,339
Why don't you ask over there?

387
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:05,329
Okay.

388
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,260
Come and have a look.

389
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,180
Have a look.

390
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,260
The word has gotten out.

391
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,380
I guess those people

392
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,420
will arrive in two days.

393
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,700
I've prepared men.

394
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,579
Don't act rashly.

395
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,420
No mission

396
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,460
is not as important as your safety.

397
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,740
Don't worry.

398
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,140
Where is Tumi?

399
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,260
Doesn't she hang around you

400
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,260
all the time?

401
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,300
She went to investigate a case.

402
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,980
Where did she go?

403
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,500
Luckily, I survived.

404
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,780
Why are you

405
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,740
sitting on other's table?

406
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,420
I'm working on a case.

407
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,220
I'm telling you.

408
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,780
Don't wander around these days.

409
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:30,820
Why?

410
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,900
Because you caught a thief a few days ago.

411
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,860
If I say

412
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,380
I suspect a bandit is

413
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,620
wandering around you.

414
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:40,780
Do you believe it?

415
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,700
Bandits don't just follow anyone.

416
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,420
I'm poor.

417
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,340
What for?

418
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:48,980
Do you need my help?

419
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:49,940
You?

420
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,780
He's a real bandit.

421
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,380
I'm afraid

422
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,260
you're not enough for him.

423
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,940
Go back now.

424
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,540
Lord Kang's matter is almost done.

425
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,620
If you delay any longer,

426
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,260
you'll miss the time to go back.

427
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,620
I need to go to the autopsy room first.

428
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,660
I'll ask someone to send you.

429
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,500
This way, please.

430
00:21:37,340 --> 00:21:38,620
She was indeed strangled to death.

431
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,580
Can you help me check

432
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,580
the marks other than

433
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,860
strangulation marks for me again?

434
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,140
This...

435
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,060
Fine.

436
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,740
So what did Lord Han say?

437
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,260
He said to stay here for another day

438
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,740
as planned.

439
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:11,820
Okay.

440
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,660
Thank you.

441
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,620
Yes.

442
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,300
Lord Kang.

443
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,780
Miss Chun is back.

444
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,060
Did she say anything?

445
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,580
She wants to hold a retrial.

446
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,620
She wants to see you.

447
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,020
Already?

448
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,140
Are you ready?

449
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,340
Yes.

450
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,740
Lord Kang, please take a seat.

451
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,180
Since you're in charge,

452
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,260
you can sit here.

453
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:54,860
I,

454
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,700
someone who delivers justice for the people,

455
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,780
should sit here.

456
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,020
Summon the criminal, Lady Zhou, to the court.

457
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,980
My lord, Lady Zhou is here.

458
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,100
Greetings, Your Excellencies.

459
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,020
Lady Zhou.

460
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,300
Who are you taking the blame for?

461
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,060
I didn't take the blame for anyone.

462
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,740
I deserved it.

463
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,060
What's your unspeakable reason?

464
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,020
I don't have any unspeakable reasons.

465
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,100
I'm an unfilial woman.

466
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,500
I just want to die now.

467
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,460
Have you ever thought

468
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,660
the murderer who killed your mother-in-law

469
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,740
is still at large?

470
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,820
She couldn't rest in peace.

471
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,420
That's your biggest unfilial behaviour.

472
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,140
You...

473
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,020
What do you mean?

474
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,460
Lady Wu, your mother-in-law, didn't hang herself.

475
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,740
Someone killed her.

476
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:11,420
That's impossible.

477
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,540
Why not?

478
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,300
Because I sleep lightly.

479
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,420
But I didn't hear anything

480
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,260
on that night.

481
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,820
If someone killed her,

482
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,740
how could he not make a sound?

483
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,060
How do you know

484
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,340
she was murdered?

485
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:23,980
First,

486
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,500
Lady Zhou just said

487
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,780
she sleep lightly,

488
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,380
but she didn't hear anything.

489
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:29,580
That chair is heavy.

490
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,300
If it collapses,

491
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,780
how could it not make a sound?

492
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:34,500
Second,

493
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:35,780
the file says

494
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,580
Lady Wu lost a shoe before she died.

495
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,220
But when people are about to die,

496
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,060
who wouldn't want to

497
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,980
dress herself up?

498
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,420
How could she lose one shoe for no reason?

499
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,540
Unless she kicked it so hard

500
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,420
that it fell off.

501
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,260
Third,

502
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,540
I checked the files.

503
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,580
I learned the height of Lady Wu

504
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,660
and the length of the rope.

505
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,260
I went to Lady Wu's house to measure

506
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,620
the height of the beam.

507
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,900
With the height of Lady Wu,

508
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,700
if she wants to hang herself

509
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,820
it's not enough to just step on the chair.

510
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,420
She has to add a table.

511
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,340
Or someone tall

512
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,100
lifted her up and hung her up.

513
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:10,900
Lastly

514
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,140
and most importantly,

515
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,740
I found footprints

516
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:14,860
in Lady Wu's room.

517
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,020
Judging from the size,

518
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,620
they should be left by a man.

519
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,730
The footprints have mud.

520
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,570
In other words,

521
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,740
it rained not long before he went in.

522
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,620
It matches the time

523
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,580
when Lady Wu died.

524
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,980
Generally speaking,

525
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:31,580
when people were

526
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,580
attacked by strangers,

527
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,140
they would resist and scream.

528
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,380
But you said you didn't hear

529
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,460
any sound.

530
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,460
In other words,

531
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,900
the person who killed Lady Wu

532
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,100
is someone she knows.

533
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,060
Speaking of which,

534
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,500
do you find it strange?

535
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,300
Or did you guess who it was?

536
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,140
Impossible.

537
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,860
My mother-in-law was a good person.

538
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,780
No one would want to kill her.

539
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,060
I know you have deep feelings for

540
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:57,900
your mother-in-law.

541
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,700
You don't want her to be criticized.

542
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,620
But now the truth is coming out.

543
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,660
Telling us

544
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,380
what you know

545
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,700
is for her own good.

546
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:16,940
I'm guilty.

547
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,860
I'm willing to be punished for lying.

548
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,540
My lord, please

549
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,380
clear my mother-in-law's name.

550
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,940
Give it to me.

551
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,340
My mother-in-law suffered from rheumatism.

552
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,620
I sent her hot water for her feet

553
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,820
before I go to bed every day.

554
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,580
You...

555
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:31,860
A few days before she passed away,

556
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,220
I was carrying hot water

557
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,420
to her room.

558
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:35,170
Give me the money.

559
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:35,540
I'm sure I'll make a comeback tomorrow.

560
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,500
Let's talk another day.

561
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,820
Leave.

562
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,860
But that day, I saw

563
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:40,700
a strange man

564
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,980
came out of my mother-in-law's room.

565
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,940
He went out from the back door of the yard.

566
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,900
I saw him fighting

567
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,980
with my mother-in-law.

568
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,540
I guessed

569
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,100
my mother-in-law must have had an affair.

570
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,020
A few days later,

571
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,340
my mother-in-law hung herself.

572
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,260
I thought she died

573
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,660
because she was ashamed.

574
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,340
I turned myself in

575
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,020
to protect my mother-in-law's honor.

576
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,340
Although you are filial,

577
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,780
you were wrong.

578
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,420
Lady Wu used to sell your embroideries

579
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,580
to a grocery store

580
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,380
and buy some daily necessities.

581
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,100
That grocery store

582
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,140
was opened by Lady Wu's brother,

583
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:23,980
Wu Yong.

584
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,260
Wu Yong is gluttonous and lazy.

585
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,540
He was a rogue when he was young.

586
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,820
He also knows kung fu.

587
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,940
In order to let him make a living

588
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,060
on the right path,

589
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,820
Lady Wu's parents bought him a grocery store.

590
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,380
But he was addicted to gambling in recent years

591
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:38,940
and lost his store.

592
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,220
After that, Wu Yong

593
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,900
went to Lady Wu for money frequently.

594
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,060
In order to protect you,

595
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,220
Lady Wu didn't allow him to come during the day

596
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,860
and never let you see each other.

597
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,220
We compared the footprints on the scene.

598
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:52,220
They match Wu Yong's size.

599
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,940
Based on the evidence I collected,

600
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,940
Wu Yong probably saw that

601
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,420
he can't get money from Lady Wu anymore.

602
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,260
So he wanted to sell

603
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,460
her jewelry and property.

604
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,900
Then they had a fight

605
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,140
and he killed her.

606
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:03,910
[Testimony from Madam Sun next door]

607
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:04,780
[Witness]

608
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,720
[Testimony from Madam Sun next door]

609
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,260
After he strangled Lady Wu,

610
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,540
he hung her on the beam

611
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,460
to make it look like she hung herself.

612
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,340
So he escaped the punishment of the law.

613
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:12,820
My mother-in-law

614
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,940
gave me the deed.

615
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,090
[Testimony from Madam Sun next door]

616
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,780
She must have been afraid that Wu Yong

617
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,220
would take away all valuable things.

618
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,500
She must have been afraid afraid that

619
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,300
I can't live a good life.

620
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,860
That's why

621
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,260
she gave them to me in advance.

622
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,500
But I...

623
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,660
Now,

624
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,140
everything is clear.

625
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,540
My lord, please make a decision.

626
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,180
Lady Zhou took the blame

627
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,540
and disturbed the court order.

628
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,580
But considering your filial piety,

629
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,060
you were willing to sacrifice yourself

630
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,060
for your mother-in-law's reputation.

631
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,300
It will count as a deed of merit.

632
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,940
Your reward and punishment will cancel each other.

633
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,020
You're now released.

634
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,580
Get up.

635
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,020
You're a smart person.

636
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,300
You're too filial.

637
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,220
In order to protect your mother-in-law's reputation,

638
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,500
you didn't even hesitate to lose your life.

639
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,140
From now on,

640
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:12,020
you just need to cooperate with us

641
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,860
and bring the murderer to justice.

642
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:14,900
Your mother-in-law will

643
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,020
rest in peace then.

644
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,980
You almost sprained your ankle that day.

645
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,780
Today, you came out for a walk again.

646
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,460
What about you?

647
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:52,980
Did you catch the thief?

648
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:55,660
He ran away.

649
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,780
Then why are you still in the mood to care about me?

650
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,340
I'll care about you

651
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,620
whether I'm in the mood or not.

652
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,580
I heard that

653
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,660
you won a big case today.

654
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,420
You saved Lady Zhou from death penalty.

655
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,340
Why are you still alone?

656
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,210
Although I won,

657
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:15,140
I still feel suffocated.

658
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,500
Maybe

659
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,740
because of Lady Zhou.

660
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,980
What's wrong with her?

661
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,260
She saw Wu Yong

662
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,180
with Lady Wu.

663
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:27,460
She thought they had an affair.

664
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,380
In order to maintain the reputation of Lady Wu,

665
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,620
she was willing to take the blame.

666
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,220
I know she was being filial.

667
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,820
But,

668
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,850
is the reputation of Lady Wu

669
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,620
more important

670
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,260
than her own life?

671
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,340
Of course.

672
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,780
Women value their reputation.

673
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,860
Naturally, they think reputations are

674
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,460
more important than their lives.

675
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,420
But I'm also a woman.

676
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,380
I think whether you're a man or a woman,

677
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,900
and no matter what happens,

678
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,060
you should live well.

679
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,700
I'm talking about a normal woman.

680
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,620
You're a weirdo.

681
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,620
It's only natural

682
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,620
if you don't think so.

683
00:30:58,940 --> 00:30:59,460

00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,980
you've reported it to the government?

856
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,060
I have reported many times.

857
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,420
It remained a dead letter every time.

858
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,380
It all ended up with nothing settled.

859
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,140
I can't

860
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,260
take it anymore.

861
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,620
Lord,

862
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,580
please help me.

863
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,380
But you have no solid evidence.

864
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,860
This case is hard to handle.

865
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,380
But what I said

866
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,580
is the truth.

867
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,860
Lord, please help me.

868
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,700
I'll take the case.

869
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,620
You can come back to court in a few days.

870
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,140
Thank you, Lord.

871
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,260
Lord Kang.

872
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,410
Lord Kang.

873
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,180
You took this case

874
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,700
very readily today.

875
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,220
Since I was ordered to patrol,

876
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,500
no matter how big the case is,

877
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,770
I have to try it carefully.

878
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,620
How else can we

879
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,860
talk about justice?

880
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,300
So today's case,

881
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:40,900
I not only have to take it,

882
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,140
but also have to make a good judgment.

883
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,500
Tell me.

884
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,420
What's your plan?

885
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,100
My plan

886
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,740
is not quite fair and square.

887
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,500
I need your help.

888
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:52,900
It's not fair and square?

889
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,500
Just tell me.

890
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,260
Can I

891
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,860
borrow your seal?
