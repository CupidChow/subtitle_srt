00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,060
apply the medicine on time.

177
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,460
Guo,

178
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,299
take good care of her.

179
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,700
Yes.

180
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,580
Honey,

181
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:45,420
the water is ready.

182
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,340
Why don't you take a bath first?

183
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,780
Then, let me put the food here.

184
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,660
Don't ask your mother to come again.

185
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,660
What?

186
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,460
She's an elder.

187
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,020
There's no reason for the elder to visit the younger ones.

188
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,180
If you always want to

189
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,220
go back to your parents' home.

190
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,660
I can send you back.

191
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,780
I... But...

192
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:10,020
There are no buts.

193
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,660
Back then,

194
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,500
my mother didn't want me to marry you

195
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,180
and become a stepmother.

196
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,140
For the sake of my devotion,

197
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,660
she agreed with the grievance.

198
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,380
Now,

199
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,100
you want me to cut ties with my family.

200
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,260
This...

201
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,660
Don't mention the things of the past again.

202
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,740
If your mother comes again,

203
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,300
go back with her.

204
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,500
Honey.

205
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,090
How can he...

206
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,820
Miss,

207
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,140
I just asked about it.

208
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,580
Zhou also went to join the fun.

209
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,660
He heard the interrogation.

210
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,940
What did he hear?

211
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,740
He said that Zhang Wuniang pleaded guilty.

212
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,420
But when Lord Zhang asked her

213
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,220
why she framed

214
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:54,980
Master,

215
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,180
she didn't say anything.

216
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,620
When Lord Zhang wanted to torture her,

217
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,940
she fainted on the spot.

218
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,340
They asked a doctor to check on her.

219
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,500
Guess what?

220
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,740
She's pregnant.

221
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,940
Zhang Wuniang is pregnant?

222
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,940
Isn't she a widow?

223
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,060
What?

224
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,100
You're not leaving?

225
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,220
Are you going to work in Zhechong Prefecture officially?

226
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,540
Yes.

227
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,660
If you don't go back to the capital with the inkstone,

228
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,180
how can you report to His Majesty?

229
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,100
Besides,

230
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,580
your job in Zhechong Prefecture

231
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,380
is just

232
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,740
a matter on the table.

233
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,530
Are you going to take it seriously?

234
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,620
That night,

235
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,380
the man who broke into Governor's Office

236
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,620
hasn't been found yet.

237
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,020
If I go back to the capital with the inkstone,

238
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,020
I can not hand in the task.

239
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,780
Moreover, I am noticeable along the way.

240
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,220
I am like a big target.

241
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,540
What you said makes sense.

242
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,420
But why can't I believe it?

243
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,810
The court has been looking for the inkstone.

244
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,940
We've found

245
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,660
about eight inkstones.

246
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:45,620
Besides,

247
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,010
whether the one in Chu You's hands

248
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,140
is real or not,

249
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,460
we have to wait for the people from Procuratorial Office

250
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,300
to check on it.

251
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,060
Zheng,

252
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,370
don't worry about me.

253
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,620
You are too thoughtful.

254
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,700
That's why you look

255
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,780
older than me.

256
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,460
Fine.

257
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,220
I won't ask about this.

258
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,700
Do as you like.

259
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,940
Left Envoy left the city overnight.

260
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,380
If he travels fast,

261
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:24,180
he is almost in Bingzhou by now.

262
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,940
Han Wuwei's men didn't catch him.

263
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,660
But Han Wuwei

264
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,700
went to Zhechong Prefecture alone,

265
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,580
accepted his nominal position,

266
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,100
and stayed in Bianzhou since then.

267
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,220
In my opinion,

268
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,420
this person

269
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,580
has no strategies at all.

270
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:38,900
He is such a joke!

271
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,140
If it weren't for what happened back then,

272
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:41,980
you...

273
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,300
Stop talking.

274
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,540
I was just complaining about grievances

275
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,900
for you.

276
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,900
There is not so much justice

277
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,020
in this world.

278
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,020
If a person

279
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,780
can only see injustice,

280
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,660
he's probably a good-for-nothing

281
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,260
or a blind man.

282
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,220
Since the inkstone in Chu You's hand

283
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,700
is fake,

284
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,660
the clues to the inkstone

285
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,060
have disappeared in Bianzhou.

286
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,940
This time, Han Wuwei stays in Bianzhou.

287
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,060
In the future,

288
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,780
we definitely have chances to fight again.

289
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,180
Don't go back to Linshui Pavilion lately.

290
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,420
Just focus on

291
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,620
looking for clues about the inkstone,

292
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,460
and wait and see.

293
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,580
Yes.

294
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:24,900
Guo,

295
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,740
Zhang Wuniang

296
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,100
did things on the 18th of this month,

297
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,500
was released on the 22nd of this month,

298
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,260
and left Bianzhou the next day.

299
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,460
Then she disappeared.

300
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,820
Don't you think it's strange?

301
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,610
I feel uneasy

302
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,290
if I don't check her motive.

303
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,100
My Lady,

304
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,860
don't think too much.

305
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,220
Rest early.

306
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:52,500
Master.

307
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,860
Is Tumi asleep?

308
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,500
She isn't.

309
00:12:59,020 --> 00:12:59,500
Tumi.

310
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,420
You are back.

311
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,860
What's the matter?

312
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:03,980
Nothing.

313
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,060
I saw the light in your room was still on.

314
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,500
I thought you were still up.

315
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,900
Have you had dinner?

316
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,260
Yes.

317
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,900
Don't be so late next time.

318
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,380
Your health is more important.

319
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:15,940
I

320
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,220
went to Zhechong Prefecture today.

321
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,380
I thought I could come back earlier.

322
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,580
But now,

323
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,500
the leader position is vacant.

324
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,540
The new team leader hasn't been selected yet.

325
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,780
It's complicated.

326
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,060
Besides,

327
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,700
here came a new commander.

328
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,140
Lord Han, recently.

329
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,500
He heard about me

330
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,660
and sent someone

331
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,100
to visit me.

332
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,780
That's why I stayed there.

333
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,220
I didn't expect Commander

334
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,540
to be so considerate.

335
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,580
Besides Lord Han,

336
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,740
a somebody came to

337
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,300
Bianzhou recently too.

338
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,660
He is Lord Kang Zhengyuan,

339
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,300
Prime Minister of Supreme Court.

340
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,860
Now Bianzhou

341
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,140
has become a place they favor.

342
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,380
I guess since they are here,

343
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,220
Bianzhou needs to change.

344
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,980
We'll be busy in the future.

345
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,740
By the way, Tumi,

346
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,140

00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,700
Linshui Pavilion

520
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,540
has done business here for a long time.

521
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,060
How is Madam Fang's

522
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,460
character?

523
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,740
I believe needless to say,

524
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,100
you all know that.

525
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,420
But about what has happened today,

526
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,460
people are all watching.

527
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,010
Did I frame her

528
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,460
and poison myself?

529
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,460
This...

530
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,580
Good.

531
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,730
Okay.

532
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,340
Since you say that you're not feeling well,

533
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:28,060
why not find a doctor to come and have a look?

534
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,780
It is clear

535
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,610
if there is any problem.

536
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,620
As for

537
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,060
other guests,

538
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,700
for those who are not feeling well,

539
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,780
we'll settle them down as soon as possible

540
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,980
and ask the doctor to treat them.

541
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,300
Does it have anything to do with you?

542
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,820
You always protect her.

543
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:49,940
Do you two

544
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,820
have an affair?

545
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,420
You...

546
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,380
Listen carefully.

547
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,380
You know

548
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,060
what you've done.

549
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,940
If you continue to mess up,

550
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,980
what will happen

551
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,540
if the government knows this?

552
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,460
Think carefully.

553
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,460
Honey.

554
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,900
Honey, forget it.

555
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,420
Screw you!

556
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,580
What were you doing?

557
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,580
I'm dying. Why didn't you come out?

558
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,940
I'll beat you...

559
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,570
I'll beat you when I get home.

560
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,380
He still beats...

561
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,580
Zhao Laoqi.

562
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,500
What's wrong?

563
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,940
What's wrong?

564
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,580
You...

565
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,420
Zhao Laoqi.

566
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,340
You...

567
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,460
This doesn't look like an act.

568
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,540
What's wrong?

569
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,300
Honey...

570
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,220
Zhao Laoqi.

571
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,170
Zhao Laoqi!

572
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,420
Honey...

573
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,620
Honey, what's wrong?

574
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:51,540
This...

575
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,460
He died.

576
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,140
Someone died after eating the fish soup of Linshui Pavilion.

577
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:55,940
Someone is dead.

578
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,980
Let's go and have a look

579
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,860
Qi.

580
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,500
Someone is dead here today.

581
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,460
All of you need

582
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,860
to cooperate with the investigation.

583
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,420
Don't leave for the time being.

584
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,460
Everyone,

585
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,780
before the officials come,

586
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,580
if anyone leaves without permission,

587
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,580
Qi...

588
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,820
I'm afraid it's hard to explain.

589
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,740
Miss, stop looking at them.

590
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,340
Madam Fang,

591
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,340
please take Mrs. Zhao

592
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,140
to the restaurant.

593
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:18,900
Lower your voice.

594
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,500
Boss the second,

595
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:20,940
Get up,

596
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,700
take the others of the restaurant

597
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,780
to seal the front and the back doors.

598
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,020
Don't let anyone in or out

599
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,700
Okay.

600
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,380
And

601
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,620
keep an eye on what Zhao Laoqi spit out.

602
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,820
Don't let anyone touch it.

603
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,460
Okay.

604
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,460
Jiu.

605
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,380
Go to the government and report it to the police.

606
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:33,860
Okay.

607
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,540
Hurry up.

608
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:40,580
The officials are coming.

609
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,380
Look.

610
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,490
The Supreme Court is investigating a case.

611
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,220
Step aside.

612
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,620
I'm Chun Dashan,

613
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,580
Deputy Team Leader of Zhechong Prefecture.

614
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:50,380
May I ask...

615
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,380
Commander of Zhechong Prefecture, Han Wuwei.

616
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,780
Greetings, Commander.

617
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,100
It's him.

618
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,780
It's that man.

619
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,100
We're surrounded anyway.

620
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:02,980
We can't get out now.

621
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:03,860
Let's go and have a look.

622
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,780
People are like this when they see corpses

623
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,620
for the first time.

624
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,180
Use this.

625
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,140
Don't worry. This is new.

626
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,100
Thank you.

627
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,900
My lady, are you alright?

628
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,580
This is Prison Guard, Lord Kang.

629
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,420
Greetings, Prison Guard.

630
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,740
Don't stand on ceremony.

631
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:37,940
I'm a general.

632
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,940
As for the case,

633
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,140
you, the legitimate official from Criminal Investigation Bureau,

634
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,860
should take charge of it.

635
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:42,980
I will only cooperate with you.

636
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,340
Get out of the way!

637
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,460
I am Hong Wu, a leader.

638
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,700
Greetings, two lords.

639
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,420
I rushed here

640
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,660
after the government received the report.

641
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,860
This is Dr. Wen.

642
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,540
We are at your service.

643
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,660
The second floor of Linshui Pavilion

644
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,980
was reserved by Lord Han today.

645
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,420
There are no irrelevant people there.

646
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,420
Take your men, and

647
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,300
bring the remaining guests

648
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,220
to the private rooms in the east

649
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:00,900
and record

650
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,340
their names and addresses one by one.

651
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,220
Ask them

652
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,500
who they were sitting with,

653
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,220
and what unusual things they saw

654
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,540
or heard.

655
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,500
You must record them correctly.

656
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,010
You can only ask one person at a time.

657
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,300
Other people should be waiting in other rooms.

658
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,580
This is not a trivial matter.

659
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,260
You must be careful.

660
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,980
If anything goes wrong,

661
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,340
I will punish you.

662
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,500
I will do my best.

663
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,700
Let's go. Follow me.

664
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,260
Yes.

665
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:23,740
Chief Guard.

666
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,380
Yes.

667
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,180
You divide our men into three teams.

668
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,460
The first team, take all the people

669
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,020
of Linshui Pavilion, including the boss, the shopkeeper,

670
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,580
clerks, waiters, people in the kitchen

671
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:33,420
and others

672
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,580
to the backyard

673
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,780
Watch them separately.

674
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,020
Don't let them talk to each other.

675
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,220
The second team, take the poisoned guests to

676
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,500
the private rooms on the second floor

677
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,540
in the west.

678
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,820
These rooms can be used as wards.

679
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,220
Ask Dr. Wen to treat them one by one.

680
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,820
As for the stove, water source,

681
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,040
[Bianzhou Government Seal]

682
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,420
the food on the tables in the restaurant,

683
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,860
and the vomit,

684
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,100
the third team,

685
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,020
keep an eye on them

686
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:54,380
until the inspectors from the government

687
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,100
come and deal with them.

688
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:55,780
Yes.

689
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,620
Lord Kang,

690
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,140
I still have some men.

691
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,740
How are you going to assign them?

692
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,420
Lord Han's men have important tasks.

693
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,500
Let's talk upstairs.

694
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,740
But now,

695
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,340
please take some men

696
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,500
to go upstairs with me.

697
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,780
Okay.

698
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,180
You...

699
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:22,980
Come here.

700
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,380
I'm calling you.

701
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,580
Come here.

702
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,460
Dad.

703
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,660
Tumi,

704
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,900
greet Commander.

705
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,460
Greetings, Commander.

706
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,180
They are witnesses.

707
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,860
They can't leave for the time being.

708
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,500
Take them to the second floor.

709
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,460
Find some soldiers

710
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,530
to send them back later.

711
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,300
Then you can rest assured.

712
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,300
Thank you, my lord.

713
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,260
My lady,

714
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,220
Madam Fang

715
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,500
will be fine, right?

716
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:58,860
It is hard to say.

717
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,450
This is serious.

718
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,580
At night,

719
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,660
Madam Fang will be imprisoned.

720
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,500
Madam Fang is just a woman.

721
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,700
If she is imprisoned,

722
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,220
she'll suffer a lot.

723
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:10,140
If she can come back safely,

724
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,300
this is nothing.

725
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,940
Who would poison guests

726
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,220
in her own restaurant?

727
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,180
Madam Fang is definitely not the one who poisoned the guests.

728
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,500
But according to the law,

729
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,940
if people know that the food is poisonous,

730
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:21,940
and they don't destroy it in time

731
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:22,860
and even sell it,

732
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,980
they will be accused of a serious crime.

733
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,340
It's possible to pay with her life.

734
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,300
Then...

735
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,740
If Madam Fang doesn't know anything,

736
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,220
she will be innocent.

737
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,060
That's true.

738
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,180
But when dealing with cases of criminal investigation,

739
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,580
people should use facts as evidence

740
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,460
and the law as the yardstick.

741
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,740
To prove that Madam Fang didn't know about the poison,

742
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,620
we need to know

743
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,260
where the poison came from.

744
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,780
It takes a lot of effort.

745
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:52,570
My two teams

746
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,140
have gone to the streets to collect messages

747
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,940
according to your order.

748
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,500
Stop talking.

749
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,220
I can't hear her.

750
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,140
Don't bother.

751
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,580
I can tell you.

752
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,660
The girl still wanted to use the law.

753
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,460
She thought that to deal with Madam Fang's case,

754
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,620
she should find evidence to prove that

755
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,900
Madam Fang didn't know about the poison.

756
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,380
She went further along the thought.

757
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,340
Now she is thinking about

758
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,100
where the poison is.

759
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,780
She did it right.

760
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,540
You don't need to lower your voice.

761
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:20,730
You have cultivated

762
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,020
some exercises to benefit the internal organs.

763
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,860
It's hard for you to hear the voice from next door.

764
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,660
She is only

765
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,220
a weak woman.

766
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,740
She can't hear you.

767
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,620
I heard

768
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,700
that she wanted to be a litigator.

769
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,460
You can only hear what you want to hear.

770
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,260
You still want her to go to court, right?

771
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,180
We don't have any information, and we can't go out to investigate.

772
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,100
I can't think of anything.

773
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,730
My Lady,

774
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,500
why don't you take a rest?

775
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,930
Lord Kang and Lord Han are both here.

776
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,020
I think

777
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,700
they are very capable.

778
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,500
Didn't you say that

779
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,620
Lord Han reminded you

780
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,780
when you were on the court last time?

781
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,580
I think

782
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:08,700
they should be able to find out the truth

783
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,540
and clear Madam Fang's name.

784
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,900
I've seen what Lord Kang did

785
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,660
today.

786
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,100
He arranged everything

787
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,420
all of a sudden.

788
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,740
I admire him.

789
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,180
But as for Lord Han...

790
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,700
I always feel that

791
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,180
he is a man who got his position

792
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,540
because of his status.

793
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,700
He is unreliable.

794
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:29,740
This girl...

795
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:30,420
What's the matter?

796
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,460
What did she say?

797
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,380
She said that you were a good-for-nothing

798
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,540
and a playboy.

799
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,330
I see.

800
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,980
Her cognition of you

801
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,180
is quite accurate.

802
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,660
Zhang Hongtu, the county magistrate, is here to see you.

803
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,700
Come in.

804
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,020
Greetings, Lord Kang.

805
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,860
Greetings, Lord Han.

806
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,780
Have you brought people here?

807
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,420
The main minister, three teams of guards,

808
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,940
and the coroner

809
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,490
are all waiting outside the courtyard,

810
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,140
and they are waiting for your orders.

811
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,100
OK.

812
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,420
Send the dead man back

813
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,780
and examine the body.

814
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,420
Then take the vomit

815
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:16,740
and the suspected fish soup

816
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,900
back.

817
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,020
As for Linshui Pavilion,

818
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,570
I'm afraid it will be closed for the time being.

819
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:23,020
Especially the kitchen...

820
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,780
It must be guarded.

821
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,460
Okay.

822
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,460
The unrelated people

823
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:27,940
are not allowed to come any closer.

824
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,140
Yes.

825
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,260
Yes.

826
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,420
Lord Kang,

827
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,940
look how you scared Lord Zhang.

828
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,580
Lord Zhang,

829
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,700
Lord Kang is leaving to check other prisons in other places

830
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,260
in a few days.

831
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:42,980
You'll be free then.

832
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,060
You must be joking, Lord Han.

833
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,860
Lord Zhang,

834
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,220
take all the people of Linshui Pavilion

835
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,220
back too.

836
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,100
I want to interrogate them myself.

837
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,580
Yes.

838
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,180
I will go to the county office.

839
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,740
Are you coming with me?

840
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,580
Sure.

841
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,620
I'm also a witness

842
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,420
of this case.

843
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,540
I'll follow you and go back to the county office

844
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,460
for an ordinary hearing.

845
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:21,300
Lord Kang and Lord Han

846
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,300
seem to be leaving.

847
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,460
Are they going for the trial?

848
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,580
Let's go there too.

849
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,770
Miss Chun,

850
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,660
your father is going to the county office

851
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,900
to cooperate with the lords to investigate the case.

852
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,020
He asked me

853
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,180
to send you back.

854
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,580
My dad didn't forget me.

855
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,380
Now I can't go to court.

856
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,260
Why hasn't my husband come back

857
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,220
for so long?

858
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,050
Didn't Tumi say that

859
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,780
my husband was just a witness

860
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,260
he would be home soon?

861
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:50,700
I don't know.

862
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,500
But just now,

863
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,300
when I went to the gate,

864
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,060
I saw Miss Chun was also waiting.

865
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,450
Before I got married,

866
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,180
Madam Fang was flirting with my husband

867
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,130
She and Tumi were also intimate.

868
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,660
Although I have tried really hard to

869
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,620
cut off my husband's thoughts about her

870
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,220
after I got married,

871
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,620
she still rents the house of the Chun family.

872
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,020
They make contact with each other,

873
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,860
which makes me uncomfortable.

874
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,940
This time, someone died

875
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,780
in Linshui Pavilion.

876
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,020
She'll have a hard time.

877
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,100
Right.

878
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,500
Tumi.

879
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,620
Dad.

880
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,450
The soldiers said that you were just a witness, and

881
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,340
you just needed to record the testimony.

882
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,740
What took you so long?

883
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,780
It was true that I only recorded the testimony,

884
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,780
but Lord Han was there.

885
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,460
So he asked me

886
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:41,530
to listen to the trial with him.

887
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,620
What about the result?

888
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,820
How is Madam Fang?

889
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,540
Today, Lord Kang

890
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,500
only interrogated the important witnesses

891
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,500
who were selected

892
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,980
one by one.

893
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,180
But Dr. Wen made a definite diagnosis

894
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,090
that all the guests

895
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,540
who were feeling bad

896
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,220
were poisoned by food.

897
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,540
It seems that

898
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,580
Madam Fang is indeed at a disadvantage.

899
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,900
Then they were really

900
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,180
poisoned by scomber japonicus.

901
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,740
This is bad.

902
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:11,860
How did you know that

903
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,420
it's related to the fish?

904
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,340
When Lord Kang asked Madam Fang today,

905
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,940
she told them

906
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,820
the ingredients of Lotus Fish Soup.

907
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,860
After knowing her for so many years,

908
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,380
I finally know this.

909
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,740
Lord Kang also thinks that it's related to the fish,

910
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,500
so he has sent someone to

911
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,340
Sanhui...

912
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,020
to look for the fish dealer.

913
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,460
Sanhui Seaport.

914
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:33,900
The soldier who sent me back today

915
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,020
came from the place.

916
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:35,900
So they know

917
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,620
the ingredients of Lotus Fish Soup.

918
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,660
He said everyone there knows that

919
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,940
the fish is poisonous.

920
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:41,740
People have to clean it

921
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,500
by themselves after buying it.

922
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,740
If they get the testimony,

923
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,140
that Madam Fang knows the fish is poisonous

924
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,140
and continues to sell it

925
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,100
will be settled.

926
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,780
What's the worst sentence?

927
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,220
Death by hanging.

928
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,180
Darling!

929
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:02,020
Darling,

930
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,980
it's fine for you to run around

931
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,060
for others' business.

932
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,580
Why are you still talking here

933
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,820
after you came back?

934
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:09,900
Why didn't you go inside?

935
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,900
I ran into Tumi as soon as I came back,

936
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,700
so I chatted with her.

937
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,540
What happened today

938
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,300
panicked Tumi too.

939
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,100
Tumi is capable.

940
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,300
She can even appeal in court.

941
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,660
You don't need to worry about of her

942
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,060
in terms of this.

943
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,900
How could you say that?

944
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,980
Why do I suddenly feel dizzy?

945
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,700
You...

946
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,260
Madam...

947
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:32,820
You...

948
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,580
What's wrong?

949
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,300
Tumi,

950
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,740
go back to your room first.

951
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,780
I'll go in with her.

952
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,140
Xiaoqin, help me.

953
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,100
-Madam... -Hold her.

954
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,860
I don't know if it's true.

955
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,220
The headache can't be diagnosed.

956
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,580
It's really useful.

957
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,580
Forget it.

958
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,820
It's normal for her to be jealous

959
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,140
because of Madam Fang.

960
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,380
The problem now is

961
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,380
how we should

962
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,140
help Madam Fang.

963
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,740
Father.

964
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,380
Tumi.

965
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,380
I think since Madam has a headache,

966
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,860
she must haven't prepared dinner.

967
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,420
So I asked Guo to prepare some.

968
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,620
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

969
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,580
Yes.

970
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,300
I forgot about dinner.

971
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,420
Father,

972
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,460
about Madam Fang,

973
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,220
you must be worried.

974
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,020
You said she would probably be hanged.

975
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,740
I feel uneasy.

976
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,420
By the way,

977
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,580
where does Scholar Sun live?

978
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,260
I'll meet him tomorrow.

979
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:37,460
Father,

980
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,980
I went to Scholar Sun last time

981
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:40,300
for your case.

982
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:41,220
He took my money.

983
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,180
But he didn't show up.

984
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,300
It's a matter of life and death.

985
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:44,340
Can we trust him

986
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,900
since he did things like this?

987
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,820
What should we do then?

988
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,620
Father,

989
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,940
I've thought about

990
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,020
the case,

991
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,380
and I have read law books

992
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,940
and my mother's notes.

993
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,540
I want to appeal instead of Madam Fang.

994
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,500
This...

995
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,420
No.

996
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,260
Father,

997
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,860
Madam Fang treats us well.

998
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,860
We can't just let her die, right?

999
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,219
How about

1000
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,179
telling me what you think?

1001
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,060
I'll go to the court.

1002
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,780
No way.

1003
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:16,260
Father, you are a soldier.

1004
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,820
How can you be a litigator?

1005
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,420
And we need to be flexible at court.

1006
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,219
If there's anything special,

1007
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,300
can I tell you

1008
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,540
and let you repeat?

1009
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,739
Besides, the government has rules that

1010
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,980
only litigators

1011
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,780
and people with scholarly honor

1012
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,860
can check the records.

1013
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,340
Are you going to read it yourself,

1014
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,900
recite it, and tell me?

1015
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,860
That would take too much time and energy.

1016
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,139
Even if we can wait,

1017
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:37,980
the officials at the court

1018
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:38,820
can't wait.

1019
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,620
I can't let you

1020
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:41,020
ruin your reputation.

1021
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,219
If people know

1022
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,300
that you have appealed,

1023
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,900
how can you marry good families in the future?

1024
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:47,179
According to the rules of this dynasty,

1025
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,739
if a woman doesn't get married at the right age,

1026
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,179
she will be arranged by the country.

1027
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,260
Father,

1028
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,420
think about it.

1029
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,699
One is my reputation,

1030
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,860
and the other is Madam Fang's life.

1031
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,620
Which is more important?

1032
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,340
Think about it.

1033
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,700
My grandfather told me that

1034
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,740
we should be righteous.

1035
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,460
We can't just think about ourselves.

1036
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,300
And you said that I resembled my mother.

1037
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,660
If my mother were here,

1038
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,540
she would make this same decision

1039
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,940
at this moment, right?

1040
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,860
Fine.

1041
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,500
Just give it a try.

1042
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:25,020
Dad, please have the meal.

1043
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,420
Okay.

1044
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,300
Madam Fang.

1045
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,460
Tumi?

1046
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,220
Why are you here?

1047
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,500
I'll appeal in court instead of you tomorrow.

1048
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,620
I've read

1049
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:43,580
the files of your case.

1050
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,500
I have some questions for you.

1051
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,100
Tumi.

1052
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,180
I appreciate your kindness.

1053
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,900
But appealing instead of me

1054
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,860
will really affect you.

1055
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,300
My father and I are not afraid.

1056
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,500
What are you afraid of?

1057
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,980
Besides,

1058
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,660
I'm not doing this for you.

1059
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,620
I'm doing this

1060
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,820
for the Chun's house.

1061
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,300
If you can't get out,

1062
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:05,660
who will pay the rent?

1063
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,060
Then how can I buy new clothes

1064
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:07,900
and have a dowry?

1065
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,460
Look at your mouth.

1066
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,300
If we want to win the case tomorrow,

1067
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,220
we still need to rely on my mouth.

1068
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:18,940
Madam Fang,

1069
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,100
can you tell me

1070
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,620
the steps

1071
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,820
from buying materials to being served?

1072
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,340
I go to

1073
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,020
Sanhui Seaport every day

1074
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,340
to buy cured scomber japonicus in person.

1075
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,060
After buying it,

1076
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,540
I have to cure it

1077
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,940
with a secret method

1078
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,700
to remove the poison.

1079
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,180
After a whole night,

1080
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,900
I cook it myself.

1081
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,860
After that,

1082
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,500
I put it into a flowered bowl

1083
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,260
with a sealed cap

1084
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,380
and serve it to the guests.

1085
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:48,780
During the whole process,

1086
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:49,900
can others touch

1087
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,020
your fish?

1088
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,620
Logically, no.

1089
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:55,180
Because

1090
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,740
the small kitchen where the fish soup is cooked

1091
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,020
is always locked.

1092
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,740
No one can go in or out.

1093
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,340
Besides,

1094
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,020
the flowered bowls for fish soup

1095
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,100
are also opened

1096
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,380
by the guests themselves.

1097
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,700
If someone touches it,

1098
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,540
they can definitely tell.

1099
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,700
That's bad.

1100
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,940
You handled it in person during the whole process.

1101
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,260
It is impossible for you to be freed.

1102
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:16,900
But after cooking for all these years,

1103
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:17,890
that day was exactly the same

1104
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:18,940
as usual.

1105
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,740
There can't be any poison left.

1106
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,540
When you go to court tomorrow,

1107
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,140
no matter what others say,

1108
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,820
remember what you said.

1109
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:27,700
In this case,

1110
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:30,020
people were poisoned in public.

1111
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,780
You can't shirk the responsibility.

1112
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,180
The best situation

1113
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,140
is to prove that you didn't know the truth

1114
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,340
and you were wronged.

1115
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,660
Then this will be manslaughter.

1116
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,530
You only need to pay some money.

1117
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,380
This is indeed strange.

1118
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,460
After thinking about it,

1119
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,300
I think there must be someone trying to harm me.

1120
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,220
But why?

1121
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,460
In terms of this matter,

1122
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,180
we can only find the reason

1123
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,140
from Zhao Laoqi.
