this witness and I

have completed the verification.

00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,860
How's it going?

10
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,259
The situation is that...he

11
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,300
is perfectly fine.

12
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,180
You can go down.

someone else can't do it

14
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,810
doesn't mean he can't do it.

15
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,140
Yeah.

16
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:14,820
Yes.

without panting.

And I don't think it's hard.

00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:28,260
It seems Zhang Wuniang is right.

What else do you have to say?

27
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,579
Please give me a little more time.

28
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,860
Let me think about it.

All right.

you haven't produced a shred of evidence

32
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:41,220
that Chun Dashan was wronged.

33
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:43,340
I've put up with you for a long time.

34
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,060
I understand that you're a little girl.

35
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,060
So I didn't charge you with court disturbance.

Stop messing with

37

Yes.

47
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,820

in the last testimony,

52
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,260
what did Zhang Wuniang say about

53
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,620

and today's statement,

58
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,060
it's said that Chun Dashan entered the yard,

59
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,340
locked the gate,

60
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,420
and was about to do something wrong.

61
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,260
In Li Er's testimony,

62
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,060
he said saw Chun Dashan

63

entered the yard

64
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,700
and rushed in

65

to save Zhang Wuniang.

66
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,820
Since he had locked the gate,

67
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,900
how could he see

68
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,900
inside?

69
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,620

71
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,330
I panicked

72
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,940
and said the wrong thing.

73
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,690
Yes, yes, yes.

74
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,380
Yes.

75
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,460
I was just angry.

76
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,339
I live right next door to Zhang Wuniang.

77
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,180
That day I heard a cry for help.

78
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,500
I climbed to the top of the wall,

79
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,930
and I saw this villain

80
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,180
doing something bad.

81
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,700
I didn't go in through the gate.

82
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,580
Do you know martial arts?

83
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,290
No.

84
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,180
Your grace.

85
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,260
I asked someone

86
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,659
to find the blueprints for Licorice Street.

87
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,940
As is shown in the picture,

88
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,140
the courtyard wall of Licorice Street

89
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,460
should be at least eight feet.

90
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:37,900
My witness

91
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,460
is six feet, and he can't get over it.

92
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,860
You...

93
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,940
I stepped on the water tank,

94
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,500
which I put under the wall to catch rain water

95
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,620
to prevent fire.

96
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:48,220
So,

97
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,420
do you still have your tank?

98
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,900
No, it's broken.

99
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,659
Since it's used to prevent fire,

100
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,700
it must have been laid aside for a long time.

101
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,780
There should be traces on the ground.

102
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,060
Why don't we ask someone to take a look?

103
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,420
As it happens,

104
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,660
I bought my jar

105
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,100
after she paid me back.

106
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,380
I didn't leave it there long enough to make a dent.

107
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,300
Then consider it as a new purchase.

108
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,460
There's no trace.

109
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,580
Is the shard still there?

110
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,620
Where did the pieces go?

111
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,860
The pieces are behind the house.

112
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,660
They have been picked up long ago.

113
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,660
I want to get even with

114
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,260
the jar seller.

115
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,540
You bought a new jar

116
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,860
and it happened to get smashed.

117
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,860
And its pieces happened to be picked up.

118
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,180
I was wondering

119
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,460
were you hurt?

120
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,740
I... No.

121
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,290
Then you're really good.

122
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:27,900
Your grace.

123
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,740
Li Er's bones were so light that

124
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,740
he was able to jump eight feet off a wall

125
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,170
while standing on a water tank,

126
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,100
unharmed.

127
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,420
A man like that,

128
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,659
your grace might consider him

129
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,620
serving the country.

130
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,340
Your grace.

131
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,180
I've learned some martial arts since childhood,

132
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,659
so I'm curious.

133
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,180
I wonder if your grace can ask Li Er

134
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,020
to demonstrate the skill

135
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,620
of jumping down from eight feet high wall

136
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,780
without any injury?

137
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,620
Yes.

138
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,100
Why don't you jump?

139
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,180
That means my evidence

140
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:53,810
doesn't hold up.

141
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,020
If you can't jump,

142
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,380
you're lying.

143
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,740
Also, it happened so suddenly.

144
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,740
Where did you come from?

145
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,380
Pestle.

146
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,100
Yes.

147
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,340
It has always been

148
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,740
the women, the children who wash the clothes.

149
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,210
Could it be that this Li Er

150
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:06,980
learned

151
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,020
his martial arts

152
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,660
from washing clothes?

153
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,940
Haven't you heard that Li Er

154
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,250
only wash clothes once a few months?

155
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:11,940
And

156
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,980
his neighbors helped with the washing.

157
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,340
That's strange.

158
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,300
In that case,

159
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,020
where did you get the pestle?

160
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,020
Where did you get it?

161
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:18,940
Where did you get it?

162
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,060
Where did you get it?

163
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:20,980
Where did you get it?

164
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,580
Li Er.

165
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,580
Why don't you jump with this pestle

166
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,420
again?

167
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,300
Your grace.

168
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,660
Guys.

169
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,300
I grew up without a mother.

170
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,340
And my father brought me up.

171
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,860
Everyone knows my father loves me.

172
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,890
Now I'm old enough to get married.

173
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,020

Who solved it?

346
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:35,980
I...

347
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,380
and some of my friends.

348
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,930
How did you solve it?

349
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,780
I came to tell Her Ladyship

350
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,940
to reassure you.

351
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
If you have any doubts,

352
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,260
you can check with him

353
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,180
when he comes back.

354
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,220
Wait till he's back,

355
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,740
then everything is late.

356
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,140
Don't worry.

357
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,820
I've arranged everything.

358
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,780
Master Hu is on his way to the county government

359
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,940
with my money

360
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,460
to bring Dashan back safe and sound.

361
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,700
What are you talking about?

362
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,660
I need you to get someone to that Master Hu.

363
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,780
He can't see the county magistrate.

364
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,500
Okay.

365
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,820
What are you doing?

366
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,380
Mrs. Wang.

367
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,700
Why are you holding Guo'er back?

368
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,260
Without the old lady's permission,

369
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,900
no one can leave the yard.

370
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,060
She belongs to Chun's family.

371
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,100
Why can't she get out?

372
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,020
Tumi.

373
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,260
Guo'er is the maid of the Chun family.

374
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,980
I'm the mistress of the Chun family.

375
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,460
Mrs. Wang is not qualified.

376
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,820
I must be qualified.

377
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:26,740
Your Ladyship.

378
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:27,820
Think about it.

379
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,300
I won't hurt my father, right?

380
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,860
Your lady must be out of your mind.

381
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,020
Master Hu is known as

382
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,770
a pen-and-knife bureaucrat.

383
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,140
If Master Hu can't solve this problem,

384
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,220
who can we count on?

385
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,130
You don't want us

386
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,020
to intercede with His Lordship

387
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,060
because you

388
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,260
read too many books

389
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,020
and you want to bully

390
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,100
honest people, like us?

391
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,740
-Madam. -Her Ladyship.

392
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,940
If we go to the government office,

393
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,340
I'm afraid there will be trouble again.

394
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,020
How old are you?

395
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,260
What do you know?

396
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,140
Since ancient times, the official has two mouths.

397
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,420
Without money,

398
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,220
we can't believe

399
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,660
what they say.

400
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,060
Now that I'm here,

401
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,900
you can leave it alone.

402
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,460
I have my own idea.

403
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,660
Thank you, your ladyship.

404
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,100
But it can't be rushed,

405
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,100
it's better to wait.

406
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,460
If we can't solve it tomorrow,

407
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,900
it's not too late to ask for help.

408
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,980
If your family

409
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:11,940
has people who can solve the problem,

410
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,820
you wouldn't ask

411
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,980
ask us for help.

412
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,940
It was Madam

413
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,940
who insisted on inviting the old lady.

414
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,380
She didn't.

415
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,180
You... Guo'er.

416
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,820
What did you mean, Your Ladyship?

417
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,020
Although I'm young,

418
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,100
I understand filial piety comes first.

419
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,250
I'm not gonna let anything happen to my father.

420
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,300
Tumi.

421
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,260
I know your father loves you.

422
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,380
But even if he loves you,

423
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,020
you're still going to get married.

424
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,900
When you marry someone, you're an outsider.

425
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,340
You belong to someone else's family.

426
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,140
So,

427
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,180
you have to understand that

428
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,220
your father is first and foremost

429
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,380
my daughter's husband,

430
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,300
and second, he is my son-in-law.

431
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,260
If there is a decision to be made,

432
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,340
it shouldn't be made

433
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:46,340
by an outsider who is about to get married.

434
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,460
I'm gonna say something nasty.

435
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,660
When your father dies in the future,

436
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,140
my daughter decides

437
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,060
where to bury him.

438
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,700
You can just cry

439
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,980
at the grave.

440
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,860
Luckily, my father is not dead yet.

441
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,260
As long as I'm alive,

442
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,620
I won't let him be wronged.

443
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,620
I don't understand.

444
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,020
Who is a stranger

445
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,420
in this yard now?

446
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,340
You gave favors and money.

447
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,980
We should thank you.

448
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,180
But you acted on your own

449
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:13,780
without

450
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,500
asking our wishes.

451
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,460
Is this the Chun family

452
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,460
or the Xu family?

453
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,500
How dare you talk to me like that?

454
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,740
It's about my father's innocence.

455
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,420
I have to

456
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,500
resist your kindness.

457
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,100
Guo'er, stop him.

458
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:23,940
Yes.

459
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,260
Stop that bitch!

460
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,700
Stop her!

461
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,220
Guo'er, are you okay?

462
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,540
So rude.

463
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,300
So rude.

464
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,300
Is that what Chun Dashan

465
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,540
taught you?

466
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,020
Your daughter married into my family.

467
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,260
You scolding the Chun family is equal to scolding her.

468
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,300
Say what you will.

469
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,820
And you.

470
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,100
Guo'er is my maid.

471
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,460
Don't you dare touch her again!

472
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:44,500
Don't you dare touch her again!

473
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,540
If a servant can't beat your maid,

474
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,180
I can do it.

475
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,300
Even if you

476
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,420
don't get married this year,

477
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,580
you'll be married

478
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,300
next year.

479
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:57,380
I will make an example of this servant girl

480
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,740
today

481
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,740
and set a rule for Master Chun,

482
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,900
so as not to make a disgrace of you

483
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,010
when you come to your husband's house.

484
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:06,980
My Lady.

485
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,140
My lady, are you alright?

486
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,220
Guo'er, go stop him first.

487
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,020
Hurry up!

488
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,260
I'll see who dares to move.

489
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,980
No, Mother.

490
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,140
Are you okay?

491
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:14,660
Tumi.

492
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,500
I... I'll send someone to stop Master Hu.

493
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,700
You should go back to rest.

494
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,700
What are you doing?

495
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,620
Mother.

496
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,180
I think

497
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,460
we should let this go.

498
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,700
You... You.

499
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,940
[The river fish is easy to get.]

500
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,420
Miss Chun is really good.

501
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,380
If it were me,

502
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,520
[Lotus Fish Soup]

503
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,220
my legs would be shaking in the court.

504
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,500
She's not afraid?

505
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,140
I have a friend

506
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,740
who works with her father, Chun Dashan.

507
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,620
He said

508
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,180
she had been fascinated by the Torah books

509
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:41,860
since childhood.

510
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,820
She must have grown up

511
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,220
listening to her grandfather's Yamen stories.

512
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,060
Really?

513
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,180
In recent years,

514
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,740
she has become more eloquent.

515
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,780
I heard she helped a lot of people.

516
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,100
No wonder.

517
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,300
Sir, here's your lotus fish soup.

518
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,020
Please enjoy.

519
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,820
Don't just listen.

520
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,700
Your missed

521
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,099
Linshuilou lotus fish soup

522
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,460
costs one tael of silver.

523
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,250
If it gets cold,

524
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,540
it will be a waste.

525
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,099
It's said that the lotus fish soup is rare.

526
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,500
It only sells ten bowls a day.

527
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,380
I was curious.

528
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,940
But it was just

529
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,420
served in front of me so easily,

530
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,500
I don't feel like drinking it.

531
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,980
Let it go to waste.

532
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,020
It's wasted anyway.

533
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:31,660
Anyway, it's you,

534
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,740
the emperor's close official, who pay for it.

535
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,060
You're kidding, Lord Han.

536
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,380
Prefectures have many talents.

537
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,780
I'm just a sixth grade official.

538
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,500
What close officials?

539
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,100
It can't be true.

540
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:42,980
Look.

541
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,460
In this small Bianzhou Restaurant,

542
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,940
even if I show my name,

543
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,620
I can't book

544
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,420
No. 1 Room.

545
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,460
Who is in No. 1 Room?

546
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,380
I heard it's a southern trader.

547
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,300
Interesting.

548
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,460
Mother.

549
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,540
Wait for me!

550
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,020
Mother!

551
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,610
Mother, don't go.

552
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,740
You're on that girl's side.

553
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,420
What else do you want me to do?

554
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,980
I begged Master Hu.

555
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:15,740
But?

556
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,580
I've been busy for nothing.

557
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,420
Mother.

558
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:20,100
I didn't mean that.

559
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,300
Dashan had always loved

560
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,060
this daughter the most.

561
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,500
You hit her today.

562
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,740
If he found out,

563
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,220
it would be a storm.

564
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,460
He'll blame me.

565
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,380
Then you asked her

566
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,180
to stop Master Hu

567
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,540
and let her do what she wants?

568
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:32,500
I thought that

569
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,860
if Dashan was sentenced in the third session,

570
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,260
it would be okay

571
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,540
to beg Master Hu at that time.

572
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,780
In that case,

573
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,100
it's all Tumi's fault.

574
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,220
She can't blame us.

575
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,900
Look at you.

576
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,620
There're so many young talents.

577
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,490
And you don't like them?

578
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,020
Why did you have a crash on

579
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,700
that Chun Dashan?

580
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:52,740
Forget it.

581
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:53,980
It's up to you.

582
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,100
Mother, take care.

583
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:09,820
Xiao Zheng, tell me.

584
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,500
We've seen a lot of women

585
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,490
since we were kids.

586
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,940
But we've never seen

587
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,180
anyone like Chun Tumi before?

588
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,370
She started talking about the law

589
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,300
at a very young age.

590
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,660
With a little prodding,

591
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,300
she can pull through.

592
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,860
She's like a little lion.

593
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,820
She grab and hit

594
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:25,780
where it hurt.

595
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,660
Yesterday, you disliked

596
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,250
a curtain of separation.

597
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,900
You took the initiative to save her.

598
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,060
I figured,

599
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,260
apart from what she said

600
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,420
was interesting,

601
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,740
and you've got a little something for yourself.

602
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,460
But Lord Han,

603
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,180
you're here on a secret mission.

604
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,330
But I have to

605
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,380
make a sad remark.

606
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,420
You...

607
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,300
Don't worry.

608
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:48,100
I wasted no time.

609
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,260
When did you see me waste the time?

610
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,020
When this case is over,

611
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,860
I have one more thing

612
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,980
to ask Lord Han.

613
00:19:59,180 --> 00:19:59,620
You said

614
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:01,860
you'd give me Chun Dashan.

615
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,020
He must be a man of law

616
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,220
if he can raise such a daughter.

617
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,660
His family is a military family.

618
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,660
You're an official.

619
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:12,820
He can't follow you.

620
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,460
I went back to the military mansion yesterday

621
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,420
to check the records of the Chun family.

622
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:20,780
Chun Dashan's father

623
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,180
has two brothers.

624
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,540
His father is the third child.

625
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,660
Chun Qingyang has two children.

626
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,300
Instead of going to the army,

627
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,260
he went to work for the Yamen.

628
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,540
As you know,

629
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,780
in order to avoid the evasion of soldiers,

630
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,380
the law stipulates that the military and the family shall not be divided.

631
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,900
But I can't believe his two brothers

632
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,260
didn't have a son

633
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,370
and then became extinct.

634
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,740
Only three of their daughters

635
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,620
married out of town.

636
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,540
To Chun Dashan's generation,

637
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,500
they had no choice.

638
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,140
His second uncle stepped into the shoes of his elder uncle.

639
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,380
So Chun Dashan doesn't

640
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,340
have a son now?

641
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,660
If he had a son,

642
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,820
he wouldn't ask his daughter

643
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,220
to stand in for him.

644
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,220
But Xiao Zheng.

645
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,940
The most important thing right now

646
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,980
is not this.

647
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,380
You know that

648
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,260
my secret edict is very heavy.

649
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,060
You should cooperate with me

650
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,300
to get the work done.

651
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,370
It's important to report to the capital.

652
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,020
As for Chun Dashan,

653
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,700
I'll figure it out later.

654
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,620
Why are you crying?

655
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,020
It's nothing serious.

656
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,500
Everything is done.

657
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,500
I'm relieved.

658
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:25,620
Have a seat.

659
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,460
My Lady.

660
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,740
There is a blood mark

661
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,460
on your back.

662
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,660
How wide is it?

663
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,860
It's all my fault.

664
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,180
In this world,

665
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,900
no lady

666
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,620
will defend a girl.

667
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,220
There is no reason for a lady

668
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,460
to defend a girl.

669
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,380
But a big sister

670
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,460
can defend her little sister.

671
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:48,940
Look.

672
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,500
We grew up together.

673
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,140
Now we even get beaten together.

674
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,460
Go find some medicine.

675
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,740
Let's apply it together.

676
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,170
But

677
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,020
they are all kept by Her Ladyship.

678
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,660
I...

679
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,580
It's fine.

680
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,340
I'll ask them now.

681
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,700
If they refuse,

682
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,940
we can rob or beg.

683
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,140
I can't let her

684
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,260
suffer any more.

685
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,460
They

686
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,540
don't like us now.

687
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,020
Stop asking for trouble.

688
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,860
What are you doing here?

689
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,660
Madam asked me to give it to you.

690
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,180
Did the sun rise from the west?

691
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,060
Xiao Qin gave it to you.

692
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,700
Don't use it now.

693
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,500
They are in a hurry to deliver it.

694
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,260
Did they poison them?

695
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,380
No.

696
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,820
Her Ladyship also wants us to

697
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,780
get better soon.

698
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,180
She thinks she hurt me.

699
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,060
When my father came back,

700
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,740
she wouldn't know

701
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:11,660
how to explain to him.

702
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,580
So this medicine

703
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,020
should be the best.

704
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,020
Well,

705
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:17,860
you can use it.

706
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,220
No, thanks.

707
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,860
The wound on my face is obvious.

708
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,580
When Master comes back tomorrow,

709
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,540
he'll ask us.

710
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,740
By then, my lady,

711
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,820
you can tell

712
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,660
what happened today.

713
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,260
Don't let them succeed.

714
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,540
Today's purpose

715
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:31,620
is to stop Master Hu.

716
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,250
It's fine if it's done.

717
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,980
Although Her Ladyship is muddled,

718
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,900
she still cares about me.

719
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:37,900
Well,

720
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,820
let's call it a day.

721
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,620
As long as my father can come back safely,

722
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,660
everything else...

723
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,940
I really have something to talk to him.

724
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,580
What else?

725
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,540
Madam reminded me.

726
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,060
I haven't talked about my marriage yet.

727
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,010
At my age,

728
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,340
I'll still get married.

729
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,180
So before that,

730
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,380
you should hurry up

731
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,620
to do what you want.

732
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,580
What do you want to do?

733
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,020
Guo'er.

734
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,770
I think I enjoy

735
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,300
killing everyone in court.

736
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,740
I think I'm very useful,

737
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,860
like a hero.

738
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,660
My lady, slow down.

739
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,660
Although I just filed a complaint,

740
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,420
when I went to court,

741
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,580
my mind went blank.

742
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,460
But after I figured out my thoughts,

743
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,740
I won't be afraid anymore.

744
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:25,460
Anyway, I don't know these.

745
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,980
As long as Master is fine

746
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,020
and your reputation is not damaged,

747
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,180
we can

748
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,020
live a good life.

749
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
What is the future?

750
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,290
Just like before.

751
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,220
When you are free,

752
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,420
you can read books and listen to stories

753
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,620
and then get married and have children.

754
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,460
It sounds boring.

755
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,100
How is it boring?

756
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,140
That's how everyone lives.

757
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,300
Anyway, you can't be a litigator

758
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:54,260
like Scholar Sun.

759
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,980
I almost forgot.

760
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,060
Scholar Sun took

761
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,340
five silvers from us.

762
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,740
He didn't do anything for money

763
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:03,740
and almost ruined it.

764
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:04,380
Go.

765
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,620
Let him spit out the money

766
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,500
that he swallowed.

767
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,420
Damn it.

768
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,780
I'll go alone.

769
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,380
Don't fight.

770
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,500
I'll teach you how to say it.

771
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,100
Just say

772
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,060
the guests from the south

773
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,420
came early or late,

774
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,130
but she appeared in Bianzhou

775
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,140
at the same time.

776
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,580
Send someone to keep an eye on him.

777
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,860
At this critical moment,

778
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,580
It's right to be careful.

779
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,900
[Tea]

780
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,980
Young Master.

781
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,740
Long time no see.

782
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,500
What are you doing here?

783
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,140
Young Master is in Bianzhou alone

784
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,420
and hasn't returned yet.

785
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,020
The Grand Secretary is worried that

786
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,420
you'll miss the pay day this month.

787
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,300
So I specially sent Shen Wei here.

788
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,330
Where is it?

789
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,500
This belongs to Young Master.

790
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,740
This is Jinyi's.

791
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:15,100
Before Shen Wei went out,

792
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:17,020
the Grand Secretary kept reminding me that

793
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,900
you should take good medicine every month

794
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,420
and you must take it on time.

795
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,770
Don't delay.

796
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,780
Otherwise, you will suffer.

797
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,260
I missed the return date,

798
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,940
because Han Wuwei

799
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,860
has arrived in Bianzhou.

800
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,660
I've already written

801
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,340
to the Grand Secretary.

802
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,740
You've already met the Left Hand Protector

803
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,980
at Linshui Building, right?

804
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:38,860
Yes.

805
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,220
I'll take care of the inkstone.

806
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,900
The Left Hand Protector paraded himself

807
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,420
in front of Han Wuwei just now.

808
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,820
It's not necessary.

809
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,140
Young Master.

810
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,540
this is all Grand Secretary's idea.

811
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,300
Although Han Wuwei is in the light now,

812
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,620
we are in the dark.

813
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,820
But Chu You, the commissioner of Bianzhou,

814
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,140
has a knack

815
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,490
for tricks.

816
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,460
He's in charge of the inkstone.

817
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,460
If he gave it to Han Wuwei,

818
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,140
it'd be difficult for us.

819
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,860
The Grand Secretary is worried that you'll suffer losses outside.

820
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:11,860
First,

821
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,180
I can attract

822
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,260
Han Wuwei's attention.

823
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,540
And I can help you get away after it's done.

824
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,340
Second,

825
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,980
the details

826
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,860
can be used by you.

827
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,820
Thank you, Grand Secretary.

828
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:26,490
Although

829
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,100
I am a young master,

830
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,020
I'm actually a sinner.

831
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,980
How can I command Left Hand Protector?

832
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,690
Young Master,

833
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,660
you can't think like that.

834
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:39,780
Although

835
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,220
he is still angry,

836
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,660
you and him

837
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,620
are father and son.

838
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,500
Blood is thicker than water.

839
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,820
In this world,

840
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,340
no father

841
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,580
will exile his own son

842
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,140
for the rest of his life.

843
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,260
Besides, everyone knows

844
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,260
he will support you.

845
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,340
It's only a matter of time

846
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,660
for your reset.

847
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,260
I've been working for the Pavilion these years.

848
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,980
I'll be fine as long as I'm with you.

849
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:07,890
Left Hand Protector,

850
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,740
don't mention

851
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,460
the past.

852
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:13,940
Yes.

853
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,620
But there is one thing

854
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,020
to ask you.

855
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,660
Just tell me.

856
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:34,860
