[Episode 1]

4
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,450
Litigators, tell me about the case.

5
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:58,460
My lord.

6
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,020
In broad daylight,

7
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,900
Villain Zhang bullied people and committed crimes in public,

8
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,740
and stole Mrs. Liu's property.

9
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,250
If we don't punish him severely,

10
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,220
how do we serve justice?

11
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,220
My lord, he's innocent.

12
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,770
He didn't take anyone's property

13
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,139
but Mrs. Liu's.

14
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,100
There must be a reason.

15
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:10,979
A reason?

16
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,380
Mrs. Liu borrowed

17
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,340
50 taels from him out of life pressure.

18
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,300
That was the reason.

19
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,820
According to the law,

20
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,220
any private loans and pawns

21
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,220
can't make more than three percent profit.

22
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,020
Although she's been in debt for a long time,

23
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,690
he can't make a profit more than how much he loaned.

24
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:20,460
According to the law of debit and credit

25
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,370
in our dynasty,

26
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,210
the basic principle is that

27
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:22,860
a lender's profit

28
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,860
can't exceed how much he loaned.

29
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,420
Villager Zhang manipulated with compound interest, raising the initial 50 taels

30
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,340
to 200 taels.

31
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,500
That was against the basic principle.

32
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,730
When Mrs. Liu couldn't repay it,

33
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,570
Villager Zhang wanted to take

34
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,220
her house.

35
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,060
That was a robbery.

36
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,060
Considering what he committed,

37
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,020
he should be sentenced to prison, exile, or put to death by hanging.

38
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:36,940
Ms. Chun.

39
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,020
That's not true.

40
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,060
I hereby present the exhibit that says Mrs. Liu

41
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:41,140
sells the room in Lin Lang Pavilion out of her own will,

42
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,940
including everything from the rafters, concrete materials, and bricks

43
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,900
to the subgrade.

44
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,620
Here is the receipt.

45
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,460
How can you deny it in court?

46
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:47,860
Right.

47
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,060
Our country was governed by law.

48
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,060
How dare you sue in court

49
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,100
while committing blackmail?

50
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,579
As a litigator,

51
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:53,300
you can't tell right from wrong,

52
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:54,900
don't you worried about being punished?

53
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,620
My lord,

54
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,460
Ms. Chun accused him of making illegal profit without any proof,

55
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,540
we dare not accept this accusation.

56
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,940
Nowhere in the receipt signed by Mrs. Liu indicates

57
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,460
there's compound interest.

58
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,900
Ms. Chun has no evidence to prove her accusation.

59
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,660
She slandered him

60
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,540
and lodged a false accusation.

61
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:07,940
Mrs. Liu

62
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,700
sells the room in Lin Lang Pavilion

63
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,780
out of her own will,

64
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,940
including everything from the rafters, concrete materials, and bricks

65
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:12,940
to the subgrade,

66
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,060
to pay her debt of 200 taels.

67
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,340
How could you sign this?

68
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,460
Why didn't you tell me?

69
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,340
I didn't.

70
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,020
They forced me.

71
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,500
Screw you!

72
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,540
If you can't pay me back,

73
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,340
I'll sell you.

74
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:24,900
Let's go.

75
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,460
Ms. Chun.

76
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Where are you taking her?

77
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,540
You can't take her away.

78
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,300
My lord,

79
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,579
according to the law

80
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,060
that...

81
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,300
Chun Tumi,

82
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,860
You disturbed the court.

83
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,900
Do you think you deserve to be a litigator?

84
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,980
You can never be one.

85
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,300
I can.

86
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,780
I want to.

87
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:01,940
My lady!

88
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,820
My lady, bad news!

89
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,740
We are having trouble.

90
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,180
Master Chun got arrested.

91
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,540
What?

92
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,820
Someone sued him.

93
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,060
Sued him?

94
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,340
For what? Talk to me!

95
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,100
For

96
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,580
attempted rape.

97
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,860
Buddha bless us!

98
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,540
Buddha bless us!

99
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:20,779
Buddha bless us!

100
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,459
Buddha bless us!

101
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,020
Buddha bless us!

102
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:23,650
Buddha bless us!

103
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,700
Buddha bless us!

104
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,660
Buddha bless us!

105
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,460
Tumi.

106
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,140
What are you doing?

107
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,140
Come here.

108
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,060
Kneel and pray.

109
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,100
Ask Buddha

110
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,730
to bless your father.

111
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,100
If you hadn't sent Zhou

112
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,250
to send a message to your parents,

113
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,340
we wouldn't have ended up

114
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,020
with no one

115
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,740
to inquire.

116
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:41,020
Old Master Chun escorted the prisoner

117
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,980
to Lingnan.

118
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:42,770
There is no man

119
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:43,900
we can rely on in this family.

120
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,180
Is there any other way

121
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,620
other than asking Mrs. Chun's parents to help?

122
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,780
Who's suing?

123
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,060
Do they have any witnesses and evidence?

124
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,100
How did my father defend?

125
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,420
Did he suffer from any corporal punishment? What was the sentence?

126
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,540
You don't know anything yet.

127
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,020
How could you still pray here?

128
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,100
Buddha, please forgive us.

129
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:56,980
Please forgive us.

130
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,180
Tumi,

131
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,940
your father really spoiled you.

132
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,780
How dare you offend the Buddha?

133
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,100
So what?

134
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,460
Father has been imprisoned.

135
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,580
Can Buddha protect him

136
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,700
from being punished?

137
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,820
He is military personnel.

138
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,100
If he was dragged back to the military and got beaten up again

139
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,300
after the court closed the case,

140
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,460
what should we do?

141
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,820
What should we do?

142
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,860
Don't cry.

143
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,220
According to the law,

144
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,740
they have to go through three trials

145
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,060
before they close the case.

146
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,420
There will be a day between each trial.

147
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,020
In other words,

148
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,220
we have four days

149
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,340
to figure things out.

150
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,460
That's good.

151
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,420
After my parents send help here,

152
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,540
we'll take some money

153
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:35,659
to the court and pull some strings...

154
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,659
That will be worse.

155
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,780
We are a military family.

156
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,300
Bribery is a bigger crime.

157
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:40,380
My Lady.

158
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,460
-How was it? -My lady.

159
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,740
The first trial closed this afternoon.

160
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,140
There were witnesses and pieces of evidence.

161
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,340
But Master Chun claimed he was wronged.

162
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,690
He's now in jail.

163
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:50,100
This can't be happening!

164
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,050
I have to go to the court.

165
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,300
Guo.

166
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:55,900
This is the new guy

167
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,140
from Linshui Pavilion, Jinyi.

168
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:57,770
Jinyi.

169
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,659
This is our lady, Miss Chun.

170
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,180
Miss Chun.

171
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:00,900
Thank you.

172
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,100
Thank you.

173
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,740
Miss Chun.

174
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,380
Have you been to the government office?

175
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,460
No.

176
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,580
But my grandfather

177
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,780
has been working for the government.

178
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,820
If I go,

179
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,700
Master Ouyang will be willing to meet, won't he?

180
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,140
Jinyi.

181
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,260
What is the information

182
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,860
on your side?

183
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,130
I heard that

184
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,900
the one who sued Master Chun is a widow.

185
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,140
She's very ferocious.

186
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,060
When I was asking around for some information,

187
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,020
I heard Mrs. He

188
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,140
gossipping about that widow's love affairs.

189
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,580
She even asked me for credit.

190
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,220
She said after she heard the news,

191
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,580
it was her who informed Zhou

192
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,860
so that Mrs. Chun could get to know.

193
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:39,900
Wait.

194
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,540
We got the notice not from

195
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,420
the government,

196
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,220
but Mrs. He?

197
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,220
That's not right.

198
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,220
The procedure did not

199
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,300
follow the book.

200
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,420
Maybe that was the style

201
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,580
of the stupid magistrate.

202
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,620
This can't be right.

203
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,140
This is great injustice.

204
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:56,940
Miss Chun,

205
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,980
don't worry.

206
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,220
There are no men

207
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:00,780
at your home currently.

208
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:01,780
Besides,

209
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,380
you are still unmarried.

210
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,060
If a female has to be there,

211
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:06,140
Mrs. Chun

212
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,100
is a better choice.

213
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,380
She'll cry when she's there.

214
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,700
I know some laws.

215
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,020
It's better that I go.

216
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,460
Miss Chun, you...

217
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,060
Enough for the persuasion.

218
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,860
I've made up my mind.

219
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,380
I'm not trying to persuade you.

220
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,740
It's just that you need to pull some strings if you wanna visit the prison.

221
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,580
Do you have enough money?

222
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:26,980
Guo,

223
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,100
did you bring enough money?

224
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,260
It's not enough, is it?

225
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,700
What should we do?

226
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:41,820
Well...

227
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,659
Take this to handle the emergency.

228
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,740
It should be enough.

229
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,300
Thank you.

230
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,540
Thank you.

231
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:59,140
[Bianzhou Prefecture]

232
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,860
Greetings, my lord.

233
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,820
You are here

234
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,220
for Dashan, aren't you?

235
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,980
I'm not here to plead.

236
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,420
My father did nothing wrong.

237
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,940
There's no need to plead if he didn't do anything wrong.

238
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,500
What do you want from me?

239
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,460
I...

240
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,060
I would like to ask you

241
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:16,900
to give me permission to check

242
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,060
the testimonies.

243
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,220
Tumi,

244
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,690
a country has its laws.

245
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,100
and family rules.

246
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,100
Government documents are serious things.

247
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,900
Outsiders can't be granted access to read them.

248
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,100
What are you doing?

249
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:29,940
Get up.

250
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,540
My lord,

251
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,700
you and my grandfather are old acquaintances.

252
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,460
You know my family.

253
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,860
My mother passed away early.

254
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:38,860
My father treated me like a treasure.

255
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,260
Now that he's wronged,

256
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,179
if I still stay at home as if nothing happened,

257
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,620
I would be a disgrace.

258
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,420
Please pity me.

259
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,580
All right.

260
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,210
Get up.

261
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,020
No matter what,

262
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,860
I can't do anything

263
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,180
I'm not allowed to legally.

264
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
But since you're my colleague's granddaughter,

265
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,580
you are junior to me.

266
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,020
You've come all the way up here.

267
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,820
Have some tea before you leave.

268
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,460
I'll go make some tea.

269
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,140
I'll be back in half an hour.

270
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,410
Thank you, my lord.

271
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,660
My lord, you are wise.

272
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,100
Since I took office,

273
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,420
I've been working hard

274
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,380
and reviewing

275
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,900
every case carefully myself.

276
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,140
I never dare to hand it to others,

277
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,980
not to mention make any mistakes.

278
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,860
Lord Kang is here to inspect the prison,

279
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,300
not you.

280
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,820
You're so impatient.

281
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,060
It's strange.

282
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,700
Lord Zhang,

283
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,020
I came to inspect the prison

284
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,140
under the order of His Majesty

285
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,290
to investigate false cases.

286
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,540
So we may need to check

287
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,100
the documents of your county.

288
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,300
Thank you.

289
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,580
This is my duty.

290
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,380
Guards!

291
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:00,900
Yes.

292
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,100
Go ask Master Ouyang

293
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,460
to hand over all the cases' documents during my term

294
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,500
to Lord Kang for his inspection.

295
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,100
Yes.

296
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,100
Miss Chun.

297
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,420
Oh no.

298
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,660
What's wrong?

299
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,620
I forgot my satchel.

300
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,580
I'll go get it.

301
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,780
My lady.

302
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,340
What is it

303
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:23,380
that she forgets

304
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,540
and has to go back to get?

305
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,540
It's her treasure.

306
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,060
What treasure that she has to bring with her?

307
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,860
Is it jewelry or jade?

308
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,860
It's not a vulgar thing.

309
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,820
In that satchel,

310
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,620
there's the law book

311
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,740
her mother gave to her before she passed away.

312
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,140
No wonder she

313
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,460
runs around herself.

314
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,260
She's an expert.

315
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,060
Who are you?

316
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,180
Stop!

317
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,340
Why are you running?

318
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:06,700
Are you guilty of something?

319
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,940
Weren't you there just now?

320
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,940
Why didn't you answer me

321
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,340
since you've heard me?

322
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,380
I...

323
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,060
This is the county office.

324
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,100
You are a girl, why are you

325
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,460
dressed like this?

326
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,620
Since you know I'm a girl,

327
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,700
you should know

328
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,220
it's improper for you to touch me like this.

329
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,220
I'm

330
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,250
very into catching thieves.

331
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,820
Not to mention

332
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,180
a thief like you who has such nice skin.

333
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,260
Come on.

334
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,060
Answer my question first.

335
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:41,260
I have a wronged case to plead.

336
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,060
A wronged case?

337
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,540
How come?

338
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,260
Tell me.

339
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,500
My lady.

340
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,340
Where's your satchel?

341
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,460
Don't mention it.

342
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,340
I almost got caught as a thief.

343
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,380
My lady, are you alright?

344
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,260
What about the book?

345
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,660
Miss Chun,

346
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,940
it's getting late.

347
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:16,180
Shall we go back first?

348
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,020
We'll figure it out another day.

349
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,100
Let's go to my father first.

350
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,340
I'm always worried

351
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,540
if I don't hear from him.

352
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,620
Don't just stand there.

353
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,500
What are you looking at?

354
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,060
Move.

355
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:44,900
This way.

356
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,140
Father.

357
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,700
Tumi.

358
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,620
Tumi.

359
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:53,780
Why are you here?

360
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,860
Did they torture you?

361
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,220
Are you hurt?

362
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,220
Go back now.

363
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,300
This is not a place

364
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,140
for girls.

365
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,780
Go back.

366
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,820
You are behind bars.

367
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,260
Why are you still worried about me?

368
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,900
Where's your mother?

369
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,900
How could she let you

370
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,940
come out alone?

371
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,940
She is praying at home.

372
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,340
She said she asked Zhou

373
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,780
to ask her mother for help.

374
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,220
Father, tell me.

375
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,060
what happened?

376
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,780
I was wronged.

377
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,860
That day, I wanted to get home earlier,

378
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,300
so I took a shortcut.

379
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,500
When I passed the back alley of Piaoxiang House,

380
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,100
a guy almost poured the slop

381
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,100
over me.

382
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,690
I'm sorry.

383
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,340
At that moment, a thief suddenly came out.

384
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:31,740
You...

385
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,460
He stole the hairpin

386
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,620
I prepared for you

387
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,620
as your birthday gift.

388
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,340
I chased him all the way.

389
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,300
I didn't know how long I have chased.

390
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,060
Stop.

391
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,420
I got to Zhang Wuniang's house.

392
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,220
I saw the gate was open,

393
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,460
so I went in.

394
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,300
Did you see

395
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,220
a guy running over?

396
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,980
I think I saw someone

397
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,260
over there.

398
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,900
Are you okay?

399
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,300
After I woke up,

400
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,940
I was here.

401
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:04,220
Father.

402
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,780
Something is fishy.

403
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,180
If we don't deal with it carefully,

404
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,060
I'm afraid you'll suffer.

405
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,780
Master Ouyang asked me

406
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,940
to hire a litigator.

407
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,460
It's Scholar Sun from the west of the county.

408
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,780
He's been writing the pleadings for years.

409
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,180
He also defends people in lawsuits.

410
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,260
He's experienced.

411
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,540
With his help,

412
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,900
we'll be more likely to win.

413
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,060
I have my own plan

414
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,540
for the lawsuit.

415
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,700
You stay out of this.

416
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,340
If your reputation was ruined,

417
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,700
you wouldn't be able to marry someone from a good family.

418
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,380
If I can't clear my father's name,

419
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,380
I'm afraid no one would marry me.

420
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:32,930
Tumi,

421
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,260
I'm sorry.

422
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,340
It's time. You should leave.

423
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,380
Take care.

424
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,660
I will.

425
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:41,620
Okay. Get up.

426
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,620
Get up.

427
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:43,850
Okay.

428
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,580
Go.

429
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,820
Hurry up.

430
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,300
Thank you.

431
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,140
Miss Chun.

432
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,940
My satchel.

433
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,180
Why do you have it?

434
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,820
I used some money

435
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,980
and pulled some strings within the government to find it.

436
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,060
Thank you.

437
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,620
I'll ask Guo to calculate it,

438
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,170
plus some bonus as gratitude and give it back to you later.

439
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,580
You're welcome, Miss Chun.

440
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,220
Madam Fang booked this carriage

441
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:36,100
to help you.

442
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,180
If you need anything,

443
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,690
just let us know.

444
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,860
Thank you.

445
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,260
We'll go back to Linshui Pavilion

446
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:41,860
to inform them.

447
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,180
Madam Fang must be expecting us.

448
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,380
Okay.

449
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,420
Tumi.

450
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,460
Have you seen your father?

451
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,100
How is he?

452
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,180
Did he say anything?

453
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,500
He said he was framed.

454
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,700
He's innocent.

455
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,060
I'm glad he's fine.

456
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,860
But why did your father

457
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,100
go to such a place

458
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,020
like Gancao Street?

459
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,900
He said someone stole his hairpin.

460
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,420
What hairpin?

461
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,060
It was for my birthday.

462
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,220
I knew it.

463
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,940
He's always been reliable.

464
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,020
How could he encounter something like this?

465
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,660
It was because of you.

466
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,060
Xiaoqin.

467
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,100
Let's go back and burn more incense.

468
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,700
Ask Buddha to bless

469
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,540
our family.

470
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,300
Someone

471
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,300
thinks she can play the law

472
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,580
just because she read several books.

473
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:01,100
In the end, she caused all these.

474
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,220
My lady.

475
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:05,819
I'm fine.

476
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,460
My Lady,

477
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,700
don't listen to her nonsense.

478
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,220
I'm not sad because of what she said.

479
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,369
It's because

480
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:22,540
my father is still suffering in prison.

481
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,020
I don't know

482
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,060
if his name can be cleared.

483
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:27,089
All he cares about is me.

484
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,940
Hanging on there.

485
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,580
She's an unreliable person.

486
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,220
Master Chun is counting on you.

487
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,420
I'll prepare some food

488
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,180
for you.

489
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,620
Father, have I grown taller?

490
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,540
Let me see.

491
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,450
Look.

492
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,340
You've grown a lot.

493
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,460
Right?

494
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,540
Right?

495
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,060
Father.

496
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,460
When can I be taller

497
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,620
than you?

498
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,170
I want to be this tall.

499
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,500
So tall?

500
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,740
How about now?

501
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,180
Is this high?

502
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,420
Remember.

503
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,540
You can see further

504
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,380
if you stand higher.

505
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,380
Come on. Let's fly.

506
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,220
Fly!

507
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,580
Fly, fly.

508
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,660
Fly! Fly!

509
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,980
I should thank you.

510
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,380
Excuse me.

511
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:41,980
Wait.

512
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,860
If it weren't for your master...

513
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,140
Scholar Sun's family is really rich.

514
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,660
I heard he charges one tael of silver

515
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,700

One tael of silver?

518

For two pieces of paper?

519
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,860
This is equivalent to Master Chun's

520

a month's salary.

521
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,500
You can write a pleading as long as you can read.

522
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,940
But it will be harder to write it well.

and the facts,

527

a statement needs to meet the requirements of the lawsuit.

At the bottom of the pleading,

529
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,540
the witnesses and pieces of evidence need to be listed.

530
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,300
The person who can write such a pleading

531
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,700

Mr. Sun,

551
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,250

You're straightforward.

Five taels for deposit.

561

Our county government will release notices on a singular date,

The morning court usually handles daily routine businesses.

Although in this case,

572

it's obvious that your father was framed,

He is so domineering even after taking the customer's money.

594

602

00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,180
Besides,

686
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,340
we have Scholar Sun.

687
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,940
Master Chun will be fine.

688
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:30,980
The court starts.

689
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,810
[Clean, cautious, and diligent]

690
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,900
Bring the criminal and the plaintiff.

691
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,740
It's him.

692
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:35,980
Exactly.

693
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,420
How could he do such a thing?

694
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,020
Tell me about it.

695
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,260
Look at him.

696
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,260
How could he be someone like this?

697
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:40,940
Move.

698
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,620
Don't judge a book by its cover.

699
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,460
Kneel!

700
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,380
Where is the plaintiff?

701
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,190
[Clean, cautious, and diligent]

702
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,850
Where is the plaintiff?

703
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,580
My lady, what are you doing?

704
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,340
It's her.

705
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,060
Who?

706
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,900
The one who poured wine on me yesterday.

707
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,620
Tumi.

708
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,380
The court is not for you.

709
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,900
Stop messing around and go back.

710
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,540
How dare you!

711
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,930
[Clean, cautious, and diligent]

712
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,740
In court,

713
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,980
how could such a brat

714
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:20,820
access without permission?

715
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,900
Who are you?

716
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,500
My lord.

717
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:25,940
I'm Chun Tumi, I came to the court today

718
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,020
to seek justice for my father.

719
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,100
Nonsense!

720
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,940
How could they let a girl

721
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,940
appeal in court?

722
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:33,660
Wait and see.

723
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,780
If you interfere

724
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,020
without Zhang Hongtu making decisions first,

725
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,930
what's the point of inspecting?

726
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:46,670
[Clean, cautious, and diligent]

727
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,580
According to the law,

728
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,820
families are allowed to appeal.

729
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,660
But

730
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,300
they can't let

731
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,940
a little girl like you do this.

732
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,420
Ask the man

733
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,700
who's in charge of your family to come here.

734
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,620
My lord,

735
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,380
My grandfather is on a business trip.

736
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,260
He couldn't come here.

737
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,660
My father was framed here in court.

738
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,300
There are no men left in the house.

739
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,700
I know showing up in public

740
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,380
ruins the reputation.

741
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,460
But filial piety is the first priority.

742
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,820
Please grant my wish.

743
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,380
My lord,

744
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,940
it is not against the law.

745
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:15,410
[Clean, cautious, and diligent]

746
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,460
Good.

747
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,340
Considering your filial piety,

748
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,020
granted.

749
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,620
Get up.

750
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,780
Thank you, my lord.

751
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,660
This girl is smart.

752
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,940
She knows that the country worships Confucianism.

753
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,380
Loyalty and filial piety are the most important.

754
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:26,370
[Be strictly just and impartial]

755
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,220
She was asking him by the name of Confucianism,

756
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,940
Zhang Hongtu can't say no to her.

757
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,660
[Clean, cautious, and diligent]

758
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,660
Plaintiff Zhang Wuniang,

759
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,900
tell me the details about that day.

760
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,460
There must be no falsehood.

761
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,500
Yes.

762
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,660
Around 9 o'clock on the 18th of this month,

763
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,780
after I collected the rent,

764
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:40,940
I was on my way and hurried back home.

765
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,140
I didn't expect

766
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,980
I met this villain.

767
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,740
Somehow,

768
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,220
he harassed me.

769
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,220
I was weak and timid.

770
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,980
I tried my best to escape and ran back home.

771
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,020
But he

772
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,180
followed me,

773
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,540
entered my yard,

774
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,390
and tried to rape me.

775
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,500
Help!

776
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,900
What happened next?

777
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,140
I tried my best to escape

778
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,260
and screamed desperately.

779
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,300
But he was very strong.

780
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,980
I couldn't get rid of him.

781
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,580
Luckily, my neighbor Li Er heard me

782
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,940
and rushed into my yard.

783
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:13,660
Help!

784
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,580
He defeated the villain, sent him to the government,

785
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,780
and saved me.

786
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,540
We don't know each other.

787
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,660
Why are you talking nonsense?

788
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,300
I went into your yard

789
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,500
to chase the thief.

790
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,740
But when I entered the yard,

791
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,660
the thief was gone.

792
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,780
Then you came out

793
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,220
and fell on me.

794
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:30,100
After that,

795
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,180
I suddenly had a pain in my head

796
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,340
and fainted.

797
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,380
When I woke up,

798
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,420
I was chained

799
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,380
and sent to the government.

800
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:35,900
My lord.

801
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,620
I'm innocent.

802
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,460
My lord,

803
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,220
please help me.

804
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:39,820
My lord,

805
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,940
you have to help me...

806
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,090
[Clean, cautious, and diligent]

807
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,700
Quiet!

808
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,460
Miss Chun,

809
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,060
since you want to seek justice for your father,

810
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,500
do you have anything to say?

811
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,380
Litigator,

812
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,540
do you have a statement of pleading?

813
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,210
My lord,

814
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,580
this is it.

815
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,820
How could a lieutenant

816
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,700
raise such a daughter?

817
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,020
He might be a talent.

818
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,700
The talent you mentioned is now the prime culprit.

819
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,500
My lord.

820
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,180
Those are my doubts concerning this case.

821
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,500
I have some questions

822
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,490
to ask the witness, Li Er.

823
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,740
May I have your permission?

824
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:26,860
Go ahead.

825
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,420
But let me remind you.

826
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,420
If you say anything proofless or if you're being unreasonable,

827
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,020
I can sentence you the contempt of court.

828
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,500
According to the law,

829
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,580
it's the master's fault if the woman in his family breaks the law.

830
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,980
That means your father will be punished

831
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,580
for any crimes you committed.

832
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:45,940
Do you acknowledge that?

833
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,980
If you want to quit now,

834
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,100
considering your filial piety,

835
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,380
I can show you my mercy.

836
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,500
Thank you for your concern.

837
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,900
But I believe

838
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,860
my father is innocent.

839
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,100
The truth will come out sooner or later.

840
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,420
There will always be flaws.

841
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,300
I believe you have a sharp eye.

842
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,380
You will give

843
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,180
my father justice.

844
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,670
[Clean, cautious, and diligent]

845
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,620
Okay.

846
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,780
Bring the witness Li Er to the court.

847
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,140
My lord, Li Er is here.

848
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,820
Greetings, my lord.

849
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,910
[Clean, cautious, and diligent]

850
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,660
Miss Chun,

851
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,820
what do you want to ask?

852
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:27,780
Li Er,

853
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,620
how do you make a living?

854
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,140
My ancestors

855
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,260
are from a prestigious family.

856
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,100
Not really a rich family.

857
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,780
But we still have some businesses from our ancestors.

858
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,260
How much are some?

859
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,220
Just some.

860
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,740
Miss Chun,

861
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,020
what does this have to do

862
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,900
with your father raping Zhang Wuniang?

863
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,460
Miss Chun,

864
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,900
ask some questions

865
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,980
related to this case.

866
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,180
My lord,

867
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,140
this is very suspicious.

868
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,980
As far as I know,

869
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,380
Li Er's family business

870
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,780
has long been ruined by him.

871
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,020
After that, he couldn't feed himself,

872
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,220
so he went around to borrow money.

873
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,020
As for this,

874
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,220
all the neighbors living on Gancao Street

875
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,100
can testify.

876
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,100
There are ups and downs in life.

877
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,060
It's normal.

878
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,340
But no matter whether you're down,

879
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,260
or up,

880
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,700
whenever you encounter injustice,

881
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,740
you should always fight it.

882
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,020
That's what a man should do.

883
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:12,860
I'm poor

884
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,060
so I can't testify?

885
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,340
Being poor is not a problem,

886
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,300
but suddenly becoming rich is abnormal.

887
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,220
Around the 18th of this month,

888
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,300
you suddenly became a glamorous man.

889
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,900
You went to Linshui Pavilion

890
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:22,900
and Piaoxiang House many times.

891
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:23,540
About this,

892
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,260
Liu and Jiu can testify.

893
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,020
They are

894
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,020
right outside the court now.

895
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,300
My lord,

896
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,220
this is their testimony

897
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,300
and this is the portrait of Li Er.

898
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:37,260
Li Er,

899
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,580
you've been generous lately.

900
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,980
My lord, you're wise.

901
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,940
Li Er suddenly made money

902
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:44,940
around the 18th of this month when this case happened.

903
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,060
He must be bribed.

904
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,660
Bribed?

905
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,060
It's just my moment now.

906
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,420
I got lucky, okay?

907
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,780
Which casino did you go to?

908
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:52,580
When?

909
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,900
How much capital did you bet with?

910
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,500
How much did you win?

911
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:55,300
A lot.

912
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:55,970
Two taels of capital.

913
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:56,860
Just a few days ago.

914
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:57,780
As for how much I won,

915
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:58,580
it depended on the card.

916
00:30:58,700 --> 00:30:59,780
Is it the Emperor or Earth 9?

917
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,340
It's confidential.

918
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,300
I can't tell you.

919
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:02,980
You won't understand.

920
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:03,660
Do you have any evidence

921
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,620
that I was bribed?

922
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,620
Although I have no evidence

923
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,620
that you were bribed,

924
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,980
if you can't explain

925
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,140
the source of the money,

926
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,220
I'm afraid our lord will sentence you for the crime of theft.

927
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,260
Even though the government will not investigate unless people report,

928
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,180
no one will report it without a victim.

929
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,540
But the safety of our county is the most important.

930
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,540
As the magistrate of our county

931
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,300
and parent of the people,

932
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,300
he is with impartiality and integrity,

933
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,460
how can he allow bandits to tyrannize the people?

934
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,700
Miss Chun,

935
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,220
I'm not

936
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:26,820
a thief

937
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,900
just because you called me one.

938
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,500
A crime of deception

939
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,140
or perjury,

940
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,180
if you falsely accuse my father,

941
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,540
you'll be flogged at most.

942
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,460
But if you commit the crime of theft,

943
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,340
you will be sentenced

944
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,580
according to the value of your stolen goods.

945
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,260
The worst sentence can be an exile.

946
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,620
Jiu,

947
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,100
how much did he spend

948
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,660
in Linshui Pavilion?

949
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,700
12 taels.

950
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,100
What about in Piaoxiang House?

951
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,010
About seven or eight taels.

952
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,500
What are you doing?

953
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,500
This is a court.

954
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,420
Behave yourselves.

955
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:03,830
[Bright and transparent]

956
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,340
This girl has a strong mind

957
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,060
at such a young age.

958
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,540
She threatened the witness with the law.

959
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:04,980
Every word she says made him shock.

960
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:05,980
Every sentence she utters made him sway.

961
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,580
She didn't even blink.

962
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:10,970
[Bright and transparent]

963
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,900
Looks like I underestimated her.

964
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,500
[Clean, cautious, and diligent]

965
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,260
Li Er,

966
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,460
where did you get the money?

967
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,770
In that case,

968
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,220
I don't have to hide it anymore.

969
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:19,900
My lord,

970
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,460
I did get it

971
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,940
from Zhang Wuniang.

972
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:24,980
My lord.

973
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:25,860
Li Er has confessed.

974
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,100
He framed my father.

975
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:28,460
Miss Chun,

976
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,500
can you be reasonable?

977
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,180
How am I framing your father?

978
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:32,860
She gave me the money,

979
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,860
that was true.

980
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,540
But that was what her husband

981
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,740
owed me many years ago.

982
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,700
I've only found the contract recently.

983
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,060
Zhang Wuniang is an upright person.

984
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,860
So she paid off his debt.

985
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,020
What a coincidence! How come?

986
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,300
Ask her if you don't believe me.

987
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,300
Zhang Wuniang.

988
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,940
Where is the contract?

989
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:49,060
My lord.

990
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,540
Li Er was telling the truth.

991
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,420
I have it with me now.

992
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,260
Present it.

993
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,330
[Contract]

994
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,580
It's real and effective. Confirmed.

995
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:10,500
[Contract]

996
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,740
I guess

997
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,900
the case will be closed soon.

998
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,420
How?

999
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,500
It looks

1000
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,500
a little confusing.

1001
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:17,900
He

1002
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,380
can't listen anymore.

1003
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,100
He'll soon make a random verdict.

1004
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,500
Isn't that how

1005
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,100
he always closes the case?

1006
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,960
[Clean, cautious, and diligent]

1007
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,140
This contract is confirmed

1008
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,130
real and effective.

1009
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,900
Miss Chun,

1010
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,620
Li Er and Zhang Wunian

1011
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,140
have reasonable explanations

1012
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,850
concerning your doubts.

1013
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,940
Do you have anything else you want to ask?

1014
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,540
I do.

1015
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:42,620
Zhang Wuniang.

1016
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,860
At 9 o'clock on the 18th of this month.

1017
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,620
Are you sure about the time?

1018
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,020
Yes, I am.

1019
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,420
Are you sure my father was very strong?

1020
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,860
Yes, I am.

1021
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:54,860
My lord,

1022
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,700
Liu said in his testimony that

1023
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,300
he met my father

1024
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,060
near Piaoxiang House.

1025
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,580
Piaoxiang House and Gancao Street

1026
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,540
are quite far away.

1027
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,260
It's hard for a young man to run there.

1028
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,180
How could my father

1029
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,700
run over there in a quarter

1030
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:06,980
and still have the strength

1031
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,780
to control you?

1032
00:34:08,409 --> 00:34:10,060
I've asked Jinyi

1033
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:10,860
to help verify it for me.

1034
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:11,860
My lord,

1035
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,699
please allow me to introduce Jinyi to the court.

1036
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,100
Summon the witness Jinyi.

1037
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:25,940
My lord,

1038
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,900
Miss Chun said it right.

1039
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,300
I started from the back alley of Piaoxiang House.

1040
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,530
I ran at my best

1041
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,820
to Gancao Street.

1042
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,739
The cart driver was driving the carriage

1043
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:35,860
following me as proof.

1044
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:37,460
I barely made it there to Gancao Street

1045
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,620
in a quarter.

1046
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:39,739
But

1047
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,219
I was so tired

1048
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,820
that I couldn't even breathe.

1049
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:44,739
That's right.

1050
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,580
No matter how lecherous he is,

1051
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,540
by then,

1052
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,139
he must not have any energy left.

1053
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,060
Yes.

1054
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:50,940
I guess even if he wanted to do something,

1055
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,139
he didn't have the strength.

1056
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,060
That makes sense.

1057
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:54,739
My lord,

1058
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,980
that is my doubt.

1059
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,580
Please investigate.

1060
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,580
Zhang Wuniang,

1061
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,380
what do you have to say?

1062
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,620
My lord,

1063
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:03,420
I'm telling the truth.

1064
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,980
His height and weight

1065
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,300
are different from this villain.

1066
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:08,500
He couldn't do it,

1067
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,620
but it doesn't mean the villain couldn't.

1068
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,380
In order to save her father,

1069
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,340
Miss Chun is trying to confuse everyone.

1070
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,940
My lord, please investigate thoroughly.

1071
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:16,740
My lord,

1072
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,100
I'm telling the truth.

1073
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,010
I just want to clear my father's name.

1074
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,060
I have nothing to hide or lie about.

1075
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:20,900
No one can do

1076
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,020
what Zhang Wuniang described.

1077
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,180
She must be lying.

1078
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,300
If you have any doubts, my lord,

1079
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,140
you can pick someone to verify it.

1080
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,310
If it is false,

1081
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,820
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

1082
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:29,860
Fine.

1083
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,020
Each of you sticks to one word.

1084
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,860
I will allow you

1085
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,300
to do another test to verify.

1086
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,100
All the officials in my court

1087
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,420
are strong

1088
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,180
like Chun Dashan.

1089
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,820
You can pick anyone from my court...

1090
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,340
Let me do it.

1091
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,420
Let me do it.

1092
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:46,940
Lord Zhang,

1093
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,820
I think I'm the most appropriate

1094
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,420
to play the criminal.

1095
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,100
Zhang Wuniang.

1096
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,300
Miss Chun.

1097
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,060
Do you have any objections?

1098
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:06,420
My lord,

1099
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,170
I have no objections.

1100
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:09,980
My lord,

1101
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,660
I have no objections.

1102
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,420
Please investigate.

1103
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:16,860
Thank you.

1104
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,140
Prepare a carriage for me.

1105
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:19,900
Yes.

1106
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,980
I'll ask the guards to drive a cart

1107
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,860
and follow you to verify.

1108
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,780
Come back early.

1109
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,380
Don't delay the trial.

1110
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,020
Yes.

1111
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,100
This is interesting.

1112
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,380
It's the first time I've seen this.

1113
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,140
Yes.

1114
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:34,850
This time

1115
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,140
he's trying to verify.

1116
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,020
Interesting.

1117
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:43,570
[Missing Person]

1118
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:38,980
My lady,

1119
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,500
do you want to take a rest?

1120
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,980
Master Chun is innocent.

1121
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,820
The verification result will be fine.

1122
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,220
I just can't let it go.

1123
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,460
I'm a little panicked.

1124
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,180
It's obvious that

1125
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,180
Zhang Wuniang came prepared.

1126
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,780
She overturned much evidence.

1127
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,860
We definitely didn't find

1128
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:52,780
the key point.

1129
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,740
The key point is why

1130
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,900
she'd frame my father.

1131
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:56,980
If we know this,

1132
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,140
it'll be easier to find evidence.

1133
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,260
Well,

1134
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,580
I'll buy you some food.

1135
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,420
You haven't eaten the whole morning.

1136
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,900
Don't starve yourself.

1137
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,380
Jinyi.

1138
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:19,810
Miss Chun.

1139
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,660
I need your help.

1140
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,300
Okay.

1141
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,580
Thank you.

1142
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:34,620
I'll wait for you here.

1143
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:36,940
Let's go.

1144
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,780
All...

1145
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:51,140
Rise...

1146
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,620
My lord,

1147
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,820
this witness and I

1148
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,100
have completed the verification.

1149
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,540
How was it?

1150
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,620
The fact is that...

1151
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,820
he was capable to do everything Zhang Wuniang claimed.

1152
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,580
Look, it's him.

1153
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,220
Some people can't do it,

1154
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,260
but it doesn't mean he couldn't.

1155
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:06,780
Yeah.

1156
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,340
That's right.
