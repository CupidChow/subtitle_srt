[Episode 17]

4
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,220
I've been in the Xu family

5
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,500
for more than 20 years.

6
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:00,460
I know everything I should.

7
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,140
For those I shouldn't,

8
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,980
I can figure them out by asking around.

9
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,180
Besides, I have a lot of evidence.

10
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,060
Don't you dare

11
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:10,500
to slander my family.

12
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:11,700
Dashan,

13
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,620
don't believe

14
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,780
his nonsense.

15
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,500
The handsome actor

16
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:18,180
you arranged in your mansion

17
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,740
never focuses on his opera performance,

18
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,740
but often tries

19
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,780
to entice your daughter.

20
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,260
Your daughter

21
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,540
became debauched

22
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,140
and lived a dissolute life.

23
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,620
As to the father of the child she's carrying,

24
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,540
you think you and your daughter

25
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,620
are the only ones that know who he is?

26
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,500
And you blamed everything

27
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,460
on Chun Dashan.

28
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,420
Dashan,

29
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,220
if you want evidence,

30
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,860
I can provide anytime.

31
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,660
Nonsense!

32
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:46,900
Little girl,

33
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,820
I know

34
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,050
more than you think I do,

35
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,260
some of them you don't even imagine.

36
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,860
For example,

37
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,820
how the Xu family started their business,

38
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,620
and who the biological father

39
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,740
of the daughter is.

40
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,220
Taking other's property,

41
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,180
do you think you'll end up well?

42
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:08,940
You...

43
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,540
The body of your daughter's biological father

44
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,100
might still be somewhere

45
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,900
waiting to be found.

46
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:21,820
You...

47
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,620
Madam,

48
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,020
don't forget

49
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:27,460
I was the one who covered everything for you.

50
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,579
But the truth will come to light sooner or later.

51
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,260
You covered it to solve one problem but it brought you new trouble.

52
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,140
Once I show them

53
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,620
the evidence I had,

54
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,380
I'm afraid your family reputation

55
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,420
which you have built for long

56
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:49,220
will be ruined.

57
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,500
You won't end up well.

58
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,540
You either listen to me,

59
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,220
or we can die together.

60
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,420
There's no third way.

61
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:57,860
In your dreams.

62
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,300
Father,

63
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,700
go to invite Lord Kang.

64
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,660
You and your daughter

65
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,650
won't be able to feed yourselves.

66
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,140
You ignorant and stupid woman.

67
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,100
I don't think

68
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,580
the Chun family

69
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,620
will accept your daughter anymore.

70
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,260
Without the Chun family,

71
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,500
how can your daughter inherit your family property?

72
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:17,820
Fan Jian,

73
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,860
if I'm not mistaken,

74
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:20,820
the moment you married

75
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:21,899
and moved to your wife's family,

76
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,220
you had planned

77
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,500
to take the Xu family's property.

78
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,460
Your marriage was just a business.

79
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,300
Only they thought

80
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,460
the deal for you to be matrilocal

81
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,580
was for them to take care of your family,

82
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,140
while the deal you set for yourself

83
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,340
was to take over their property.

84
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,220
You...

85
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,500
After all these years,

86
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,460
you've only shown your intention now,

87
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,220
you're patient.

88
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:42,900
Well,

89
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,500
how long do you think you should be sentenced in prison

90
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,260
for deceiving and fraud?

91
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,220
Let alone whether you have the evidence,

92
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,420
even if you do,

93
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,420
you need to testify it.

94
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,420
Well,

95
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,740
I have another question for you.

96
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:57,700
Go ahead.

97
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,220
Xiaoqin,

98
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:01,740
what was her role?

99
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,100
Xiaoqin?

100
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,420
You want to know why

101
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,410
I had to marry her as my concubine, don't you?

102
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,500
Because my son's mother, Yuqin,

103
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:14,300
was her biological sister.

104
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:16,820
Do you remember?

105
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,940
Back then,

106
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,460
because she was close to me,

107
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,300
you almost beat her to death

108
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,100
out of some random excuse

109
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,860
and threw her in a mass grave.

110
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,380
Little girl,

111
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,659
beating the servant to death for no reason

112
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,100
violated the law, right?

113
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:39,540
But

114
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,900
this is

115
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,180
just one

116
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,620
of the evil things you had done.

117
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,980
It is enough to sentence you.

118
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:50,220
But you probably never expected

119
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,060
that Yuqin didn't die.

120
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,140
After that,

121
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,740
she gave birth to my son

122
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,780
before she passed away.

123
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,300
Xiaoqin

124
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,460
is my son's biological aunt.

125
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:08,460
I feel much relieved

126
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,260
with her taking care of my son.

127
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,820
As for you,

128
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,700
ever since

129
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,740
you had that bastard daughter,

130
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,660
you couldn't have any kids anymore.

131
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,700
Now,

132
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,860
if you take my son in,

133
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,540
you can thank me

134
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,380
for finding an inheritor for your Xu family.

135
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,780
As long as you listen to me,

136
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,740
you will always be my wife,

137
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,340
I'll provide you with everything you need.

138
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,380
Most importantly,

139
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,780
you'll have a son

140
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,740
to take care of you when you're old.

141
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,620
What do you think?

142
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,540
You should have listened to me earlier.

143
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:00,220
Enough.

144
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,740
As you can see,

145
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,260
it's over.

146
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:05,980
Mr. Mei,

147
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,220
please withdraw the lawsuit.

148
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,820
We can be released tomorrow.

149
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,660
By the way, little girl,

150
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,780
I think your father

151
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,340
will divorce her daughter.

152
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:17,820
From now on,

153
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,020
we have nothing to do with each other.

154
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,100
Madam,

155
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,420
don't you worry.

156
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,140
Once we find out the truth, if we really want a divorce,

157
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,780
it will be just a divorce agreement.

158
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,220
It's our family's rule

159
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,100
not to push people to the limit.

160
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,340
Idiot.

161
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,860
She cheated on your father.

162
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,380
and you're playing the nice girl?

163
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,260
If I wasn't nice,

164
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,900
I wouldn't have been tricked by you.

165
00:07:50,409 --> 00:07:51,220
You dragged me and my father

166
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,140
into this.

167
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,740
Now you want to get away with it?

168
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,659
You wish it was that easy.

169
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,180
I asked you to be my witnesses.

170
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,260
What do you mean dragging you into this?

171
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,490
Be your witnesses?

172
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,420
Did he also ask you to be here

173
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,020
as a witness?

174
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,780
He must have promised you a lot of money.

175
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,180
Otherwise, how can he lure you into this trap?

176
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:12,890
Fan Jian,

177
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,060
you told us

178
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,380
all the dirty work,

179
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,660
what do you want?

180
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,220
To be my witnesses.

181
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,780
You brought us here to witness

182
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,220
just to use us

183
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,580
to threaten Madam Xu.

184
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,820
In this way,

185
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,580
even if you pushed her to the limit,

186
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,380
she could hire someone to kill you,

187
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,330
but she couldn't do anything to us.

188
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,419
You had a good plan.

189
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,580
Unfortunately,

190
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:35,900
you used your money

191
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,500
and redeployed all the guards,

192
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,500
no one else here can testify.

193
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,299
So I didn't hear anything.

194
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,740
Mr. Mei,

195
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,100
what about you?

196
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:50,940
Mr. Mei,

197
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,940
I'll give you

198
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,380
2,000 more taels of silver.

199
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,300
3,000 taels.

200
00:08:58,690 --> 00:08:59,900
You can

201
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,500
take the money now

202
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,180
but it may cost your life.

203
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,300
10,000 taels.

204
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,220
I don't believe

205
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,900
Laishui court

206
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,220
won't take my side.

207
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,300
10,000 taels?

208
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,180
Who is so generous?

209
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,020
Who are you?

210
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,940
Do you think you can scare me

211
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,210
with just anybody?

212
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,460
He's just a captain.

213
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,660
A low-rank official

214
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,930
doesn't deserve to be respected.

215
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:38,860
Okay.

216
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,820
Mr. Mei,

217
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:41,620
please

218
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,540
get the magistrate here

219
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,020
and back me up.

220
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,300
Tell him I want to reconcile with the Xu family.

221
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,580
The Chun family used their official position

222
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,580
to bully me.

223
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,500
Okay.

224
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,420
You don't want to testify for me,

225
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,380
but there are many others

226
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,340
who want to do that.

227
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,460
You wasted my plan.

228
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:07,940
Fan Jian,

229
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,740
you asked for the magistrate,

230
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:10,500
aren't you afraid

231
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,380
I'll expose

232
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,180
everything you did?

233
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,980
About the murder of Xu's biological father,

234
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,420
you were the one who told the truth but didn't save him,

235
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,580
you should be sentenced to be flogged 100 times for this.

236
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,140
You knew it but you didn't report to the government nor help him,

237
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,260
that deserves more punishment.

238
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:24,860
Fine.

239
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,900
If you expose me,

240
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,060
I'll expose the Xu family.

241
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,140
You...

242
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,820
The Xu family killed people

243
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,220
and hurt a maid for no reason,

244
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,140
they deserve more severe punishment, don't they?

245
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,620
The Xu family

246
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,740
will take their responsibilities.

247
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,740
But you know

248
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,100
the law so well.

249
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,060
Knowing the law but breaking the law

250
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,060
is the worst,

251
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,340
more punishment for that.

252
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,740
Our law rules

253
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,660
that no lawsuit unless someone sues.

254
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,260
That guy

255
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,620
had no relatives.

256
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,900
So what are you gonna do?

257
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,750
Who's gonna sue me?

258
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,980
This toy boy?

259
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,660
No one sues you,

260
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:05,100
but it's okay to denounce you.

261
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,540
Ridiculous.

262
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,420
Where will you find a high-rank official

263
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,900
to do that?

264
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,620
Fan Jian.

265
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,620
You are still not behaving yourself

266
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,860
now that you are here?

267
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,260
The Prime Minister of Supreme Court

268
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:18,980
is still here for the patrol with his squad.

269
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,500
Are you trying to get me killed?

270
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,620
My lord.

271
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,250
I'm innocent.

272
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,740
The Chun family has gone too far.

273
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,180
I wanted to reconcile

274
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:29,620
with my wife.

275
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,540
It's our family business.

276
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,660
But Chun Dashan

277
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,420
wants the Xu family's property.

278
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,420
And they found

279
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,100
this toy boy

280
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,420
with a low rank from nowhere

281
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,220
to bully me.

282
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:39,820
My lord,

283
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,980
you must help me here.

284
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,100
Do I look like a toy?

285
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,410
Lord... Lord Kang.

286
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,820
I didn't know you were here.

287
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,900
Sorry for not greeting you.

288
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,020
Plea... Please forgive me, Lord Kang.

289
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,220
It's better that you didn't.

290
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,300
If you did,

291
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,180
I'd miss all these.

292
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,340
Chun Tumi.

293
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:04,980
Yes.

294
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,980
Concerning the case of the corruption of Laishui County Government,

295
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:08,980
this guy was involved

296
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,420
in the murder of Xu's biological father.

297
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,580
Concerning the case of the Xu family hurting the maid,

298
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,780
I order you to investigate it on behalf of the Prison Guard.

299
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,780
In three days, after the officials of Luoyang

300
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,620
come here and take this over,

301
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,100
you will go for the prison patrol with me.

302
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,180
Any objections?

303
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,900
No, my lord.

304
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,460
I will do my best

305
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,380
to prove the good people's innocence

306
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,340
and nail

307
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,340
all the bad guys.

308
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,830
[Laishui County Government]

309
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,050
Tumi,

310
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,940
so this is it?

311
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,180
Leave everything to the law.

312
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,090
The law will give everyone

313
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,460
a fair result.

314
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:45,610
Putting them in prison

315
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,340
did save the trouble to detain them.

316
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,580
Thank you, Lord Kang.

317
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,660
Why thank me?

318
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,740
Captain Chun asked for me urgently.

319
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,660
I thought you

320
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,460
were in trouble.

321
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,380
Unexpectedly,

322
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,170
you made me

323
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,380
witness how corrupted they are here.

324
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,900
Thank you for clarifying everything.

325
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,780
This is the first time

326
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,180
I handle such a complicated case.

327
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,980
I need your help.

328
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,020
Tumi,

329
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,860
I've always been curious.

330
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,620
Who was it

331
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,930
that taught you the law?

332
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,660
Why?

333
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,220
Is there anything wrong?

334
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,100
Of course not.

335
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,100
I just admire that

336
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,740
he made you such a good student.

337
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,580
I still remember

338
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,660
the first time I met you.

339
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,780
You have improved

340
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,900
so much since then.

341
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,940
Well, she is the best in the world.

342
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,180
Ye,

343
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,020
I was thinking about you.

344
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:57,940
And you are here.

345
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,570
I have something

346
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,180
to tell you.

347
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,580
Lord Kang asked me to review

348
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,660
all the cases in Laishui.

349
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,580
This is the first time

350
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,700
I solve cases alone.

351
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,140
It's a big responsibility.

352
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,740
But I am more confident

353
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,020
than before.

354
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:10,940
Congratulations.

355
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,260
Ye.

356
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,140
What's going on?

357
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,300
I wanted to

358
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
celebrate with you.

359
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,980
But I have to go.

360
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,100
Right.

361
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,380
You told me before.

362
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,460
Is there anything I can help with?

363
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:38,820
No.

364
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,420
Are you gonna get hurt?

365
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:41,170
No.

366
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,380
I promise you.

367
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,300
I'll come to visit you

368
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,580
after I finish my things.

369
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,020
Well, Ye,

370
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:49,740
let's meet in Luoyang.

371
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,580
Luo Yang?

372
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,820
We will finish everything here

373
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,100
pretty soon.

374
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,860
The next stop of the patrol is Luoyang.

375
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,860
I heard it's a big city.

376
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,140
I'm not familiar with it.

377
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:58,980
But I know

378
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,290
there is a UNIFON.

379
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,940
It's located on the most bustling street.

380
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,450
When you arrive,

381
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,660
let's meet there.

382
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,220
Okay.

383
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,100
Remember,

384
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,660
no matter where you are,

385
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,410
I will find you.

386
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,190
[Laishui County Government]

387
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,540
My lady.

388
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:30,740
Guo.

389
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:34,260
-Lord Kang. -Lord Kang.

390
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,260
Thank you.

391
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,580
In such a short time,

392
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,820
you managed to review and sort out all the cases here

393
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,620
and hand them over to the officials from Luoyang.

394
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,580
I'm impressed.

395
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,540
It's all thanks to

396
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,740
Lord Kang's reputation

397
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,580
that everything went so well.

398
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,020
From now on,

399
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,860
cultivate your own reputation.

400
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,020
One day

401
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,820
when Lord Han and I are not by your side,

402
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,130
you will also be able to do a good job.

403
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,420
Lord Kang,

404
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,900
you flatter me.

405
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,500
You deserve it.

406
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:00,860
Tumi,

407
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,490
when you were working hard,

408
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,020
I also did something big.

409
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,140
What was it?

410
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,210
I've informed the Minister of War

411
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,300
the Chun family

412
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,220
made great contributions during the patrol.

413
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,300
So your request to be unregistered from the military

414
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,540
has been on the schedule.

415
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:20,980
Thank you, Lord Kang.

416
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,500
You don't have to thank me.

417
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,020
You deserve it.

418
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,220
About this,

419
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,020
we had a deal.

420
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,740
Tumi will help me with the patrol.

421
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,850
Consider this as her tuition fee.

422
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:31,820
I thought

423
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,060
this was so hard that it was almost impossible.

424
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:37,020
Now it's done easily just like that?

425
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,380
How come it's easy?

426
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,020
During the patrol,

427
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,180
one time after another, you stood up

428
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,180
in front of the people

429
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,140
to help the innocent and punish the guilty.

430
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,740
Even if you had to make yourself the enemy

431
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,780
of Luo Li, the regional commissioner of Youzhou,

432
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,130
you never had a blink.

433
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:50,980
None of the cases

434
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,700
was easy.

435
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,220
You all studied the law.

436
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,020
You want to punish the guilty and help the innocent.

437
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,100
As for Mr. Mei and Magistrate Shan,

438
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:00,380
they abused their power of law,

439
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,220
bullied the people, and confused right and wrong.

440
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,260
You punished them

441
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,500
by exposing their crimes.

442
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,500
This alone is a big case you've solved.

443
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,859
You uphold the law.

444
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,619
The law will never let you down.

445
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:15,060
Lord Kang,

446
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,020
our whole family

447
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:19,980
will do our best

448
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,339
to serve the court.

449
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,700
Save the courtesies.

450
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,140
Let's meet

451
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,180
at the post later.

453
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,140

457
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,540
let's go back and pack up.

458
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,380
Prepare to set out.

459
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,220
My lady, let's go.

460
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:45,650
Let's go!

461
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,060

462
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,100
Have you recovered?

463
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,340
Young Master.

464
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,660
Why do you look so bad?

465
00:17:59,380 --> 00:17:59,730
I'm fine.

466
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,820
I'm almost through this.

467
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,900
Lie down and rest more.

468
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,060
I'll leave soon.

469

Young Master.

470
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,460
Are you confident

471
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,100
handling the inkstone's issue?

472

after it's over,

475
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,500
I'll send you away

476
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:17,980
from Mowu Pavilion.

477
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,100
Why?

478
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,740
You don't need me anymore?

479
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,540
No.

480
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,300
It's because

481
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,660
a lot has happened recently.

482
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,380
It made me understand

483
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,460
we have to

484
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,610
live for ourselves.

485
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,620
As your buddy,

486
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,060
I've seen enough

487
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,300
of the world.

488
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,060
It's huge.

489
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,620
Now I want you to see it.

490
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,580
What's your plan

491
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,260
after finding the inkstone?

492
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,100
Take Li with me and leave.

493
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,180
What?

494
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:03,980
Young Master.

495
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,780
Now that we are here,

496
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,900
I can't hide it from you anymore.

497
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,340
Ayili was taken by Han Wuwei.

498
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,540
I'm not cold.

499
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,660
I don't care if you're cold.

500
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,980
I worry you'll become my burden if you're sick.

501
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,740
Be careful.

502
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,260
Be careful.

503
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,500
Han Wuwei.

504
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,460
Oh no.

505
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,420
The arrow was poisoned.

506
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:29,700
Han Wuwei.

507
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:34,700
My lord, go.

508
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,500
Take him and leave.

509
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:37,940
Hurry!

510
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,140
Your hand is sweating.

511
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,380
Stop.

512
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,620
Han Wuwei.

513
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,740
You need to rest.

514
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,700
No.

515
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,980
It's getting late.

516
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,260
We need to enter the city now.

517
00:20:59,580 --> 00:20:59,980
Let's go.

518
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:02,940
Han Wuwei.

519
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,380
What's wrong?

520
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,420
Are you okay?

521
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:07,700
Han Wuwei.

522
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:45,700
Be careful.

523
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,260
Mother.

524
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,180
Mother!

525
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:21,580
Mother!

526
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,260
Mother, don't go.

527
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,180
Mother.

528
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,260
You let me

529
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,260
take advantage of you.

530
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,580
Don't complain after you wake up.

531
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,020
Don't worry.

532
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:00,700
I won't leave.

533
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,900
I'll always be with you.

534
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,300
Lord Han.

535
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,740
Has His Highness not been back yet?

536
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:30,700
No.

537
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:32,380
Weren't you protecting him?

538
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,060
What happened?

539
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,340
We were  assassinated on the way.

540
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,380
We let him leave first.

541
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,020
We agreed to meet at the mansion.

542
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:37,900
Lord Han Feng

543
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,580
died protecting His Highness.

544
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,620
Now we don't know where he is.

545
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,860
Then go find him.

546
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,700
His Highness has someone important with him.

547
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,820
It will be dangerous

548
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,980
if we make a big fuss out of this.

549
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,500
Gather the secret guards,

550
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:49,980
disguise as civilians,

551
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,260
and look for His Highness both inside and outside the city.

552
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:52,980
Yes.

553
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,660
Please enjoy.

554
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,260
Thank you.

555
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,260
I'm assigned

556
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,890
to work at the Desmao Zhechong Prefecture.

557
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,460
The barracks

558
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,980
is right outside Luoyang City.

559
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:13,980
So I'll stop here,

560
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,700
I won't enter the city with you.

561
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:16,940
Dashan,

562
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,860
you're newly assigned.

563
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,980
You must do your best

564
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,660
to live up to

565
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,340
Lord Kang's kindness to our family.

566
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,490
I will, Father.

567
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:26,780
Now,

568
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,060
I'm no longer registered in the military.

569
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,460
I'm an officer of the military rank.

570
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,340
[Liquor]

571
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,260
This is different from before.

572
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,180
I used to train only two days every ten.

573
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,020
From now on,

574
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,420
I'll have to stay in the military government for full-time work.

575
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,660
Besides,

576
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,250
Bianzhou and Luoyang are far apart.

577
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,140
I'm afraid

578
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,660
I can only go back to see you

579
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,420
during the holiday or when I take a leave.

580
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,520
[Liquor]

581
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,380
That's fine.

582
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,300
You can't come to Bianzhou.

583
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,500
But we can go to Luoyang

584
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,020
to see you.

585
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,420
We can do better than that.

586
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,420
I have an idea.

587
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,180
You smart ass.

588
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,620
What ideas do you have?

589
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,660
Didn't Father get transferred

590
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,700
to Luoyang?

591
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:03,940
I don't think

592
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,980
he'll be transferred again in the future.

593
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,340
It kinda troubles us

594
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,180
to travel back and forth between Bianzhou and Luoyang.

595
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,020
We can't see each other often in a year.

596
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,290
How about

597
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,540
we all move to Luoyang?

598
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,380
Tumi, don't forget

599
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,900
your grandfather

600
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,820
has work in Bianzhou.

601
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,060
It doesn't matter.

602
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,860
I'm old.

603
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,260
I can quit.

604
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,300
But

605
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,660
compared with Bianzhou,

606
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,780
life cost

607
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,780
in Luoyang

608
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,340
is very expensive.

609
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,060
I'm afraid we can't afford

610
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,540
the mansion there.

611
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,100
Grandfather,

612
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,020
don't we have a mansion

613
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,100
in Bianzhou?

614
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,300
If we move to Luoyang,

615
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,580
we can sell it.

616
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,580
Well...

617
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,860
[Liquor]

618
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:50,860
Father,

619
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,060
what do you think?

620
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,940
I have no objection.

621
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:58,660
[Wine]

622
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,340
It's settled then.

623
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,180
When we arrive in Luoyang,

624
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,140
I'll go choose a mansion with Guo.

625
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:57,820
I'll definitely choose one

626
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,740
that makes us all happy.

627
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:00,860
It's your job now.

628
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,060
Okay.

629
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,820
[Liquor]

630
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:18,820
How are you feeling?

631
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,660
Any better?

632
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,100
I'm fine.

633
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,860
Just a minor injury.

634
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,700
A minor injury?

635
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:36,620
Do you know

636
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:37,860
how much you bled yesterday?

637
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,380
I'm not that delicate.

638
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,660
Who helped me get changed?

639
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,580
I did.

640
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,860
It was urgent. Saving you comes first.

641
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,100
Don't worry.

642
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,300
I won't

643
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,140
tell anyone

644
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,740
that your body doesn't look good.

645
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:56,540
Anyway,

646
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:58,060
you did something even more embarrassing.

647
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,180
I don't have a good body?

648
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:00,970
How could you...

649
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,140
Calm down.

650
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,980
What did I do?

651
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,180
It was nothing.

652
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,050
You just kept calling me mother

653
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,780
and wouldn't let me leave you.

654
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,020
Nonsense!

655
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,380
Impossible.

656
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,900
Why not?

657
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,820
Did I misread you?

658
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,340
You're blushing.

659
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,140
Young Master, you're awake.

660
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,500
Yeah, he is.

661
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:43,380
That's good.

662
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,100
Have some porridge now.

663
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,060
Take your medicine after you finish it.

664
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,740
Thank you, Madam.

665
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,300
Where am I?

666
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,020
This is Luohebei.

667
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,420
Sorry for the trouble.

668
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,780
You're welcome, Young Master.

669
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,220
You were in trouble,

670
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,340
I had to help you.

671
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,700
The medicine you asked for,

672
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,860
I've got it.

673
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:08,820
Great.

674
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,860
Let's go grind the medicine.

675
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:10,580
Let's go.

676
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:21,820
Lord...

677
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,620
Wuwei.

678
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,420
I was joking

679
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,700
about you doing something embarrassing.

680
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,420
I know

681
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,060
you miss your mother.

682
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:31,820
I understand.

683
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:34,890
Although I've never seen

684
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:35,730
mine,

685
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,100
I miss her too.

686
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,700
What are you doing?

687
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,580
You can't move now.

688
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,940
We can't stay here for long.

689
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:55,940
We're leaving.

690
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:56,780
Why?

691
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,180
Don't you know

692
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,420
the guys yesterday?

693
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,220
Besides Yaksha,

694
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,980
the White Ghost is the most skilled assassin

695
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,100
in Mowu Pavilion.

696
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,700
I'm afraid he may be after us.

697
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,500
It concerns our lives.

698
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,100
I'll have to send you somewhere as soon as possible.

699
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:20,940
Where?

700
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:35,780
My lady, look.

701
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,180
There are so many people here.

702
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,820
It's busier than Youzhou.

703
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,140
I thought Youzhou

704
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,220
is already a prosperous place.

705
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,340
I didn't expect Luoyang to be better.

706
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,740
After we settle down,

707
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,740
I'll accompany you to walk around.

708
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,860
We came here

709
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,540
to check the mansion. That's the most important.

710
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,140
We'll live here

711
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:53,820
in the future.

712
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,620
We'll have plenty of time.

713
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,580
Guo.

714
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,700
Help me

715
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,060
find the location of UNIFON.

716
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,180
We'll go and hang out there.

717
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,140
Why?

718
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:02,420
You wanna buy some skincare products?

719
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,300
We brought a lot with us

720
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,380
and there're many left.

721
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,700
I just need to go.

722
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,100
I mean,

723
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,100
UNIFON

724
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,300
provides skincare products to the royal families.

725
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,420
Since we're here,

726
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,420
why not go take a look?

727
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,100
Okay.

728
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,690
Han Wuwei.

729
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:19,530
Bastard.

730
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,540
Is this how you treat the one

731
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,380
who saved your life?

732
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,180
I shouldn't have saved you.

733
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:24,860
Han Wuwei.

734
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,140
Bastard!

735
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,820
It's been two days.

736
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,500
Why are you still so angry?

737
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,180
How dare you say that?

738
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,580
You knocked me out

739
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,260
and brought me here.

740
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:48,620
There's no other person here.

741
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,140
Am I not one?

742
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,100
You...

743
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,460
You just came to deliver food

744
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,250
and then disappeared.

745
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,460
I'm doing this

746
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,500
for your safety.

747
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,660
If I stay here

748
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,540
for too long,

749
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,940
it will cause suspicion.

750
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,100
So I should thank you

751
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,330
for bringing me food.

752
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,500
Alright, don't be angry.

753
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,460
Rub your neck with this medicine.

754
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,540
You'll feel better soon.

755
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,170
These are all your favorite dishes.

756
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:38,860
How do you know

757
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,940
what I like?

758
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,940
I've been with you for a long time.

759
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,500
I can tell

760
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,860
what food you like.

761
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,180
I'm surprised that you remembered.

762
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:52,820
Have more.

763
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,220
We'll get down to business after you finish.

764
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,700
We can talk now.

765
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,300
Okay.

766
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,900
You must answer me honestly

767
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,530
whatever I ask you.

768
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,820
I don't care

769
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,980
what's between you and Mowu Pavilion.

770
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,220
But Hanfeng had been with me since childhood.

771
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,980
I must avenge him.

772
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:21,850
[Feng's Mansion]

773
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,140
This is a nice mansion.

774
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,290
My lady, you have good taste.

775
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,940
But the price...

776
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:22,740
Miss Chun.

777
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:23,900
Since Lord Kang

778
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,460
asked me to pick a mansion for you,

779
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,580
I won't cheat you

780
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:28,060
nor would I rip you off.

781
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,500
You're from Bianzhou,

782
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,540
you probably don't know

783
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,580
the market here.

784
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,460
250 taels

785
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:35,100
is already very cheap for this area.

786
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,860
Ask around,

787
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,180
if I'm not telling the truth,

788
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,340
you  can rip out my eyes

789
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,180
and step on them.

790
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,620
I trust you.

791
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,700
But buying the mansion is a big deal.

792
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,130
Can you wait a few more days

793
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,460
when my grandfather comes back from Bianzhou,

794
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,420
I'll discuss it with him.

795
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,700
This family is in a hurry to sell it.

796
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,050
[Feng's Mansion]

797
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,020
I think

798
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,980
it has just been renovated.

799
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,660
It's also taken good care of.

800
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,260
This family must like it.

801
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,740
They must have had no choice selling it.

802
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,500
The landlord is a scholar.

803
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,220
His wife

804
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,700
is a daughter of a former noble family.

805
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,100
Their son works in another city

806
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:04,740
for the government,

807
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:05,820
they are going to live with their son.

808
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,740
Or else, they won't want to sell it.

809
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:08,980
How about this?

810
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,140
Help me to negotiate.

811
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,660
Tell them that my family is also a scholar family.

812
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,820
Grandfather takes care of things very carefully.

813
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,940
He's a kind man.

814
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,300
If we live here,

815
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,860
we will surely take good care of the house.

816
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:17,700
It's better than selling it

817
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,740
to those who don't cherish it.

818
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:19,740
If you tell the landlord that,

819
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,020
he might agree.

820
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,860
You're so smart.

821
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,860
I think it will work.

822
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,740
I'll talk to the landlord then.

823
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:28,860
But I hope

824
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,340
you can speed up.

825
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,300
The landlord is waiting to meet his son.

826
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,100
Okay.

827
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,700
-My lord. -My lord.

828
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:39,580
Did you find anything?

829
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,500
Yes.

830
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,780
Han Wuwei has returned to the mansion.

831
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,020
But he was alone.

832
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:45,940
He would never

833
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,980
abandon Miss Ayili.

834
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,420
Keep a close watch on Han's Mansion.

835
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,460
Don't miss one person, nor even one horse.

836
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,020
If you miss anything,

837
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,260
kill yourself before you come to meet me.

838
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:53,980
Yes.

[Peaceful and Elegant]

840
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:17,699
Why are you so late?

841
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,380
I have to be cautious

842
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,699
not to be seen.

843
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,060
What to talk about tonight?

844
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,219
How about telling me

845
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:26,580
some important figures in Mowu Pavilion?

846
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:27,780
No.

847
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:29,620
Before I answer your questions,

848
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,340
I have something more important to do.

849
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,179
What's more important

850
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,820
than dealing with Mowu Pavilion?

851
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,210
Treating you.

852
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:37,620
Treating me?

853
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:39,210
I have a physician in my mansion.

854
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,540
Don't you worry.

855
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,659
An ordinary physician

856
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:43,780
is no better than me.

00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:44,739
Listen.

858
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,219
You were seriously injured this time.

00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,570
on your three

862
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:51,409
acupuncture points.

863
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,380
But the effect is limited.

864
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:54,820
Even if you can endure it,

865
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:55,820
I bet you must be

866
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:56,940
in great pain now.

867
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,020
A bit.

868
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:01,700
But it's not

869
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,100
as serious as you said.

870
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,100
You're stubborn as a mule.

871
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:13,860
Forget it.

872
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:15,860
What are you doing?

873
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,220
What's wrong with you?

874
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,820
So we'll just leave it because it hurts?

875
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,860
Could it be

876
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,260
that you're shy?

877
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,540
Ridiculous.

878
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,220
I am a famous playboy

879
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,660
in Xi'an and Luoyang.

880
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:36,500
Do you think

881
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,620
I'd be shy in front of you?

882
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,540
So Lord Han

883
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,500
is famous for being a playboy.

884
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,620
Nonsense!

885
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,620
You're shameless!

886
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:54,900
You weren't like this before.

887
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,380
I think you've learned something bad.

888
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,940
Alright, I'll stop teasing you.

889
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,460
Sit down.

890
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,620
This time, you made a big fuss

891
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,340
about capturing the assassins.

892
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,060
You bought us

893
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,180
some more time,

894
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,180
but as you can see

895
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,500
that instead of just waiting,

896
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,860
we'd better take the initiative.

897
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,220
There's no news from Mowu Pavilion.

898
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,300
You can't

899
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:23,340
trap me here forever.

900
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,340
So,

901
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,380
even if I tell you

902
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,460
everything about Mowu Pavilion,

903
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,580
there's nothing more you can do.

904
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,260
It takes some time

905
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,140
to lure them out.

906
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,820
I only know thieves would wait and watch before they take action,

907
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,940
I don't know the one who was stolen would wait to catch the thieves.

908
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,300
I have an idea

909
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,980
to lure them out.

910
00:36:43,610 --> 00:36:44,180
What is it?

911
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,860
You spread the news

912
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,540
that you're in love

913
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,700
with a girl

914
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,660
from a mysterious organization.

915
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,060
You want to take her back to Chang'an

916
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,100
and marry her.

917
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,060
What?

918
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,500
I know a lot of secrets

919
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:55,370
of Mowu Pavilion.

920
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,900
If they heard of this,

921
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:57,900
they wouldn't take the risk

922
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,660
letting you marry me.

923
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,980
They will definitely come and stop you.

924
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:01,980
No.

925
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:03,780
I'll lose more

926
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,300
if you did this, okay?

927
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,740
If you hadn't alerted the enemy,

928
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,980
I wouldn't have done this.

929
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,340
Whatever.

930
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:10,620
Don't even

931
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:11,780
think about it.

932
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:42,780
My Lady.

933
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,860
It's midnight. Why are you still up?

934
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,380
Guo,

935
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,620
did you hear

936
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:48,740
someone blowing the leaves?

937
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,620
Yeah,

938
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,980
you did.

939
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,420
Maybe I heard it wrong.

940
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,180
My lady,

941
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:03,780
don't work too much.

942
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:05,300
Rest early.
