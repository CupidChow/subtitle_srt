[Episode 7]

4
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:08,699
Grandfather.

5
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,260
I thought

6
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,140
you would come to me tomorrow.

7
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:13,980
Have a seat.

8
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,900
Your father didn't allow you

9
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,820
to get involved with Lord Han

10
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,420
for your good.

11
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,780
I know.

12
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,140
But now the two lords appreciate me

13
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,380
and asked me to go on patrol with them.

14
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,380
The present they gave me

15
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,260
is to help our family get rid of the military registration.

16
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,900
Isn't it always

17
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,060
your wish？

18
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,380
If getting rid of the military registration

19
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,100
made you suffer,

20
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,980
I would rather

21
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,380
give up this wish.

22
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,260
But checking around prisons and investigating cases

23
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,060
are both what I want to do.

24
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,220
Grandfather, think about it.

25
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,540
We are a family of soldiers.

26
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,780
Fathers and sons will both become soldiers.

27
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,500
Father is young now.

28
00:02:49,579 --> 00:02:50,820
I'm his only daughter.

29
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,420
If I have a younger brother in the future,

30
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,220
can you bear to see him

31
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,460
be destined to join the army?

32
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,890
He can't take the civil examination，

33
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,620
or do

34
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,940
what he likes.

35
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,540
Your father and I

36
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,100
will find a way to solve the registration problem.

37
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,450
But you're a girl.

38
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,860
It's inappropriate for you

39
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,980
to follow them and check around the prisons.

40
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,580
I've never heard of it.

41
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,380
I know if I do so,

42
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,300
people will say that I am not gentle and refined.

43
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,460
They will say that I go out as a girl and no one wants to marry me.

44
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,700
But if I do a good job,

45
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,780
won't it change

46
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,210
people's previous stereotypes

47
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,820
about women?

48
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,980
Don't use the method

49
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,579
with which you deal with criminals in court

50
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,780
to deal with me.

51
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,420
I only know that it's unreasonable.

52
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,060
Intolerable!

53
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,620
Grandfather,

54
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,300
Father and you are afraid that others will judge me.

55
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,940
Then dote on me, protect me,

56
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,420
and make it up to me.

57
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,620
Naughty girl.

58
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,579
Please help me persuade my father.

59
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:40,660
Child,

60
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,140
do you know

61
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,060
what is your father's biggest problem?

62
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,300
He's afraid of letting down your mother.

63
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,420
No one can succeed on the path

64
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:50,180
you chose.

65
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,020
Your father is afraid that

66
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,300
he won't be able to protect you in the end.

67
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,450
But since no one

68
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:59,660
can succeed on the path,

69
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,060
if you don't let me try,

70
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:01,700
how can you know that

71
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,060
I can't do it either?

72
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,660
If Mother were here,

73
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,980
she would support me.

74
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,060
Mother used to study law.

75
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:10,620
What's Father's attitude then?

76
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,900
Does he know that Mother also wanted to become a litigator

77
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,860
but failed and felt sorry for herself?

78
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,620
Wait a minute.

79
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,580
Since you studied law,

80
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,380
your father has been unwilling to throw away

81
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,659
any piece of paper you wrote.

82
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,500
When he didn't have more space to keep them,

83
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,060
he left them with me.

84
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,300
I thought that

85
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,060
Guo burned it.

86
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:46,980
Look.

87
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,260
This was the first time

88
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,900
you tried to write an indictment

89
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,820
when you were twelve.

90
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:55,380
Look.

91
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,780
This one

92
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,340
was full of articles of law you wrote from memory

93
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,900
unhappily all night

94
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,860
when your father scolded you

95
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,820
that you didn't focus on poetry.

96
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,300
Your father

97
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,620
often doesn't sleep at night.

98
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,300
He keeps worrying when

99
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,820
looking at these indictments.

100
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,860
He doesn't want to restrict you

101
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,540
from doing what you like.

102
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,900
But this thing

103
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,500
is like a knife

104
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,060
hanging above his head.

105
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,980
Child,

106
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,220
when fighting against the evil

107
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,300
conflicts with your safety,

108
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,860
what will you choose?

109
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,140
How will your father and I

110
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,980
face it?

111
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,980
Go to your father when you have an answer.

112
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,900
Dashan, I said it for you.

113
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,300
But in my heart,

114
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:08,700
I don't agree with you.

115
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,420
I know what you're worried about.

116
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,780
But she has talent and inheritance.

117
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,860
She can't hide it.

118
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,780
If she can't,

119
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,380
I can't protect her.

120
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,540
Father,

121
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,500
I have promised

122
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,980
Tumi's mother that

123
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,820
I won't let Tumi

124
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,860
repeat the same mistake as her mother.

125
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,140
If you don't let her repeat,

126
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,540
she will be unhappy

127
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:38,420
and be depressed for the rest of her life.

128
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,140
Children

129
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,659
should walk on their own.

130
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,820
Who can

131
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,580
stay with them forever?

132
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,340
Back then, I wasn't optimistic about

133
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,460
your marriage.

134
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,100
But now,

135
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,980
have you ever regretted it?

136
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,700
Of course not.

137
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,460
It is the happiest thing in my life

138
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,820
that I could marry Tumi's mother

139
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,380
and

140
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,770
give birth to Tumi.

141
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,940
I don't think

142
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,260
Tumi's mother would regret it either.

143
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:24,940
You're awake.

144
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,380
Grand Secretary.

145
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,340
Don't get up.

146
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,340
You just took the medicine.

147
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,980
You're still weak.

148
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,780
Where is this place?

149
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,659
We are still in Bianzhou.

150
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,220
You were in a coma because of poison yesterday.

151
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,940
Fortunately, Jinyi sent a message back.

152
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:45,220
I arrived in time so that I could save you.

153
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,220
Come on.

154
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
But not long ago,

155
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,409
when Left Envoy came,

156
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,060
I had taken some medicine.

157
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,820
In the past, taking medicine once can be effective

158
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,290
for months.

159
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,490
Why did it attack me in advance?

160
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,820
You have taken the medicine for too long.

161
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,340
It's getting worse every year.

162
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,900
Since it happened this time,

163
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,540
you need to take medicine

164
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,980
more frequently.

165
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,820
I'm useless.

166
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,900
It's not that you're useless.

167
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,980
You've always been eager to excel.

168
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,060
Think about it.

169
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,780
How long has it been since you went back to the Pavilion?

170
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,290
I was just busy with

171
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,500
my work.

172
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,020
The work outside is important.

173
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,860
I don't blame you

174
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,940
if you don't come back.

175
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,059
But the pain of the poison

176
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,299
is like a thousand ants piercing your heart.

177
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,380
How can you treat it

178
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,299
perfunctorily?

179
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:44,780
Except for me,

180
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,220
what about Ayili?

181
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,700
Aren't you afraid that she'll worry about you?

182
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,820
How is Li?

183
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,220
Except for missing you every day,

184
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,300
she is fine.

185
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,500
That's good.

186
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,380
Young Master.

187
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,020
I'm taking advantage of my seniority,

188
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,700
I still have to advise you.

189
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,340
A tired bird needs to return to its nest.

190
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,420
If you can

191
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,620
get the inkstone done this time in Youzhou,

192
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,420
go back to the Pavilion early.

193
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,650
Go back to the Pavilion?

194
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,420
It's not easy.

195
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,530
In Juzi's heart,

196
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,700
I'm an unworthy descendant

197
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,220
What's the difference between me and a dead person?

198
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,260
Mowu Pavilion...

199
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,500
I'm afraid I can't go back.

200
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,940
Young Master.

201
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,340
My lady, are you going out?

202
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:07,300
Be quiet. Don't let dad hear you.

203
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:08,900
My Lady,

204
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,700
Master was so angry

205
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,140
because of the patrol yesterday.

206
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,980
If there's nothing important today,

207
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,140
don't go out.

208
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,340
Or you'll be blamed again.

209
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,460
I'm going to see Lord Kang.

210
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,700
I must go.

211
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,700
Are you still going

212
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,330
to check around prisons?

213
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,340
Guo,

214
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,660
we are women.

215
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,420
We were born

216
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,940
to be imprisoned in the inner mansion.

217
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,540
Every year,

218
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,220
we have to face this small world in the house.

219
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,180
Checking around prisons with Lord Kang

220
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,060
and seeing how big the outside world

221
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,900
may be the only chance

222
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,300
in my life.

223
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,700
So I won't

224
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,580
give up easily.

225
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,330
Grand Secretary.

226
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,900
Don't see me off. He's asleep.

227
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,900
I heard that you and Young Master

228
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:55,860
helped the girl

229
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,500
called Chun Tumi a lot.

230
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,420
The world is dangerous.

231
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,380
As the young master,

232
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,300
it's better to save trouble.

233
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,420
When he gets better,

234
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,500
I will suggest him too.

235
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,700
Yes.

236
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,180
I've been looking for Lord Kang for a day,

237
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,340
but I haven't seen him.

238
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,940
I can only wait until tomorrow.

239
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,140
Little girl,

240
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,620
where have you been so late?

241
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,060
Lord Han?

242
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,300
I'm not blaming you,

243
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,980
but why do you always go out?

244
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,260
It's none of your business.

245
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,100
Lord Han!

246
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,660
Since you have agreed to go on patrol,

247
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,020
and mentioned the present,

248
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,140
you are

249
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,460
a subordinate of Kang Zhengyuan.

250
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,940
How dare you talk back to your superior?

251
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,100
Why did you bring me here?

252
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,420
Put me down.

253
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,140
Are you afraid?

254
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:21,780
I...

255
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,060
Are you here to drink?

256
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,220
This is good wine.

257
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,900
The Three Drunk Flowers in Bianzhou

258
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,140
is fruitier

259
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,740
than ordinary wine.

260
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,900
Since you're back so late,

261
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,180
it doesn't matter if you stay longer.

262
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,900
You're forcing me.

263
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,420
Yes.

264
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,340
I just like to force you.

265
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,740
You can't go down anyway.

266
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,460
Let's just take it as it comes.

267
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,740
Last time I helped you.

268
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:00,660
When I went back,

269
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,900
I told Zheng everything

270
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,820
according to what you said.

271
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,740
Zheng taught me a lesson too.

272
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,620
You dragged me here

273
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,620
to make amends?

274
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,820
If I say

275
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:11,740
I just came here

276
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,140
to tease you. Do you believe it?

277
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,820
I'm very grateful to you and Lord Kang.

278
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,700
Because you gave me an opportunity

279
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,820
to go on patrol.

280
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:22,980
But can't you be like

281
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,180
Lord Kang?

282
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,380
Get down to business.

283
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,220
After that,

284
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,060
do things you should do.

285
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:27,700
Because he doesn't

286
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,940
want to see you as much as I do.

287
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,940
I think it is because

288
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,060
Lord Kang has no time for you.

289
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,420
So you came out.

290
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,220
Yes.

291
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,700
He wants to write to his mother.

292
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,860
He has no time to talk to me.

293
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,180
What do people write

294
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,220
when writing to their mothers?

295
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,580
Today is my mother's death anniversary.

296
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,490
What do you do

297
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,500
at your mother's death anniversary?

298
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,300
We don't have a death anniversary.

299
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,180
You don't have a death anniversary too?

300
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,020
My father and grandfather think

301
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,730
it's not necessary to commemorate someone in some form.

302
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,100
Just keep her in your heart

303
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:08,940
and think about her every day.

304
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,300
Then she will be with you every day.

305
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,020
Then we are the opposite.

306
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,580
My mother made a mistake.

307
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,260
It was just

308
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,700
jealous things.

309
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:23,330
Unfortunately, she was not as open-minded as you.

310
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,220
She couldn't get over it.

311
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,350
So she found a day casually

312
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,620
and

313
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,100
killed herself easily.

314
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,530
The royal inner courtyard

315
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:32,900
can't tolerate

316
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,140
someone like my mother.

317
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,060
So they

318
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,540
erased all her existence

319
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,020
Erased one's existence?

320
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,020
They erased her name

321
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,420
on the clan book

322
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,940
and burned all her belongings.

323
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,490
Let me show you something.

324
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,380
This is the lawbook

325
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,820
my mother left me.

326
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,820
There are some notes written by her.

327
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,220
This is my treasure.

328
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,620
It inspired me

329
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,780
to follow my mother's ambition

330
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,980
and be an upright litigator.

331
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,220
Your mother left you something.

332
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,340
At least you have something to think about.

333
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:16,780
My mother

334
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,420
left me nothing.

335
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,660
That's not true.

336
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,740
Your mother should have

337
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,180
thick eyebrows, big eyes,

338
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,510
a small mouth like a cherry,

339
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,500
and small earlobes.

340
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,660
She looked gentle and cute, right?

341
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,820
How do you know that?

342
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,900
My mother didn't even leave

343
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,780
a portrait.

344
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,580
I knew it from you.

345
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,820
So,

346
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,940
you are the best evidence

347
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,060
of your mother's existence.

348
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:43,620
Tumi,

349
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,620
let me teach you

350
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,220
how to comfort people correctly, okay?

351
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,620
I...

352
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,460
There's a meteor.

353
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,090
Meteor?

354
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,300
Where is the meteor?

355
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,780
Just now...

356
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,460
It disappeared.

357
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,060
I heard that

358
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:13,300
if a man and a woman see a meteor

359
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,860
at the same time,

360
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,620
it means that

361
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,460
they are destined to get married.

362
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,900
We were so close today.

363
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:22,980
So close?

364
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,900
So close.

365
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,380
Are you drunk?

366
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,820
You start to talk nonsense.

367
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,660
Why are you so annoying?

368
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,660
You are

369
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,740
the most annoying person.

370
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,580
Do you really believe

371
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,660
there's a meteor?

372
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,340
I won't talk to you.

373
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,620
I really have to go.

374
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:52,900
My goodness,

375
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,460
you're finally back.

376
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,220
Master has looked for you

377
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,740
for several times today.

378
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,020
If you didn't come back,

379
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,020
I would be

380
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,900
killed.

381
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:01,900
From now on...

382
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:02,460
Father.

383
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,579
Father, what's the matter?

384
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,460
Nothing.

385
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,140
I just came to see you.

386
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,460
Have you finished packing?

387
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,260
You allow me to go to check around prisons?

388
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,660
I knew you were the best.

389
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,579
I was wrong.

390
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,020
Before making this decision,

391
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:23,980
I should have discussed it with you.

392
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,500
I shouldn't have acted on my own

393
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,740
and made you sad.

394
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:27,940
I'm not sad.

395
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,900
What should I be sad about?

396
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,020
I know you protect me and spoil me.

397
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,330
Everyone says that

398
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,860
women can't touch the law.

399
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:36,940
But you spoil me

400
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,700
so that I can do whatever I want.

401
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,260
Tumi.

402
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,930
I know learning a lot and

403
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,220
working for the people

404
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,340
are what you decided to do

405
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,900
when you started studying law.

406
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,580
If a person

407
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,540
really wants to do something,

408
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,020
he should try his best.

409
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,100
No problem.

410
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,340
I'll go with you.

411
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,540
After all, I'll be there for you.

412
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,060
I will protect you.

413
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,020
However,

414
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,060
when I'm not there one day,

415
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,540
you still need to do things well.

416
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,220
You have to protect yourself

417
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,500
with your ability.

418
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,340
You won't be away.

419
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,100
Dad will always be with me.

420
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,900
Silly girl.

421
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,300
Young Master.

422
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,220
This is the medicine for this month.

423
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,500
Take it on time.

424
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,380
Take care.

425
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,780
I heard that you have met

426
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,220
a female litigator recently.

427
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:16,900
Yes.

428
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,780
It's not easy

429
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,300
for a woman to become a litigator.

430
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,900
I also heard that

431
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,820
the female litigator was close to Han Wuwei

432
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,660
and Kang Zhengyuan.

433
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:28,460
Yes.

434
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,260
Make good use of her.

435
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,620
But you must know your place.

436
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,420
Get the inkstone done as soon as possible.

437
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,060
After you left,

438
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,660
Ayili loved to sit outside

439
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,220
the hut where you read books before.

440
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,060
Although she didn't say it,

441
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,380
but deep down,

442
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,540
she is hoping for her brother to return.

443
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,340
Don't worry, Grand Secretary.

444
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:46,980
I will go

445
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,220
wherever Han Wuhu is

446
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,140
in Youzhou.

447
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,340
Please.

448
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,420
Young Master, you have always been sensible.

449
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,700
I can rest assured

450
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,860
to entrust it to you.

451
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,180
You don't have to

452
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,020
worry too much about Juzi.

453
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,450
I'm always there planning for you.

454
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:10,340
Grand Secretary,

455
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,540
I have a request.

456
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:16,980
Is there anything

457
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,900
you can't say to me?

458
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,020
Li and I have been apart for too long.

459
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,700
I want to see her.

460
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,820
OK.

461
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,340
I'll remember it.

462
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,100
Come on.

463
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,020
Okay, Young Master. Don't see me off.

464
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,660
Young Master, what did Grand Secretary say?

465
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,540
Young Master, what happened?

466
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,780
Pack up and go to Youzhou.

467
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,380
What about Ayili?

468
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,500
He promised me that

469
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,460
he would bring Li

470
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,580
to see me the next time he visits me.

471
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,620
Isn't that good?

472
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:14,700
He mentioned Chun Tumi.

473
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,300
Chun Tumi?

474
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,620
Could it be Shen Wei?

475
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,740
No.

476
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:25,980
Could it be that

477
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,180
Grand Secretary has someone else

478
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,100
to keep an eye on us?

479
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,290
Be careful during this period.

480
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,420
Stay away from the Chun family.

481
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,340
Grand Secretary doesn't allow you to get close to

482
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,500
Chun Tumi?

483
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,140
He wants me to take advantage of Chun Tumi.

484
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,820
Isn't that good?

485
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:41,940
Jinyi,

486
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,100
think about it.

487
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,700
Once outsiders

488
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,660
be involved in the affairs of our pavilion,

489
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,300
how many people can be alive?

490
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,580
Besides,

491
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,700
the inkstone

492
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,100
is the top priority now.

493
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,700
Other than Han Wuwei,

494
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,060
we shouldn't get involved with

495
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,660
other men or affairs

496
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:58,780
to avoid distraction.

497
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,420
How's your packing going?

498
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,180
Almost done.

499
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,060
Don't touch it.

500
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,860
You don't understand it.

501
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,220
Who said I don't understand?

502
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,140
It sounds like

503
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,340
I'm illiterate.

504
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,340
His Majesty also praised me for being brave and meticulous.

505
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,260
Yes.

506
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,780
You have a rough face, but you're meticulous.

507
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,180
But...

508
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,780
Don't touch them.

509
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,580
Who wants to touch your stuff?

510
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,380
Where is your lawbook?

511
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:34,940
Well...

512
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,740
I've long remembered it.

513
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:38,900
I didn't bring it.

514
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,050
You didn't bring it?

515
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,660
You don't understand it.

516
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,220
I'll give Chun Tumi some books.

517
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,220
You can't give her my books.

518
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,180
You've already memorized it.

519
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,060
Do you need it?

520
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,620
Every time I read it, I get something new.

521
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,420
Sometimes,

522
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,420
I have to read it

523
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,980
when I don't know how to sentence.

524
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
Yesterday, I noticed that Chun Tumi

525
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,660
valued her lawbook

526
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,930
It turned out that it was a book her mother left for her.

527
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,700
The pages were almost torn.

528
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:21,020
I don't know how many times she has repaired it.

529
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,780
Since she was young,

530
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,980
she has only read this lawbook

531
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,180
and she has had so many feelings and experiences.

532
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,620
She is such a little girl

533
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,540
who loves law!

534
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,180
If she is lucky enough to read

535
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,940
a whole set of law books,

536
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,980
how happy will she be?

537
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,620
Right?

538
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,700
Right?

539
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:45,660
Yes.

540
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,260
She values the book

541
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,500
her mother left for her.

542
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,860
It's called missing her mother.

543
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,580
Yes.

544
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,780
If you give my books to her,

545
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,740
and the notes on them were written by me,

546
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,300
will she miss me?

547
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,420
No way.

548
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:05,460
I'll ask His Majesty for one set.

549
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,900
Cheapskate.

550
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,780
Honey,

551
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,540
what took you so long?

552
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,340
Now that you've become Captain.

553
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,940
Captain should

554
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,900
have his air.

555
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,500
I'll make you a new military uniform

556
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,820
later.

557
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,180
As Captain,

558
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,420
the most important thing for me is to set an example

559
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,580
and train the soldiers well.

560
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,170
As the mistress,

561
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,980
the most important thing for you is to take care of the family,

562
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,540
Dad and Tumi.

563
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,220
Yes.

564
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,500
By the way,

565
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,460
you need to get ready quickly.

566
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,020
Since I have been promoted,

567
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,420
I have to treat the men in the army

568
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,540
to have a meal

569
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,780
and invite the neighbors

570
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,620
to have fun in our house.

571
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,780
I'm joining the team soon

572
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,340
to protect Lord Kang to check around prisons.

573
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,100
If something happens,

574
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,500
you will need neighbors to help you.

575
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,420
OK.

576
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,020
Check around prisons?

577
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,380
So you'll be away for a long time?

578
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,180
Probably a few months.

579
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:27,780
Well,

580
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,140
Tumi will miss you.

581
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:30,980
Don't worry.

582
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,260
Tumi is going north

583
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,180
with me.

584
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,780
She can also meet

585
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,380
her mother's relatives there.

586
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,740
You can't go.

587
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,380
I...

588
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,660
I'll be afraid when I am alone.

589
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,060
If you are afraid,

590
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,300
when I set off,

591
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:51,620
you can go back to

592
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,980
your parents' home and

593
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:53,940
live for a while.

594
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,540
No.

595
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,340
Honey,

596
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,220
I will worry about you

597
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,340
day and night when you are out for work.

598
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,220
Since you can take Tumi,

599
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,140
why don't you take me with you?

600
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,010
Nonsense.

601
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,620
Going on a business trip is not a joke.

602
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,220
Commander Han also goes alone.

603
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,820
He is kind enough to

604
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,300
let Tumi go with me.

605
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,460
I'm going out in a few days.

606
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:19,700
Inviting the neighbors,

607
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:20,940
entertaining my men,

608
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:21,860
and packing the luggage...

609
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,980
I have a lot of things to do.

610
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,060
You have to help me to arrange for them.

611
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,060
Don't miss anything.

612
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,420
I'm full.

613
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,460
Honey...

614
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:43,820
Come on.

615
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:44,620
Come on. Let's drink.

616
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:45,250
Let's drink.

617
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:46,900
Come on.

618
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,460
Let's drink.

619
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,060
Dad.

620
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,660
Slow down.

621
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,980
-Hurry up. -Father,

622
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,740
I want to be a general when I grow up.

623
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,860
My son wants to be a general when he grows up.

624
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,740
General is great. He will be a general.

625
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:57,100
Fine.

626
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,380
I'll show you

627
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,900
what a real general is.

628
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,860
Come on. Cheers.

629
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,420
Everyone,

630
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,220
my son wants to be a general.

631
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,420
The real general is here.

632
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,220
General spent a lot today.

633
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,920
[Three Drunk Flowers]

634
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,300
He bought us

635
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,180
top-quality Three Drunk Flowers.

636
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,380
It's soft and sweet.

637
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,220
This wine is not cheap, right?

638
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,620
I'm going on a long trip.

639
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,740
Please take care of

640
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,940
our family.

641
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,220
This wine is really good.

642
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,260
Brothers,

643
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:22,580
elders.

644
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:23,780
Come on.

645
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,170
I'm here to propose a toast to everyone

646
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,260
with Three Drunk Flowers

647
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,530
to express my gratitude.

648
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,660
Okay.

649
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,300
Enjoy yourselves.

650
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,020
Come on.

651
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,460
Cheers.

652
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,180
Please.

653
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:32,940
Please.

654
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,700
-It's great. -Tumi,

655
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,420
I didn't expect to drink

656
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,820
the tea you made.

657
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,860
Madam Zhang,

658
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,220
what are you talking about?

659
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,020
You're a celebrity now.

660
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,220
I've always wanted to ask

661
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,260
whether your legs twitch

662
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,460
when you go to the court,

663
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,140
I'm fine.

664
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,220
Tumi is not an ordinary girl.

665
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,260
She helps the neighbors

666
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,380
to solve problems.

667
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,580
I said earlier that she could achieve great things.

668
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:58,980
When did you say that?

669
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,660
I said that.

670
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,420
Really?

671
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,260
I've never heard of it.

672
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:02,900
At that time...

673
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:05,090
Mrs. Wang, you were all there, right?

674
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,900
My Lady, why are you here?

675
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:09,930
Guo,

676
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,060
I saw Xiaoqin

677
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,220
sneak out just now.

678
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:13,860
These days, they have known that

679
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,580
my father and I are leaving,

680
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,810
but nothing has happened.

681
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,060
I'm afraid something might happen.

682
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,460
Hurry up and follow her.

683
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,660
Okay.

684
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,540
Guo, come in.

685
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:48,700
What took you so long?

686
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:49,620
Where's Xiaoqin?

687
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,580
My legs are about to break.

688
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:52,540
My lady,

689
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,220
can I reply after I sit down?

690
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,460
Sit down.

691
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,020
You're always rude.

692
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,420
Why are you paying attention to manners now?

693
00:28:58,940 --> 00:28:59,820
My lady,

694
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,660
her master is still sick.

695
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,090
She was asked to buy medicine.

696
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,540
Why did she play all the time

697
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,540
and put the business to the end?

698
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,900
Buy medicine?

699
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,940
Her Ladyship fell ill so suddenly this morning.

700
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,300
She didn't even have time to see a doctor.

701
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,460
What medicine could she buy?

702
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,850
I thought so too.

703
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:15,980
I even

704
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,740
went to the pharmacy to ask about it.

705
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,260
But the people from the pharmacy

706
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,820
are really strange.

707
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,660
He refused to say anything

708
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,300
and refused my money.

709
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,300
Did you see clearly what medicine it was,

710
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,100
what package it was and how much she bought?

711
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,300
I don't know.

712
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,820
She bought a lot of things

713
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,180
and mixed them together.

714
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,380
It seemed that she didn't want others

715
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,660
to see the medicine.

716
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,100
But

717
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,020
I saw the one

718
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,820
she was holding the tightest.

719
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,700
It seemed to be wrapped

720
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,100
with rattan paper.

721
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,460
The package was very small.

722
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,820
Rattan paper?

723
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,020
Such a special package

724
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,300
and such a small bag...

725
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,220
It must be very rare.

726
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,540
Is she going to

727
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,660
poison Master?

728
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,700
You don't need to hold me.

729
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,900
-Honey. -I'm not drunk.

730
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,420
Be quiet.

731
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,180
Tumi might be asleep.

732
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,180
It's good that you think so.

733
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,020
A family should live a good life.

734
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,100
Honey,

735
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,940
have some hangover soup

736
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:11,980
and wash your feet.

737
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,220
Then, you will sober up.

738
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,620
Bring me the hangover soup.

739
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:37,700
Honey.

740
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,340
This is the hangover soup.

741
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,060
Father, are you asleep?

742
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,660
Drink the hangover soup first.

743
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,460
Tumi,

744
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,300
what happened? It's so late.

745
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,060
I have asked Guo

746
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,980
to bring you some hangover soup.

747
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,940
Have some, please.

748
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:54,940
Tumi,

749
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,500
I've prepared some hangover soup.

750
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,060
Your father is about to drink it.

751
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,180
Thank you for your filial piety.

752
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,060
Yes.

753
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,060
Her Ladyship asked Xiaoqin

754
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,380
to keep an eye on it.

755
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,700
It's been cooked for a long time.

756
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,180
OK.

757
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,300
Then please drink Her Ladyship's soup.

758
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,260
I...

759
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,780
Something is wrong with the soup.

760
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,650
What's wrong with it?

761
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,060
It smells like medicine.

762
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,540
Did someone poison it?

763
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:27,420
Tumi,

764
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,780
what are you talking about?

765
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,460
Xiaoqin,

766
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,020
you've been watching it, right?

767
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,220
Yes.

768
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,740
I've been watching it.

769
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:37,060
It's not poisonous.

770
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,620
But I just feel that

771
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,100
it smells weird.

772
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,980
Madam, why don't you take a sip?

773
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,180
I...

774
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,300
Or, Xiaoqin, have a sip?

775
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,260
What happened between you two?

776
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:53,700
Master,

777
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:55,340
there's really nothing inside.

778
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,700
You've been out walking around

779
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,100
for half a day,

780
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:58,980
and you went to the pharmacy.

781
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,140
What did you buy?

782
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,860
Tell the truth.

783
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:07,700
Xiaoqin,

784
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,940
it's useless to hide it.

785
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,140
We will know whether you did it or not

786
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,060
after asking the pharmacy tomorrow.

787
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,420
If you poisoned him,

788
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,020
we'll send you to the court.

789
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,780
Whether you will be spanked

790
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,020
or hanged

791
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,540
is up to your luck.

792
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,420
After all,

793
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,860
you were trying to kill an official.

794
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:24,940
This...

795
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,210
It's not poison.

796
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,220
It's the laxative

797
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,660
Her Ladyship asked me to buy.

798
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,100
Get out.

799
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,780
I have something to talk to Her Ladyship alone.

800
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,820
Get out.

801
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,340
I'll send you back to your parents' home tomorrow.

802
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,180
We'll part ways

803
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,500
with each other.

804
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,260
I was wrong.

805
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,340
I was wrong.

806
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,140
Please forgive me this time,

807
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,100
honey.

808
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,900
I just didn't want you to leave.

809
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:21,900
I...

810
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,020
I wanted to have a child with you.

811
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:26,980
Then you won't

812
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,060
keep thinking about your daughter.

813
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,740
That laxative is harmless.

814
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,900
It can only make you

815
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,580
lie in bed for a few more days.

816
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,540
If you can't go,

817
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,060
the army will send someone else.

818
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,620
It's a long way to check around prisons.

819
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,700
You will suffer a lot.

820
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,340
I feel sorry for my husband.

821
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,780
What's wrong with that?

822
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,020
Military orders are like mountains.

823
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,580
Unless I'm crippled,

824
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,300
or I die...

825
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:54,900
Otherwise,

826
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,620
military orders are not easy to change.

827
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,180
Do you know what will happen

828
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,820
if you dare to change the military orders?

829
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,460
Anyone who tries to escape the military order

830
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,460
because of self-harm

831
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:06,180
will be punished by military law.

832
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,940
I didn't think that much.

833
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,620
Others won't think that

834
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,659
you don't want to be apart from your husband.

835
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,780
They'll only think that I'm afraid of suffering,

836
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,739
and I escape military orders on purpose.

837
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,380
The Chun family

838
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:22,860
is not a noble family.

839
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:24,420
I know you've suffered.

840
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:26,580
Okay.

841
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:28,620
I'll grant your wish.

842
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,139
You can look for a husband

843
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,980
who can accompany you all the time.

844
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:34,540
No.

845
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:35,340
No!

846
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:36,330
Honey!

847
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,620
Honey...

848
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,860
My lady, drink it when it's hot.

849
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,340
It's so nutritious.

850
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,060
Old Master asked me

851
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,100
to give this to you.

852
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,700
My granddaughter, Tumi,

853
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,140
has been chubby and cute since childhood.

854
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,540
If she gets thin during the patrol,

855
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,170
Dashan and Guo will be punished.

856
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,740
On the way,

857
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,780
she must not read.

858
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,740
She must rest in inns.

859
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,420
Besides completing official duties every day,

860
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,300
she must be accompanied

861
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,620
to take a walk or run.

862
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,900
Dashan arranges for

863
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,260
the daily workout according to the situation.

864
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,260
This was also given by Old Master.

865
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,340
He said

866
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,660
if Miss is hungry or thirsty,

867
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:46,180
if she sees anything interesting

868
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:47,940
or what others have

869
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,500
on the way,

870
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,220
you have to buy her one too.

871
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,420
Don't buy it only when she asks for it.

872
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,900
Grandfather is so old.

873
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,740
He worked in the government

874
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,780
and saved so little money,

875
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,380
but he gave them all to me.

876
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,300
He should have kept it.

877
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,820
He can buy whatever he wants.

878
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,060
If something happens to our family,

879
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,700
can he borrow it from Her Ladyship?

880
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,700
My lady,

881
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,020
this is Old Master's love

882
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,140
for you.

883
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,900
If you don't accept it,

884
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,380
he will be very sad.

885
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,020
I asked him

886
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,100
at that time.

887
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,700
Old Master said that

888
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,690
he would die soon.

889
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,020
It's useless for him to keep the money.

890
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,060
Practice thrift at home but be amply provided while traveling.

891
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,340
He said, "Don't let Miss suffer."

892
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,740
Have you prepared the things

893
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,700
I asked you to prepare?

894
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:46,810
Yes.

895
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,930
[I, Chun Tumi, will punish evil-doers and encourage people to do good. I will

896
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:10,450
[make Mother proud.]

897
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,190
[Kang Zhengyuan]

898
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,680
[Lord Han Wuhu is on patrol.]

899
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:40,550
[Ye]

900
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:52,660
Sky lantern, sky lantern,

901
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,180
may my wish come true.

902
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,920
[Grandfather, Father, be healthy.]

903
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,720
[Ye, may you have a happy life. Jinyi, be safe.]
