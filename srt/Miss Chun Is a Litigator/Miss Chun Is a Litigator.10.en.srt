I'm going to go over the files

with Lord Kang.

7
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:07,780

Or do you need something?

Yes.

20
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,860
They didn't let us out of the city.

Step back.

68
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:32,980
Ridiculous.

69
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,540
I want to ask Luo Li that

70
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,100
how were the military slaves in Bianzhou

so powerful?

72
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:38,740
He is suspected of

73
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,420
the Youzhou theft case.

74
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,500
Tell me.

75
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,410
How many people were arrested?

76
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,780
Where are they being held?

77
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:54,940
Don't do this to him.

78
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,100
He's injured.

79
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,220
He's just a military slave.

80
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,500
Military slaves are people, too.

81
00:03:58,579 --> 00:03:59,740
Luo Li has picked on me.

82
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,340
You also want to pick on me?

83
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,860
Luo Li tortured him severely.

84
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:03,940
Instead of helping her,

85
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,900
you were so mean to him.

86
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,620
What is the difference between you and Luo Li?

87
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,300
Chun Tumi.

88
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,740
You spent your days and months

89
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,580
guarding the files.

90
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,300
You have no idea

91
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,660
what's going on.

92
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:12,900
Why are you still lecturing me?

93
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,340
Do you know Zheng...

94
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,300
Some people don't have to pay with their lives

95

unless it's a crime of treason.

96
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,660
Some people's lives are worthless.

97
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,900
They let them be military slaves.

98
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,380
Whether he's alive or dead, killed or sold,

99
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,140
it's up to others.

100
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,420
Take him with me to save people.

101
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:36,700
Yes.

102
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,780
A bunch of losers.

103
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,580
Kang Zhengyuan was sick.

104
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,580
Han Wuwei is just a warrior.

105
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:51,460
What could he possibly do?

106
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,580
My lord.

107
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:54,820
I'm here

108
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,140
to warn Han Wuwei

109
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,700
not to extend his hands too far.

110
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,780
So I kidnapped his soldiers

111
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,740
and tortured him.

112
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:02,940
I picked

113
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,700
the lowest of the military slaves.

114
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,980
Why can't you stop him?

115
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:08,820
Lord Han is noble

116
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,660
and skilled in martial arts.

117
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,180
He wants to take his men away.

118
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,940
We can't stop him.

119
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,020
Get out!

120
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,260
Leave!

121
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,140
My lord.

122
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,500
Miss Chun wants to see you.

123
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,620
Let her in.

124
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:43,980
Yes.

125
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,140
Lord Kang.

126
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,659
You are...

127
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,340
I'm fine.

128
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,620
Nothing serious.

129
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,220
What brings you here?

130
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,980
Isn't Youzhou under lockdown?

131
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,660
I heard that Luo Li arrested people everywhere.

132
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,940
If they were suspected, they were tortured.

133
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,020
There was no clue about the theft.

134
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,860
That's why Luo Li was so anxious.

135
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,460
So he ordered to lockdown the city

136
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:19,820
and arrest him in the city.

137
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:21,820
Don't wander around

138
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,020
without anything to do.

139
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,060
If anything happens,

140
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,540
we can't protect you.

141
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,460
Now, people are in panic.

142
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,340
Lord Han can't wait any longer.

143
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,980
What's wrong with him?

144
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,740
He lost his temper

145
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,140
and went toward Luo Li.

146
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:38,820
Nonsense.

147
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,180
Isn't this adding fuel to the fire?

148
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,060
Lord Kang,

149
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,900
you're not feeling well.

150
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,900
It's not suitable to go out.

151
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,020
Why don't you send someone out?

152
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:48,820
Guards!

153
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:53,780
My lord.

154
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,060
Take my token

155
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:59,540
and ask Han Feng to find

156
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,260
Lord Han back.

157
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,060
Yes.

158
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:09,940
The statement

159
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,700
was incoherent.

160
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,740
Luo Li captured so many

161
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,940
innocent people.

162
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,500
Even if they confess by torture,

163
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,420
we can't find anything.

164
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,220
What's the use?

165
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:19,730
If you don't want to get involved,

166
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,260
just read the file.

167
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,420
Don't be distracted.

168
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,180
It's not about being distracted.

169
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,700
I'm already trapped.

170
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,100
My lord.

171
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,420
What did he lose?

172
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:29,860
Only

173
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,020
antique jades and royal treasures,

174
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,580
names and paintings

175
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,220
that had been collected over the years

176
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,980
were revealed.

177
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:37,820
Is this

178
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,020
worth all the fuss?

179
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,659
Think about it.

180
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,540
If there was a theft,

181
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,020
they'd probably sell the stolen goods.

182
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,340
It's against the law

183
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,420
to transfer royal treasures.

184
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,700
The more noise he makes,

185
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,780
the less the black market dealers dare to take it.

186
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,540
If the thief keeps it in his hand

187
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,260
for a long time,

188
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:00,220
he will be caught one day sooner or later.

189
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,340
He did this

190
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,300
to drive the thieves

191
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,530
into a corner.

192
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,580
It's really inappropriate

193
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,820
to use the normal life of the people

194
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,820
to pay the price.

195
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,740
Unfortunately, I don't have

196
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,820
the energy to stop him right now.

197
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:33,690
You want to help me again?

198
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,980
Do you pity the people

199
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,700
or me?

200
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:43,740
Working for the people

201
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,980
has always been my desire.

202
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,860
You're indebted to our family.

203
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,100
Besides, the patrol is not over yet.

204
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,820
This is my duty.

205
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,340
So, Lord Kang.

206
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,860
Forgive my willfulness.

207
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,580
Besides,

208
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,100
my father cares about these.

209
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,540
The people in Youzhou had a hard time.

210
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,100
They sigh every day.

211
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,060
This is really pushing me

212
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,020
to the limit.

213
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,340
Captain Chun is a good person.

214
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,220
That's what he said.

215
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,100
But why don't you think about

216
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:13,980
he has been

217
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,060
working for me and Wuawei

218
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,660
and didn't even go back?

219
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,420
How could he talk to you?

220
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,170
Why could he be sighing?

221
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,900
Anyway, it's my duty.

222
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,300
I'll do it even if you don't want me to.

223
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:28,660
Zheng!

224
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,460
Zheng!

225
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,300
I'm going to avenge you.

226
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,580
Why did you ask someone to stop me?

227
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,180
If you fight with Luo Li,

228
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,660
how can you take advantage of him?

229
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,060
He can stand up for two dynasties.

230
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,740
Of course he is a man of means.

231
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,900
Although he can't kill us,

232
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,340
it's not difficult

233
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,620
to make us suffer.

234
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:48,820
Wuwei.

235
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,820
Please listen to me.

236
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:51,780
I...

237
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,500
Zheng.

238
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,180
You're still sick.

239
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,780
You'd better rest and recuperate.

240
00:09:59,220 --> 00:09:59,740
Leave the rest

241
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,140
to us.

242
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:03,860
Take your medicine.

243
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:04,940
Otherwise,

244
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:05,980
I won't be able to explain to your mother.

245
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,180
What?

246
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,420
Lord Kang did this

247
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,540
because someone drugged him?

248
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,100
Is there justice?

249
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,090
Who would do that?

250
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,610
Could it be...

251
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,700
Who else?

252
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,340
He ordered someone to poison Zheng

253
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,540
because he didn't want Zheng to stop

254
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,020
his investigation from causing a bloodbath,

255
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,220
which would cause chaos to the people.

256
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,260
It's just the ingredients are hard to track.

257
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,220
Without the antidote,

258
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,780
Zheng may not be in danger,

259
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,300
but he won't recover for a while.

260
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,340
So, tell me.

261
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,900
Shouldn't I

262
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:48,940
give Luo Li some trouble?

263
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:50,820
Lord Han,

264
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,500
is it not Lord Kang

265
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:53,660
and the people of Youzhou that matter now?

266
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,090
What's the use of being angry?

267
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,260
But apart from these,

268
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,060
what else can I do?

269
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,260
I'm very protective of Zheng.

270
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,180
Luo Li's men

271
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,300
wouldn't be able to stick a needle in it.

272
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:04,780
What did the doctor say?

273
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,460
He said it's just a cold.

274
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,660
Is this doctor one of our own?

275
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,690
The military doctor

276
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,900
and the famous doctors from Youzhou,

277
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,780
we checked all of them.

278
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,180
Didn't princess

279
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,620
leave

280
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,220
any elixir or something?

281
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,500
There's no such thing.

282
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,580
Even if there is,

283
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,740
if the princess thinks that

284
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,460
Zheng may use it when he's on a patrol,

285
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,420
she will bring down the palace

286
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,540
and won't let Zheng come.

287
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,340
In that case,

288
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,420
we can only solve

289
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,380
this case first.

290
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,980
Or we can leave

291
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,020
and wait for Lord Kang to heal?

292
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,580
Are you sure

293
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,580
you didn't have any other interests

294
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,050
that would have led him to do this?

295
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:40,860
No.

296
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,220
Both Zheng and I

297
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:43,980
were close to him.

298
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,420
It was the theft of the vault

299
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,300
that shattered the peace.

300
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,700
Luo Li is proud of his forces in Youzhou,

301
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,940
but he also wants to win over

302
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:51,780
the Duzhong forces.

303
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,700
He was trying to

304
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,940
get me and Zheng.

305
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,020
But it

306
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,020
happened suddenly.

307
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,460
And Zheng was acting under orders.

308
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,500
This is bound to be

309
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,060
a stumbling block in his way.

310
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,580
So Khrom Luo

311
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,180
is that kind of person?

312
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,780
Unless he is guilty of treason,

313
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,820
otherwise, even if he kills someone,

314
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,820
he won't pay with his life.

315
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,380
I think

316
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,620
he just wants to overcome this difficulty

317
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,700
and apologize to you.

318
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,620
Anyway, you're not gonna

319
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,780
turn on him.

320
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:15,940
Bullshit.

321
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,700
Now he and I

322
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,900
have fallen out

323
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:19,940
with each other.

324
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,620
But...

325
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,140
Knowing the joint

326
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:24,900
makes solving the case much easier.

327
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,220
What do you think?

328
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,900
You're not someone who's waiting to die.

329
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:31,980
You must have done something.

330
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:32,900
What did you find?

331
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,500
I can't hide anything

332
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,300
from you.

333
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,220
The secret vault in the Yanwu Pavilion,

334
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,450
if Luo Li didn't go there,

335
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,820
that place was locked.

336
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,460
The patrol guards

337
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,620
found a window

338
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,380
was opened.

339
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,540
They informed the butler

340
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,940
and found out that it was stolen.

341
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,620
But it was done so cleanly

342
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,210
and left no clue.

343
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:04,860
What's going on

344
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,060
in the secret vault?

345
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:07,900
It's empty.

346
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,300
Luo Li

347
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,660
plundered the people.

348
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,980
One of the treasures

349
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,180
is said to be particularly important.

350
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,180
There're also many exotic treasures from the previous dynasty,

351
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,180
which were rewarded by the emperor

352
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,220
after Luo Li

353
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,010
resisted the southwestern rebels

354
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,420
to help the emperor successfully ascend the throne.

355
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,170
But anyone

356
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,140
who knows about his secret vault

357
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,740
must be one of his closest confidants.

358
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:25,900
Not more than five.

359
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,860
They were all people he trusted to the utmost.

360
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,380
How did you know?

361
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,860
I subdued his butler

362
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,220
and forced him to tell me

363
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,780
how to open the secret vault.

364
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:46,420
Lord Han,

365
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,420
no one else

366
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,780
would do such a thing.

367
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,100
I had no evidence that he drugged Zheng.

368
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:51,860
So apparently,

369
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,860
there's nothing I can do about him.

370
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,220
I didn't leave any evidence, too.

371
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,300
What could he do to me?

372
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,780
No matter what I tell you,

373
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,460
you won't listen to me.

374
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,420
Why don't I ask Lord Kang

375
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,500
to tell you?

376
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,460
Let's get down to business.

377
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,260
With all that stuff moving out,

378
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,820
It must be a gang.

379
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,260
But if it's a gang,

380
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,260
it takes a lot of people.

381
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,420
Planning, location, strategy,

382
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,740
transportation and hiding

383
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,100
take a long time.

384
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,140
A few months

385
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,420
or even a year might be possible.

386
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,100
Why would they pick a bad time to do it

387
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,740
when we're on patrol?

388
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,940
Maybe they are not from Youzhou.

389
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,220
Otherwise, they wouldn't have

390
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,020
done it now.

391
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,140
You mean

392
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,860
it was an outsider?

393
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,860
It's hard to find one outsider.

394
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,900
If a lot of outsiders

395
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,700
suddenly arrive,

396
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,420
the target range is much easier to determine.

397
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,220
Follow me.

398
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,460
There are several important points

399
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,380
in what you said.

400
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
You said the guards on patrol told you

401
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,300
there was a window open?

402
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:44,940
Yes.

403
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,460
Luo Li had not been to the Yanwu Pavilion

404
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,020
since the morning before.

405
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,300
So it means

406
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,460
they haven't seen anything unusual until now.

407
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:54,610
When Khrom Luo wasn't there,

408
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,740
the door was locked.

409
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,860
It was not until the butler went there

410
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,220
that he found the vault empty.

411
00:14:59,260 --> 00:14:59,700
Yes.

412
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,060
Even if five people

413
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,300
knew about the secret vault,

414
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,900
how many people knew about the mechanism?

415
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,820
Only Luo Li and the butler.

416
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,380
Lord Han.

417
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,420
Do you remember

418
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,620
it was six o'clock in the evening

419
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,260
when we had dinner?

420
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,900
It was not dark at that time.

421
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,100
There were pedestrians on the street.

422
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,460
And there're people moving about in the house,

423
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,940
and no burglary was possible.

424
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,780
Apart from the other evidence,

425
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,220
the timing

426
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,460
would only have occurred

427
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,100
between the morning before

428
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,660
and when the housekeeper found it.

429
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:27,860
And they

430
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,660
had to do it in the dark.

431
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,340
It's most likely

432
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,900
the night before.

433
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:34,660
That makes sense.

434
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,420
If it was all planned out,

435
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,700
they must have chosen

436
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,540
a hiding place.

437
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,460
From the time they stole it

438
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,060
to the time they found it,

439
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,180
they had 24 hours to hide it.

440
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,460
Surely martial law

441
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,140
was of little use at this point.

442
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,020
So,

443
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,700
you think they have

444
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,020
already moved the stuff out of town?

445
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,820
They've been searching for so long,

446
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,540
which almost turned Youzhou upside down.

447
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,260
But they still haven't found anything.

448
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,140
Suppose the theft

449
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,060
was successful the night before.

450
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,860
Because the city gate was closed.

451
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:06,780
They can only

452
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,140
get it out the next day

453
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,140
without anyone noticing.

454
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,340
So many things...

455
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,140
must

456
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,620
pass through the gates

457
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,940
without suspicion.

458
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,260
Funeral?

459
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:25,780
I met the funeral procession

460
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,100
on my way into town.

461
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,580
You think

462
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,300
there's something wrong with the funeral procession?

463
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,980
It's indeed suspicious.

464
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,500
I'll take the family into custody first.

465
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:33,620
What?

466
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,980
Even if the family is suspicious,

467
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,220
what if they're meticulous,

468
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,300
someone really died?

469
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,820
You can't open the coffin

470
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,020
to find the evidence

471
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,740
without their family's pemission.

472
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,820
If that family doesn't agree,

473
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,540
we'll investigate

474
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,660
and open the coffin in secret.

475
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,020
Justice

476
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,380
is a matter of justice,

477
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,540
transparency and openness.

478
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:50,900
Otherwise, how can we convince the public?

479
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:51,850
What should we do?

480
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,380
Not this, not that.

481
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,260
There's always a price to pay.

482
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,690
In my opinion,

483
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,340
we should stop the lockdown.

484
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,380
Withdraw the men guarding the city gate.

485
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,780
They can't have stolen anything

486
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,060
and kept it hidden.

487
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,089
The wind was so tight that they dared not move.

488
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,380
As soon as the wind blows,

489
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:07,339
they'll have to

490
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,380
take out the loot and divide it.

491
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,900
When you suspect someone,

492
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,619
keep an eye on him.

493
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:15,900
Good for you.

494
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:18,460
But you can't just relax.

495
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,980
You have to be loose on the outside and tightened inside.

496
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,020
First,

497
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:22,339
find out the suspicious person

498
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,619
the day after the incident.

499
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,780
Second,

500
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,700
check the people

501
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:26,940
who moved to the city in the past year.

502
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:28,339
Third,

503
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,580
find out how it was stolen.

504
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,260
I'm curious too.

505
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,140
How did they

506
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,540
get all that stuff out?

507
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,340
I've checked the mansion

508
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,540
countless times inside and outside,

509
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,300
and there's no clue at all.

510
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,780
I kind of admire

511
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,490
those thieves.

512
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,330
I don't know

513
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,170
how they did it.

514
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,420
You don't know

515
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,500
there're rumors

516
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,740
in Luo Li's mansion now.

517
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,420
It's said that the master

518
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,500
made all the treasures disappear,

519
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,540
even Luo Li believed it.

520
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,340
And his two Miss Luo

521
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,660
said they

522
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,260
asked the master for help.

523
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:01,860
I see.

524
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,420
Lord Han.

525
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,780
you have to join hands with Luo Li

526
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,740
for Lord Kang.

527
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,260
It's empty.

528
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,380
Lord Luo.

529
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,540
I found it.

530
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,460
Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.

531
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,300
Hurry!

532
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,290
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

533
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,420
Hurry!

534
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,340
Here. Let's go.

535
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,700
If the loot left the city,

536
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,980
it might have just gone.

537
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,020
They hauled away so many treasures at once.

538
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,140
First, it's not good for running away.

539
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,580
Second, it's too attractive.

540
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,740
Third, they had to be careful

541
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,260
that Luo Li would find out and try to retrieve it.

542
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,340
Judging from their behavior,

543
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,340
I guess

544
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,860
they will calm down

545
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,540
and take action after they get away from the trouble,

546
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,700
or just sit back and split the spoils

547
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,260
and go their separate ways.

548
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,620
But my men

549
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,740
have tracked it for 100 miles.

550
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,100
They couldn't even found

551
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,140
any trace,

552
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,860
not to mention catching them.

553
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:33,740
So,

554
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,140
the stolen goods must still be in Youzhou,

555
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,420
or outside the city.

556
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,700
I knew it.

557
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,940
Wuwei is really smart.

558
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,460
Thanks to your guidance.

559
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,580
Many things

560
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,020
are just a blindfold.

561
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,540
I didn't need to trouble myself.

562
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,100
And I didn't want to get into it.

563
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:16,740
Little girl.

564
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,900
Where have you been?

565
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,260
I've been looking for you.

566
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,140
What is this?

567
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,140
Why does it taste so bad?

568
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,180
Don't eat it if it doesn't taste good.

569
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:36,900
Word has just come that

570
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,060
the secret passage

571
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,420
leads to a drugstore

572
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,820
in the back street of Luo Li's mansion.

573
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,220
Luo Li immediately arrested

574
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,140
the owner of the pharmacy.

575
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,540
Everything is as you expected.

576
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,900
That master

577
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,060
was the head of the funeral cortege

578
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:54,700
you met

579
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,540
on the day you entered town.

580
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,660
His name is Shan Yi.

581
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,100
He's 23 years old.

582
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,250
He is

583
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,460
an accomplished scholar.

584
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:04,180
He earns his living as a doctor.

585
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,300
He's still studying.

586
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,060
And he plans to continue taking

587
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,900
the imperial examinations this year.

588
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,500
He's a local.

589
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,020
His parents died.

590
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,020
And he grew up

591
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,420
with his grandfather.

592
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,140
His grandfather, Shan Youde,

593
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,020
was also a physician in the countryside.

594
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,620
He's 69 years old.

595
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,740
Unfortunately,

596
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,540
he passed away

597
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,060
before his 70th birthday.

598
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,380
My lord.

599
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:30,940
Did he confess?

600
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,420
Have you found his accomplice?

601
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,140
No, he kept crying out for the wrong.

602
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:35,900
My lord.

603
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,740
I was wronged.

604
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,300
The east yard of my house

605
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,060
is rented out to outsiders.

606
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,460
I really don't know

607
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,340
where the secret passage came from.

608
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:46,980
Can you confirm that

609
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,340
the secret passage is in his east yard?

610
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,260
Yes.

611
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,380
But it's true that his family had a funeral.

612
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:52,980
His grandfather died of illness

613
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,980
and lay dormant for a few days.

614
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,100
The fact is that

615
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,900
the people who helped with the funeral

616
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,780
moved out immediately.

617
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,020
They said they were going home.

618
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,140
Going home?

619
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,340
Where?

620
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,940
Take the official road or the water?

621
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,100
I don't know.

622
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,500
They left

623
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,660
no trace?

624
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,940
Such as, let us know

625
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,540
where they

626
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,580
found the secret vault?

627
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:21,700
Until now,

628
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:22,820
Duzhong might

629
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,740
also got the news.

630
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,620
No matter how anxious Luo Li was,

631
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,460
he dared not open the coffin directly.

632
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,420
If it's stolen goods, it's fine.

633
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,780
If it's a dead man,

634
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,500
he'll lose all his pride.

635
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,780
He even offended

636
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,780
Zheng and I.

637
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:35,940
This time,

638
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,500
if we still don't find anything,

639
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:39,820
with his goods on us,

640
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,020
he'll be damned

641
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:41,980
if we want to mess with him.

642
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,420
During the patrol,

643
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,700
it was disrespectful

644
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,340
to lose the treasure given by the emperor.

645
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:50,980
Plus, the public resentment was boiling.

646
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:52,940
The only thing he can gamble now

647
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,900
is to confess.

648
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,220
I mean, would that be torture?

649
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,180
A man has to confess.

650
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,580
Torture him.

651
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,940
I don't believe he won't confess.

652
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:07,140
No.

653
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,300
I had the idea

654
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,020
for the passage.

655
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,540
If Shan Yi was really wronged,

656
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:11,340
I always feel like

657
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,540
I'm doing something bad.

658
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,620
For the sake of his burial,

659
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,460
he had not hesitated to rebel against the garrison of the city.

660
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,540
I think he should be

661
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,340
a filial son.

662
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,620
It couldn't be helped.

663
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,780
Don't blame yourself.

664
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,780
There's no contradiction

665
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,980
between being filial and doing bad things.

666
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,100
Besides,

667
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:28,980
Lord Han,

668
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,700
do you know something?

669
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:32,700
It's not what I knew,

670
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,780
but it's what I did.

671
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,260
I listened to you.

672
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:39,700
Take them to find the secret tunnel.

673
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:40,930
So I warned Luo Li

674
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,860
implicitly and explicitly.

675
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,980
You want him to

676
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,060
respect the law

677
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,540
and not to break the law?

678
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,380
Kind of.

679
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,660
What do you mean?

680
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,690
Zheng's last stop

681
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,580
on behalf of the emperor

682
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,900
is also our last stop.

683
00:23:59,260 --> 00:23:59,900
It's Luo Yang.

684
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,580
Governor of Luoyang,

685
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:02,740
and Master Liushousi

686
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,180
are His Majesty's

687
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:04,860
old capable officials.

688
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,180
If Luo Li were to be dealt with

689
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,820
by these senior officials,

690
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,100
they would have more experience

691
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:11,980
than Zheng and me.

692
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,460
Why don't we let the capable do it for us?

693
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,140
His secret vault was stolen

694
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,980
and arrested so many innocent people.

695
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,220
And he tortured them without evidence,

696
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,220
which violated the law.

697
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,740
Weren't you threatening him?

698
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,500
I was threatening him.

699
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,180
Zheng and I are are inferior to him.

700
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,420
Then I'll find some old officials

701
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,500
who can match him

702
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,460
to deal with him.

703
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,220
If he didn't want to disturb the old officials,

704
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,380
he must follow the law

705
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,980
and make sure there were no miscarriages of justice.

706
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,140
I wonder

707
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:35,940
if it would make you feel better.

708
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,620
That seems to be the case.

709
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,700
But I always feel insecure.

710
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:42,700
Don't be afraid.

711
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,460
This is the art of checks and balances.

712
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,340
Although Luo Li is proud of his army,

713
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,740
he is not dominant.

714
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,220
You're just

715
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,380
getting used to it.

716
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,140
You are all officials.

717
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,780
One and a half sentences can change

718
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,140
our lives.

719
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,460
I can't get used to it.

720
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:09,700
Lord Han.

721
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,420
I took

722
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,100
what you said to heart.

723
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,620
I let him heal his wounds,

724
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,700
de-slavery,

725
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,780
and start at the lowest rank.

726
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,100
How is your injury?

727
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:23,660
I...

728
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,220
All right. All right. You may leave now.

729
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:25,820
Don't scare her.

730
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,380
Yes.

731
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,700
There're things you always say I don't understand.

732
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,860
If you don't tell me,

733
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,860
how would I understand?

734
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,380
I used to

735
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,690
want to be on the horse.

736
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:46,260
Now I want to learn

737
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,540
how to govern the world.

738
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,380
Fine.

739
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:52,900
I'll do my best

740
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,780
to help Lord Han.

741
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,780
Don't forget what you said.

742
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,180
I promise.

743
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,140
My illness is recurrent,

744
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,820
but it's not serious.

745
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,340
Why did you come here in the middle of the night?

746
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,220
You are almost recovered.

747
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,980
Luo Li will interrogate Shan Yi tomorrow,

748
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,180
and you will be sick again.

749
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,540
If he doesn't let you hear the trial, he...

750
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,580
I have caught

751
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,500
the murderer,

752
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,850
but he committed suicide on the spot.

753
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,620
Zheng.

754
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,780
How am I supposed to

755
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,700
swallow that?

756
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,660
Luo Li was so strange.

757
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,460
Even if he had lost all his savings,

758
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,300
even in the face of great disrespect to the emperor,

759
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,260
he wouldn't have done such a thing.

760
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:47,930
Lord Kang.

761
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:51,260
Tell me.

762
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,100
Was there anything important

763
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,180
in that vault

764
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,380
besides gold and silver?

765
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,220
I don't know.

766
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,820
If there was,

767
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:00,540
he wouldn't want me and Wuwei

768
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,860
know.

769
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,380
The more he does,

770
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,180
the less I can make him happy.

771
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:06,660
Tumi,

772
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,380
Is there any way

773
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:10,300
we can get this case transferred to Zheng?

774
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,100
I don't believe in acting on emotion.

775
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,820
But Luo Li's actions

776
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,540
were indeed suspicious.

777
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,260
Why don't we get involved

778
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,660
and investigate the background?

779
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,380
Normally, there's no way.

780
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,370
But abnormally...

781
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,460
Yes.

782
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,620
Just tell me what I should do.

783
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,820
Then Lord Han,

784
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,860
please take me to see Shan Yi.

785
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,780
Luo Li's prison

786
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,260
is not allowed to be visited.

787
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,780
But who can stop me

788
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,420
from doing what I'm about to do?

789
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:58,740
Wait.

790
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,580
Shan Yi.

791
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,900
I can help you.

792
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,490
Just do as I say,

793
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,260
I can help you get rid of the punishment

794
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,220
and let the officer

795
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:22,260
take over your case.

796
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,500
As long as you don't ask me

797
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,940
open the coffin to check,

798
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,300
I'll do whatever you say.

799
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,220
My grandfather and I are family.

800
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,420
Even if I die,

801
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,260
I can't let anyone

802
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,340
disturb his peace.

803
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,260
All you have to do

804
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,580
is admit that you did it.

805
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,900
Didn't you just say

806
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,180
you were gonna help me?

807
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,420
This is clearly hurting me.

808
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,940
You didn't steal, right?

809
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,860
Of course not.

810
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,300
Whether you believe it

811
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,700
or not,

812
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,220
even if you kill me, I'm saying

813
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,940
I didn't do it.

814
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,940
Then you should admit those crimes.

815
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,420
Lord Kang walked the jails,

816
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,900
looking for miscarriages of justice.

817
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,020
You confessed everything

818
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,700
and took all the blame.

819
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,460
With the confession,

820
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,940
Luo Li must close the case.

821
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,420
A case he solved,

822
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,500
Lord Kang has the right

823
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,420
to review it.

824
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,020
Simply put,

825
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,140
you plead guilty.

826
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,220
Luo Li is in charge of judgment.

827
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,700
Lord Kang is in charge of the retrial.

828
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,180
All you have to do is recant.

829
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,180
If I confess,

830
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,660
don't I have to tell you

831
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,180
where the stolen goods are?

832
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:27,980
What if Lord Luo

833
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,100
wants me to tell him

834
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,700
where the goods is?

835
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,500
Do I really

836
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,700
have to take him to open the coffin?

837
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,260
I said you'd recant,

838
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,740
just say it.

839
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,900
Anyway, those people have escaped.

840
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:42,580
Just tell them

841
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:43,740
they left with their stuff.

842
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,780
They treated you badly

843
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:46,940
and dug a tunnel in your house.

844
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,410
Why do you still care about them?

845
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:50,780
Tumi.

846
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,140
It's almost time.

847
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,700
Do you understand?

848
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:55,770
Yes.

849
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:08,980
Lord Kang.

850
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,500
I acted on my own

851
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,380
without asking for your permission.

852
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,940
Please forgive me, Lord Kang.

853
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,050
It's fine.

854
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,220
The law is strict,

855
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,740
but there is a reason.

856
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,220
In a special situation,

857
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,340
you know how to be flexible.

858
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,020
This is a clever move.

859
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:24,220
Even I, the Prime Minister of Supreme Court,

860
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,780
can't find anything wrong with you.

861
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,860
I grew up reading the book of the law

862
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,220
my mother left me.

863
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,740
I also listened to my grandfather talk about cases.

864
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,260
I don't know about the rest,

865
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,540
but there are only four words

866
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,500
I work by.

867
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,540
Which four words?

868
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,940
To reward the just and punish the wicked.

869
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,580
I'm incompetent.

870
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,260
I failed to fight Han Wuwei,

871
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:45,820
causing Young Master to be seriously injured

872
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,620
and lost in the Youzhou territory.

873
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,220
After days of searching in vain,

874
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,580
please send someone to help me.

875
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,620
All this is because of me,

876
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,540
I'm willing to take all the blame,

877
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,300
just to find the Young Master.

878
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,330
[The Young Master is seriously injured and went missing in Youzhou. After days of searching in vain,]

879

00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,330

[The Theft of the Secret Vault]

882
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,260
Lord Kang.

883
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,940
Lord Kang, you look much better.

884
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:28,940
Have a seat.

885
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,380
There's no need for courtesy.

886
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,890
Did everything go well?

887
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,380
He confessed everything this morning.

888
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,620
It's sudden,

889
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,580
but it was exactly what Luo Li wanted.

890
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,060
I think

891
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,660
they were in a hurry to close the case,

892
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,060
so they didn't pay much attention

893
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:44,140
to the suspicious parts of the evidence.

894
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,220
Yes.

895
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,380
The general couldn't see it,

896
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,140
but the Prime Minister of Supreme Court certainly could.

897
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:50,460
Actually, I was a little confused last night,

898
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:51,820
but it passed.

899
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,180
What?

900
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,180
Shan Yi.

901
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:55,380
He's a civilian

902
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,260
and an inexperienced scholar

903
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,300
who has never seen anything before.

904
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,940
How could he be so bold

905
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,020
to act according to his plan?

906
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,540
Wasn't he afraid

907
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,540
you're gonna set him up?

908
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,100
Maybe this Shan Yi

909
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:05,860
is not as simple

910
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,980
as we think.

911
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,380
Lord Kang, have some tea.

912
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:25,820
What?

913
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,860
You think I'm a worrywart?

914
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,060
No.

915
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:31,500
I think it's the first step,

916
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,020
just to make sure nothing happens

917
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,820
and the suspect gets a fair trial.

918
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,260
You start worrying about

919
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,700
the outcome of the last step?

920
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,420
I do have that problem.

921
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,900
Wuwei once said that

922
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,740
the moment is the most important thing.

923
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,300
Lord Han is taking it one step at a time.

924
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,700
You're visionary.

925
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,140
You two just need to blend in.

926
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,260
He may not think

927
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:50,580
as far ahead as you and I,

928
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,180
but he's a better judge of character than I am.

929
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,820
I remember the first time

930
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,660
you went to the court,

931
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,500
he knew you were a good prospect.

932
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,420
Tumi.

933
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,620
Thanks for your help.

934
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,740
Lord Han

935
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,740
recommended me?

936
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,100
I should thank him

937
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,540
for his understanding.

938
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,620
Jailbreak

939
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,340
is a violation of the law.

940
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,460
We have

941
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,420
a common secret together.

942
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,100
There's no need to be polite in the future.

943
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,180
Since Lord Kang said so,

944
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,940
I'll go over the line and correct you.

945
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,940
Lord Han took Shan Yi out

946
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,100
and sent him back after a while.

947
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,540
How can this be a jailbreak?

948
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,180
It's an arraignment at best.

949
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:27,940
Yes.

950
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,500
You're right.

951
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,420
You're

952
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,650
going out for a walk today?

953
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,060
The city is free.

954
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,170
I want to see

955
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,820
how the people of Youzhou are recovering.

956
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,580
I can still find some clues

957
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:40,580
from

958
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,100
the neighborhood's talking.

959
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:42,860
Okay.

960
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:43,900
When you come back,

961
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,300
tell me what you heard.

962
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,580
Well, Lord Kang, today you...

963
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,500
I'll stay in the Luo mansion,

964
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,340
looking for a chance to take over the wrongful convictions.

Ye!

972

Ye!

973
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,780
It's me.

974
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:26,900
Don't come over.

975
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,420
Ye.

976
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,860
I brought you some medicine.

977
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:30,890
My illness...

978
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,220
The usual medicine...

979
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,300
Won't...

980
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,180
Useless...

981
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,260
But Ye,

982
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,260
how do you know it won't work

983
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,300
if you don't take it?

984
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,020
Ye!

985
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,100
You're awake.

986
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,740
Don't move.

987
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,500
I'll get you some water.

988
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,820
I saw your lips were chapped,

989
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,220
so I went to get some spring water.

990
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:10,900
I wonder

991
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,060
if you'd like a drink first?

992
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:23,500
Be careful.

993
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:44,260
Thank you.

994
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,380
Are you feeling better now?

995
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,460
I'm fine.

996
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,140
You must be hungry.

997
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,540
I'll get you something to eat.

998
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:51,620
No need.

999
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:53,300
Please leave me alone.

1000
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,580
But you're injured.

1001
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,060
You need someone to take care of you.

1002
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,540
I want to sleep.

1003
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,300
Then I'll visit you tomorrow.
