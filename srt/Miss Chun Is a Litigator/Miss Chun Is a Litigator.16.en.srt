you need to

176
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,500
keep me safe.

177
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,540
What do you think?

178
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,860
A gentleman's words

179
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,180
are quick as a whip.

180
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:29,860
Over there.

181
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,580
Go!

182
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:35,890
After everything

183
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:36,820
is ready tomorrow,

184
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:37,770
I'll blow on this leaf

185
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,539
as the signal.

186
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,419
If you hear it,

187
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,580
you can be at ease.

188
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:42,980
I'm leaving.

189
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,860
I'm really leaving.

190
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,340
Why don't you give this to me?

191
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,700
I'll learn how to blow it later.

192
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,540
Use this.

193
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,180
Bye.

194
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,900
Jinyi.

195
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,300
Ayili.

196
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:22,420
Ayili is in Han Wuwei's hands.

197
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,100
Hurry!

198
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,140
Grand Secretary.

199
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,410
It's time for him

200
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,340
to take the antidote.

201
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,700
Check

202
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,140
if he took the medicine.

203
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,380
Yes.

204
00:09:54,270 --> 00:10:00,310
[Mu'ai Hall]

205
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,100
My lord.

206
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,540
Last time, Mr. Wu

207
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,660
hired by Madam Xu said,

208
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,340
he thinks that Old Master Xu is still alive.

209
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,980
I agree with that.

210
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,140
Although his reason is not valid,

211
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,620
we might as well

212
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,100
think from another perspective.

213
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:19,420
What do you think, Miss Chun?

214
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:20,900
My lord,

215
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,300
can you summon the witness to the court?

216
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,380
Send the witness in.

217
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,700
My lord.

218
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,460
They are...

219
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,020
They are the witnesses

220
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:32,740
when Fan Jian fell into the water.

221
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,140
They are all cooks and waiters

222
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,260
of nearby inns.

223
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,820
Yes.

224
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,060
I have a question for you.

225
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,340
Fan Jian was facing an inn

226
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,700
where he fell into water, right?

227
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,660
Yes.

228
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,050
Yes.

229
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,460
Is there anything special there?

230
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,500
There is

231
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,540
nothing special there.

232
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,180
There's a small dock.

233
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,460
I have another question.

234
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,340
While Fan Jian shouted

235
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,820
and ran to the lakeside,

236
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,290
a group of well-meaning people

237
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,020
followed him, right?

238
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,340
Yes.

239
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:58,900
Yes.

240
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,700
Did you see

241
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,340
who was the first one behind him?

242
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,500
We only wanted to save people.

243
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,420
Who cared who was the first?

244
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,220
Yes.

245
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,700
Did you see clearly that

246
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,100
after Fan Jian fell,

247
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,820
did he swim up?

248
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,460
It was dark,

249
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,500
but no one

250
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,460
came out of the water.

251
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,740
What a grievance this must be!

252
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,500
Yes.

253
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,220
This place is very cold at night.

254
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,610
If anyone falls into water now,

255
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,500
they'll be freezing

256
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,820
and couldn't walk,

257
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,060
let alone run away.

258
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,100
Otherwise, why didn't they find him?

259
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,220
If I were Fan Jian,

260
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,100
and wanted to design a fake death

261
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,820
to gain some benefits,

262
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,580
what would I do?

263
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,060
Miss Chun.

264
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,980
We're in the court.

265
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,260
This is not a child's play

266
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,340
for a girl like you.

267
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:47,620
Go home now

268
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,580
and ask your father

269
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,980
to find a husband for you.

270
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,620
Yes.

271
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,460
As a woman,

272
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,420
why do you want to be a litigator?

273
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,300
There's no such practice in history.

274
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:55,940
That's right.

275
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,740
How dare you!

276
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,060
Miss Chun.

277
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,580
If you

278
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,820
really can't say anything serious,

279
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,220
why not...

280
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,380
Let me tell you

281
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,420
a story,

282
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,380
so that everyone here

283
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,370
can judge

284
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,460
the possibility.

285
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,140
Once upon a time, there was a man.

286
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,380
He was a well-mannered scholar.

287
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:19,380
But he always felt that he was not born in the right time,

288
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,020
and felt frustrated for all his talent.

289
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,700
He didn't want to live poor

290
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,900
like before.

291
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,140
Coincidentally,

292
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,300
his parents and brothers

293
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,540
loved money.

294
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,260
So they gave him an idea.

295
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,140
They persuaded him

296
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,460
to be a living-in son-in-law

297
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,820
in a rich man's house in this county.

298
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,300
A rich lady liked him.

299
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,580
It was done.

300
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,780
They lived together for 22 years.

301
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,980
His wife was rich,

302
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:43,740
but her personality was very strong.

303
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,540
The man's family not only loved money,

304
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,540
but they were also greedy.

305
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,660
They wanted to take advantage of the man

306
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,460
to lead a good life.

307
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,700
So every time this man asked for money,

308
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,580
he would be scolded by his wife.

309
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,940
As time went by,

310
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,460
the man couldn't stand it anymore.

311
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,820
He had a plan

312
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,450
to frame his wife

313
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,300
and put her in jail.

314
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,620
In this way,

315
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,900
he could control

316
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,260
all the money in the family.

317
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,300
Impossible.

318
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,740
He wouldn't dare.

319
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,180
Really?

320
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:09,900
So,

321
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,900
the man had a plan

322
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,530
and wanted to fake his death.

323
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,460
First, he went out

324
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,180
in the excuse of travelling.

325
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,220
Then he pretended to be missing.

326
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,890
When the time came,

327
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,860
he let his wife

328
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,020
go to the inn for him.

329
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,460
They had a big fight.

330
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,220
He pretended

331
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,420
he was stimulated,

332
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,060
ran to the lake, fell into the lake and died.

333
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:29,460
Of course,

334
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,940
he needed a spy

335
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,260
for this series of arrangements.

336
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,460
This spy had to stay

337
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,860
by his wife's side for a long time,

338
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,620
report his wife's whereabouts to him

339
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,580
and inform him immediately.

340
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,060
May I ask,

341
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,210
besides his wife's old maid,

342
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,140
was there a better choice for this spy?

343
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,540
Madam Wang?

344
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:50,260
Madam Wang

345
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,060
was the man's spy.

346
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,220
Madam Wang.

347
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,220
No way.

348
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,700
Madam Wang hinted that the man's wife

349
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,930
look for him in the inn,

350
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,460
and then informed the man.

351
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,420
So the man proposed

352
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,340
about taking a concubine,

353
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,540
which caused his wife to be furious.

354
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,100
They started a fight.

355
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,780
The man naturally acted

356
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,060
as if he was stimulated.

357
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,540
He went to the lakeside and jumped off the lake.

358
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,170
That way, Madam Wang

359
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,500
became the biggest witness.

360
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,420
But in fact,

361
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,820
someone did fall into the lake.

362
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,020
There was also proof that

363
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,340
the body didn't float up.

364
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:24,860
What?

365
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,380
Was it a coincidence?

366
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,700
There should a corpse after death.

367
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,980
If a person didn't die,

368
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,700
where would the body come from, my lord?

369
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,060
This was

370
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,820
a meticulous fraud.

371
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,460
Yes.

372
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,460
That makes sense.

373
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,540
There should a corpse after death.

374
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,980
We didn't see the corpse.

375
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:40,620
Yes.

376
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,020
Like what Miss Chun said,

377
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,380
how did he

378
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,620
hide from so many people?

379
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,700
Could it be that

380
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,220
he has a doppelganger?

381
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,500
My lord, have you heard of

382
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,780
spider and horse traces?

383
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,220
If he was so meticulous

384
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,420
to notice spider traces,

385
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,140
what was left to hide?

386
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,500
However,

387
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,460
there is no perfect crime in this world.

388
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,060
He would definitely leave something behind.

389
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,780
But we haven't found it.

390
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,100
What is the clue?

391
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,860
Tell us now.

392
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,300
Yes.

393
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,620
Seeing is believing.

394
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,980
If you are curious,

395
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,580
let's go to the lake

396
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,380
when it gets late. You'll know.

397
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,530
Get out of the way!

398
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:18,980
Get out of the way!

399
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,020
Move!

400
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,380
Move!

401
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,340
Move!

402
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,300
The man did it

403
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,020
to attract more attention.

404
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,940
Then there would be more witnesses.

405
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:31,940
My Lord.

406
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,180
Did you see his face

407
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,580
at that moment?

408
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,340
It's too dark to see clearly.

409
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:37,940
Besides, he ran so fast.

410
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,340
There was no time to see clearly.

411
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,060
But I noticed

412
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,820
he was wearing a white middle clothing.

413
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,140
He was wearing a white middle clothing with his hair down.

414
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,780
It would be more eye-catching in the dark that way.

415
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,340
Those kind people who chased him

416
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,980
would only notice these,

417
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,780
but can't see his face clearly.

418
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,660
They didn't know

419
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,500
what he did either.

420
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,780
My lord, let's go this way.

421
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,340
My lord, look.

422
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,140
There are so many goods bags on the dock.

423
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,900
And that man was obviously

424
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,340
very familiar with the terrain.

425
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,500
Look at the bags.

426
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:08,620
It's big enough to block

427
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,700
one's body.

428
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,860
And the stone over there

429
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,980
is shaking.

430
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,940
You need a rope to get it fixed.

431
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,300
Help!

432
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,780
Help!

433
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,140
Over here!

434
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,900
Over there.

435
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,620
Here.

436
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,650
Where?

437
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,300
Over there.

438
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,060
Where is he?

439
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,260
He fell from here.

440
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:45,980
He fell.

441
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:46,740
Is there anyone who can swim?

442
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,860
Help!

443
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:48,860
Let me see.

444
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,820
I don't know how to swim either.

445
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,300
Hurry up, find people who can swim.

446
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,740
What was he upset about?

447
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,620
Find someone!

448
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:56,900
Hurry up!

449
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,100
Who is it?

450
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,860
Are you okay?

451
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,300
Help!

452
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,580
He was right here. Hurry!

453
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,260
Hurry up.

454
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:05,740
Get someone!

455
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,819
Who can swim? Help!

456
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,500
My lord, look.

457
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:12,740
It's too dark.

458
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:15,660
He had a helper.

459
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:17,940
Who could it be?

460
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,300
Brothers fight tigers together.

461
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,660
Father and son go to war together.

462
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,700
It was Fan Bai.

463
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,780
These are all your guesses.

464
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:27,619
Do you

465
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,380
have any evidence?

466
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:30,740
My lord,

467
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,450
I have a witness's testimony.

468
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:34,740
My lord.

469
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,340
The three waiters

470
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,060
from nearby inns

471
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,740
all said in their testimonies that

472
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,420
on the afternoon of the incident,

473
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,490
they saw Old Master Xu

474
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,380
appear by the lake

475
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,580
wandering.

476
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,980
He went back and forth many times.

477
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,980
As for the physical evidence,

478
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,220
Few people went to the lake after the incident,

479
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,980
so the evidence is still intact.

480
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,420
If you have any doubts,

481
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,140
you can send someone to check them one by one.

482
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,780
Your testimony

483
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,620
can only prove that

484
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,260
Old Master Xu appeared by the lake before the incident.

485
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,020
It can't prove that Madam Xu

486
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,740
didn't force him to jump into the lake.

487
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,180
As for the physical evidence you mentioned,

488
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,020
it could also be fabricated

489
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,980
by Madam Xu

490
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,740
to clear her name.

491
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,300
The problem now is

492
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,420
whether Fan Jian is dead or not.

493
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,540
No corpse was found.

494
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,740
It can't prove that Fan Jian is dead.

495
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,340
At the same time,

496
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,460
it can't prove that

497
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,180
Madam Xu is innocent.

498
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,260
So, Miss Chun,

499
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,460
do you have

500
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,740
more powerful evidence?

501
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:34,620
My lord.

502
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,460
The evidence you want is outside the court.

503
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,220
My lord.

504
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,020
Someone put a box

505
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,940
outside the court.

506
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,020
Bring it up.

507
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:44,820
Yes.

508
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,220
What's in

509
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,540
such a big box?

510
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,340
What's in it?

511
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,380
What is this?

512
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,980
We should open it and see.

513
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:02,660
Open it.

514
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:04,780
It's open.

515
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,420
What is this?

516
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:08,860
You...

517
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,500
What's wrong?

518
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:09,970
What's wrong?

519
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:10,500
You...

520
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,180
Don't...

521
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:11,780
Don't be rude.

522
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,380
Why is there someone inside?

523
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:18,940
Yes.

524
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,300
This is a person.

525
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,580
Who are you?

526
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:25,860
I am

527
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:27,900
Fan Jian.

528
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:28,780
He...

529
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,020
He really faked his death.

530
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,020
In my opinion,

531
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:32,860
both of them

532
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:33,580
are not good.

533
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:34,620
They must be locked up.

534
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,220
Yes.

535
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,020
Lock them up.

536
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:36,860
Lock them up!

537
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:38,180
Lock them up!

538
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:38,620
Lock them up!

539
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,180
Fan Jian,

540
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,290
do you admit your crime?

541
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,020
Yes,

542
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,620
I admit.

543
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,500
My lord, I'm ashamed.

544
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,420
I can't believe I acted for

545
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,780
such a petty person.

546
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,250
But the law of our dynasty stresses

547
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,460
rule of morality with its priority to penalty,

548
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,740
taking respecting etiquette, law, human relations

549
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,060
and educating the people as the first task.

550
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,260
Now,

551
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,420
Old Master Xu is deeply regretful.

552
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,300
He didn't commit a murder

553
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,260
or a serious crime.

554
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:18,300
Why don't you give him a chance

555
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,940
to talk to his wife?

556
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,820
If they can understand each other,

557
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,180
it's better than them turning against each other.

558
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,820
It'll be a slight atonement for his sins

559
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,740
under your correction.

560
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,180
Okay.

561
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,740
The court is adjourned for the moment.

562
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,500
Ye, are you hurt?

563
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:49,780
No.

564
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,460
You went to catch Fan Jian.

565
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,260
How did you get hurt?

566
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,100
It's not him.

567
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,180
It's my own business.

568
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,410
Don't worry.

569
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,580
Tumi.

570
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,460
Father.

571
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:10,900
This is...

572
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,700
Lord Kang's subordinate.

573
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,300
Why is he dressed like this?

574
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,020
Lord Kang is afraid that I'll expose my position,

575
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,260
making people think

576
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,660
the government is biased.

577
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:27,460
Lord Kang is so thoughtful.

578
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:28,940
Tumi.

579
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,570
Lord Shan is looking for you.

580
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,060
Go and take a look.

581
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,220
Go ahead.

582
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,500
I have something

583
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,700
to tell your father.

584
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,380
You have something to tell me?

585
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,300
Yes.

586
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,820
I accidentally found something

587
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,820
when I was helping Tumi with the case.

588
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,940
The less people know about this, the better.

589
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,860
I can't tell Tumi.

590
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,580
Xiaoqin went to a house.

591
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,260
There were old maids, young maids

592
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,420
and a seven or eight-year-old child.

593
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:25,980
Old Master.

594
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:26,860
Come in.

595
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,780
Did anyone see you?

596
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,980
No.

597
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,780
I was so worried.

598
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,060
Old Master.

599
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:37,740
Xiaoqin.

600
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,340
Thank you.

601
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:40,770
I thought

602
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,340
I would never see you again.

603
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,540
No.

604
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,340
Relax.

605
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,860
What took you so long?

606
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,780
I wonder if Chun Tumi

607
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,700
noticed something.

608
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,220
She asked Chun Dashan

609
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:55,780
to spy on me

610
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,620
from time to time.

611
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,780
Chun Dashan.

612
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,900
Let him take care of himself.

613
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,420
Madam Xu said

614
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,540
how deeply she loved Chun Dashan.

615
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,020
But shee couldn't stand loneliness.

616
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,180
When she was in the Xu family,

617
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,780
someone made her pregnant.

618
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,700
Chun Dashan

619
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,740
is a busybody.

620
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,620
This time,

621
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,650
let him be a pushover

622
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,460
to raise someone else's child.

623
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,180
Xi is crying.

624
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:26,780
Hurry up.

625
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,540
Hurry up.

626
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,780
It's my hope that

627
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,660
you won't feel pity this time,

628
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,860
and you can make a decision in your heart.

629
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,580
All right, let's go.

630
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,020
Let's go.

631
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,420
Go.

632
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,420
Tumi.

633
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,820
What did Lord Shan say?

634
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:50,860
Old Madam and Master

635
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,100
didn't reach a consensus.

636
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,660
Lord Shan has returned to the city.

637
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,940
A judgement will be made in the next trial.

638
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,020
This family is ridiculous.

639
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,260
I thought

640
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,220
the Xu family was just snobbish.

641
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,730
I didn't expect that...

642
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,220
It's all my fault.

643
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,900
I shouldn't have provoked them.

644
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,020
By the way,

645
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,620
how did he find

646
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,860
Old Master Xu?

647
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,940
Since I suspected that Old Master Xu was not dead,

648
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,980
I've been thinking about this.

649
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:22,660
We've met

650
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,860
Fan Bai before, right?

651
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,690
He can act shamelessly.

652
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,740
But when he does,

653
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,660
Old Master has to testify for him.

654
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,460
So I asked him

655
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,780
and Lord Kang

656
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,260
to keep an eye on the Fan family.

657
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,420
In this way,

658
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,820
we found Old Master.

659
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:38,340
I see.

660
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:40,980
Father.

661
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,020
What were you talking about?

662
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,020
Kid.

663
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,740
Mind your own business.

664
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,020
Let's go.

665
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:54,980
Now I'm

666
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:55,860
a kid again.

667
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,020
Let me out!

668
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,260
His lordship said

669
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,380
to let you rest in the room.

670
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,500
If anything happens,

671
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,700
his lordship will take care of it.

672
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,940
Let me out!

673
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,420
As you expected,

674
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,020
you're injured.

675
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,540
It's just the blood of the assassin.

676
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,060
Aren't you afraid of nothing?

677
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,490
Why are you

678
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,660
pretending?

679
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,340
Think whatever you want.

680
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,300
I just don't want anyone

681
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,380
to get hurt because of me.

682
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,540
You think too much.

683
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,260
I'm not doing this for anyone.

684
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,300
I'm just doing it for

685
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,260
what I want to do.

686
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,340
I also have

687
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,420
what I want to do.

688
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,140
I've always wanted to see someone.

689
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,100
He has had a hard life.

690
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,940
I want to see him soon

691
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,340
so that he can be free.

692
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,740
Will you keep your promise?

693
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:51,980
Will you help me?

694
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,380
Since I lost the bet,

695
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,780
I won't go back on my words.

696
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,220
If you help me,

697
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,060
I'll help you too.

698
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,780
Did you keep him alive?

699
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,580
I didn't find him alive.

700
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,500
He either committed suicide or ran away.

701
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,210
This is only the first round.

702
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,420
If they don't kill me,

703
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,020
they won't give up.

704
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:10,900
The assassins of Mowu Pavilion are indeed powerful.

705
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,060
If they send another batch,

706
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,930
the defense here

707
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,940
can't hold on.

708
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,860
I have an idea.

709
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,580
What is it?

710
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,500
Zheng.

711
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,660
Mowu Pavilion sent first-class assassins

712
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:28,860
to assassinate Ayili.

713
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,820
It's not safe for her to stay here.

714
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,300
I'll take her

715
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,940
to Luoyang Villa.

716
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,460
As for other matters,

717
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,940
I'll explain to you when you arrive in Luoyang.

718
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,820
What is the identity of Ayili?

719
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,460
Did Lord Han leave any message?

720
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,340
Well...

721
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,300
Lord Han didn't tell me.

722
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,860
He only said it was too dangerous,

723
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,340
so he took her away

724
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,460
to ensure her safety.

725
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,140
How many people did he bring?

726
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,700
If anything happens on the road,

727
00:27:59,170 --> 00:27:59,740
can he handle it?

728
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,500
All the secret guards and Lord Han Feng

729
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,460
followed him.

730
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,940
I'll send my two teams of bodyguards

731
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,050
to catch up with them

732
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,380
and protect them together.

733
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,500
Yes.

734
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,220
Although now

735
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,740
we are tied together,

736
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,300
there are some rules

737
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,220
I have to explain to you.

738
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,660
For example?

739
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,940
For example, I don't like

740
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,780
people speculating about me.

741
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,420
No one speculated about you.

742
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:34,660
You were the one

743
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,780
uneasy all the way.

744
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,820
If I had the time,

745
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,100
I'd better think about

746
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,500
what you want to tell me

747
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,980
and how to find the one I'm looking for.

748
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,140
Have them all figured out.

749
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,100
You're not stupid.

750
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,820
You should know how I will deal with things

751
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,940
and how to be on guard.

752
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,260
Whether to take the initiative

753
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,540
or to set a trap

754
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,780
depends on how much

755
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,420
useful information you tell me.

756
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:11,460
Grand Secretary.

757
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,340
At ease.

758
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,020
Where's Ayili?

759
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,420
We're one step behind.

760
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:28,420
There's no trace of Ayili

761
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,380
and Han Wuwei at the post.

762
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,220
Han Wuwei ran away.

763
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,620
Did you tell anyone

764
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:36,380
about this?

765
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,460
No.

766
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,340
I didn't find Young Master,

767
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,140
so I came to you immediately.

768
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,820
Someone alerted the enemy.

769
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,620
When our men arrived,

770
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,820
we only saw traces of fighting.

771
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,620
How is that possible?

772
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,700
Did Han deliberately

773
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,540
cheat and mislead us?

774
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,020
Guards!

775
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,940
Listen to my dispatch from now on.

776
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,820
Depart for Luoyang, Youzhou

777
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,580
and Bianzhou.

778
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,460
Track Miss Ayili's whereabouts respectively.

779
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,100
Yes.

780
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,860
White Ghost has also started off.

781
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,820
Since the young master's accident,

782
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,020
they have been led by Juzi

783
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,540
about the matter of Ayili.

784
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,340
Juzi was involved too?

785
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,780
Jinyi,

786
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,660
I'll take care of Ayili's matter.

787
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,580
You stay here

788
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,260
and wait for Young Master to come back.

789
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,460
Don't tell him yet.

790
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,140
I know you and Young Master

791
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,260
are close.

792
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,140
But Young Master has an important task.

793
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,740
He must find the ink stone.

794
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,700
Don't distract him.

795
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,620
When I find Ayili,

796
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,140
I'll let them see each other.

797
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,460
Then we'll tell him

798
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,740
what happened.

799
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:03,980
It's better for everyone

800
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,900
this way.

801
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,060
Miss Chun.

802
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,780
Captain Chun.

803
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,540
I didn't have the chance to tell you my name in court.

804
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,260
My surname is Mei.

805
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,540
Mr. Mei.

806
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,060
What can I do for you?

807
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,060
Old Master Xu wants to

808
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,380
meet you.

809
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,940
What should be the sentence

810
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,020
for Old Master Xu framing his wife?

811
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,700
Lord Shan has his own decision.

812
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,540
Why does he want to see my daughter?

813
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,900
After all,

814
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,460
it's just a couple's feud.

815
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,180
He didn't make a big mistake.

816
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,660
It doesn't have to be tried in court, does it?

817
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,940
What Old Master Xu meant was

818
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,260
this is a family matter,

819
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,700
it's better to settle it in private.

820
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,460
Lord Shan, do you think

821
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,460
it's more appropriate to do so?

822
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,620
Lord Shan.

823
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:00,780
Yes.

824
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,380
Old Master Xu

825
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,860
is now in prison.

826
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,660
Without your permission,

827
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,900
I wouldn't dare to invite

828
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,460
Miss Chun to see him.

829
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,380
Since he wants to settle it in private,

830
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,420
he should talk to Madam Xu.

831
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,340
It's okay.

832
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,100
Father.

833
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,340
Since it's Lord Shan's idea,

834
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,780
please come with me.

835
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,340
Miss Chun, if you have any questions,

836
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,980
just ask.

837
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,220
I want to ask you.

838
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,940
Mr. Mei, did you

839
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,780
know the truth from the moment

840
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,060
he took the Fan case?

841
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,780
The conclusion was made yesterday,

842
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,140
and you already have a backup plan now.

843
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,820
Obviously, you are well-prepared

844
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,820
and experienced.

845
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,100
How dare you have no regard for

846
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,420
justice and law at all!

847
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,580
Do you want to say

848
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,540
since ancient times,

849
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,700
being a litigator

850
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,650
is not a glorious thing.

851
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,060
It's just that employers paid us

852
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,260
to get rid of hard cases.

853
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,940
Whether it's to say black as white

854
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,940
or the other way aroung,

855
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:04,900
it doesn't matter.

856
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:05,980
Because the ultimate goal

857
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:06,580
is to win.

858
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,690
If you win, you earn money.

859
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,140
The truth doesn't matter.

860
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:10,820
Indeed.

861
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,740
You didn't do bad things yourself.

862
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,420
What do those victims' sufferings

863
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,780
have to do with you?

864
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,980
Miss Chun, you must think

865
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,260
litigators not only exist

866
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,620
for money,

867
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,100
they should uphold justice

868
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,420
and help the weak.

869
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,340
If rich and powerful people

870
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,500
can disregard fairness and justice,

871
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,740
or even cover up the truth,

872
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:31,780
the world

873
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,820
will be dark.

874
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,580
But what does the darkness

875
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,330
has nothing to do with me?

876
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,260
The darkness didn't start from me

877
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,060
or end for me.

878
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,020
Indeed.

879
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,620
People of different aspirations cannot get along together.

880
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,860
A litigator is not a big talent,

881
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,620
but you you should at least

882
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,460
have justice in your heart.

883
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,700
If there is no justice in this world,

884
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,020
and the world is dark,

885
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,180
none of us

886
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:55,980
can survive.

887
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,100
Miss Chun.

888
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,140
You're going too far.

889
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,300
You may think

890
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,540
if the world is dark,

891
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,940
people will suffer.

892
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,420
But what I'm thinking is

893
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,179
after the Fan family case is done,

894
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,300
has my wife

895
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,380
made beggar's chicken

896
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:13,860
and warmed the wine

897
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,980
to wait for me to go home for dinner?

898
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,820
Let's talk about the recent things.

899
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,500
The case was just concluded yesterday.

900
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:21,650
Today, Old Master Xu

901
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:22,980
asked us to meet him in prison.

902
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,380
Did you plan this

903
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,500
from the beginning?

904
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,719
[Laishui County Government]

905
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,260
Stop!

906
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:38,900
Officer.

907
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,429
[Laishui County Government]

908
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,100
Tumi,

909
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,260
you have done your best

910
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,739
to clear Madam Xu's name.

911
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,460
Why do you want to get involved in this?

912
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,340
Father.

913
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,460
Mr. Mei

914
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,500
is pressing me with Lord Shan.

915
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,060
He must have bribed with money.

916
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,740
He went to such lengths.

917
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,620
I want to know

918
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,900
what Old Master wanted to do.

919
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:00,970
Besides,

920
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:02,580
I also want to know

921
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,490
whether Laishui County Government

922
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,100
is honest and upright or corrupted?

923
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,170
Money makes the mare go.

924
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,460
Men and women were put in one prison.

925
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,620
And there were no guards.

926
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,580
I wonder how much money

927
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,100
he spent to talk alone.

928
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,300
Why are you here?

929
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,860
Do you think we want to come?

930
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:25,860
Madam.

931
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,220
Don't forget.

932
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,700
If it weren't for my daughter,

933
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:29,740
this man...

934
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,450
His evil plot has succeeded.

935
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,780
We don't want anyone to repay us.

936
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:35,900
But we don't just listen to

937
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,060
people's cold words

938
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,900
I asked them to come.

939
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,100
Dashan,

940
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,900
we are family.

941
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,740
Now we need an explaination

942
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,020
for this family matter.

943
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,660
I invited you here

944
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,140
as witnesses.

945
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,100
In case, someone regrets

946
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,220
in the future.

947
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,980
Who's your family?

948
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,500
I didn't expect

949
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,500
I've been planning for more than ten years.

950
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,900
It was cracked

951
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,170
by you, a little girl.

952
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,140
I underestimated you.

953
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,540
If you don't want others to know,

954
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:12,850
then don't do it.

955
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,420
Just say what you want to say.

956
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,940
We have business to deal with.

957
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,220
Okay.

958
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,220
Let's each take a step back.

959
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:22,220
I will

960
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,060
ask Fan Bai to withdraw the charges.

961
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,180
You don't accuse me either.

962
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:27,940
Let's use enough money

963
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,140
and let the government

964
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:30,980
erase the scandal.

965
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,140
Then we all move to Youzhou.

966
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:35,970
The Xu family has property

967
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,020
and a lot of land there.

968
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,700
In a few years, people will forget about it.

969
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,100
By then,

970
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,100
a lot of good days

971
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,420
will be ahead of us.

972
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:45,860
Look.

973
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:47,660
What do you think?

974
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,380
Live a good life?

975
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,100
If I don't sue you for a life sentence,

976
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,780
people will call me merciful,

977
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,420
let alone live with you.

978
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,340
Are you out of your mind?

979
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,660
It seems you don't want to live with me anymore.

980
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,900
To be honest,

981
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,970
I've taken over

982
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,300
half of your business and management.

983
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,500
I dare to talk to you like this today

984
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,780
is because I have this support.

985
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,540
We used to love each other,

986
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,900
if you want to live a good life, let's do it.

987
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,540
No.

988
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,980
No one will have a good life.

989
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,260
You wish.

990
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,380
Fine.

991
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,780
I'll go to jail with you.

992
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:30,740
Chun Dashan.

993
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,340
Give me a brush.

994
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,340
I'll sign a pledge.

995
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,900
I'll give all the property

996
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,260
of the Xu family to you.

997
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,660
Live a good life

998
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,780
with my daughter.

999
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:44,180
Stop laughing.

1000
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,940
Dashan,

1001
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,740
do you know why I called you here?

1002
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,100
I just want you to know

1003
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,660
what the Xu family and your wife

1004
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,740
really are.
