[Episode 33]

23
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,880
Mr. Chang,

24
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,190
a breach of military orders
is a serious crime.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,630
Don't be angry.

26
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,600
Please don't blame General Yao.

27
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,190
I asked Cuiyan to bring him back.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,830
Cuiyan?

29
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,110
What can a paper girl do?

30
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,910
Get my horse ready.

31
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,190
Cuiyan.

32
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,910
Miss Zhu.

33
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,600
Why are you here?

34
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:52,750
General Yao,

35
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,160
didn't I tell you

36
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,470
I would send men to investigate?

37
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,000
Why did you disobey my order

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,360
and sneak into the enemy's camp?

39
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,160
You're putting our state

40
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,670
at risk

41
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,240
and our soldiers in jeopardy.

42
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,080
How will you be punished?

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,550
I'm conscious of my sin.

44
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,960
I deserve any punishment.

45
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,670
Forget it.

46
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,750
I know you care for the Garuda.

47
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,440
But now, our frontier is in danger.

48
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,720
No one can leave his post
without permission.

49
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,110
I need you to lead the army

50
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,190
to fight our enemy.

51
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,240
For the sake of your good reason,

52
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,550
I won't punish you too much.

53
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,720
Your salary will be deducted

54
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,750
as a warning.

55
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,000
You may rise.

56
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,030
Thanks, Your Highness.

57
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,080
Tell me.

58
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:34,520
What happened?

59
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,000
Miss Zhu,

60
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,240
Mr. Chang...

61
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,030
Mr. Chang,

62
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,440
what do you mean?

63
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,600
Cuiyan,

64
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,600
I painted a long whip as your weapon.

65
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,110
Go to the General's Residence in Bei Di

66
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,270
and get General Yao back.

67
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:21,950
Remember.

68
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,160
Don't blow your cover.

69
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,640
General Yao is in Bei Di?

70
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,480
Yes.

71
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,480
We don't have much time.

72
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,070
Hurry up.

73
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,720
Go.

74
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,920
That's what happened.

75
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,880
Xu Ruoxu.

76
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,760
Since when were you

77
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,070
a dark archer working for His Highness?

78
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,230
Miss Zhu, do you remember?

79
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,880
You promised me

80
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,200
I could deal with the black bee.

81
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,200
Miss Zhu,

82
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,480
don't misunderstand His Highness.

83
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,230
When I knew about the recruitment,

84
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,440
I took Yuan to see His Highness.

85
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:54,720
As a citizen of Da Liang,

86
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,950
I also wanted to fight a war.

87
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,320
I begged and begged

88
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
until His Highness sent us

89
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,760
to investigate
the Nine-Section Dragon Marrow.

90
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,950
What have you got?

91
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,880
The General's Residence
is heavily guarded.

92
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,760
As soon as we sneaked in,

93
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,350
we were found by the patrols.

94
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,920
We didn't find anything unusual.

95
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,880
You didn't find anything unusual.

96
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,200
That's so weird.

97
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,270
It's been a long time.

98
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,760
Bei Di people must have known

99
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,270
the Nine-Section Dragon Marrow was lost.

100
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,320
Besides, the three of you

101
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,880
have better martial arts than Mr. Tan.

102
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,720
Why could Mr. Tan

103
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,640
take it back so easily

104
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,920
while they couldn't?

105
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:34,000
Now, do you still

106
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,270
trust Mr. Tan?

107
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,760
Yuan is here.

108
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,270
I have a plan

109
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,430
to test if Mr. Tan is innocent.

110
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,480
Your Highness, I just wonder
if you'll let me do that.

111
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,480
Miss Zhu, say it.

112
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,760
Do you guys remember Ling?

113
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,080
Miss Zhu, do you...?

114
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,310
Do you want Yuan to kill Mr. Tan?

115
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:05,990
Yes.

116
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:08,920
The strong survive while the weak die.

117
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,870
It's the way the black bee lives.

118
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,480
After the black bee kills someone,

119
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,310
the man's memories

120
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,080
will stay with the black bee.

121
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,080
It's the most useful way

122
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,040
for us to know the truth.

123
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,990
Even if Mr. Tan is suspected,

124
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,960
he is a human,

125
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,080
after all.

126
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,310
How could you be so cruel?

127
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:23,800
Qing,

128
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,710
I know you get me wrong

129
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,960
for what happened before.

130
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,150
But now, I'm not being cruel.

131
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,960
It's Mr. Tan who tried many times

132
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,040
to kill us.

133
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,830
Besides, Yuan won't really kill him.

134
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,680
We'll just check his memories.

135
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,520
Then, we'll stop.

136
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,240
But are you sure nothing will go wrong?

137
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,640
What if Yuan accidentally kills him?

138
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,830
I know you're being soft.

139
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,990
But we don't have a choice now.

140
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,550
How can we get to know the truth?

141
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,040
How can we get

142
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,430
the real Nine-Section Dragon Marrow?

143
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,590
Will we still do nothing

144
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,990
when the Garuda has turned into a crow?

145
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,480
We'll do Miss Zhu's plan.

146
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,550
As a prince, I should do my duty.

147
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,590
For the big picture,

148
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,680
I'm willing to sacrifice something.

149
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,640
I believe Mr. Tan

150
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,960
will also understand.

151
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,590

152
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,110
Yuan, did you see?

153
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,830
Let's go back and tell them.

[Garuda Pass]

155
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,080
Mr. Chang.

156
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,240
Cuiyan,

157
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,360
what are you doing here?

158
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,760
Mr. Chang,

159
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,640
I'm scared.

160
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,310
I fear you'll leave
Miss Zhu and me again.

161
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:33,590
Cuiyan,

162
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,750
you don't know what happened.

163
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:37,880
Mr. Chang,

164
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,880
I'm a mere paper girl.

165
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,120
But I have feelings, too.

166
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,190
I hope

167
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,830
you won't leave us.

168
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:54,800
Come on.

169
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,120
Let's go back.

170
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,320
Who on earth are you?

171
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,190
Oh, Your Highness.

172
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,680
I've worked so hard to stay with you

173
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,190
and assist you for years.

174
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,360
Unexpectedly, I was trapped

175
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,070
by the black bee of Bei Di.

176
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,040
You're a spy of Bei Di.

177
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,150
The Garuda has run out of energy.

178
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,440
I guess it's dying.

179
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,390
The Prince of Langya

180
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,630
sent me to steal
the Nine-Section Dragon Marrow.

181
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,510
This is the latest poison.

182
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,920
Take it back

183
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,630
and the Garuda will die.

184
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:57,950
No.

185
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,000
I don't think I can fool them

186
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,270
with a fake drug.

187
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,880
Instead, I'll alert them.

188
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,830
I came here

189
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,510
just to take away

190
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,750
the real Nine-Section Dragon Marrow.

191
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,710
Are you still so foolish to think

192
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,680
the black bee only saw

193
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,830
how I got the Nine-Section Dragon Marrow?

194
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,480
You wicked creature.

195
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,320
Everyone in my army

196
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,680
took you for our savior.

197
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:33,190
Confess.

198
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,680
Is the real marrow

199
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,950
still in Bei Di?

200
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:37,830
General Yao.

201
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,710
He works for me.

202
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,040
I'll deal with him personally.

203
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,560
Leave us alone.

204
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:51,680
Your Highness.

205
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:52,480
Leave.

206
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,510
Let's go.

207
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,750
Did you serve me for so many years

208
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,560
just for this day?

209
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,190
I know you truly care for me.

210
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,950
Or you wouldn't still be

211
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,390
keeping my secret.

212
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,040
Then, why did you try
to kill the Garuda?

213
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:37,880
Why?

214
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,830
Because the Garuda

215
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,920
killed my father and ruined my clan.

216
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,960
My clansmen were loyal.

217
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,360
My father was a Bei Di general

218
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,310
who guarded the Garuda Pass.

219
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,640
He was working really hard.

220
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:56,750
But in a battle between the two states,

221
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,990
the Garuda killed him.

222
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,720
Then, Bei Di lost the Garuda Pass.

223
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,110
The late emperor of Bei Di hated it

224
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:07,950
when a bird defeated my father's army.

225
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,840
He gave out an order

226
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,320
to peel the face of all my clansmen,

227
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,840
so that we would be too ashamed to live.

228
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,960
One of my father's subordinate

229
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,640
pitied me and hid me.

230
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,350
Or I would have been dead, too.

231
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,150
All this was caused

232
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,670
by the Garuda

233
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,000
and Da Liang.

234
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,400
Your Highness,

235
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,520
if you were me,

236
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,400
would you have a second choice?

237
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,110
In this case,

238
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,320
why did you try awfully hard

239
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
to approach me?

240
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,840
Because only when you take the throne

241
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,760
can I ultimately

242
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,840
destroy Da Liang.

243
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,280
Even if you know my purpose now,

244
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,000
I won't regret it.

245
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,400
Because...

246
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,790
Because your grace

247
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,640
has mesmerized me.

248
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,150
Over the years,

249
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,000
I've been assisting you sincerely.

250
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,470
So, you planned all this.

251
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,400
You and I

252
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,760
are exactly the same.

253
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,440
We were discarded
by someone we trusted most.

254
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,520
Think about how your father treats you.

255
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,440
Why don't you go to Bei Di with me?

256
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,230
I can help you

257
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,400
get the throne of Bei Di,

258
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,110
conquer Da Liang,

259
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,910
and become the emperor of the world.

260
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,230
Isn't it better

261
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,230
than being an exiled prince?

262
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,710
Shut up!

263
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,000
Your Highness,

264
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,000
I can't believe

265
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
you used a puppet string.

266
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,760
You work for me.

267
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,880
You're certainly under my control.

268
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,230
Now, you've lost your martial arts.

269
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,670
Let's see what will happen.

270
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,230
Mr. Tan is confirmed to be

271
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,150
a spy of Bei Di.

272
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,790
He'll be executed tomorrow at noon.

273
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,150
- Yes.
- Yes.

274
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:04,520
Your Majesty.

275
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,520
Your Majesty.

276
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,960
Bad news, Your Majesty.

277
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,880
Bad news, Your Majesty.

278
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
Tell me about it.

279
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,200
A message came
from our spy at the Garuda Pass.

280
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,230
It says...

281
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,790
If you keep mumbling,

282
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,910
I won't spare you.

283
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,910
Mr. Tan who worked
for the Prince of Langya

284
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,470
colluded with Bei Di
to poison the Garuda.

285
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,200
The Garuda was badly injured

286
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,000
and lost its spiritual energy.

287
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,670
What did you say?

288
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,230
Your Majesty,

289
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:42,280
Mr. Tan who worked
for the Prince of Langya

290
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,640
colluded with Bei Di
to poison the Garuda.

291
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,150
The Garuda was badly injured

292
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,230
and lost its spiritual energy.

293
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,470
If the Garuda is dead,

294
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,880
Da Liang will be in danger.

295
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,520
Without the Garuda at the frontier,

296
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:00,910
our state must be

297
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
on the verge of crisis.

298
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,440
Go.

299
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,000
Get me Zhao Ai, my second son.

300
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

301
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,790
Why is there a sandstorm again?

302
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,110
Since the Garuda became a crow,

303
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,000
the Garuda Pass has never
had a good day.

304
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,110
The sandstorm is fierce.

305
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,520
People will die sooner or later.

306
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,280
Do it harder.

307
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:35,470
Raise your spear.

308
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:35,910
Take it back.

309
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,590
One more time.

310
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,440
Buddy,

311
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,000
you will get better.

312
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,470
General,

313
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,280
Bei Di troops are lining up.

314
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,910
If they attack us again,

315
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,710
I don't think we can resist.

316
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,310
Will you

317
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,230
contract me again?

318
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,640
Don't you remember?

319
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,920
You contracted me before.

320
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,590
What's this?

321
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,040
Is it...?

322
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,560
Is it the contract
between a human and a demon?

323
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,830
You'll follow me all your life?

324
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:53,560
All right.

325
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:54,920
From this day on,

326
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,230
you're my brother.

327
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,640
We will

328
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,760
fight side by side

329
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,110
even when we have to die.

330
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,040
Even when we have to die.

331
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,280
Sorry.

332
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:11,950
We can't

333
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,520
fight together anymore.

334
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,160
You and I

335
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,520
have fought wars for a dozen years.

336
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:20,920
We're always together.

337
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,110
But now, our enemy

338
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,560
has injured you so badly.

339
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,110
I can't take care of you anymore.

340
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:36,590
My soldiers vowed to fight desperately.

341
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,760
I just want you to get through this.

342
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,920
General,

343
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:56,590
all soldiers are lining up
at the city tower.

344
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,070
Please go and command.

345
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
Why are they there?

346
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
Please go.

347
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,830
General,

348
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,110
the war is about to start.

349
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:26,880
Soldiers are depressed.

350
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,830
We tried hard to keep the secret.

351
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,110
But there was still a leak

352
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,400
about the falling of the Garuda.

353
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,640
So, people are saying

354
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,800
the Garuda turning into a crow

355
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,880
is a bad omen.

356
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,760
The sandstorm lasted a few days.

357
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,430
We don't have food or water for days.

358
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,830
I guess we can hardly hold on.

359
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:42,280
General, please execute the Garuda

360
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,470
as our people request

361
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,830
to calm them down
and reassure our soldiers.

362
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,560
General, please explain the truth

363
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,280
to calm down our people and reassure us.

364
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,760
General,

365
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,760
we don't have food or reinforcements.

366
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,280
Bei Di troops may invade us anytime.

367
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,230
We have to stop people

368
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,070
from starting a riot

369
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,230
due to the Garuda.

370
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,280
General,

371
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,430
the Garuda helped us

372
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,110
to repel Bei Di's demons.

373
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,520
But now, it has no energy.

374
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,040
It can hardly protect itself.

375
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,590
It will be our burden.

376
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,680
That's right, General.

377
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,590
The bird is still here.

378
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:16,190
If Bei Di troops invade us,

379
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,560
we can't get away.

380
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:20,350
Dying in a war will be worthwhile.

381
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,430
But we can't

382
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,640
die like this

383
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,640
for no reason, General.

384
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,310
That's right.

385
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,760
General, if you hadn't
defended that bird,

386
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,950
we wouldn't end up like this.

387
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,830
General, please make a decision.

388
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,110
Did I...?

389
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,230
Did I really do it wrong?

390
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:16,830
General,

391
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,950
what are you doing?

392
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,830
Our contract is over.

393
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,400
You've sacrificed too much for us.

394
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,680
I promised you

395
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,070
I would take good care of you.

396
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:44,880
Unexpectedly,

397
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,520
I got you in such trouble.

398
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,190
It's time to set you free.

399
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,880
- General.
- General.

400
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,110
Away you go.

401
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,560
Don't be nostalgic.

402
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,760
Soldiers,

403
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,590
don't you remember

404
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,280
how it risked its life

405
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,590
to help us

406
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:17,470
and our state?

407
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:21,470
If we kill the Garuda
to satisfy our people,

408
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,470
will you really be confident enough

409
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,160
to defeat Bei Di troops?

410
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,470
If we kill the Garuda,

411
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,560
won't you be ashamed?

412
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,310
You're right, General.

413
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,430
I pledge my life to follow you.

414
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,190
I pledge my life to follow you.

415
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:47,350
Soldiers,

416
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,160
life here is hard.

417
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:50,950
You've been staying for years.

418
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,350
I know.

419
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:55,560
You wish to go back to your hometown.

420
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,590
That's also my wish.

421
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:02,000
But now, Bei Di troops
have come to our frontier.

422
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,640
Tomorrow, we'll have a desperate fight!

423
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,800
Whether our families can live

424
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,040
depends on us.

425
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:11,640
We must fight with our lives!

426
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,950
We'll protect our state!

427
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:16,430
Soldiers,

428
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,400
we've been guarding here for years.

429
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:22,110
Tomorrow's battle will be crucial.

430
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,160
The Garuda has left.

431
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
We have to count on ourselves.

432
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Do you have confidence?

433
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,040
Die in a battle!

434
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,350
Never surrender!

435
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,880
Die in a battle!

436
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,160
Never surrender!

437
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,590
Die in a battle!

438
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:38,920
Never surrender!

439
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,190
Die in a battle!

440
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:41,520
Never surrender!

441
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,640
Miss Zhu,

442
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,640
why do you look so tired?

443
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,880
It's my fault.

444
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,280
Before I fed the Garuda,

445
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,400
if I had carefully checked

446
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,800
if the Marrow was real,

447
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,830
we wouldn't end up like this.

448
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,470
Miss Zhu,

449
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,520
it's not your fault.

450
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
Don't think too much.

451
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,880
Mr. Tan was too wicked.

452
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,040
Have some noodles.

453
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,430
Your Highness,

454
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,470
the eunuchs have come

455
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,880
to announce some imperial edicts.

456
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,680
I knew this day would come.

457
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,590
Greetings, Your Highness.

458
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,470
Greetings, Your Highness.

459
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,350
You may rise.

460
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,470
Thanks, Your Highness.

461
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,680
General Yao,

462
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,230
I know you released

463
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,640
the Garuda.

464
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,800
Mr. Tan did everything.

465
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,400
But I'm also responsible.

466
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,950
The imperial edicts are here.

467
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,520
Edict for the guilty prince.

468
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,680
At the behest

469
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,000
of His Majesty,

470
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,880
my son Zhao Heng

471
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,590
didn't notice the spy of Bei Di

472
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,590
and brought trouble to the frontier.

473
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,560
He neglected his duty.

474
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,680
He failed to be a good son

475
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,680
or a good supervisor in the army.

476
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,040
He'll be put in prison here
and reflect on himself for one day.

477
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,310
[Imperial Edict]
Respect this.

478
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,280
Yes, Father.

479
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
Edict for guilty general Yao Pengju.

480
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,080
At the behest

481
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,680
of His Majesty,

482
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,470
[Imperial Edict]
General Yao Pengju is guilty.

483
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:57,080
He failed to command his army

484
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,560
and he was instigated
to release the Garuda.

485
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,390
He can't be spared.

486
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,920
He'll be executed within three days.

487
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,150
Respect this.

488
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:03,840
What...

489
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

490
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,720
- General.
- General.

491
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,440
Edict for the Yao's Army.

492
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,680
At the behest

493
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,200
[Imperial Edict]
of His Majesty,

494
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,390
the Yao's Army has been
guarding the Garuda Pass

495
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,720
and is meritorious
for defending the frontier.

496
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:45,920
It will be "the Garuda Army".

497
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,110
After the reorganization,

498
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,800
it will be in the charge
of the Prince of Langya.

499
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:49,870
No one shall disobey.

500
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,390
Respect this.

501
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,230
- Yes.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

502
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:16,680
[Prison]

503
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,390
Your Highness,

504
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:20,920
it's moist in there.

505
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,320
Take one more robe.

506
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:29,920
You go back.

507
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,720
Remember to tell Zhang Yuhu

508
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,040
to reassure the soldiers.

509
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:33,470
Yes.

510
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:34,840
Also,

511
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,510
take care of General Yao's family.

512
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,510
Yes.

513
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,750
General.

514
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,720
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

515
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,320
As the commander of the Yao's Army,

516
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,200
I'm giving out one last order.

517
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,800
I don't allow any soldier

518
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,390
to visit me.

519
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:02,870
- But...
- But...

520
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,630
- General.
- General.

521
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:43,200
[Prison]

522
00:29:57,510 --> 00:29:58,150
Mr. Chang.

523
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,720
Mr. Chang.

524
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:01,320
Mingyan?

525
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,870
What's the rush?

526
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:04,680
Soldiers are gathering
at the gate of the prison

527
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,440
and they won't leave.

528
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,840
I don't know where Miss Zhu is.

529
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:07,510
Mr. Chang,

530
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,350
go have a look.

531
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,390
I was about to go.

532
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,680
[Prison]

533
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:37,920
There you are, Mr. Chang.

534
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,630
Glad you're here.

535
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,630
General doesn't allow us to see him.

536
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,990
Please check on him for us.

537
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,750
Mr. Chang, please tell General

538
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,920
we'll always be with him.

539
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,230
We'll always be with him!

540
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,390
We'll always be with him!

541
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:56,920
Soldiers,

542
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,350
I will tell him.

543
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,390
I didn't know

544
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,110
you would come to see me.

545
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,750
I also didn't know

546
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,720
a prince like you

547
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,230
would be in prison.

548
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,990
Nor did I know

549
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,470
a prince like you

550
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,960
would be a demon.

551
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,510
I'm sure you knew it.

552
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,080
The black bee

553
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,440
just helped you confirm it.

554
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,630
Miss Zhu,

555
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,960
Yuan saw something else

556
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,350
in Mr. Tan's memories.

557
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,630
Is it about the Prince of Langya?

558
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,270
You know it?

559
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,600
So, when you sent Yuan

560
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,600
to test Mr. Tan,

561
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,320
you knew this day would happen.

562
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,510
Let me guess.

563
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,840
He tried to kill the Dragon

564
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:45,990
and attacked me in Yangcheng.

565
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,200
In many cases,

566
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,200
you sent Mr. Tan, right?

567
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,150
Miss Zhu,

568
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,680
I don't know if you will trust me.

569
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,960
I've never meant to hurt you.

570
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,720
But anyway,

571
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,110
I'm a prince of Da Liang.

572
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,470
I'm the Prince of Langya.

573
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,150
It can't be your reason

574
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,630
to sacrifice others.

575
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,560
Miss Zhu...

576
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:32,470
Oh no.

577
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,840
General Taotie.

578
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,200
You worked with Monk Lotus

579
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,270
to fight against the Black Qilin King.

580
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,440
You sealed the channel
between two realms

581
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:45,230
and cut off the hope of demons like you.

582
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,270
Don't you ever feel guilty?

583
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:00,680
Yao.

584
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:03,630
Qing,

585
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,600
there you are.

586
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:15,640
We'll be with General!

587
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,510
What have I done

588
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,270
to deserve so many soldiers

589
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,160
to fight with me together?

590
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,430
I shall have no regrets.

591
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,160
Yao.

592
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,270
Oh, Mr. Chang.

593
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:53,990
Please ask Miss Zhu something.

594
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,750
I cut off my contract with the Garuda.

595
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,400
Can it get back its energy?

596
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,600
Yao, why did you do that?

597
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,430
You should know.

598
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,470
The Garuda didn't lose its energy

599
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,270
because of the contract.

600
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,750
Is there no other way?

601
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:17,990
Does it have to die because of me?

602
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,640
The Garuda is lucky

603
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,680
to have a friend like you

604
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,310
in its life

605
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,470
who values its life

606
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,880
more than his own life.

607
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:34,920
It's also my luck

608
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,160
to be favored by the Garuda

609
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,640
for a lifetime.

610
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,160
Yao,

611
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,400
Bei Di has been ambitious.

612
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,950
Now, their troops are gathering

613
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:49,920
to invade us.

614
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,080
You released the Garuda at this time.

615
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,200
Do you have a solution?

616
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:56,950
Qing, you're well-educated.

617
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,510
But you don't know
the art of conspiracy.

618
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,030
To end the war

619
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,200
and avoid the death
of more humans and demons,

620
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,680
even if I'm blamed for all the sins,

621
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:08,710
it'll be worth it.

622
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,160
Then, you should understand me.

623
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,400
I sacrificed some people

624
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,790
for more peace.

625
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,510
We're the same.

626
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,470
No.

627
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,310
What's the difference?

628
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,160
When you sacrifice others,

629
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:35,750
your heart

630
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,680
doesn't hurt.

631
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,840
When my father exiled me

632
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,920
and I had to lead a vagrant life,

633
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,550
my heart stopped hurting.

634
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:52,230
I was only seven.

635
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,510
It's too late to explain anything.

636
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,310
Qing,

637
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,750
do you really think
the Garuda Pass has been peaceful

638
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,680
just because of the Garuda?

639
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,950
My soldiers fought wars

640
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:06,880
and killed our enemies

641
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,310
to get the peace

642
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,440
with their lives.

643
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:12,790
Then...

644
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,200
"When the Garuda is alive,

645
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,310
Da Liang will survive."

646
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,310
"When it dies, Da Liang will die."
What about the legend?

647
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,200
Because our people need a legend.

648
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,990
Compared to fierce fighters,

649
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,440
the mysterious Garuda

650
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,160
makes people more easily believe

651
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,200
our state will be safe and peaceful.

652
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,790
Because of this legend,

653
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,950
our people are willing to support

654
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,200
His Majesty who is away in Yunlong.

655
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,080
They believe he's the emperor

656
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,640
and with an emperor,

657
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,510
our state will be great.

658
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,950
Instead,

659
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,310
if people know

660
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:50,790
everything

661
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,470
is attributed to the Yao's Army,

662
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,990
His Majesty will think
we have too much power,

663
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:57,400
command our own troops,

664
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,200
and will be out of control.

665
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:00,470
So...

666
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:03,600
So, you released the Garuda

667
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:05,680
and would be executed.

668
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,030
All the time,

669
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,990
when the emperor wants to kill,

670
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,880
people have to die.

671
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,470
But under such circumstances,

672
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,510
if I die,

673
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,310
the soldiers will be depressed.

674
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:19,880
All creatures suffer.

675
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,790
Everyone makes his choice.

676
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:23,640
Why do you choose

677
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,840
to hate this world?

678
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,680
Now, you're blinded by hatred.

679
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,080
This isn't the real you.

680
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,510
You're not the Prince of Langya.

681
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,400
You're not Lotus, either.

682
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,880
You're Zhao Heng.

683
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,840
I hope I can see

684
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,360
the virtuous Zhao Heng.

685
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,230
In that case,

686
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,550
will you love me?

687
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:14,200
I've been telling myself

688
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,400
to be a normal man.

689
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,510
I will take the throne

690
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,160
and get back what belongs to me.

691
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,230
But since I met you,

692
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:28,950
everything has changed.

693
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,230
My life is out of control.

694
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,310
I hate this kind of feeling,

695
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:38,790
but I can't help trying

696
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:40,990
to approach you.

697
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:44,160
This is the change you have to make.

698
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,080
It's not about anyone else.

699
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:50,710
Anyway,

700
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,840
I want you to understand

701
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,270
and give up on me.

702
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,310
Is it because of Chang Qing?

703
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,750
If I tell you I'm Lotus,

704
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,710
will you...?

705
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,510
You once said

706
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,200
you weren't his substitute.

707
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,710
Why did you change your mind?

708
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,640
I regret it.

709
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,600
I really do.

710
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,360
You're Zhao Heng.

711
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,710
You must not regret it.

712
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,030
Our emperor far away in Yunlong

713
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,270
only cares about his throne.

714
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,470
How would he care

715
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,230
about frontier soldiers?

716
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,230
When a legend is gone,

717
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,230
I believe he'll soon find

718
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:10,640
another legend.

719
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:11,990
Qing,

720
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,680
my life doesn't matter.

721
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,030
But I want you to do two things.

722
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:22,990
Yao,

723
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:24,160
what are you doing?

724
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:25,310
Get up first.

725
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,310
Qing,

726
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,750
the first thing is...

727
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,510
Whatever happens,

728
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,950
you must help His Highness
to reassure my soldiers.

729
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:35,600
I've been fighting on the frontier

730
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,990
and don't have much contact with him.

731
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,360
But in the past few days,

732
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,990
I've seen through him.

733
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:40,950
He's a good prince

734
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:42,750
who will reign very well.

735
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,990
I believe

736
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,310
he will make my army strong again.

737
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,270
The second thing...

738
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,160
It's the Garuda.

739
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:57,440
I can't accompany it

740
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,880
for the rest of its life.

741
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,400
After I die,

742
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,990
it will come to me.

743
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,950
I know you can talk to it.

744
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,510
Please take care of it for me.

745
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:15,550
All right.

746
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,270
I will do these things.

747
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,230
I will.

748
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,550
Get up.

749
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:23,680
Thanks, Mr. Chang.

750
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:03,160
General Yao wants you
to go back for some rest!

751
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:05,440
But...

752
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,160
The war is about to start.

753
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,950
But you're staying here.

754
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:20,030
Is this what General Yao wants to see?

755
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:30,880
Vice General Zhang.

756
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,600
Soldiers,

757
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,270
go back for some rest!

758
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,550
We must not disobey General Yao!

759
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,030
- Yes!
