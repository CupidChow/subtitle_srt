come investigate if necessary]

Is Mr. Zhou here?

202
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,430
He'll be back soon.

203
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,040
Why don't you wait inside?

204
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:07,630
Alright.

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:31,790
This...

209
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,750
Isn't this where Mrs. Zhou was murdered?

210
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,960
Why would Zhou paint this?

00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,080
Yesterday, I secretly
reported Madam Sufen's case

to Mr. Lu of the Inspection Department.

216

No wonder.

No wonder they came to investigate.

00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,160
Liyu,

219
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,280

The day Mrs. Zhou died,

242
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,430
did Madam Zhou leave the residence?

243
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,190
I didn't notice.

244
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,670
What about Young Master Zhou?

245
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:36,640
Did he leave the residence?

246
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,910
It was so late.

247
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,720
He wouldn't go out.

248
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,000
Even when he learned of her death,

249
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,840
he refused to go because he was afraid.

250
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,390
Is this true?

251
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:50,880
He didn't go to the scene?

252
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,550
Of course.

253
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,030
Young Master has always
been afraid of it.

254
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:55,960
Thank you.

255
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,640
Zhou hasn't been to the scene.

256
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,760
How could he paint

257

What do you need from me?

262
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,510
Miss Zhu is looking for you.

263
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,310
She's complaining about
your disappearance again.

264

Let's go.

265
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,030
Where did Qing go again?

It's almost the Zi hour.

267
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,360
Why is he missing again?

268
00:18:33,390 --> 00:18:34,880
Miss Zhu, I'm back.

269
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,960

270
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:36,880
Where have you been?

271
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,120
I found many strange things
in Sijing Garden,

272
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,000
so I went to investigate.

273
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,000
Don't meddle in others' family affairs.

274
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:49,000
The Tiger's Paw is almost done.

275

and help me.

277
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,550
Okay, as you wish.

278

Miss Zhu.

279
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,270
Can the Tiger's Paw be completed?

280
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,270
Tomorrow's my son's wedding.

281
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,150
He must have it.

282
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,030
Don't worry.

283
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,270
I guarantee your son
will have it tomorrow

284
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,960
on his wedding night.

285
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,150
Good.

286
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,760
Thank you, Miss Zhu.

287
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,600
The night in the bridal chamber

288
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,030
and success
in the imperial examination.

289
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,790
In the eyes of others,

290
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,670
my life

291
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,390
is nothing but a joke.

292
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,360
Today,

293
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,550
I will marry Young Master Zhou.

294
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,120
Am I dreaming?

295
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,550
His last wife just passed away, right?

296
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,600
That's right.

297
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,270
He's marrying

298
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,670
a maid from his household.

299
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,840
Seems so.

300
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:55,310
No one dares to marry
their daughters to the Zhou family.

301
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,840
The auspicious time has arrived.

302
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,510
Bow to Heaven and Earth.

303
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,910
Bow to the parents.

304
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:22,240
Bow to each other.

305
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,120
The ceremony is complete.

306
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,080
Good, good!

307
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:34,960
My good son

308
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:36,840
and daughter-in-law.

309
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:40,390
I just hope you

310
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,270
will soon give me a grandson.

311
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,430
To the bridal chamber.

312
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,960
Do you know which wife this is?

313
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,600
The fifth one.

314
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,720
The fifth?

315
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,030
Yes.

316
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,760
Who knows how long
this marriage will last.

317
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,030
Congratulations, Madam.

318
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,000
Thank you, thank you.

319
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,550
Likewise, likewise.

320

321
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,240
Cuiyan.

322
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,790
Where has Yingtao gone?

323
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,790
She was just here.

324
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,270
Probably went to the Zhou family wedding

325
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:37,510
to join in the excitement.

326
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,080
Help! Help!

327
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,270
It's Yingtao.

328

329
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,270
Yingtao, how did you fall into the water?

330
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,270
Let's find a place to dry her off.

331
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,000
So someone really is

332
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,430
interested in the Tiger's Paw.

333
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,150
You're the thief who stole the drawing.

334
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,480
Stop chasing.

335
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,270
Miss Zhu.

336
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,640
Sorry, I'm late.

337
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:20,510
I'm fine.

338
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,310
Don't worry.

339
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,840
The real Tiger's Paw is still here.

340
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,430
Forget about the Tiger's Paw.

341
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,270
You should rest for a while.

342
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,030
I'm fine.

343
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:32,310
Qing.

344
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,190
Qing.

345
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,600
I'm really fine.

346
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,960
Don't push yourself, just lie down.

347
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,720
Qing, I'm really fine.

348
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,430
Madam Zhou
is still waiting for the Tiger's Paw.

349
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,480
Your appointed time hasn't come yet.

350
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,640
Close your eyes and rest for a bit.

351
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,080
Go to sleep quickly.

352
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:52,430
Alright.

353
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,120
Liyu,

354
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,310
you are my wife.

355
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,030
From now on,

356
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,910
I will make sure you live a good life.

357
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,550
Young Master.

358
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:46,790
What happened to Miss Zhu?

359
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:48,880
Yingtao,

360
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,120
how did you fall into the water?

361
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,840
I don't know.

362
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,030
It seemed like someone pushed me in.

363
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,760
No wonder.

364
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,430
So he used a diversion

365
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,270
to steal the Tiger's Paw.

366
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,000
Why haven't they come yet?

367
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,310
The bride is dead! Murder!

368
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
The bride is dead!

369
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:11,840
Guangping.

370
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,550
Murder!

371
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,120
Guangping.

372
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,360
What are you doing?

373
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,390
She's just a maid.

374
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,910
Why make such a fuss?

375
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,270
Is that enough?

376
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,720
Is that enough?

377
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,910
- Murder!
- Guangping.

378
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,030
- Guangping!
- The bride is dead.

379
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,790
Murder!

380
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,510
Murder, murder!

381
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,190
The bride was murdered!

382
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,480
Let's go and see.

383
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,310
Murder!

384
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,120
The bride was murdered!

385
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,840
Let's go and see.

386
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,550
Hurry, hurry.

387
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,760
Murder, murder, murder!

388
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,960
A beast killed her!

389
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,390
Cuiyan,

390
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,910
go and see what happened.

391
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:45,960
Madam.

392
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:46,720
How could this happen?

393
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,120
It's a beast.

394
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,310
A beast killed her.

395
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,550
- It's a beast.
- Murder!

396
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,240
Murder. A beast killed her.

397
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,790
Murder.

398
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:08,840
Sir,

399
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,760
why are you here again?

400
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,600
The Inspection Department
is here for an investigation.

401
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,790
There is a wedding here.

402
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,310
Sir,

403
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,000
it may not be appropriate.

404
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:17,430
Murder!

405
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,390
This place is already in chaos

406
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,760
and you still dare to lie.

407
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,430
Murder!

408
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,790
Murder! A beast killed someone!

409
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:24,390
Murder!

410
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,910
Run! Murder!

411
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,510
Enter.

412
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,430
Murder.

413
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,640
A beast killed someone!

414
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,760
Madam Zhou,

415
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:47,910
we meet again.

416
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,550
The Inspection Department received word

417
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,720
and got here quickly.

418
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,080
Your residence often
has strange incidents,

419
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,840
so we must closely monitor it.

420
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,510
Mr. Lu,

421
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,390
the bride's heart
was completely removed.

422
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,760
The method was extremely brutal,

423
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,760
doesn't like a human's doing.

424
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,840
It was indeed done by a beast.

425
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,120
This beast has probably taken human form

426
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,760
and is hiding among the people.

427
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,080
The Zhou residence
has always been peaceful.

428
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,510
Why would there be a beast?

429
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,080
Whether it's human or beast,

430
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,310
you surely know best.

431
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,360
In this case,

432
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,080
the beast must be outside the residence.

433
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,550
There is none inside.

434
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,480
Guangping.

435
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,030
I think the groom is the prime suspect.

436
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:35,960
It was not me.

437
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:36,960
- Not me.
- No.

438
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,000
It's not my son.

439
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:39,000
No.

440
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,000
It's not my son.

441
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,310
It's not my son!

442
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,030
What's happening outside?

443
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,080
Miss Zhu.

444
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,760
Miss Zhu,

445
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,000
are you feeling better?

446
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:56,960
Bad news.

447
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,840
Miss Zhu,

448
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,120
sir, something bad happened.

449
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,030
It's in chaos outside.

450
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,790
They say a beast killed someone.

451
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,600
Who died?

452
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,910
The bride

453
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,310
died in the bridal chamber

454
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,840
with a hole in her chest.

455
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,390
How could this happen?

456
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,510
Qing,

457
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:16,880
go check out. I'll be right there.

458
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,310
Alright.

459
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,030
If you run again, we'll show no mercy.

460
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,600
Release the arrows.

461
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,670
No one is allowed to harm my son.

462
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,600
How could he
be the son of a beast like you?

463
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,480
Everyone, look closely.

464
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,030
This Madam Zhou before you

465
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,310
is the White Tiger
that has been hiding in the residence.

466
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,310
She is behind all the previous cases.

467
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:58,670
He's not your son at all.

468
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,190
He is the son of Zhou Shuyou.

469
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,190
You've been pretending to be his mother.

470
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:03,880
Liar.

471
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,080
He is my son.

472
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:13,790
More than twenty years ago,

473
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,910
Zhou Shuyou accompanied his wife

474
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,720
back to Yunlong to visit her family,

475
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,270
and was killed

476
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,080
by a beast

477
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,240
when he was passing through Wuxia City.

478
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,120
Only his wife and child survived.

479
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:27,550
And there was
a female corpse at the scene,

480
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:29,600
dressed finely
but her face was destroyed.

481
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,120
Her identity was unknown,
and her death was tragic.

482
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,480
It was an unresolved case of that time.

483
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,240
In fact,

484
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,310
the beast scratched her face

485
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,640
and disguised itself as her

486
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,910
to continue committing crimes
in Wuxia City,

487
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,030
killing Zhou Guangping's
three wives in a row.

488
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,840
Am I wrong?

489
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,430
You are that beast,

490
00:30:49,310 --> 00:30:50,150
White Tiger.

491
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:50,840
You're lying.

492
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,760
So it was you.

493
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,360
The White Tiger
that killed my family was you!

494
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,030
Guangping.

495
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,510
Don't believe
their baseless accusations.

496
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:01,270
Guangping.

497
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:01,960
Don't come any closer!

498
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:05,840
Beast,

499
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,310
you won't escape in the end.

500
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,430
You're all framing me.

501
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,150
Is it your Inspection Department
trying to harm me?

502
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,880
Tiger Wind Squad.

503
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,080
Everyone, get ready.

504
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,360
Zhou.

505
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,430
Are you alright?

506
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,510
Thank you for cooperating with our plan.

507
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,120
If it weren't for the murder

508
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,910
at Sijing Garden,

509
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:40,790
we, the Inspection Department,

510
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,150
wouldn't have been able to enter openly.

511
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:45,640
Lu Ying,

512
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,640
enter the formation from the northwest.

513
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,390
White Tiger,

514
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,600
reveal yourself.

515
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,550
Be careful!

516
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,720
Restrain it.

517
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,470
The Prince of Langya is truly impressive,

518
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,750
using a peach blossom rain
to create a formation.

519
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:27,880
Mr. Lu.

520
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,470
Mr. Lu.

521
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:30,400
Mr. Lu.

522
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,270
Mr. Lu.

523
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,230
Mr. Lu.

524
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,640
Mr. Lu.

525
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,080
How is this Tiger Wind Squad
so powerful?

526
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,640
The embroidery.

527
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:10,990
There's something wrong
with that embroidery.

528
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,400
Mr. Lu.

529
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:13,840
The embroidery!

530
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,310
The embroidery!

531
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,840
There's something wrong
with that embroidery.

532
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,080
In the ancestral hall!

533
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:19,840
The embroidery!

534
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,880
It's in the ancestral hall.

535
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:01,950
Guangping.

536
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:10,950
Liyu.

537
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,920
How are you still alive?

538
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,230
Aren't you dead?

539
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,360
Did you all conspire to deceive me?

540
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:29,840
Is that right?

541
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,950
Thanks to your son
and daughter-in-law,

542
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,550
that body of Liyu

543
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,640
was merely a mannequin
we prepared earlier.

544
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:37,750
Without this deception,

545
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,710
how else could we capture you?

546
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,790
Guangping,

547
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,550
is it true?

548
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,640
Didn't you promise me

549
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,080
not to lie to me again?

550
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:59,360
I'm sorry.

551
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,120
Don't blame me.

552
00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:03,230
I don't blame you,

553
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,990
Guangping.

554
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,710
I don't blame you.

555
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,120
I'm not your son.

556
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,510
You're nothing but a beast.

557
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:22,880
Yes, yes.

558
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,710
You're not my son.

559
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,030
I have nothing to do with you.

560
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,230
I...

561
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,990
I'm not your mother.

562
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,550
Everyone, listen.

563
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,680
I have nothing to do with him.

564
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,400
He's not my son,

565
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,790
and I'm not his mother.

566
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,160
I...

567
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:46,710
I have one last wish.

568
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,440
Guangping,

569
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:53,790
Miss Zhu has the Tiger's Paw
in her hand.

570
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,600
I entrusted her to make it
for you with great effort.

571
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,160
Eat it,

572
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:01,200
and it will cure your heart condition.

573
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,400
Just help me

574
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:05,120
fulfill my last wish.

575
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:05,920
Will you do it?

576
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,120
What are you waiting for?

577
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,640
Quickly tie this beast up

578
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,030
and take it back for interrogation.

579
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,600
Wait.

580
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:16,790
Miss Zhu.

581
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:21,640
Mr. Lu.

582
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,310
Let me finish one thing first

583
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,600
with this White Tiger,

584
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,750
then you can take her into custody.

585
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,400
Miss Zhu, please go ahead.

586
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,360
But you look exhausted today.

587
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,080
Were you in the Sijing Garden kitchen

588
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,600
cooking for too long?

589
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,400
You seem overworked.

590
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,840
Is everything alright?

591
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,440
I did encounter some trouble.

592
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:39,750
But it's nothing serious.

593
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,990
Miss Zhu,

594
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,990
I'm truly grateful.

595
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,470
Just a small thing, no need to thank me.

596
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:48,470
Here.

597
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:50,950
I told you

598
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:51,920
I wouldn't eat it.

599
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,470
I promised Madam Zhou

600
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,360
I'd make the Tiger's Paw for you

601
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,600
and take the Shennong Tripod.

602
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,880
That's your business.

603
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,160
She and I are no longer connected.

604
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,710
I won't take or eat

605
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,270
anything she gives me.

606
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,160
Do you know
how this Tiger's Paw is made?

607
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,200
She didn't tell me,
and I don't want to know.

608
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,160
You've seen that White Tiger before.

609
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:11,950
Didn't you notice

610
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,270
she's not the same as before?

611
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,440
This ingredient has no flavor,

612
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,640
but this one

613
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,310
was boiled three times in spring water,

614
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,680
simmered three times in lamb broth,

615
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,310
and 32 hours in chicken broth

616
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:28,360
to slowly infuse the flavor.

617
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,310
Just like you,

618
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,200
you're the pearl she carefully nurtured.

619
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,440
She cherished you

620
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,510
and tormented you like fire.

621
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,880
You must trust my cooking skills.

622
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:41,600
If this works,

623
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,270
what kind of son do you want?

624
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,030
One who is obedient

625
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,790
and never leaves you,

626
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:47,600
or one who

627
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,600
treats you as his treasured pearl?

628
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,360
No.

629
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,440
May heaven bless

630
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,470
that his illness is cured,

631
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,880
and that he suffers no more pain.

632
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,920
I grant him freedom.

633
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,160
I grant him eternal freedom.

634
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,160
Make your own choice.

635
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:08,360
White Tiger,

636
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,680
I've given him the Tiger's Paw.

637
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,550
Let him decide

638
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:12,920
the rest for himself.

639
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:14,920
Young Master.

640
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:15,990
This is Madam's...

641
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,310
This is the White Tiger's
final wish for you.

642
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,200
Eating it
will cure your heart condition.

643
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,680
Please take it.

644
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:23,840
Yes.

645
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:24,880
Guangping,

646
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,440
I beg you.

647
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:27,790
Eat the Tiger's Paw

648
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,400
and it will heal your heart.

649
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,120
I said I don't want to eat!

650
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:33,790
Guangping.

651
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,990
You said you'd give me freedom.

652
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:35,790
Go pick it up.

653
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:36,750
Why do you keep pushing me?

654
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,200
I am not your son.

655
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,680
My life is none of your business.

656
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,120
You are not my son.

657
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:45,440
All I ask is for you
to eat the Tiger's Paw.

658
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:46,990
Please.

659
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:49,920
This is my last wish, alright?

660
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,080
Please, Guangping.

661
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:55,880
Liyu.

662
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,510
Are you okay?

663
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:58,990
I'm sorry.

664
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,160
Please, Guangping.

665
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,550
I'm begging you.

666
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,160
Please.

667
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,600
I beg you.

668
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,160
White Tiger.

669
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:12,160
Please eat it, okay?

670
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,120
Guangping.

671
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,550
Miss Zhu is kind-hearted,

672
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,680
even wanting to fulfill
the wish of a monster.

673
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,510
You're overthinking it.

674
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,030
This is just our deal.

675
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,710
I make the Tiger's Paw for her.

676
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,080
She gives me the Shennong Tripod.

677
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,880
What kind of tripod is it

678
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,920
that concerns Miss Zhu so much?

679
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,840
The Shennong Tripod

680
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:38,710
is said to be used by Shennong
while tasting hundreds of herbs

681
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:39,990
to make soups and decoctions.

682
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,750
If raw beans and water are put inside,

683
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,990
it automatically turns into sauce.

684
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:46,550
The Zhou family
rose to wealth with this.

685
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,360
Imagine,

686
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,750
if such a miraculous tripod

687
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:50,440
is used to make hot pot,

688
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,270
the flavor would be...

689
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,750
Miraculous.

690
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,400
Just thinking about it

691
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,880
makes me excited.

692
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,200
Your Highness,
you've tasted every delicacy.

693
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,160
There's no need to dwell on

694
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:04,710
this mere hot pot of ours.

695
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,310
Others' hot pot doesn't interest me.

696
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:08,470
But

697
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,230
if it's made by Miss Zhu herself,

698
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,880
then I must try it someday.

699
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,400
Qing.

700
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:16,400
Don't disturb others in their work.

701
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:17,710
Your Highness.

702
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:20,470
Shall we take the White Tiger now?

703
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:21,920
Yes.

704
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:22,600
Wait.

705
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:24,440
Your Highness.

706
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,600
There are still doubts about this case.

707
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,080
There is no solid evidence yet

708
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,230
to prove that
the White Tiger killed people.

709
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:29,840
Perhaps it wasn't her who killed them.

710
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:33,990
It was me.

711
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,080
I killed them.

712
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,160
No one else.

713
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,360
I confess.

714
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:39,990
Those women deserved to die.

715
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,920
I brought them into this house

716
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,440
to keep an eye on Guangping

717
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,790
and not let him leave me.

718
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:48,440
But instead, what did they do?

719
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,680
One by one, they encouraged him

720
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:51,950
to abandon me

721
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,160
and leave me.

722
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,680
They deserved to die.

723
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:56,440
I had to kill them.

724
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,160
I wanted them dead

725
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,600
so they could never see Guangping again.

726
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:00,510
Enough!

727
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:04,440
White Tiger,

728
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:06,880
your son is already grown.

729
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,230
Let him walk his own path from now on.

730
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:10,680
Go with them in peace.

731
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,160
And also,

732
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:14,840
I'll take the Shennong Tripod.

733
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,550
Take the White Tiger into custody.

734
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:19,550
Yes.

735
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,440
I'll take my leave now, Miss Zhu.

736
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,400
Farewell.

737
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:38,920
Young Master Zhou.

738
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,920
I have something to tell you.

739
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,270
Did you notice?

740
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,920
Your heart illness
is different from others.

741
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,990
It's because the beast within you
is about to awaken.

742
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,840
When it does, it will be very dangerous.

743
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:01,710
What... What are you saying?

744
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,750
Cuiyan, Yingtao.

745
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,120
Come with me to fetch the tripod.

746
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,750
This is truly terrifying.

747
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,640
I never thought Madam
was actually a White Tiger.

748
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:16,920
But, Young Master,

749
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:19,640
you don't have to worry anymore.

750
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,550
No one will be able to control you

751
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,640
or punish you anymore.
