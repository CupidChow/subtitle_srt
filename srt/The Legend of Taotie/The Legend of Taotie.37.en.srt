[Episode 37]

23
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,030
All my life,

24
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,830
I was trying to get my father's love.

25
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,440
I hated my mother.

26
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,240
But actually, I was deceived

27
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,960
and misunderstood everything.

28
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,830
A woman loved me.

29
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,830
But I didn't love her.

30
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,440
And the woman I love

31
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,000
doesn't love me.

32
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,240
Now, Zhao Ai

33
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,520
has become the wise emperor.

34
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,830
And he will forget me.

35
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,190
In the end,

36
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,720

Don't look back.

Keep your back straight.

I miss you so much.

What about Mr. Chang?

00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,320
Where is he?

47
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,830
He painted me out and left.

48
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,640
I don't know where he has gone.

49
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,790
Why didn't you stop him

50
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:36,830
from leaving?

51
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:39,000
How could I stop Mr. Chang?

52
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,550
Glad he's safe.

Tell me about it.

60
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,790
Miss Zhu, why do you ignore me?

61
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,830

68
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,160
Today, I went to Market Dong

69
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,880
and heard His Majesty is
the reincarnation of the True Dragon.

70
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,270
He's diligent and caring.

71
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,270
He also fights fiercely.

72
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:20,200
A few days ago,

73
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,790
he went to the Garuda Pass.

74
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,070
He fought bravely,
defeated Bei Di troops,

75
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,720
and recovered lost ground.

76

Keep your voice down.

00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:33,600

Don't ask.

84
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,720
Miss Zhu will be sad.

00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,480
In the Inspection Department,

117
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,470
there's a dungeon for demons.

118
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,230
Every time we caught a demon

119
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:36,590
that hurt people,

120
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,710
we put it in the dungeon.

121
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,760
It's heavily guarded.

122
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,280
Every day, archers

123
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,590
patrol regularly.

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,640
Nothing has ever gone wrong.

125
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,280

126
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,200
At the Zi hour,

127
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,080
when Yundun patrolled
for the last time,

128
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,910
he found all the imprisoned demons

129
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,640
had disappeared.

130
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,790
Disappeared?

131
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,400
Yes.

132
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,470
Is anything left behind?

133
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,550
No.

134
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,350
But I suspect

135
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,030
a strong demon did that.

136
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,200
How do you know a demon did that?

137
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,080
My Fire-Ice Arrow sensed

138
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,030
its strong smell.

139
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:14,880
Are you saying

140
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,760
when you entered the dungeon,

141
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,200
your weapon responded?

142
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,760
Yes.

143
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,280
I'm sure about that.

144
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,710
Every time a strong demon

145
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,030
approaches it,

146
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,760
it gives me a warning.

147
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,640
Strong demon?

148
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,030
Is Bai Ze back?

149
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,000
Bai Ze is

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,670
the only strong demon

151
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,910
in the mortal world.

152
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,840
It makes sense.

153
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,880
I shot him with my arrow.

154
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,080
Now, he's back.

155
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,230
That's why

156
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,790
my arrow reacted strongly.

157
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,150
If Bai Ze released those demons,

158
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,670
he must be up to something evil.

159
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,590
Be on alert

160
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,640
for random wildfires!

161
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,840
Be on alert

162
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,320
for random wildfires!

163
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,880
Mr. Lu,

164
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,840
they're all dead.

165
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,710
And all these people

166
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,200
were killed by demons.

167
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,710
The man over there...

168
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,000
The bruises all over him

169
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,030
were caused by a bird demon.

170
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,790
I guess the bird demon from our dungeon

171
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,910
killed him.

172
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,640
So,

173
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,670
the demons that killed them

174
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,710
possibly came from the dungeon

175
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,710
of our department.

176
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,030
Recently,

177
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,030
near Wuxia,

178
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,960
a dozen cases happened
where demons killed people.

179
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,080
It's confirmed

180
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,280
the escaped demons did that.

181
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,710
Now, people in town are scared.

182
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,520
What happened?

183
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:30,320
Let's go.

184
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,230
We've searched outside the town.

185
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,440
Are you sure
you haven't found their den?

186
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,000
Not yet.

187
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,150
But Mr. Lu has been

188
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,520
gathering archers from different places.

189
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,760
They'll go out of town
to hunt the demons.

190
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,790
How can Bai Ze

191
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,200
bewitch those demons?

192
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,280
In the Garuda Pass, I injured Bai Ze.

193
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,880
He's supposed to be healing himself.

194
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,910
How does he get the power

195
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:55,230
to control so many demons?

196
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:02,520
Miss Zhu,

197
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,790
we were away for a long time.

198
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,230
The dust is everywhere.

199
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,550
I'm exhausted.

200
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:14,030
But it's weird.

201
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,710
There's no dust on this painting.

202
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,440
Did Yingtao clean it?

203
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,840
Bai Ze's Supernatural Creatures.

204
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,080
Why does Bai Ze

205
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,200
suddenly have a human body?

206
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,200
Miss Zhu.

207
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,030
Look at the painting.

208
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:58,080
The demon beasts are looming

209
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,710
as if they would come alive

210
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,400
and get out of the painting.

211
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,640
Oh no.

212
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,110
What's wrong?

213
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,230
I guess Bai Ze

214
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,640
has a human body

215
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,840
by using other demons' power.

216
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,150
This painting is the key.

217
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,960
I can't let him

218
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,470
appear like that again.

219
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,880
The painting is the key?

220
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,760
Then, let's tear it up.

221
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,200
Go guard the door.

222
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,280
I'll seal it.

223
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,670
Miss Zhu, are you all right?

224
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:03,110
I'm fine.

225
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,910
Taotie.

226
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:14,080
I didn't expect

227
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,640
to see you again so soon.

228
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,080
Bai Ze,

229
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,470
it's indeed you who released the demons

230
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:22,440
and let them attack humans.

231
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,110
You stop me from sealing this painting.

232
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,280
It must be what you possess.

233
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,030
You don't know yet, huh?

234
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,280
I couldn't get my body back

235
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,960
without you, Taotie.

236
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,790
The dishes you made

237
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,910
got the mermaid,

238
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,200
the White Tiger, and the Black Bee

239
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,030
back to this painting.

240
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,670
So, this painting

241
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,960
has gathered the power of demons.

242
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,230
Or how could I appear like this?

243
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,320
Bai Ze!

244
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,280
Miss Zhu.

245
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:55,960
Cuiyan.

246
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,790
Miss Zhu.

247
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,470
Cuiyan,

248
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,640
put it away.

249
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:33,000
Savior.

250
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,280
Savior, who injured you again?

251
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,680
Go away.

252
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:41,390
Taotie did, of course.

253
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,830
Miss Zhu?

254
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,190
How about her? Is she injured?

255
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,950
I'm just worried
about the Dragon's blood.

256
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,590
I fear...

257
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:53,680
Robe.

258
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,560
Robe.

259
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,120
That's what happened.

260
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,440
Miss Zhu doesn't seem to wake up.

261
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,830
We didn't have a choice

262
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,240
but to invite you over, Mr. Lu.

263
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:13,480
Yeah.

264
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,710
Mr. Lu, what do we do?

265
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,040
We don't know where Mr. Chang is.

266
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,680
Don't worry too much.

267
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,270
I'll send my men

268
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,950
to look for Mr. Chang.

269
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,710
Your top priority

270
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,920
is to take care of Miss Zhu.

271
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,630
Miss Zhu.

272
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,950
Mr. Lu.

273
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,070
Mr. Lu,

274
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,320
it's Bai Ze.

275
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,590
Bai Ze?

276
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,510
He's really hiding near Wuxia.

277
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,630
And recently,

278
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,680
demons have been killing people.

279
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,480
Bai Ze must be behind all this.

280
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,440
Luckily, you injured him

281
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,040
and bought us some time

282
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,120
to track him.

283
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,830
He gathered the demons

284
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,270
and stole my painting.

285
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,000
It must have something
to do with the Lotus Tower.

286
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,590
I've sealed the painting.

287
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,830
For a time,

288
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,920
he will be too weak

289
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,800
to come out.

290
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,510
If you find him,

291
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,870
let me know immediately.

292
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,080
I get it.

293
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:12,720
Miss Zhu,

294
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,080
take some rest and get better.

295
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,080
Miss Zhu,

296
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,320
do exactly what Mr. Lu says

297
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,320
and get some rest.

298
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,390
We'll take care of Bai Ze.

299
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,960
That's right, Miss Zhu.

300
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,510
You freaked us out.

301
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,840
Don't make a big fuss over it.

302
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,750
Rest assured.

303
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,750
I know how to recover.

304
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,390
How?

305
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,560
How, Miss Zhu?

306
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,320
Well...

307
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,630
I need to eat the Life's Flavors Dish.

308
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,560
Life's Flavors Dish?

309
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,960
Does it mean a lot of dishes

310
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,680
or a lot of flavors?

311
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,870
What's the difference?

312
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,870
Miss Zhu,

313
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,270
is Cuiyan right?

314
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,990
Cuiyan not only does better martial arts.

315
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,270
She's cleverer, too.

316
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:54,960
That's great.

317
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,840
Looks like our restaurant

318
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,440
will be open soon.

319
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,440
Cuiyan and I should get prepared.

320
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,200
In this case,

321
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,990
Miss Zhu, take some rest.

322
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,870
I should go.

323
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:06,440
Bye.

324
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:07,600
Cuiyan, Yingtao,

325
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,510
walk him out.

326
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,320
Everybody,

327
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,040
Miss Zhu

328
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,600
has been feeling unwell.

329
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,600
When she recovers,

330
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,680
I'll tell you to come for the meals.

331
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,750
No need.

332
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,440
I've recovered.

333
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,320
Miss Zhu.

334
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,110
Miss Zhu is out.

335
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,800
Dear guests,

336
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,600
I caught a cold the other day

337
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,440
and didn't feel very well.

338
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,080
But now, I'm all right.

339
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,390
My restaurant will be open tomorrow.

340
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,470
Awesome.

341
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,440
What I experienced on my trip

342
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,440
has impressed me a lot.

343
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,600
I'm going to blend all these flavors

344
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,390
into a new dish.

345
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,600
I'll make the Life's Flavors Dish

346
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,510
for people in Wuxia.

347
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,150
- Great.
- Nice.

348
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,840
Miss Zhu, you'll make a new dish.

349
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:25,200
This is awesome.

350
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,390
We've been waiting

351
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,080
and it will finally pay off.

352
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:29,870
By then,

353
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:32,200
please come and enjoy it.

354
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:34,990
This is great.

355
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,390
I'll come and line up tomorrow.

356
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,110
Miss Zhu, hope you will be open soon.

357
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,800
We want to taste the new dish.

358
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,920
That's right.

359
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,630
Let's go.

360
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,560
- Miss Zhu.
- Miss Zhu.

361
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,720
How about you take a few more days off?

362
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,680
Don't rush

363
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,200
to make the new dish.

364
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:05,870
That's right.

365
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,870
I want to make a new dish

366
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,350
and cover up my real condition.

367
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,600
If Bai Ze knows I don't show up,

368
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,630
he'll try to attack me again.

369
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,150
I can't let him know
how I really feel now.

370
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,720
But Miss Zhu, you're so weak.

371
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,750
How can you cook?

372
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,600
It's all right. When I cook,

373
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,800
I'll recover faster.

374
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,680
When this dish is done,

375
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,750
I'll recover.

376
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,470
Let's go.

377
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,630
It's so heavy.

378
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,440
Cuiyan, give me a hand.

379
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:11,870
Cheers.

380
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,110
Here.

381
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,960
Miss Zhu cooks so well.

382
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:30,680
Cuiyan, Yingtao.

383
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,110
Coming.

384
00:22:32,110 --> 00:22:32,630
Be right there.

385
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,390
Taotie,

386
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,320
I can't kill you.

387
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,990
But I know how to deal with you.

388
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,630
You're getting much better.

389
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,510
I think you'll recover soon.

390
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,560
I have to thank you.

391
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,200
You understood what I meant

392
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,600
and painted me out
with your brush and robe.

393
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:09,720
But anyway,

394
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:12,150
I can only go out for a short time.

395
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,870
I can't do something personally.

396
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,470
Tell me what to do.

397
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,040
You know the beast language.

398
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,270
Demon beasts trust you, too.

399
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,440
So, please help me

400
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,350
summon all the demons to Wuxia.

401
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,200
When I recover, I plan

402
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,470
to send them home.

403
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,870
Send them home?

404
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,600
You've got the Dragon's blood?

405
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,870
Don't ask.

406
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,390
The eldest son should be in charge.

407
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,320
The second son isn't qualified.

408
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,440
Sister-in-law,

409
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,960
you're wrong.

410
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,200
The eldest son needs

411
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,680
to have a son

412
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,200
before he takes charge.

413
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,680
It's been years.

414
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,080
You haven't had one single child.

415
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,630
What do you mean?

416
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,080
Don't you get it?

417
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,350
Mind your attitude!

418
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,680
Shut up, both of you.

419
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,800
Can't you stop when eating?

420
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,440
So, money can't buy happiness.

421
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:30,720
I'm not wrong.

422
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,350
Yingtao.

423
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,150
Old Lady,

424
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,990
this is the Family Harmony you ordered.

425
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,350
Miss Zhu,

426
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,350
thank you.

427
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,320
This old lady said
her family used to be poor.

428
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,080
At every festival,

429
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,320
she gathered some ingredients

430
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,720
and stewed them together.

431
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,510
They enjoyed the taste of happiness.

432
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,990
Try it, everybody.

433
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:06,110
Does it taste as happy as before?

434
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,510
You call this simmering dish

435
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:11,750
the Family Harmony?

436
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,870
Eat it, all of you.

437
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:15,920
Come on.

438
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,560
It's indeed the taste
of happiness like before.

439
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,230
My children,

440
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,350
it tastes so good.

441
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,720
If one single ingredient was missing,

442
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,510
it wouldn't be so good.

443
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,630
Just like our family.

444
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:09,350
If a family member is missing,

445
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,560
our family

446
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,600
won't be complete.

447
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,870
You must remember.

448
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,870
Only a harmonious family
will always prosper.

449
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,870
Mother.

450
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,750
Good girls.

451
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,600
Mother, it's my fault.

452
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,990
I was wrong.

453
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,560
I'm sorry.

454
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,840
It's my fault.

455
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,510
Brother.

456
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,230
It's my fault.

457
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:41,630
This is great.

458
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:44,110
Great.

459
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,470
Let's eat.

460
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,080
Let's continue.

461
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:48,750
Come on.

462
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,320
Here. Eat it.

463
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,150
Come on.

464
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,040
The Spicy Soup is served.

465
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,870
What smells so great?

466
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,990
- So good.
- It smells great.

467
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,440
Yeah.

468
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,040
Indeed.

469
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,320
What's that?

470
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,040
Miss Zhu,

471
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,560
what did you call this soup?

472
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,630
The Spicy Soup.

473
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,510
It smells great.

474
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,080
Can we have some?

475
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:20,840
Sorry.

476
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,750
This is the last bowl.

477
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,080
Can we taste some?

478
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,600
No.

479
00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:25,680
- Just one bite.
- Just one bite.

480
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,600
We'll come tomorrow.

481
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,080
We will.

482
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:34,630
Enjoy it, Miss.

483
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,600
With one more spice

484
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,510
in this soup,

485
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,040
it may taste better.

486
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,870
Miss,

487
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,350
what is it, then?

488
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,680
Sea salt.

489
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,350
Sea salt comes from the seawater.

490
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,350
It's indeed tastier than normal salt.

491
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,840
It can make the soup tasty

492
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:05,350
and preserve the food's original taste.

493
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,200
Are you also a famous chef?

494
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,040
I'm not good at cooking.

495
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,600
It's just how my folks cook.

496
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,320
You flatter me.

497
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,720
Do you have time

498
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,270
to stay and taste other dishes?

499
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:25,350
Thank you, Miss.

500
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,110
But I came here

501
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,440
to see my brother.

502
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:31,440
He's said to be the accountant here.

503
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,200
So, did you see him?

504
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,440
You're here for Chang Qing?

505
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,350
Yes.

506
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,510
You're Xiaoli?

507
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,870
Miss,

508
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,320
is my brother here?

509
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,680
Can you get him out?

510
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,960
Your brother...

511
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,630
He isn't here now.

512
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,350
Then,

513
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:50,960
where is he?

514
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,440
We don't know

515
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,600
where he is.

516
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:55,870
But I believe he will come back.

517
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,870
Please stay here, Xiaoli.

518
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,600
Qing...

519
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:01,870
Chang Qing

520
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,350
will come back.

521
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,560
Thank you, then.

522
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,080
But if I stay here,

523
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,350
it would be too much trouble.

524
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,720
Now, you need an accountant.

525
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,350
How about I work for you?

526
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:13,720
You can also do the accounting?

527
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,350
I'm not as wise as my brother.

528
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,510
But yes, I can.

529
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,230
If you don't mind,

530
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:19,630
you can work here.

531
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:23,630
Xiaoli, you do have

532
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:25,600
Mr. Chang's eyes.

533
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,510
It's too cold out there.

534
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,510
I don't want to go out.

535
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:44,350
We have to.

536
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,390
Miss Zhu wants some ingredients.

537
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,560
We have to get them.

538
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,960
What if the wind blows me away?

539
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,230
I have a plan.

540
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,440
This basket is very heavy.

541
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,040
You carry it

542
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,510
and won't be blown away.

543
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,110
Right.

544
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,200
Hey, girls.

545
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,750
Why haven't you gone out yet?

546
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,750
If my ingredients aren't ready,

547
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,110
I can't cook tomorrow.

548
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,230
Hurry up.

549
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:11,990
Let's go.

550
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,080
Mr. Lu?

551
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,200
Mr. Lu.

552
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,270
Miss Zhu.

553
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
What have you got?

554
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,600
I received an urgent message.

555
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,110
There was a big wave in the sea today

556
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,470
and it flooded a nearby village.

557
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:33,720
So far,

558
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,960
over 20 houses have been damaged.

559
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,870
Over 30 dead bodies have been salvaged.

560
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,600
Oh,

561
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:39,960
many survivors

562
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,390
saw some mermen come ashore.

563
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,630
Mermen?

564
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,040
Mermen?

565
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,800
Why did they come ashore for no reason?

566
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:46,870
As soon as I got the message,

567
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,040
I came over there.

568
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,390
I don't know the details.

569
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:52,350
The mermen came ashore.

570
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:54,150
I can't figure it out

571
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:55,350
within a short time.

572
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,840
Theoretically, Bai Ze

573
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,800
can't maintain his body for a long time.

574
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,110
He can't make such a big scene.

575
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,200
If Bai Ze isn't involved,

576
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,630
that'll be much easier.

577
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:08,040
I'll send some archers to check it.

578
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,270
If they find something,

579
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,200
I'll let you know.

580
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,230
Goodbye.

581
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,150
Mermen.

582
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:19,720
Girls.

583
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:21,870
Just go.

584
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,560
Let's go.

585
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,320
The game has started.

586
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,230
This time,

587
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,040
I'll see how you can win.

588
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,040
Miss Zhu.

589
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,600
Miss Zhu.

590
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,110
What's attracting your attention?

591
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,350
I've been calling you.

592
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,510
You have?

593
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,230
Are you watching Miss Xiaoli
do the accounting?

594
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,320
Do you not trust her?

595
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,870
Don't be ridiculous.

596
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,720
I just think when she pays attention,

597
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,350
she looks so much like her brother.

598
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:17,110
I wonder how Qing is doing.

599
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,390
So, you miss Mr. Chang.

600
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,150
You're quite nagging.

601
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:26,200
Cuiyan.

602
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:28,080
Think about it.

603
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,230
If I splash you

604
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,720
with the tea,

605
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,750
what will happen?

606
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:34,800
I...

607
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,270
I'll go clean the house.

608
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,440
Qing,

609
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,680
I don't know when you'll forgive me.

610
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,510
But don't worry.

611
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,080
I'll take good care of your sister.

612
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:09,470
Miss Zhu.

613
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,440
Miss Zhu?

614
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:13,470
Is that you?

615
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,030
Miss Xiaoli?

616
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,310
Why is it you?

617
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:23,710
It was blowing really hard.

618
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,840
I saw the window in Zhu's room

619
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,880
was blown open.

620
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,510
So, I got in to close it.

621
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:36,470
This window is never open.

622
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,080
Cuiyan, Miss Xiaoli,

623
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:45,880
time for dinner.

624
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,680
The brine duck isn't too greasy.

625
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:01,990
It tastes a bit sweet.

626
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:03,990
Tasty, isn't it?

627
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,360
Try this.

628
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,550
Miss Zhu is a great chef.

629
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,680
She makes extraordinary dishes.

630
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,990
These days,

631
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,840
I've heard many diners

632
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,270
talk about Zhu's cooking skills.

633
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,640
They mentioned many fancy dishes,

634
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,120
especially the Bee Soup.

635
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,640
It's said to be really tasty.

636
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:23,550
What's more,

637
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,990
it tastes crispy and pungent.

638
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,270
I'm quite curious.

639
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,120
In this case,

640
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,710
I can make it for you.

641
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,120
Thank you, Zhu.

642
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,160
Luckily, when I met Yuan
at the frontier,

643
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,550
I got some bee venom from him.

644
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:38,270
Just a few minutes.

645
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,840
Miss Zhu is really weird.

646
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,790
As if she's possessed.

647
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,640
She does whatever Xiaoli says.

648
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,270
Miss Zhu.

649
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:05,950
What are you doing?

650
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:07,790
I've designed a new dish.

651
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,080
Bee Soup.

652
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,080
I was inspired by the black bee.

653
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,230
Isn't it just wonton?

654
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,510
It's not wonton.

655
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:17,030
It's much smaller.

656
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,880
Doesn't it look like the black bee?

657
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:23,640
Qing,

658
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,790
is it a coincidence

659
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,550
that your sister came at this time?

660
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:30,360
Here.

661
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,440
Xiaoli, try it.

662
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,470
Thank you, Zhu.

663
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,120
Why...?

664
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,230
Why does it taste pungent?

665
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:47,600
This is

666
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,640
what Miss Zhu has designed.

667
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,400
This pungent taste

668
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,510
comes from the black bee's venom.

669
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,160
It tastes really fancy.

670
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:58,400
No wonder diners can't forget it.

671
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,200
Of course.

672
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,640
The venom comes from the king bee.

673
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,710
It's certainly the best.

674
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,440
Then...

675
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,400
It must be precious.

676
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,950
I won't say it, then.

677
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,440
Xiaoli, what were you about to say?

678
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,080
I wanted to ask you

679
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,230
for some bee venom

680
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,360
to cure the beggars with a rash.

681
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,840
But it's too precious.

682
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,680
I'll try something else.

683
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,440
When she came out of Miss Zhu's room,

684
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,360
I thought it was strange.

685
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,990
Now, she wants the bee venom.

686
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,270
Miss Xiaoli, you're so kind.

687
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,440
You even want to help the beggars.

688
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,120
Those beggars

689
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,640
can't even afford food,

690
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:36,470
let alone see a doctor.

691
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,840
So, I'm thinking

692
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,790
if they can be cured

693
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,680
without spending any money.

694
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,080
The bee venom is highly toxic.

695
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,360
Even the slightest lapse

696
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,840
may get them killed.

697
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,680
Can it really cure the rash?

698
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,600
Xiaoli is right.

699
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,160
The bee venom is very effective

700
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,270
for all kinds of rash.

701
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,230
Not to mention the black bee's venom.

702
00:37:58,990 --> 00:37:59,750
Then, Miss Zhu,

703
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,790
let's give Miss Xiaoli

704
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,710
a bit more bee venom.

705
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:05,600
We don't have too much.

706
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,920
And Miss Zhu needs it for the dish.

707
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:10,920
Then, Zhu,

708
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,080
don't be embarrassed.

709
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,360
I'll try something else.

710
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,160
Xiaoli,

711
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,120
you can take the bee venom.

712
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,600
Glad you care for people.

713
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:19,880
Really?

714
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,920
Thank you, Zhu.

715
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:21,710
Let's go.

716
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,270
You shouldn't have said that much.

717
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:57,710
Miss Zhu,

718
00:38:58,360 --> 00:38:59,640
why are you up so early?

719
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,640
Demons have been running wild in Wuxia.

720
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,790
On Market Dong,

721
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:10,640
no demon beasts are sold.

722
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,080
Miss Zhu,

723
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,200
didn't you promise Mr. Chang
you wouldn't eat demons?

724
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,400
But when he's away,

725
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,440
you want to eat them.

726
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,200
Who said that?

727
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:21,030
I'll just buy some and watch them.

728
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,310
Miss Zhu,

729
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,920
no demon beasts are sold.

730
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,400
But there are all kinds

731
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,510
of mortal ingredients.

732
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:27,470
Look.

733
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,200
The shopkeeper recommended

734
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:30,990
the matsutake and the agaric.

735
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,840
They're rare, too.

736
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,600
There are ordinary ingredients.

737
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,310
I won't waste

738
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,160
my cooking skills on them.

739
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,160
Ladies,

740
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,230
what's going on here?

741
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:51,840
Miss Xiaoli,

742
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,440
Miss Zhu wants to cook.

743
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,750
But now, no demon beasts

744
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,120
are sold on the market.

745
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,840
This is all we could find.

746
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,790
Miss Zhu used to make

747
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:07,200
very rare dishes.

748
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,120
Now, these ingredients

749
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:10,680
are really normal.

750
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,080
Xiaoli is new here.

751
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,470
But she knows
I'm picky about ingredients.

752
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,080
The two of you

753
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,790
only find excuses.

754
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,680
But Zhu,

755
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,310
common people

756
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,950
eat these vegetables.

757
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:32,120
If you can make them

758
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,790
into rare dishes,

759
00:40:34,310 --> 00:40:36,120
won't they prove your great skill?

760
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,310
That's right, Miss Zhu.

761
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,950
How about we make a hotpot with them?

762
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,400
In winter, isn't that great

763
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,160
to have a hotpot together?

764
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,750
Hotpot?

765
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,120
Good idea.

766
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,510
How about I make a new dish

767
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,230
with them?

768
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,230
Awesome.

769
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:02,680
The hotpot Miss Zhu makes
will be delicious.

770
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,360
Right, Cuiyan?

771
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,360
Can we have the hotpot?

772
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,470
All right.

773
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:18,440
Go out and put up a notice.

774
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,080
Tell people in Wuxia.

775
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,510
In three days,

776
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:24,160
we'll hold a taste test.

777
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,950
Then, we'll be busy again.

778
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,950
The taste test of Tianxiang Restaurant
has started.

779
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:47,400
Let's go and see.

780
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,200
Oh, the taste test.

781
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:48,510
Come on.

782
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,440
Let's go take a look.

783
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,320
[Taste Test]

784
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,510
There she is.

785
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,470
At last.

786
00:41:59,200 --> 00:41:59,920
Everybody,

787
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:01,880
it's the twelfth month.

788
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,600
And it's really cold.

789
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,600
Miss Zhu

790
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,950
invites all homeless guys in Wuxia

791
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,270
to enter our restaurant first.

792
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,990
Why are they here?

793
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,120
Miss Zhu is doing

794
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,510
a big act of kindness.

795
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,950
Kindness, indeed.

796
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,710
Miss Zhu is so kind.

797
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,200
Impressive.

798
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,360
She's so nice.

799
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:45,990
Miss Zhu,

800
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:47,160
it's really kind of you.

801
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,160
Thank you, Miss Zhu.

802
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,230
Thank you, Miss Zhu.

803
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,310
You're so kind.

804
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,710
Thank you, Miss Zhu.

805
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,200
Thanks, Miss Zhu.

806
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:54,990
Take your seats.

807
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,400
It's the springwater

808
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,550
from the cliff in Cangwu Mountain

809
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:10,640
twenty li away from Wuxia.

810
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,120
It was delivered yesterday

811
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,920
and kept in a fresh bamboo vessel.

812
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,600
I need such sweet water

813
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,160
for a great dish.

814
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:31,230
The Shennong Tripod

815
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,920
is a precious pot.

816
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,030
Mr. Shennong used it
when tasting the herbs.

817
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:38,950
Common people usually use herbs

818
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,640
as the spice in a hotpot

819
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,790
for more nutrition.

820
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:44,440
The Shennong Tripod

821
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,950
works better on spleen strengthening.

822
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,360
This is the most tender part of the steak.

823
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,920
The thickness of it

824
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,550
decides how it will taste.

825
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:15,880
If it's too thick, it won't cook well

826
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,880
and it'll be hard to chew.

827
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:19,080
If it's too thin, it'll be gone in water

828
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:20,080
and melt in the mouth.

829
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,160
It won't be tasty.
