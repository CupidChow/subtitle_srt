is the best proof of human's arrogance.

But the most marvelous part

61
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,790
is what Xiaoli gave you.

Her blood.

63
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,440
It's suspicion.

64

You mentioned Xiaoli's blood.

Why do you think she attacked you?

69
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,480
You thought she foolishly believed

She isn't downstairs.

192
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,910
What's the scent?

193
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,640
She's here.

194
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,910
She is here.

195
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,320
She must be here.

196
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,230
Qing,

197
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,520
the Five Venoms Seal.

198
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,200
Bai Ze was here.

199
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,550
The Five Venoms Seal?

200
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:43,640
Bai Ze was here.

201
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,400
Qing.

202
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,320
Wait for me.

203
00:11:59,200 --> 00:11:59,960
I'll be back.

204
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,320
Qing.

205
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,110
Cuiyan,

206
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,840
where do you think Miss Zhu has gone?

207
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,550
Mr. Chang isn't here, either.

208
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,230
Our restaurant is so dreary.

209
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,710
Cuiyan,

210
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,670
say something.

211
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,200
Otherwise,

212
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,550
I want to kill myself in the tank.

213
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,760
Yingtao.

214
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,150
Why do I think

215
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,110
Miss Zhu is just around us?

216
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:52,470
Cuiyan,

217
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,110
don't scare me.

218
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,280
If Miss Zhu is around us,

219
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,910
we should be able to see her.

220
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:58,520
Right?

221
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,280
All the thoughts

222
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,790
and all the scenes

223
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,880
are just illusory.

224
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,550
If I clear my mind

225
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,520
and get rid of them,

226
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,550
maybe I can...

227
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,910
Clear my mind.

228
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,030
I still think

229
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,280
Miss Zhu is around us.

230
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,080
Savior,

231
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,400
yesterday, you said you avenged Xiaoli.

232
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,670
What do you mean?

233
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
Why can't I

234
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,670
find Taotie anywhere?

235
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,110
She's stuck in the Five Venoms Seal.

236
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,440
Now, she's transparent.

237
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,230
Of course, you can't see her.

238
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,080
The Five Venoms Seal?

239
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,150
What is that?

240
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,880
Greed, resentment, obsession,

241
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,710
tardiness, and suspicion.

242
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,280
The origin of all the pain in the world.

243
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,670
She'll be transparent

244
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,440
and go through all sorts of pain

245
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,960
until she melts into blood

246
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,760
and totally disappears.

247
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,440
How much longer can she live?

248
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,150
Be patient and wait.

249
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,320
Why are you so anxious?

250
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,670
Are you really anxious

251
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,150
or are you eager to save her?

252
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,440
I want to get the Dragon's blood soon

253
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,670
and open the Portal

254
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,200
in case of more trouble.

255
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,200
But savior,

256
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,640
don't you fear she'll run away?

257
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,960
She can't leave Tianxiang Restaurant.

258
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,080
If she leaves,

259
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:52,760
she'll only die sooner.

260
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,790
What does it mean?

261
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,880
I don't understand.

262
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,280
She should avoid people.

263
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,110
Once she leaves Tianxiang Restaurant,

264
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:04,910
she'll meet people

265
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:08,960
and their emotions will be amplified

266
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,030
to enhance the Five Venoms Seal.

267
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,670
Then, she'll die sooner.

268
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:18,880
Savior, you had

269
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,150
such a marvelous plan.

270
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,320
I'm no match for you.

271
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,960
Everybody suffers.

272
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:27,400
In this world,

273
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:30,470
everybody is upset about something

274
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,960
and he can't get rid of it.

275
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,760
Ordinary people can't stand it.

276
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,280
Let alone she'll absorb

277
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,030
everyone's pain.

278
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,760
All those emotions she receives

279
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,350
will be amplified a thousand times.

280
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,280
She'll be like living in hell.

281
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,110
Taotie,

282
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:52,320
hope you'll enjoy it.

283
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,910
It's such a great seal.

284
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,110
Even Taotie can be stuck in it.

285
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,320
Is there no way

286
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,760
to inactivate it?

287
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,640
What?

288
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,910
You're curious?

289
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,840
I just fear there may be a flaw.

290
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,280
Rest assured.

291
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:22,320
This time,

292
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,670
you don't need to worry.

293
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,590
Even if you want to save her,

294
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,110
that will be impossible.

295
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,470
The only antidote

296
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,840
is the Form-Revealing Herb

297
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,200
that grows in the valley.

298
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,000
It's sweet and cold

299
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,200
that can stabilize and reveal the soul.

300
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,710
It's hard to pick.

301
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,150
And she can't leave her restaurant.

302
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,080
So, she won't get it.

303
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,790
I can forgive you
for what you did before.

304
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:53,400
From now on, you must join me.

305
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,550
I need you to do something.

306
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,110
You're a human,

307
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:59,910
but you know the beast language.

308
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,080
Demon beasts trust you.

309
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,520
So, you will

310
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,310
call on them to help me.

311
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,920
By then,

312
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,190
we'll have a powerful force

313
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,230
to fight against humans.

314
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,400
But when the Portal is open,

315
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,590
they can go home.

316
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,110
Isn't that what we want?

317
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:20,190
Why do we start a war

318
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,430
between humans and demons?

319
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,710
The coming of demons in the mortal world

320
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,800
seems to be accidental,

321
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,040
but turns out to be inevitable.

322
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,640
If they simply go back home,

323
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,830
the past centuries will be meaningless.

324
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,880
Since they're in the mortal world,

325
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,590
why can't they turn this world

326
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,400
into their beautiful homeland?

327
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,560
So, we don't open the Portal

328
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,070
to make demon beasts disappear,

329
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,040
but to punish

330
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,830
those humans

331
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,640
who are immersed in infinite desire.

332
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,400
We'll turn this prosperous world

333
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,590
into an ideal home for demons.

334
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,400
That's the real meaning

335
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,950
of opening the Portal.

336
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,270
Let it go.

337
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,990
Let go of everything.

338
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,560
As long as you desert them,

339
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,320
all the emotions of greed and resentment

340
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,600
won't hurt you.

341
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,150
When someone lives,

342
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,150
how can he be emotionless?

343
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,080
Miss Zhu,

344
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,800
did you quarrel with Mr. Chang again?

345
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,390
Are you hungry?

346
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,350
Eat something.

347
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,630
Miss Zhu, you're finally back.

348
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,230
When you were away, we missed you.

349
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,920
Miss Zhu,

350
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,720
don't leave me.

351
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,560
Don't leave me.

352
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,270
Qing.

353
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,560
I still can't let go of this world.

354
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,150
He'll meditate for an hour.

355
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:07,600
He won't notice I'm gone.

356
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,350
But within such a short time,

357
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,510
I can't return to Tianxiang Restaurant.

358
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,560
Other people can't

359
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,600
talk to Miss Zhu.

360
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,080
Time is running out.

361
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,320
What do I do?

362
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,750
Where are you going?

363
00:20:49,870 --> 00:20:50,920
To get some fresh air.

364
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,150
Don't go too far.

365
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Before Taotie melts into blood,

366
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,600
you can't stay away from me.

367
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,720
Besides,

368
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,040
demon beasts are coming here.

369
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,960
It's dangerous out there.

370
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,200
All right.

371
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,990
He forgave me.

372
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,150
But he stays vigilant.

373
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,270
What can I do?

374
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,840
Demon beasts are gathering here.

375
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,080
Demon beasts.

376
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,110
Black bees.

377
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:31,840
Black bees.

378
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:37,920
Black bees,

379
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,630
I know your king, Yuan.

380
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,390
Ask him to send a message

381
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,350
to Miss Zhu.

382
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,630
Form-Revealing Herb.

383
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,320
Only this herb

384
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,560
can inactivate the Five Venoms Seal.

385
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:48,920
Quickly.

386
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,990
You have to be quick.

387
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,600
Where's Xu Ruoxu?

388
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,600
Miss Zhu,

389
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,390
I can't see you with my compound eyes

390
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,920
unless I'm the black bee.

391
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,390
Ruoxu is on his way.

392
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,840
The Form-Revealing Herb?

393
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,630
Did Qing send you?

394
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:41,800
A form-revealing herb in the valley.

395
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,390
I get it.

396
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,150
Thank you, Yuan.

397
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,040
Form-Revealing Herb.

398
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,510
I'll go get it.

399
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,390
I've been so bored these days.

400
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,630
Anyway,

401
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,320
I don't have a choice.

402
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,630
I have to try it.

403
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,600
Can you lend me

404
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,560
your whip?

405
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,630
But I can't get it

406
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,390
unless I leave my restaurant.

407
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,920
She betrayed me.

408
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:40,600
Mother.

409
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,200
These are lies.

410
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,200
Mother, come back.

411
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,960
More taxes are required.

412
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,720
How can I support my family?

413
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,560
Father, I want this.

414
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,510
I just want it.

415
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,440
How dare you cure me?

416
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,720
I didn't do that!

417
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,270
I'll fight it out with you!

418
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,320
But you left me.

419
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,270
Why? Why?

420
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,230
I won't live anymore!

421
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,350
I didn't do that.

422
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,470
I'll kill you!

423
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,680
You seldom come home.

424
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,040
We've been married for years.

425
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,560
Others all have obedient children.

426
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,350
Why do I have bad sons?

427
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,230
I passed the Imperial Exam!

428
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,720
I passed it!

429
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,350
I'm going out of town.

430
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:34,560
I have to go out.

431
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,990
I wonder how Miss Zhu is doing.

432
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,320
The legendary Form-Revealing Herb

433
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,040
scrunches up

434
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,750
to protect itself
by pretending to wither.

435
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:45,960
Even one single drop of water

436
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:48,800
will bring it back to life.

437
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,110
Water.

438
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,350
Water.

439
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,440
Qing.

440
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:15,960
Can we

441
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,320
never see each other again?

442
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:39,720
Why does my heart hurt so much?

443
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,200
Qing,

444
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,470
you're going to be fine.

445
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,200
Take care.

446
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,720
I'm so lucky.

447
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,470
Looks like Zhu Chengbi

448
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,750
is going to die.

449
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,230
Chengbi.

450
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:01,800
Chengbi.

451
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,080
Hang in there, Chengbi.

452
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,350
I can't die.

453
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,510
Qing is waiting for me.

454
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,470
He's waiting for me.

455
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,350
Let go of this.

456
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,110
Everything in this world

457
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:07,230
is just illusory.

458
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,990
It's the externalization
of the five senses.

459
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,200
Let it go

460
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,200
and all the pain will be gone.

461
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,350
All the emotions in this world

462
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,920
aren't worth staying for.

463
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,440
As long as you remain calm,

464
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,750
you won't be scared of anything.

465
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,870
As long as you desert them,

466
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,680
all these emotions

467
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,990
can't hurt you.

468
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,350
Oh no.

469
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,150
Something's wrong with Taotie's seal.

470
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:28,440
Taotie,

471
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,200
you can't go.

472
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,390
I'm surprised.

473
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,800
The foolish guy Chang Qing

474
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,270
is so infatuated with you.

475
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,150
Even the sacrifice of Xiaoli

476
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:38,320
didn't deceive him.

477
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,470
He foolishly

478
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,630
stayed by my side and flattered me,

479
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,510
just to save your life.

480
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,920
Bai Ze,

481
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,350
you racked your brains

482
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,200
to finally think of killing me
with the Seal.

483
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,470
But you didn't expect me

484
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,560
to find the Form-Revealing Herb, huh?

485
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:31,630
Taotie,

486
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,510
we've been fighting for centuries.

487
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,230
You should know me.

488
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,560
If the Herb could really work,

489
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,920
would I tell Chang Qing?

490
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,470
Bai Ze,

491
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:43,960
what do you mean?

492
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,270
You look so naive and cute.

493
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,040
But you never know.

494
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,680
The Form-Revealing Herb

495
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,470
can only reveal your body.

496
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,150
It can't inactive the Five Venoms Seal.

497
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,960
When you get your body back,

498
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,720
the Dragon's blood will
blend into your body.

499
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,750
That's why I told Chang Qing

500
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,200
about this herb.

501
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,750
When the Dragon's blood
completely blends into you,

502
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,710
you'll lose control of your body.

503
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,320
You'll be the messenger
to summon the Black Qilin King

504
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,270
and my best puppet.

505
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,710
Miss Zhu!

506
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,710
Miss Zhu.

507
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,230
Qing.

508
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,270
Miss Zhu.

509
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,040
Miss Zhu.

510
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:52,880
Taotie,

511
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:53,910
I expect

512
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,270
to see you open the Portal personally.

513
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:00,750
I'm so useless.

514
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,230
Before Yuan told us,

515
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,950
we didn't know

516
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:04,710
Miss Zhu was just around us.

517
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,120
She must have been miserable all alone.

518
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,360
I'm to blame, too.

519
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,320
I should have looked more carefully.

520
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,360
Miss Cuiyan,

521
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,360
don't blame yourself.

522
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,670
Miss Zhu was stuck in Bai Ze's Seal.

523
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:15,950
Nobody could see her

524
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,430
without the bee's compound eyes.

525
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,910
Luckily, Mr. Chang saw through all this.

526
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,840
But it's been days.

527
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,800
Why haven't we heard from them?

528
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,710
Cuiyan, Yingtao!

529
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,360
Mr. Chang?

530
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,360
- Mr. Chang.
- Miss Zhu.

531
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,990
Miss Zhu.

532
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,190
- Miss Zhu.
- What happened?

533
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,750
Take out all the nutritious ingredients.

534
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,160
Hurry.

535
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,160
Let's go.

536
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:58,670
Chengbi.

537
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,120
Qing.

538
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:03,470
Chengbi.

539
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,270
I'm innocent, Qing.

540
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,160
- Chengbi.
- Qing.

541
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,270
I didn't kill Xiaoli.

542
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,880
I didn't kill her, Qing.

543
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:10,950
I know.

544
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,160
I know everything.

545
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:13,800
You told me

546
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,640
you would only cook with your knife.

547
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,230
You wouldn't do anything else with it.

548
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,360
So, you wouldn't kill Xiaoli with it.

549
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,840
I was so angry that I misunderstood you.

550
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,470
We stayed together for a long time,

551
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,270
but I forgot your habits.

552
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,360
Later, I got to know

553
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,190
Xiaoli was bewitched

554
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,160
by Bai Ze.

555
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:39,400
She was just like the old me

556
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,400
who couldn't tell right from wrong.

557
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,710
She even lost her life.

558
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:47,750
Qing,

559
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,910
she's as kind as you.

560
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,560
You're always her best brother.

561
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,430
Bai Ze is to blame for everything.

562
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,840
Don't blame yourself.

563
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,510
These days, I almost thought

564
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:10,840
I could never see you again.

565
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,670
It won't happen.

566
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:15,910
I'm always here.

567
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,990
I'm always by your side.

568
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,160
Luckily, Bai Ze trusted me

569
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,040
and told me about the Form-Revealing Herb.

570
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,640
Is the seal inactivated?

571
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,040
Now, my body is revealed.

572
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,670
It means I'm all right.

573
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,670
Don't worry about me.

574
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:43,670
Chengbi.

575
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:45,670
I'm sorry

576
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:46,950
for what you suffered.

577
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:53,560
Nothing will hurt us anymore.

578
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,670
We won't leave each other.

579
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,040
We won't.

580
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,950
I always trust you.

581
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,040
I know

582
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,800
you always trust me, too.

583
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,400
[Inspection Department]

584
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,270
With the help of Yuan,

585
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,910
we got Miss Qu Yan back.

586
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,950
She was scared, though.

587
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,160
She must be taken good care of.

588
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,670
Before, she was missing

589
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,320
due to our negligence.

590
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,800
Mr. Chang is taking care of Miss Zhu.

591
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,270
When Mr. Lu is back,

592
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,800
Mr. Chang will visit him and apologize.

593
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,910
Please tell Mr. Lu about it.

594
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:14,470
Yan.

595
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:18,640
You had tough days.

596
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:20,040
Let's go.

597
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,160
What's wrong with Mr. Lu?

598
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:22,990
I don't know.

599
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,120
Mr. Lu,

600
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:28,120
I should go back.

601
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:35,320
Yan,

602
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,800
are you injured?

603
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,910
I won't leave you anymore.

604
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,160
What do you want?

605
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:58,950
Is Miss Zhu a demon?

606
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,950
Ask her to leave Wuxia.

607
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,360
Or your restaurant can't be open again!

608
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:04,270
Smash it!

609
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:05,640
Smash!

610
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,120
What are you doing?

611
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:06,560
Stop.

612
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,560
Miss Zhu.

613
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,270
Are you Taotie?

614
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,360
Taotie.

615
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:21,510
Taotie.

616
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:26,840
Go.

617
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,080
Run!

618
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,670
Demon!

619
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:39,080
What happened?

620
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,360
When you were away, some people said

621
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:42,670
Miss Zhu was a demon

622
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:43,880
and they tried to smash our restaurant.

623
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,040
Miss Zhu was so angry

624
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,120
that she transformed.

625
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:01,880
Miss Zhu.

626
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,950
Why can't I take it out?

627
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,990
When the Dragon's blood
completely blends into your body,

628
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:38,400
you'll lose control of your body.

629
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,800
You'll be the messenger
to summon the Black Qilin King

630
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,470
and my best puppet.

631
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,400
I don't know why,

632
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,560
but I think

633
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,470
this isn't a mere earthquake.

634
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,470
Bai Ze must have a more wicked plan.

635
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,080
On the other side of the Portal
is the beasts' home.

636
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,160
Demons here want to go back home.

637
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,880
As time goes by,

638
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,360
there will be fights.

639
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,670
Now, Bai Ze is stirring.

640
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,950
If we open the Portal

641
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,080
and let them go home,

642
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:39,470
will it be better?

643
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:40,400
No way.

644
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:42,640
If the Portal is open,

645
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,360
the Black Qilin King will appear.

646
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,510
The world will be in chaos.

647
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,310
He's more terrible than Bai Ze.

648
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,310
But the Lotus Tower
is about to collapse.

649
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,200
The Black Qilin King will also come out.

650
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,200
Or do we

651
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,710
just need to defeat
the Black Qilin King?

652
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,920
No one can defeat him.
