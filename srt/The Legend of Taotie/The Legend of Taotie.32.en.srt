General,

30
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,800
Bei Di has invaded.

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,800

It's really Garuda.

- It's Garuda.
- Good, the time has come.

Why can't I go?

50

Miss Zhu,

51
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,390
last time at Yangcheng Prefecture,

52
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,070
Prince of Langya
nearly caused your death.

53
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,440
This time, you absolutely cannot go.

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,640
Last time, Mr. Chang Qing
was with you.

55
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,110
This time, it's just you.

56
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,040
Then tell me,

57
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,270
where should we look for him?

58
00:04:59,270 --> 00:04:59,760
But...

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,720
Right now,

60
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,880
only the Inspection Department's spies
are everywhere.

61
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:05,510
If I want to know Qing's whereabouts,

62
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,040
I can only go find him, understand?

63
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,110
Then...

64
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,270
No, no.

65
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,760
Tell me, can a paper girl like you

66
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,830
stop me?

67
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,440
Otherwise, let me show you

68
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:21,510

69
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,070
At that time,

70
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,880
you won't be able to meet anyone.

71
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,000
Miss Zhu,

72
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:29,670
take care.

73
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:57,790
Yuhu,

74
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,200
go to the camp and count the casualties.

75
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,550
Also,

76
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,040
tell the soldiers

77
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,200
the supplies will arrive tomorrow.

78
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,160
Let them hold on a little longer.

79
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:06,880
Yes.

80
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,600
How is it, Yao?

81
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,790
How is the battle today?

82
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,270
This battle

83
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,640
is really tough.

84
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,200
By the way,

85
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,670
I should thank your strong assistance,

86
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,550
otherwise, Garuda Pass
would have been lost.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,350
Whether Garuda Pass can be defended

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
all depends on you.

89
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:32,550
- Garuda is here.
- Garuda is here.

90
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:41,760
Yao, you flatter me.

91
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,040
Thanks to your mutual understanding
with Garuda,

92
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,320
we came up with such a plan.

93
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,720
What's more unexpected is

94
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,200
Garuda didn't appear.

95
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,070
Just relying on the sound

96
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,920
was enough to help Da Liang
escape danger.

97
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,230
It's truly a divine bird.

98
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,550
But we can't hide

99
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,720
this secret forever.

100
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,880
Looks like Bei Di will not
attack again in the short term.

101
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,270
If they come again,

102
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,640
we can still hold out like this

103
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,230
until Prince of Langya

104
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:06,920
brings the supplies.

105
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,320
My concern now is not Garuda Pass,

106
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,480
but rather

107
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:13,880
the court.

108
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,320
Yunlong,

109
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,440
Garuda is just
as important to the court.

110
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:20,950
Otherwise, there wouldn't be the rumor

111
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,200
that if Garuda is here,

112
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,670
then Da Liang is safe.

113
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:26,760
Yao,

114
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,230
no need to worry too much.

115
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,270
Let's hope so.

116
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:38,480
When the bird is gone,
the bows are put away.

117
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,600
Once the legend proved false,

118
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,320
it'd lose all its value.

119
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,790
Slow down.

120
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,350
Great, Qi.

121
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,790
With these supplies,

122
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,790
the soldiers' morale will stabilize.

123
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,550
Yes.

124
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,150
Slow down, slow down.

125
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:58,670
I heard Garuda has recovered.

126
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,790
It played a crucial role

127
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,320
in this battle.

128
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,280
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

129
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,880
Garuda's recovery

130
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,080
was a deception by me and Mr. Chang.

131
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,590
Garuda's spiritual power
has depleted

132
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,400
and cannot be restored.

133
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:13,640
Can Mr. Chang's brush

134
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,710
offer a solution?

135
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,790
Sorry.

136
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,150
Although I can communicate
with demon beasts,

137
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,080
I don't know how to heal them.

138
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,150
I'm truly helpless.

139
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,030
Garuda is called a divine bird,

140
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,400
but after all, it's a demon beast.

141
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,840
I believe only she

142
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,320
understands beasts.

143
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,960
I'm wondering

144
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,200
why you came alone?

145
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:47,760
Where's Miss Zhu?

146
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,470
I've been acquainted
with General Yao for a long time.

147
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,470
When I received his letter,
I hurried over.

148
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,520
Your Highness,

149
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,080
who are you and Mr. Chang

150
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,960
referring to exactly?

151
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,670
Can you invite her to treat Garuda?

152
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,550
Miss Zhu from Tianxiang Restaurant.

153
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,440
She understands all matters
related to demon beasts.

154
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,400
If we can invite her,

155
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,760
Garuda will surely be saved.

156
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:13,550
Your Highness,

157
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:16,520
would it be better

158
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,590
to consider this carefully?

159
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,030
Garuda is in critical danger.

160
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,400
Bei Di is watching closely

161
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,790
and the war is on the verge
of breaking out.

162
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,640
We have no other plans.

163
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,910
Except for inviting Miss Zhu,

164
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,550
what other plans

165
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,670
do you have?

166
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,000
You're right.

167
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,550
We must prioritize the big picture.

168
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,520
Inviting Miss Zhu over

169
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,880
can give Garuda a chance to survive

170
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,120
and the border crisis will be resolved.

171
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,480
Your Highness,

172
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,680
the border situation
is changing rapidly.

173
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,560
Garuda can no longer fight.

174
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,560
Please make a decision soon.

175
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,190
Mingyan.

176
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:00,880
Yes.

177
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,750
Quickly go to Wuxia City
to invite Miss Zhu over.

178
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,120
[Prince of Langya]
Here, take this token.

179
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,240
The post stations along the way
will assist you.

180
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:09,830
Yes.

181
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,000
Cuiyan.

182
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,390
Cuiyan!

183
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,120
Yesterday, there was no one
at the Prince of Langya's residence.

184
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,560
Now, even Cuiyan is missing.

185
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,150
Cuiyan!

186
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:32,830
Coming.

187
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
Coming, coming.

188
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,680
Coming, coming.

189
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,830
What's the matter, Miss Zhu?

190
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,190
Go buy some
soup-filled dumplings for me.

191
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,950
Miss Zhu, do you miss Mr. Chang?

192
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,440
That's why you want me
to buy soup-filled dumplings?

193
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:50,120
Go now.

194
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,590
You won't even eat them.

195
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:53,830
It'll be a waste!

196
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,750
Let's go find Mr. Chang Qing.

197
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,070
I'd love to,

198
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,630
but where should we go?

199
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,630
Now, even the Prince of Langya
is nowhere to be found.

200
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,880
Why mention him

201
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,190
all of a sudden?

202
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,510
Mingyan.

203
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:17,800
Miss Zhu.

204
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,830
What brings you here?

205
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:19,830
The border is in crisis

206
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:20,880
and Garuda is in critical danger.

207
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,560
Even Mr. Chang is at a loss.

208
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,070
His Highness wishes
to invite you to help.

209
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,800
You said Qing is at the border?

210
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:28,120
Yes.

211
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,590
His Highness and Mr. Chang
are both there.

212
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
Miss Zhu, where are you going?

213
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,630
Miss Zhu,

214
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:40,710
where did you go?

215
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,150
Go to the border.

216
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:43,510
Cuiyan,

217
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:44,120
let's go.

218
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:44,830
Alright.

219
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,070
Move away.

220
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:53,680
Benefactor.

221
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,270
How did you appear?

222
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,750
It's timing

223
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,000
and fate.

224
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,070
Taotie never imagined

225
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,880
that one day she'd be in the trap
of her own devising.

226
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:03,880
Now the Bai Ze's Supernatural Creatures

227
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,390
has gathered six demon beasts.

228
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,240
I can restore my physical form
for four hours each day.

229
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,190
This is very beneficial to me.

230
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,070
Congratulations.

231
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,120
You've never had a physical body.

232
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,440
After you've restored it,

233
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,390
you will find it much easier to act.

234
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,950
I'm truly happy for you.

235
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,710
Restoring my physical form
is what I wanted.

236
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,190
What about what you want?

237
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,750
Taotie is inherently cruel.

238
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:36,360
I had already guessed
she would disregard others' lives

239
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,040
and insist on speeding up the growth
of the Twin Mushroom

240
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,270
to extend your life.

241
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,150
Is this what you wanted?

242
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:42,950
You've always held

243
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,590
helping others as your duty.

244
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,390
Now so many people
have died because of you.

245
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:47,390
Do you feel

246
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:50,070
no guilt in your heart?

247
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:52,070
Benefactor,
you should know my thoughts.

248
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,190
Life, aging, sickness, and death
are all natural occurrences.

249
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,750
I don't wish to alter
the laws of the world,

250
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,190
and I have no intention
of sacrificing others' lives

251
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,360
to extend my own life.

252
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,830
Do you know that Taotie

253
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,800
is not only cruel to humans,

254
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,070
but even more cruel to beasts?

255
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,710
Now Garuda's spiritual power
has exhausted,

256
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,320
there's no cure left.

257
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,630
Only by opening the Portal

258
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,440
and sending it back to the demon realm

259
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,360
can it be saved.

260
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,190
Taotie has the Dragon's blood

261
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,320
and severed the two realms
for 500 years.

262
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:31,920
Countless beasts have died
due to their depleted spiritual energy.

263
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,880
They cry day and night,

264
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,630
pleading for help in your ears.

265
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,150
Can't you hear them?

266
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,320
Mr. Chang Qing.

267
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,800
Mr. Chang Qing,
when will you open the Portal?

268
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,000
Save us!

269
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,440
Mr. Chang Qing!

270
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,830
Mr. Chang Qing!

271
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,750
Save us!

272
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,240
Mr. Chang Qing.

273
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,000
Mr. Chang Qing, save us!

274
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,480
All this time,

275
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,630
I have been indecisive.

276
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,240
I wanted to believe
that everything Miss Zhu did

277
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,950
had her own consideration.

278
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,680
But I didn't expect to drag them down.

279
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,680
Whether humans

280
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:20,920
or beasts,

281
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:23,680
they all have the right
to choose for themselves.

282
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,750
I must not disregard
other people's feelings

283
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,360
because of my own selfish desires.

284
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,390
I'll bear the consequences

285
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,150
of the sins I committed.

286
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,120
Benefactor, rest assured.

287
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:37,480
I'll definitely get the Dragon's blood

288
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,440
and help the beasts return home.

289
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:40,750
Good.

290
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,710
Taotie is coming soon.

291
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:45,920
This time,

292
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,800
I hope you don't disappoint us again.

293
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:08,840
Your Highness,

294
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,350
this is the only path to Bei Di.

295
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:12,920
We can use this forest

296
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,630
as an ambush.

297
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,720
Your Highness,

298
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,960
Garuda has reacted.

299
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,230
It must be Miss Zhu arriving.

300
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,200
Go check.

301
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:24,920
Alright.

302
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,270
Your Highness.

303
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,920
Mr. Chang Qing.

304
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,960
I've missed you so much.

305
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:19,960
Cuiyan.

306
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,470
Long time no see.

307
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:22,960
Go.

308
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,270
Go.

309
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,960
Is it because its spiritual energy
has exhausted?

310
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,320
You can sense it?

311
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,440
I noticed something strange
about this curtain earlier.

312
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,350
It's not afraid of light.

313
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,720
I didn't expect its spiritual energy
to be depleted to this extent.

314
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,470
Conquering Bei Di
will hasten your death.

315
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,870
Why do this?

316
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,510
Did you make a pact with him?

317
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:10,750
No wonder you swore
to defend the border to the death.

318
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,390
Please, Miss Zhu, lend a hand

319
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,680
and save my brother's life.

320
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,630
You treat it like a brother?

321
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,630
Forever and ever.

322
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,470
Spiritual exhaustion is fate.

323
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,470
Unless...

324
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,600
Please tell me plainly.

325
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,750
Unless you can find
Nine-Section Dragon Marrow.

326
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:28,960
What is that?

327
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,630
According to legend,
during the ancient chaotic era,

328
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,270
humans and beasts lived together.

329
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,840
To adapt to the human world,

330
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,080
beasts developed
a type of spiritual power

331
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,630
in their bone marrow.

332
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,390
When the beast is about to die,

333
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,440
they can consume it

334
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,270
to delay the depletion
of their spiritual energy.

335
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:47,110
But I don't know where to find

336
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,270
such an ancient relic.

337
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,960
As long as it can
save my brother's life,

338
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,630
I will do my utmost.

339
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,040
I will send someone to search for it.

340
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:55,510
Your Highness.

341
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,110
To be honest,

342
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,960
I learned magic during my travels

343
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,200
in Bei Di.

344
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,080
I heard that Nine-Section Dragon Marrow

345
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,600
is hidden within the Bei Di Pass.

346
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,200
Mr. Tan, you really know everything.

347
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:09,960
Miss Zhu,

348
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,600
I apologize for my past behaviors.

349
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,510
But that was all

350
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,320
our personal grudge.

351
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:16,870
I hope you can forgive me.

352
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,800
Mr. Tan, your skills are extraordinary
and your tactics are cunning.

353
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,510
You've put me
in deadly situations many times.

354
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,040
You think just a few words

355
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,750
can make me forget all that?

356
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,200
Miss Zhu,

357
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,720
now the state is at stake.

358
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,270
Please prioritize the greater good.

359
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,200
You may refuse this favor,

360
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:34,720
but please, think about the safety

361
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,870
of the common people of Da Liang.

362
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:37,800
Your Highness, you're making me

363
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,040
look petty.

364
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:41,560
Saving Garuda indeed
is the most important thing now.

365
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,320
Thank you, Miss Zhu.

366
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,320
Mr. Tan,

367
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,870
is there any evidence

368
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:49,870
for what you just said?

369
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,320
I can't be certain,

370
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,230
but I'm willing to investigate.

371
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:55,200
Go ahead.

372
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,200
Be careful with everything.

373
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,800
Thank you, Your Highness.

374
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,390
The golden wings hang low.

375
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:31,470
The clouds of heaven

376
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,920
fly in fury.

377
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,720
And the world is at peace.

378
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,920
Wearing golden armor,

379
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,800
terrorizing the barbarians.

380
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,350
The prise of their might and virtue

381
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,080
travels a thousand miles.

382
00:21:54,870 --> 00:21:56,990
Praying for peace and safety

383
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,560
for ten thousand years.

384
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,840
Why does my heart

385
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,800
have this ominous sensation?

386
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,680
[General's Residence]

387
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:21,720
General,

388
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,840
long time no see.

389
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,080
I said we would never meet again.

390
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,200
Why have you come to find me?

391
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:34,150
I've come to deliver the brush to you.

392
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,800
Thank you.

393
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,390
I didn't know
you had come to the border.

394
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,350
I've been looking for you
for a long time.

395
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,390
I know regarding the Twin Mushroom,

396
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,270
I hurt you.

397
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:05,870
But,

398
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,270
after all this time,

399
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,270
you should have forgiven me by now.

400
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:11,350
That's a easy thing for you to say.

401
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:12,600
But I cannot

402
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,990
forget the many lives lost.

403
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,110
I don't want to see you.

404
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,680
Miss Zhu, please go back for now.

405
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,560
I cannot go back.

406
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:24,990
What are you

407
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:25,990
staying here for?

408
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,470
I'm here to help you save Garuda.

409
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,110
I don't need your help.

410
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,390
Alright.

411
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,990
I'm not helping you,

412
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,800
I'm saving it for myself.

413
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:35,920
You see,

414
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,150
if Garuda dies,

415
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,960
Da Liang will be in danger,

416
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,040
then Wuxia City will be doomed.

417
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,920
I am trying to protect the Lotus Tower.

418
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:45,270
Now do you understand

419
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,800
what I say?

420
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:53,200
Qing,

421
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,390
it's been a long time.

422
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,750
I was wrong.

423
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,470
I told you long ago

424
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,750
that we would never meet again.

425
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,470
This meeting

426
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,600
should be the last time.

427
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,200
As for the brush,

428
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,320
thank you.

429
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,200
Qing.

430
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,960
If I cure Garuda,

431
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,040
will you forgive me then?

432
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,270
I'm going to take that

433
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,680
as a yes.

434
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,270
Don't back out.

435
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:16,110
General Yao.

436
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,270
What will you do

437
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,840
if we can't find
Nine-Section Dragon Marrow?

438
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,200
When my army triumphs,

439
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,720
I will die with it.

440
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:41,510
Garuda is lucky

441
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,560
to have you.

442
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,150
General Yao, rest assured.

443
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:08,350
My dark archer is highly skilled.

444
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,390
He will surely succeed.

445
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:12,350
Mr. Tan has arrived.

446
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,150
General.

447
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,990
Mr. Tan, you really are impressive,

448
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,600
being able to bring back
Nine-Section Dragon Marrow

449
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,440
single-handedly from Bei Di.

450
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,320
Unfortunately, I had
military affairs to attend to

451
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,510
and couldn't go with you.

452
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,110
I am truly ashamed.

453
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,750
General Yao, do not blame yourself.

454
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,390
The war is imminent.

455
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,840
You must naturally prioritize the war.

456
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,920
How could you leave carelessly?

457
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,350
Thank you for your understanding.

458
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,270
Miss Zhu.

459
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,390
Indeed, it is the marrow
of an ancient beast.

460
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:01,510
Miss Zhu,

461
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,320
now that we have it,

462
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,800
can you treat Garuda?

463
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,080
With it, things will be easier.

464
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,320
Tomorrow, I can treat it.

465
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:08,870
That's great!

466
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,200
Qing.

467
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,870
Human life

468
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,720
is already short enough.

469
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
I don't want you to leave me like this.

470
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,720
You will forgive me,

471
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,320
right?

472
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,350
Miss Zhu,

473
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,230
when will you truly understand

474
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,230
what I'm thinking?

475
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,510
Everything is ready?

476
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,080
I've done everything
according to your instructions.

477
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,960
Fed it
the Nine-Section Dragon Marrow

478
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,320
every four hours.

479
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,270
Qing,

480
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,960
don't forget what you promised me.

481
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,470
Miss Zhu,

482
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:12,960
how are you?

483
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:19,800
Why is this happening?

484
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,560
Though the dragon marrow is real,

485
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,750
it's mixed with the blood
of a phoenix bird.

486
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,510
The blood is colorless and tasteless,

487
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:39,750
but the phoenix bird
belongs to the Phoenix family,

488
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,920
which can revive through nirvana.

489
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,270
Are you saying

490
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,920
Garuda has undergone nirvana?

491
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,080
If it's only nirvana, it would be fine.

492
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,080
But it clearly shows signs
of poisoning now.

493
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,440
Your Highness,

494
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,440
we haven't seen Mr. Tan

495
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:07,840
since yesterday, right?

496
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,110
What do you mean?

497
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,870
Since Nine-Section Dragon Marrow
was brought back,

498
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,200
it has been personally kept
by General Yao.

499
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:22,230
He'll never hurt Garuda.

500
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,110
The only person who has access

501
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,990
to the dragon marrow alone

502
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,080
is Mr. Tan, right?

503
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:36,920
Mingyan.

504
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:37,750
Yes.

505
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,230
Bring Mr. Tan over.

506
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:39,840
Yes.

507
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,960
I understand that

508
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,920
you're suspicious of Mr. Tan.

509
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,800
But the matter
has not been fully investigated.

510
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,800
Maybe it's a plot from Bei Di.

511
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,440
Mr. Tan is your capable assistant.

512
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,110
You'll certainly speak in his favor.

513
00:31:58,630 --> 00:31:59,840
Perhaps you have been involved

514
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,750
in this matter as well.

515
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,510
May I ask what you requires?

516
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,150
How did you acquire

517
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,200
the Nine-Section Dragon Marrow?

518
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:26,720
From the treasure house
of Bei Di General's residence.

519
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,920
The treasure house?

520
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,750
Bei Di General's residence
is heavily guarded.

521
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:34,680
And Nine-Section Dragon Marrow
is such a precious item.

522
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,720
How could you alone

523
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,680
secure it so easily?

524
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,750
It seems all of this was premeditated.

525
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,720
Is there an issue

526
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,440
with the Nine-Section Dragon Marrow?

527
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,470
You brought it back yourself.

528
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,680
You know best

529
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,230
whether there's an issue or not.

530
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:00,750
Yes.

531
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,270
You ugly man,

532
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,560
clearly you have no good intentions,

533
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,560
volunteering to save Garuda

534
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,560
disingenuously.

535
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:08,630
Your Highness.

536
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,150
I did bring back

537
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:12,040
the Nine-Section Dragon Marrow
from Bei Di.

538
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,600
Although the General's residence
is heavily guarded,

539
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,720
I found that

540
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,750
their patrols follow a regular pattern.

541
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,750
There are rarely people
at the treasure house.

542
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,470
I didn't obtain it simply by chance.

543
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,150
Please believe in my sincere loyalty.

544
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,150
Even if you brought it back from Bei Di,

545
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,990
who knows if you did something

546
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:29,870
on the way back?

547
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:32,200
If I don't want to save Garuda,

548
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,630
why would I volunteer

549
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,600
to go get the Nine-Section Dragon Marrow

550
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,230
from Bei Di personally?

551
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,960
What if you conspired with Bei Di?

552
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,350
You brought up

553
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,200
that the cure for Garuda is in Bei Di,

554
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,470
then you brought back
fake medicine to deceive us.

555
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,600
That's not impossible.

556
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:55,600
Miss Zhu.

557
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:58,870
There seems to be some
misunderstanding between us.

558
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,470
But this matter

559
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:01,870
truly has nothing to do with me.

560
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,320
I did it for His Highness

561
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,840
and for the sake of Da Liang.

562
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,470
I didn't want things to come to this.

563
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,800
If Your Highness does not trust me,

564
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,160
I am willing to die as an apology.

565
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,120
Your Highness.

566
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:26,880
Miss Zhu.

567
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,990
Now is not the time to assign blame.

568
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,800
Our urgent task

569
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,840
should be to think

570
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,950
of any other way

571
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:32,990
to save Garuda.

572
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:40,750
Miss Zhu,

573
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,470
I just want to ask you one question.

574
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:45,320
Can it still live?

575
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:46,470
Yes.

576
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:48,710
However,

577
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,950
it is now a crow,
devoid of all spiritual power.

578
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:55,360
Is there any way to restore it?

579
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:57,880
No.

580
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,360
No matter what,
the Portal must not be opened.

581
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,120
Miss Zhu,

582
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,800
I know you must have a way.

583
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,160
I beg you, save it.

584
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,840
Without Nine-Section Dragon Marrow,

585
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,670
I truly cannot help.

586
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,640
But General Yao,

587
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,640
Garuda has already
transformed into a crow.

588
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,470
There should be no danger
to its life now.

589
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,550
You need not worry too much.

590
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,120
Do you know that Taotie

591
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,680
is not only cruel to humans,

592
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,600
but even more cruel to beasts?

593
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
Now Garuda's spiritual power
has exhausted,

594
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,550
there's no cure left.

595
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,550
Only by opening the Portal

596
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:38,880
and sending it back to the demon realm

597
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,790
can it be saved.

598
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,640
Your Highness,

599
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,230
the real Nine-Section Dragon Marrow

600
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,160
should still be in Bei Di.

601
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,550
I am willing to go there again.

602
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,600
You still want to go?

603
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,600
What else do you want
to bring back to harm us?

604
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,710
No,

605
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,440
you want to escape
in fear of punishment.

606
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,310
Enough.

607
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,600
General Yao, Miss Zhu.

608
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:00,230
Before there is solid evidence,

609
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,600
I cannot make rash conclusions.

610
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,600
But I can guarantee

611
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,600
I will handle this matter seriously.

612
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,680
There will be no leniency.

613
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:08,600
Mingyan.

614
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,310
Yes.

615
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,120
Temporarily detain Mr. Tan.

616
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,880
Before the investigation is clear,

617
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,360
he must not leave the camp even a step.

618
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,440
Without my permission,

619
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,400
no one is allowed to approach him.

620
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:18,600
Yes.

621
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:21,710
Mr. Tan.

622
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:32,120
Your Highness.

623
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,200
No matter what,

624
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,950
I believe in what Mr. Tan said.

625
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,470
The real Nine-Section Dragon Marrow

626
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,710
must still be
in Bei Di's treasure house.

627
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,360
I am willing to go and try.

628
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,270
Absolutely no.

629
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,360
As the commander of the Yao's Army,

630
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,470
if you are discovered by the enemies

631
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:46,360
within Bei Di's borders,

632
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,510
the consequences would be unimaginable.

633
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,230
The army cannot be without a leader.

634
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,400
As for what happened to Garuda,

635
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,160
don't tell anyone else about it.

636
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:54,600
If it is leaked,

637
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,200
it will cause unrest within the army

638
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,880
and may even cause panic
among the people.

639
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,080
I will send someone else

640
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,600
to investigate

641
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,840
the matter on the dragon marrow.

642
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:03,950
Your Highness...

643
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,880
Don't say more.

644
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,080
This is a military order.

645
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,400
Looks like everyone is tired.

646
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,680
Head back and rest early.

647
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,440
Mr. Tan,

648
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:40,750
can you really get

649
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,600
everything I ask for?

650
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,550
I will give you

651
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,440
what you wish.

652
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,310
Are you really

653
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,950
assisting me with sincerity?

654
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,680
[Garuda Pass]

655
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,790
Thousands of li,

656
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,310
the roc is soaring.

657
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,600
I know you must not
be willing to accept this.

658
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:42,400
Mr. Chang,

659
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,920
General has instructed you to wait here.

660
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:44,360
Okay.

661
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,920
[To Mr. Chang]

662
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:22,790
I have been ordered to guard
Garuda Pass for more than ten years

663
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,400
performed my duties faithfully,

664
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,160
and have never betrayed
the emperor's trust.

665
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,470
I now voluntarily resign

666
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,790
because I'm the only one there

667
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,440
for Garuda.

668
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,950
I truly cannot abandon it.

669
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,710
I am willing to die for it

670
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,440
with no regrets.

671
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,510
My child and widowed mother

672
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,600
are my only concern left.

673
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,440
Jie is still young.

674
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:47,790
Though clever and bright,
he is inexperienced.

675
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,230
I don't expect him
to achieve great things,

676
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,790
only hope him to be safe and sound.

677
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,080
If something should happen to me,

678
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:57,310
I hope you will help me
take care of them.

679
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,200
The value of friendship

680
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,080
lies in heart-to-heart communication.

681
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,600
I believe you will not disappoint me.

682
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,310
General Yao did leave, after all.

683
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:20,750
Mr. Chang Qing,

684
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:22,600
why did you call me here so late?

685
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:23,710
In such a mysterious way,

686
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,080
and you wouldn't even
let me tell Miss Zhu.

687
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:35,680
Cuiyan.

688
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:38,920
I'm sorry.

689
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:48,680
Who are you?

690
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:50,510
Yuan.

691
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,200
You are not a Bei Di person.

692
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:04,440
Cuiyan.

693
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,160
Cuiyan.

694
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,030
Mr. Yao,

695
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,470
Mr. Chang asked me to find you.

696
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,550
Yuan,

697
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,550
what are you doing here?

698
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,950
You're looking more and more like Ling.

699
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,470
Catch the spy!

700
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,550
Catch the spy!

701
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:16,680
This place is not safe,

702
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,030
we must leave.

703
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:34,200
You two go first.

704
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,270
Be careful.

705
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:36,160
Go.

706
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:58,550
Qing,

707
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,600
where did you take Cuiyan

708
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,600
and why is General Yao also missing?

709
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,510
Did General Yao go to Bei Di?

710
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:09,710
What exactly is going on?

711
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:14,990
Mr. Chang,

712
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,310
disobeying military orders
is no small crime.

713
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:20,750
Your Highness, please calm down.

714
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,710
Please do not blame
General Yao just yet.

715
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,310
I've already sent Cuiyan
to bring him back.

716
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:25,880
Cuiyan?

717
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,230
What can a paper person do?

718
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:30,030
Prepare a horse for me.

719
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:36,310
Cuiyan.

720
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,030
Miss Zhu.

721
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:44,840
Why are both of you here too?

722
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:46,880
