00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:14,800
I'm so hungry...

191
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,110
Eat something then.

192
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:21,110
There's nothing good. I'm starving.

193
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,640
Listen,

194
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,470
you can't be this headstrong.

195
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,190
Tianxiang Restaurant

196
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,760
has been closed for two weeks.

197
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,270
I've told you many times.

198
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:35,560
There are no fresh ingredients I want to eat.

199
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,680
Food

200
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:39,920
is an important thing

201
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,680
that should be in tune with the times.

202
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,760
Every meal has to be taken seriously.

203
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,110
Everything we eat

204
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:47,070
should be something unique that we crave for.

205
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,640
You can wait,

206
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,310
but I need to save money

207
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,430
so I can return you three hundred taels of silver.

208
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,280
Qing,

209
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,710
you just don't understand it, do you?

210
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,190
If there's no good food,

211
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,230
I'd rather starve to death.

212
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,760
You

213
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,710
won't starve to death,

214
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,310
at least not today.

215
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,070
Oh.

216
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:09,710
My goodness.

217
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:11,430
Such a beautiful mermaid.

218
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,400
I didn't expect

219
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,760
to see such a treasure.

220
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,640
What's so special about the mermaid?

221
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,760
It's described in "Bai Ze's Supernatural Creatures"

222
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,040
that this mermaid has a snake-shaped head
and a fish-shaped body.

223
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,110
She also has two legs

224
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:22,560
and lives in deep cold water.

225
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,040
This is much more precious than bass

226
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,280
and a rare delicacy too.

227
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,700
[Zhu]

228
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,880
Too bad.

229
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,520
The meat is tender and soft,

230
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,710
but an important taste

231
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,520
is missing.

232
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,230
How... How's that possible?

233
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,350
It's so fresh.

234
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,310
How about you

235
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,760
taste it again?

236
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,430
It's fresh, yes.

237
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,110
But

238
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,040
she has been trapped in this jar

239
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
so of course she's distressed.

240
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,160
And she must have been scared and sad

241
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,280
on the way here.

242
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,350
Of course it won't taste good

243
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,350
when the meat is bitter.

244
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,070
What she needs

245
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:27,800
is a special feeling.

246
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,070
With this feeling,

247
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:31,160
even if she'll be in pieces, she will still say yes.

248
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,760
What is that?

249
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,560
That is called

250
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,950
love.

251
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,310
Help! Help!

252
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,560
Help!

253
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:58,110
Once,

254
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,520
I woke up on the beach
after falling into the water accidentally

255
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,110
and the first person I saw was her.

256
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,640
She stared at me

257
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,830
with her sparkling eyes.

258
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:20,800
Excuse me!

259
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,710
May I know your name?

260
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,760
My name is Gao Cong

261
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,230
and I style myself Ziyu.

262
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
After that,

263
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,430
to see her again,

264
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,470
I go to the beach

265
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,070
where we last met every day

266
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,590
to look for her.

267
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:49,520
Madam!

268
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:50,800
Madam!

269
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,430
Where are you?

270
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,560
Madam!

271
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,800
Madam!

272
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,800
I know you're here.

273
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,830
Why don't you want to meet me?

274
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,110
I just want to return the favor!

275
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,710
But I don't even know your name.

276
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,300
Please come here and tell me!

277
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,520
Madam.

278
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,350
Where are you?

279
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:21,880
Madam!

280
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,880
Madam!

281
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,950
I bought a house here.

282
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,470
This will be our home in the future.

283
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:42,350
Look, lotus flowers.

284
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,520
However, good times didn't last long.

285
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
I had no income,

286
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:53,680
so I had to pawn my stuff often

287
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,710
to scrape a living.

288
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,820
[Jiyuan Pawnshop]

289
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,070
Mr. Du.

290
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,110
My friends in the past

291
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:01,680
Can you please lend me some money?
I have an emergency.

292
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,000
all refused to help.

293
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,520
They even laughed at me.

294
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,160
I started to dig lotus roots

295
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,880
and sell calligraphy and paintings.

296
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,760
I tried my best

297
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,470
for Jiao.

298
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,350
Mister, do you like calligraphy or paintings?

299
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:23,760
No.

300
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,230
But

301
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:24,950
Calligraphy and paintings here.

302
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,680
nobody showed any interest.

303
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,680
It's raining heavily.

304
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,310
Go home now!

305
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,000
Give it to me.

306
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:41,880
Darling,

307
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,110
you're tired.

308
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:43,950
Have some tea.

309
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,040
My family disowned me because of you,

310
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,110
yet you're good-for-nothing.

311
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,070
I must have been blind to choose you!

312
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,070
Jiao?

313
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,310
Is that you, Jiao?

314
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,830
Never did I expect

315
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,520
that my wife was a mermaid.

316
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,190
The next day,

317
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,430
Xie Yan, a good friend who I hadn't seen
for a long time,

318
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,230
asked me out for dinner.

319
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,760
After I got drunk,

320
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,710
I started to talk about this with him.

321
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,950
In the past, we traveled and studied together,

322
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,830
and we had fun riding horses and singing.

323
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,760
Forgive me for saying this,

324
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,950
but you look much older now.

325
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,830
My dearest wife

326
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,280
is actually a mermaid.

327
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,800
Liar. They are all liars.

328
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,400
Cong,

329
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,160
congratulations.

330
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:26,830
Congratulations?

331
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,310
What's there

332
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:31,920
to congratulate on?

333
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,070
Have you ever heard

334
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:39,710
of Mr. Jia, the Southern Military Governor?

335
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,430
He's the Emperor's favorite.

336
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,110
I asked a lot of people

337
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,760
and got to know that fish
is Mr. Jia's favorite food.

338
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,310
He likes raw fish in particular.

339
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,560
Speaking of rare fish,

340
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,710
you already have one

341
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,310
at home, don't you?

342
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,710
Xie Yan asked me to give Jiao

343
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,920
to Mr. Jia for money.

344
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,470
Actually, I hadn't planned to do it.

345
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,950
But when I talked to Jiao about it,

346
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,640
she said...

347
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,400
What?

348
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,470
She said she'd be willing to do so.

349
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,880
No wonder Miss Zhu said the meat is bitter.

350
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,160
Anyone who has been hurt deeply like this

351
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,230
by someone they love

352
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:30,350
will feel bitter.

353
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,070
Now that she's willing to do this,

354
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,520
I'll keep her in Tianxiang Restaurant
for the time being.

355
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,040
As for whether or not to eat her,

356
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,350
I'll wait until you make up your mind.

357
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,000
Then,

358
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,800
thank you Miss Zhu.

359
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,280
Goodbye.

360
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,760
You haven't gone to bed yet?

361
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:44,680
I'm hungry.

362
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,230
I'm so hungry that I can't fall asleep.

363
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,000
You're not hungry but gluttonous.

364
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:50,070
If you're really hungry,

365
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,800
why didn't you eat

366
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,640
the noodles I made you tonight?

367
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,560
You know why.

368
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,190
I want to eat the mermaid.

369
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,070
The meat is bitter,

370
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:58,230
I'm afraid it's hard to swallow.

371
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,040
Miss Zhu,

372
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,310
go to bed.

373
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,680
You won't feel hungry once you fall asleep.

374
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,400
I knew it.

375
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,880
You stay up late and hide here

376
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,040
because you're afraid I may eat her.

377
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,680
Madam,

378
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,350
this mermaid

379
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,640
looks ugly and tastes bitter.

380
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,760
I suggest you

381
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,230
forget about her.

382
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,640
Let go of your obsession.

383
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,950
Let go of your obsession
and everything will be easy.

384
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:23,590
Now you really look

385
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,800
like someone I know.

386
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,800
He likes to chant scriptures too

387
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,280
and he talks a lot.

388
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,880
However, he's a monk.

389
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,230
And you talk even more than he does.

390
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,070
Who is he?

391
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,590
A monk I ran into

392
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,040
a few days ago in the temple.

393
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,520
I'm not like a monk.

394
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,070
I just wanted you to go to bed early.

395
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,470
You may feel sick if you eat too much.

396
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,880
I've eaten a lot of supernatural creatures.

397
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,800
What's so special about her?

398
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,710
Because she was once a person too.

399
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,230
She has feelings

400
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,640
and she can feel pain.

401
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,280
Also,

402
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,000
she was brought here as a food ingredient
by the man she loves.

403
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,190
This kind of pain

404
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,590
hurts much more than anything else.

405
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,350
Thank you, Mr. Chang.

406
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,160
Thank you, Miss Zhu.

407
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,230
Why?

408
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,110
What if I help Gao Cong?

409
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,880
If I can be cooked by you masterfully

410
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:37,800
and given to Mr. Jia,

411
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,590
then Cong will know

412
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,680
that although I'm a mermaid,

413
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,590
I truly love him

414
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,830
and will not let him down.

415
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,430
Did you hear that?

416
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,400
She's willing to do so herself.

417
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,400
It's not my fault.

418
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,760
I'm willing to do anything

419
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,880
for my husband.

420
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,950
That day, after he returned
from the dinner with Xie Yan,

421
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,190
he became seriously ill.

422
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,230
What he usually ate

423
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:05,070
was wild plants and coarse grains,

424
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,470
a feast like that was too much for him.

425
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,910
He also had a few drinks too.

426
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,950
He was suffering inside

427
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,230
and caught a cold,

428
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,710
so suddenly he started to have a high fever.

429
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:20,000
Jiao...

430
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:23,710
Jiao...

431
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,040
Darling, I'm here.

432
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:25,950
Jiao...

433
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:27,710
Jiao...

434
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,110
Jiao...

435
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:33,950
In my dream,

436
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,520
you were being cut

437
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,150
into pieces

438
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:42,430
and

439
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,520
I was living

440
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,670
an extravagant life again.

441
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,390
I feel so miserable.

442
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:50,950
Jiao,

443
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,670
I'm so useless.

444
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,470
When Xie Yan told me

445
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,800
to give you to Mr. Jia,

446
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,950
I should have refused sternly.

447
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,080
I'm so despicable.

448
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,760
How could I even think about this?

449
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,230
Do as you wish.

450
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,710
What did you say?

451
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,190
Do as you wish.

452
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,230
Do as he wishes?

453
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,430
In the end,

454
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,800
it's still Gao Cong's idea.

455
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,230
You had a chance to say no.

456
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:29,360
Guess mermaids

457
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,840
don't know how to lie.

458
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,560
Come on.

459
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,080
Thank you, Mr. Chang.

460
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,840
What's so good

461
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,800
about Gao Cong

462
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,760
that you're willing to die for him?

463
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,800
What's so good...

464
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:50,040
What's so good about him...

465
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,520
I just remember that I saw him

466
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:55,710
releasing a sea bass back into the sea

467
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,360
that night in the storm.

468
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,080
Leave me alone.

469
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:01,950
Okay.

470
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,230
Be smarter next time

471
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,600
so that you won't be caught again.

472
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,230
It's still too cruel

473
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,470
to eat it raw.

474
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,360
Go back to your home, the deep sea.

475
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,320
Humans are gluttonous.

476
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:52,950
Hurry up, leave now!

477
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:53,710
Go inside!

478
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,560
Help...

479
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:58,800
Help!

480
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,080
Help!

481
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:01,840
Help.

482
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,110
I looked at him once

483
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,190
and fell in love with him.

484
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,040
Jiao,

485
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,320
it sounds like

486
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,670
Gao Cong used to be a good person.

487
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,080
Why did he become like this?

488
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,800
He used to be kind

489
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:44,950
because he was rich.

490
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:46,560
He thought he should behave in a noble way.

491
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,560
Now he's poor,

492
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:49,560
he is showing

493
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,080
his true colors.

494
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:00,430
Jiao,

495
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,870
think over it.

496
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,320
What do you really want?

497
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,080
Do you want Gao Cong to love you

498
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,190
or do you want him to be rich?

499
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:14,630
I do as he wishes.

500
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,840
Ugh.

501
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,800
She's still so hopelessly devoted to him.

502
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,320
[Zhu]

503
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,430
Come here and look.

504
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,280
Look over there!

505
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,630
Such a big sedan chair.

506
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,360
I've never ridden in something like this.

507
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,000
I've never seen something like this,

508
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:06,870
let alone riding in it.

509
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:11,560
Is this

510
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,520
Tianxiang Restaurant?

511
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,390
Your Highness,

512
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:15,230
yes it is.

513
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,280
Who is he?

514
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:24,000
He brings a red carpet everywhere he goes.

515
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,520
Isn't that impressive?

516
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:26,080
Oh my.

517
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,230
He's so handsome.

518
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:41,470
So handsome.

519
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,230
Look. Isn't he handsome?

520
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,280
Yes, yes, he is.

521
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:45,150
[Zhu]

522
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,870
The lantern with the character Zhu
is hanging on the first floor,

523
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,760
indicating that Miss Zhu
is willing to see her guests.

524
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,000
Light blue curtains

525
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,280
are hanging on the second floor,

526
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:55,280
indicating that she is unwilling to see her guests.

527
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,080
Tianxiang Restaurant

528
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,080
is such an interesting place.

529
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,080
The Prince of Langya is here!

530
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,280
Zhao Heng, the Prince of Langya?

531
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:26,430
Greetings, Your Highness.

532
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,000
Miss Zhu is having a rest.

533
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,840
Sorry, we didn't know that you'd come.

534
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:31,390
Forget about the formalities.

535
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,910
I've just

536
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:35,840
arrived here.

537
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,280
I've been traveling all morning

538
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,560
and haven't had my lunch yet.

539
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,600
I heard that Miss Zhu

540
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,910
of Tianxiang Restaurant
is the best cook in the country.

541
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,360
I wonder if I can have the pleasure
of trying her cooking.

542
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:49,800
Your Highness, you flatter us.

543
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,230
Miss Zhu doesn't want to meet guests today.

544
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,910
Wuxia is not a big place

545
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:56,670
but there are a lot of great cooks.

546
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,840
You've just arrived. How about

547
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:02,080
you try other people's cooking first?

548
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,670
But the cooking skills of other great cooks

549
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:05,520
are not on par with Miss Zhu's.

550
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,560
I just want to meet Miss Zhu

551
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:10,560
and she's the only one I trust.

552
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,000
I wonder when she will meet her guests.

553
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,320
I can wait for her here.

554
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,190
His Highness is exhausted from a long trip recently.

555
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:19,870
So of course his first meal in Wuxia

556
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,040
is very important.

557
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,910
That's right.

558
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:24,950
What?

559
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,190
What is this? It smells so good.

560
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:27,040
Such a nice smell!

561
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,080
It smells so good.

562
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:29,430
So good.

563
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:31,560
Why does it smell so good?

564
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,630
I'm hungry now.

565
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:34,910
Do you want to sell it?

566
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:35,560
How much should I pay?

567
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:36,280
