Why not lock him
in the illusion together?

50
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,230
Maybe it can distract the Taotie's mind.

The helper General invited this time

turns out to be a banished immortal.

As expected,

nothing can be hidden from your eyes.

70
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,350
As long as what?

71
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,120
As long as you are willing
to enter the mirror as well,

72
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,960
you can reunite with her.

73
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,000
Fate is like a mist,

74
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:52,720

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,280
And my mirror

76
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,120
can clear up the mist

77
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,400
to glimpse a corner of fate.

78
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:03,840
Of course,

79
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,310
this was not originally destined.

80
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,960
But once you glimpse it,

81
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,750
there will be no turning back.

00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,280
this is the only way.

85
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,790

86
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,120

87
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,720
In the mirror.

88
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,750
I must see for myself

89
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,070

people hang various kinds of lanterns

95

to celebrate the festival.

96
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,560
These are snacks.

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,720
Snacks?

98
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,230
Yes.

99
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,750
Why the ones you make
are called green dumplings

100
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,230

109
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,790

if she takes the prayer beads,

193
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,520
Lord Wuchang will completely die

194
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,710
and never reincarnate.

195
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,030
All of this

196
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,590
was caused by Zhu Chengbi.

197
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:23,840
Qing.

198
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,110
Qing.

199
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,080
Qing.

200
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:37,520
Qing.

201
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,400
Miss Zhu.

202
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,320
Where am I?

203
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,320
Have you forgotten?

204
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,670
I said

205
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,320
I wanted to find a peaceful place,

206
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,350
and you painted me

207
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,280
this paradise.

208
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,230
No.

209
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,670
We are still in the mirror.

210
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:29,790
Have you forgotten?

211
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,150
You said you wanted to take me to find

212
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,150
a rare delicacy

213
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,880
and you led me all the way

214
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,230
to Yangcheng Prefecture
near Yuanhe Town.

215
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,350
None of this is real.

216
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,000
Come with me quickly.

217
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,280
You are the one who forgot.

218
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:42,790
Qing,

219
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,320
don't you want this?

220
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,080
Just the two of us.

221
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,880
You've always wanted this too,

222
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,230
right?

223
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,070
Don't use her face

224
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,400
to say such things.

225
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,830
Is there no other way?

226
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,640
Her injury

227
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:39,040
is an old wound from 500 years ago.

228
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,520
Accumulating over hundreds of years,

229
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,350
it's already deeply afflicted.

230
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,470
In order to heal,

231
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,110
it will naturally
require an extraordinary price.

232
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,710
Aside from the herbs from these beasts,

233
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,710
she needs a human's life as a catalyst.

234
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,000
There must be someone

235
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,230
who is willing to sacrifice
their life for her.

236
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,950
You must quickly find such a person.

237
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
Decide quickly.

238
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,310
Her time is running out.

239
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,000
Alright.

240
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,590
I'll do it.

241
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,230
Are you sure you want to do this?

242
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,280
Once you sacrifice your life,

243
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:20,190
you'll only have
six months left to live.

244
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,830
Think it through carefully.

245
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,110
Don't regret it later.

246
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,040
Taking the herbs from the beasts

247
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,710
was already a grave sin on my part.

248
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,590
I cannot escape the blame.

249
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:33,040
How can I take someone else's life?

250
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:34,710
I'm willing to do it

251
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,230
to save her.

252
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,160
Qing.

253
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,920
Qing, you cannot agree to this.

254
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,400
Miss Zhu.

255
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:51,840
Miss Zhu.

256
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,710
- Miss Zhu.
- Qing.

257
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:54,830
Miss Zhu.

258
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,790
Qing.

259
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,110
Qing, Qing.

260
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,030
Miss Zhu.

261
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,070
Miss Zhu.

262
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,550
Who is he?

263
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,790
He must be very important to her.

264
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,030
Ever since meeting her,

265
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,520
I've never seen her
so heartbroken over anyone.

266
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:40,480
Miss Zhu, be careful!

267
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,120
This is real.

268
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,480
It's not an illusion.

269
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,640
She's really injured.

270
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,880
She's really injured.

271
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,600
You didn't hit my vital point.

272
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,880
Seems you took pity on me.

273
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,120
I regret it

274
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,790
for not ending you with one strike.

275
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,720
I'll only ask once.

276
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,960
Where is she?

277
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,310
Qing.

278
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,600
Qing.

279
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,000
Qing.

280
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,000
Qing.

281
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,240
How does it feel?

282
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,910
Good, isn't it?

283
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,600
Do as you please

284
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:34,150
with me.

285
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,150
Just a pair of
twin water snake demons,

286
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,720
how dare you to be so arrogant.

287
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,070
Just for showing me
this ominous scene,

288
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,480
I should strangle you!

289
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,360
Such a slender waist

290
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,000
feels good to pinch.

291
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:56,960
Speak.

292
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,360
How can the illusions in this mirror

293
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,520
be broken?

294
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,600
General,

295
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,070
don't you already know?

296
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,670
What is shown in this misty realm

297
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,550
is all unchangeable truth

298
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,390
that will happen.

299
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,000
I don't believe it.

300
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,360
Acting recklessly.

301
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,760
Even you

302
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,910
will have to pay a price.

303
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,880
I've been waiting for this day.

304
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:25,720
Shut up!

305
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:51,760
I said

306
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,550
she... she is in my mirror.

307
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,240
There's no mirror

308
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,190
which can trap people.

309
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,640
The runes of the formation

310
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,310
General activated earlier are complex,

311
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,600
but I've followed her for years

312
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,960
and can still recognize some of it.

313
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:08,880
That formation

314
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,640
is called "Exchanging",

315
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:11,880
and its purpose

316
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,520
is merely to transfer
someone from one place

317
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,310
to another place

318
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,910
where the same formation is drawn.

319
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,240
The purpose of this mirror

320
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,520
is only to show where she is.

321
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,070
That woman who looks exactly like you

322
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,360
must have used
the same words to deceive her

323
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,960
to confuse her mind.

324
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:39,910
Miss Zhu.

325
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,070
As expected,

326
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,390
as long as I take on this face,

327
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,480
you can do nothing with me.

328
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,390
What a pity.

329
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,600
You're actually so devoted

330
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,190
to that Taotie.

331
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,030
What you know

332
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,760
is just this face.

333
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,910
Do you really know her?

334
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,430
Do you know
how many beasts she's devoured?

335
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:11,640
Do you know how terrifying she is?

336
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,070
Old man,

337
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,600
have you seen a gentleman in green?

338
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:28,760
No...

339
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:32,910
No rush.

340
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,520
Since you wrote down the incantation,

341
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,840
that person will come here.

342
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,670
General,

343
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,520
why not stay here

344
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,720
and drink

345
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:51,840
while waiting for him?

346
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,480
You're quite smart.

347
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,240
This wine

348
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,000
smells like
Thousand-day Drunkenness.

349
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,190
That's right.

350
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:13,150
This wine has long been extinct.

351
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,880
There are only these two jars
in the whole world.

352
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:20,550
You truly know about wine.

353
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,390
Stop.

354
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:28,270
Do you think you can leave?

355
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,190
This formation has 72

356
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,670
identical arrays.

357
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,430
How do you know

358
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,390
where she was transferred?

359
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,670
I don't need to find her.

360
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,520
I just need to find Moon Pond.

361
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,670
That is the center of the formation

362
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,790
and the entrance
we've been searching for.

363
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,270
You...

364
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:51,760
You...

365
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,640
You...

366
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,520
How did you know about Moon Pond?

367
00:25:59,190 --> 00:25:59,720
Moon.

368
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,000
Her drawing is so clumsy.

369
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,640
I just guessed

370
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,150
it must be a pond.

371
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,670
But seeing how anxious you are,

372
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,790
my guess must be correct.

373
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,520
Even so,

374
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,640
you don't know the incantation.

375
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,390
The incantation?

376
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,480
Alpha Three.

377
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,520
Beta Two.

378
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,600
Beta Two.

379
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,790
Gamma Five.

380
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,360
Delta Seven.

381
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,520
Delta Seven.

382
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,360
How could this be?

383
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,360
Surprisingly, I'm already in Moon Pond.

384
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:53,880
How could this be?

385
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:02,190
She's really here.

386
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,360
When this wine was brewed,

387
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:07,790
the world changed color
as it emerged from the kiln

388
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,150
and storms raged.

389
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,720
The mountain gods and lake spirits
took human form to ask for the wine.

390
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,790
That guy was so bold

391
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,000
to let them drink it.

392
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:22,150
Even immortals
collapsed drunk at his doorstep,

393
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,670
revealing their true forms.

394
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:28,880
It was a major embarrassment.

395
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,240
What a pity.

396
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,910
At that time,
I was on Penglai Fairy Island

397
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,270
and didn't make it in time.

398
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,640
I didn't get a single taste.

399
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,030
But today,

400
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,840
I've seen it here with you.

401
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:41,760
I must thank you

402
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,390
for fulfilling one of my wishes.

403
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,550
This wine has been poisoned.

404
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,880
If she drinks it, she'll surely die.

405
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,430
I covered my eyes,

406
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,430
and placed a deadly poison

407
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,880
in one of the jars of wine.

408
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,240
The poison is colorless and tasteless.

409
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:07,520
Even you may not be able to tell.

410
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,390
Indeed,

411
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,880
this fine wine does not come easily.

412
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:15,520
But the poison you used

413
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,120
may not work on me.

414
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,670
I don't want you to die.

415
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:23,600
I just want you to sleep
for a thousand years.

416
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,840
Do you remember

417
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,360
the last time you came,

418
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,190
you devoured eight million
of my Yangcheng citizens?

419
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,310
Thousands of my kin

420
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,030
were stuffed into wine jars by you.

421
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,880
Now that you mention it, I remember.

422
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,760
I did make drunken shrimp back then.

423
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,190
Those I didn't finish

424
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:45,910
were put back into the lake.

425
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,960
No wonder you look drunk.

426
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,310
Which one are you?

427
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,550
Why are you still drunk now?

428
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,390
Does it matter?

429
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,430
I am just a nameless man.

430
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,190
You don't need to worry

431
00:28:58,190 --> 00:28:59,600
I'll do anything to you today.

432
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,240
At your age,

433
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,360
even if you were made into wine,

434
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,240
it would taste sour and unpleasant.

435
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,640
Today I am here

436
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:07,720
only to eat your master.

437
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,360
I'm not sitting here

438
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,360
for himself.

439
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,480
I've waited a hundred years

440
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,150
and have already grown old.

441
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,360
Finally, heaven has eyes,

442
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,310
letting me wait until today
for your arrival.

443
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,720
Let's each take

444
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,240
one jar of this wine,

445
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,150
how about it?

446
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,880
As long as I can stop you,

447
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:36,110
it's worth all my efforts.

448
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,040
You don't need to do this.

449
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,560
I won't spare your master.

450
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,040
As for this wine,

451
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,110
I'll come back to drink it
after eating your master.

452
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,880
I heard you came this time

453
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,430
with a human companion.

454
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,000
So what if I did?

455
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,470
May I ask,

456
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,230
how long does a human live?

457
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,680
General, you roam this world

458
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,190
for how many years

459
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:00,230
and how many people
have crossed paths with you?

460
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:03,470
Drinking, singing,
and living in splendor.

461
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,880
Where are they now?

462
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,950
Where is Duan Qingtang?

463
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,040
Where is Mei Dongjing?

464
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,400
Where's Monk Lotus,

465
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,470
who gave you your name

466
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:14,920
and trapped you in Wuxia City?

467
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,590
In the end,
you are the only one left here.

468
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:20,190
From now on,

469
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,350
there will be endless years.

470
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,590
The nights will be long,

471
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,190
and you will remain alone.

472
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,680
You're right.

473
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,520
Where is he now?

474
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:13,560
Who are you really?

475
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,470
Why do you know so much?

476
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:17,950
No need to worry.

477
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,590
All things are transient

478
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,920
like bubbles and shadows,

479
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,070
dreams and illusions,

480
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:24,710
dew and lightning.

481
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,560
You've lived a thousand years

482
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,350
but still can't comprehend

483
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,470
and let go the obsession in your heart.

484
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,000
You've repeated the mistake.

485
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,190
So why cling to it?

486
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:39,040
Why not seize the day
and enjoy the wine?

487
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,590
Well said.

488
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:53,710
Seize the day and enjoy the wine.

489
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:11,560
Miss Zhu.

490
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,190
Miss Zhu!

491
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,310
Don't drink.

492
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:32,920
Don't drink!

493
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,590
Where did that arrow come from?

494
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:46,830
Miss Zhu!

495
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,070
Miss Zhu.

496
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,160
Miss Zhu.

497
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:58,350
Qing.

498
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:01,680
Miss Zhu.

499
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,000
Miss Zhu.

500
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,430
Miss Zhu.

501
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,640
Miss Zhu.

502
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,230
Old man,

503
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,430
you're eloquent.

504
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,710
Lord Wuchang is lucky to have

505
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,680
such a loyal subordinate like you.

506
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,880
But it's a pity

507
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,680
that all of this

508
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,640
is just an illusion.

509
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,000
Even though you entered
the formation's center,

510
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:37,000
breaking the mechanism within

511
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,880
will still require effort.

512
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:43,640
Putting in effort
to break this mechanism

513
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,190
is troublesome.

514
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,280
Brother!

515
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,560
I've heard

516
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,520
that the illusions of your clan
are unmatched,

517
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:04,680
and yet now,

518
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,640
how could it be?

519
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,640
Taotie

520
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,190
has such a strong mind

521
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,760
and broke through my illusion.

522
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,630
However, her power

523
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,520
must have been greatly diminished.

524
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,760
What's left

525
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,150
depends on the performance
of the Yangcheng aquatic tribe.

526
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,320
Miss Zhu.

527
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,630
Miss Zhu.

528
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,520
Are you okay?

529
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,560
What about you? Are you hurt?

530
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,710
Your wound is still bleeding.

531
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,470
Let me treat it for you.

532
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,560
It's fine.

533
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,630
It's fine, Qing.

534
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,280
Don't move.

535
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,560
Qing,

536
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,390
you're getting bolder now.

537
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,520
Chang Qing.

538
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,870
You swore to take the Dragon's blood

539
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:08,840
and open the Portal

540
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,560
for them.

541
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,470
Have you forgotten?

542
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,150
I haven't.

543
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,520
I will never forget

544
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,280
if I reach into her wound right now,

545
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,190
I could take the Dragon's blood, right?

546
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,150
Must I, for a promise,

547
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,910
have to take her life?

548
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:29,600
I've already told you

549
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,120
this wound won't harm me.

550
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:34,600
Are you done?

551
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,470
Yes.

552
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,150
With such serious injuries,

553
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,040
why are you running around?

554
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,800
I'm going to capture Lord Wuchang

555
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
and grind him into mince.

556
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,760
Miss Zhu,

557
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,040
why are you
so obsessed with past grudges

558
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,710
to commit such cruel acts?

559
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,600
When will vengeance end?

560
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,560
I may not know

561
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,430
what happened

562
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,710
between you and Lord Wuchang,

563
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,870
but can't you let it go?

564
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:09,390
Impossible.

565
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,710
I will definitely do

566
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,150
what needs to be done.

567
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,040
Lord Wuchang.

568
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,910
How dare you use such
despicable means against me.

569
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,390
Get out here!

570
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:38,950
What's wrong?

571
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,120
Lord Wuchang set a barrier

572
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,950
to trap me here.

573
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,040
Why didn't it stop me?

574
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,630
It's only targeting me.

575
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,190
Who dares stop me?

576
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,670
Bachong Ying.

577
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,870
You dare?

578
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,960
The spear is shaking like this.

579
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,150
You're just as coward

580
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,800
as you used to be.

581
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,430
Why don't you step aside?

582
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,960
Though I am weak and slow,

583
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,670
I've always admired you.

584
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,960
Now, I

585
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,960
also have people behind me
I must protect,

586
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:51,830
so I cannot retreat.

587
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,320
My master has not yet escaped danger,

588
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,870
so I dare not die either.

589
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:06,760
Last time,

590
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:10,280
I made brewed crab.

591
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:11,870
And this time,

592
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,280
I've invented a new recipe,

593
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,670
hand-washed crab.

594
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,830
First, chop your master into pieces,

595
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:21,390
then fry with sesame oil.

596
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:24,320
Finally, add ten seasonings,

597
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,190
mix them well

598
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,430
and it's ready to eat.

599
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,520
How does that sound?

600
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,870
As a servant,

601
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,430
I shall be loyal and righteous

602
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,390
and protect my master.

603
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,320
But I'm not competent enough

604
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,000
and suffered such
great pain and humiliation.

605
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,320
I truly feel ashamed.

606
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,110
Loyalty,

607
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,760
righteousness.

608
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,760
Who among you

609
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,040
dares to say

610
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,630
these words in front of me?

611
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:53,480
General.

612
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:59,110
Your always like
to bring up old matters.

613
00:39:00,430 --> 00:39:01,720
Hundreds of years have passed.

614
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,720
Why do you still cling to them?

615
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,350
Enough nonsense!

616
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:09,670
Miss Zhu.

617
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:14,720
If not now,

618
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,000
when will you take action?

619
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,240
Stop.

620
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:31,720
Stop, all of you.

621
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,960
Stop it, everyone.

622
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:35,350
Do not be disrespectful to General.

623
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:36,800
Master.

624
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,110
Why have you come out?

625
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:38,760
Insolent!

626
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:40,630
Who permitted you to act like this?

627
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,080
Fengyi,

628
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,240
do you not know my principles?

629
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:48,760
General.

630
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,190
Wuchang,

631
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,760
how dare you set layers of traps for me.

632
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,150
Do you think I'll spare you lightly?

633
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:02,240
I admit guilt.

634
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,150
500 years ago,

635
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,240
you faced a heavenly calamity
and great disaster,

636
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,080
and were saved by Master Lotus.

637
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,480
You made a vow

638
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,720
to repay him with your life.

639
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,630
Is this true or not?

640
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,150
True.

641
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,000
Then how did you

642
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,480
repay him?

643
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,560
It's fault.

644
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,830
I've always felt
deeply ashamed towards you.

645
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,240
Naturally, I should willingly
offer myself for you.

646
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,080
Since it's your own choice,

647
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,430
then what about now?

648
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:39,390
You've schemed to take my life.

649
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,590
You're not just

650
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,280
a cowardly rat,

651
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,350
but also

652
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,000
a hypocrite cloaked in righteousness.

653
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,000
General,

654
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,320
I did not plot against you.

655
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,390
Still pretending!

656
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:50,960
General.

657
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,350
I...

658
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,110
Don't blame Master.

659
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:56,110
It was I who did it.
