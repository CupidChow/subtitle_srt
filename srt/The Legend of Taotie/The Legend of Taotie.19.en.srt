193
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,070
Oh, Mr. Lu.

194
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,750
Did you

195
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,800
kill him?

196
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,240
Your department sent a suspect.

197
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,240
Isn't it ridiculous?

198
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,270
- That's right.
- Yeah.

199
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,950
Since you guys suspect me,

200
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,070
I'll have someone else

201
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,830
investigate this case.

202
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,590
Yundun,

203
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,590
take me back.

204
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,920
His Highness will interrogate me.

205
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
But Mr. Lu...

206
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,920
If your men interrogate you,

207
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,270
they will shield you.

208
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:33,680
You...

209
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,390
That's right.

210
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,950
Yeah. They'll shield you.

211
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,120
They certainly will.

212
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:38,590
I'm his witness.

213
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,070
What's she doing here?

214
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,320
She's from Pingyue House.

215
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,710
Mr. Lu didn't kill this man.

216
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,000
Last night, Mr. Lu was at Pingyue House

217
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:02,920
and never went away.

218
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,040
So, he can't be the murderer.

219
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,190
If you don't believe me,

220
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,800
all the other girls

221
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,040
can be his witnesses.

222
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,320
Miss Qu from Pingyue House

223
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,830
came here to be your witness.

224
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,710
Mr. Lu,

225
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,590
you're so lucky.

226
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,070
Last night, Mr. Lu

227
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,510
must have had a great time.

228
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,390
What are you thinking?

229
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,320
Mr. Lu likes this lady.

230
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,120
Don't fantasize.

231
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:33,480
Don't be ridiculous.

232
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,590
I just think Miss Qu Yan

233
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
looks really nice.

234
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,950
She's a gorgeous lady.

235
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:39,270
Everybody thinks she's nice.

236
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,590
Such fresh lotuses

237
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,040
should be brighter.

238
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,320
If only I could live so gorgeously!

239
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,360
When will you get the Dragon's blood?

240
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,920
When will you get the Dragon's blood?

241
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:53,710
Qing.

242
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,120
You're in a good mood.

243
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,630
The lotuses look great.

244
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,040
You rarely enjoy my painting like this.

245
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,710
Because your previous paintings

246
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,950
didn't satisfy me.

247
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,000
You never looked at them carefully.

248
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,680
Cuiyan, Yingtao.

249
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,190
Get me my stick vessel.

250
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:30,000
Let me see who's lucky enough

251
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,120
to taste the Hibiscus Flame.

252
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,880
Miss Zhu,

253
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,440
you don't need to draw.

254
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,320
Only eight men bought the sticks.

255
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:42,950
Eight?

256
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:44,950
Look.

257
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,360
Eight, exactly.

258
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,440
Miss Zhu,

259
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:49,270
those people thought

260
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,240
a hundred liang for an egg

261
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,830
would be too expensive.

262
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,270
Besides,

263
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,680
they didn't know
if they could be picked.

264
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,480
If they failed,

265
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,440
their money would be wasted.

266
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,800
The rosefinch's egg is extraordinary.

267
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,320
When they taste some, they'll know.

268
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,630
Not to mention a hundred liang,

269
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
they can't taste it anywhere else

270
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,150
with even a thousand liang.

271
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:09,440
Miss Zhu,

272
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,560
what's the mystery
in the rosefinch's egg?

273
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,800
Does it taste great?

274
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,680
If I tell you, the mystery will be gone.

275
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,440
People say the Hibiscus Flame is ominous.

276
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,720
It brings bad luck.

277
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,270
Ignore the rumors.

278
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,230
They'll regret it.

279
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,270
Miss Zhu,

280
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,560
it's just a new dish.

281
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,510
Why do you do it in such a big way?

282
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,510
You draw sticks

283
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:33,600
and each person can only eat once.

284
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,230
It never happened before.

285
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,320
You know what?

286
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,270
The rosefinch's egg isn't ordinary.

287
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,750
Each person can have
the Hibiscus Flame only once.

288
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,560
If someone eats it again,

289
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,150
he will die.

290
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:47,990
He really will.

291
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,920
Is that true?

292
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,320
If it's so dangerous,

293
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,720
why will you make the dish?

294
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,040
Will you kill people?

295
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,840
It's the ultimate quest for food.

296
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,870
The greater the food is,

297
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,720
the bigger price you have to pay.

298
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:03,390
Just like the bee venom of Bee Soup.

299
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,150
Everybody knew it was poisonous,

300
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,110
but they all wanted to try it.

301
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,920
That's what's fun about it.

302
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,440
Yeah.

303
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,720
Even the rouge salesman
outside our restaurant

304
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,350
spent a hundred liang on one stick.

305
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,110
That's right.

306
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:15,600
He's a mere salesman.

307
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,080
How does he have so much money?

308
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,800
He must know the value of the dish

309
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:21,200
and wants to taste it at whatever cost.

310
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,150
Miss Zhu.

311
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:26,990
Heng.

312
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,040
There you are.

313
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,990
Thanks for coming, Your Highness.

314
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,560
To what do we owe this pleasure?

315
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,440
The Hibiscus Flame, of course.

316
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,040
But you bought a stick.

317
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,040
You came in such a hurry.

318
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,200
I guess you have an important visitor.

319
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:50,720
No.

320
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,110
It's just...

321
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,080
Wan'er's birthday is coming.

322
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,630
Miss Zhu, do you have time

323
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,110
to go to my mansion
and make the Hibiscus Flame

324
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,800
for her birthday meal?

325
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:09,440
Your Highness, you're late.

326
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,920
We've sold out the dishes

327
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,630
at the price of 100 liang for each.

328
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,320
I'll triple the pay.

329
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,510
You really love her, Your Highness.

330
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:21,720
You're quite generous.

331
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,630
His Highness is rich.

332
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:24,560
Such expenses

333
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:26,230
are just a drop in the bucket.

334
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:26,920
They mean nothing.

335
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,470
A man doesn't love a woman

336
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,040
by spending money on her,

337
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,920
but caring for her.

338
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:37,990
You're right, Mr. Chang.

339
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,390
Earlier today, I asked Wan'er.

340
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,750
A man has ten thousand liang of gold,

341
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,390
but he only gives you a thousand.

342
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,320
Another man has only ten liang,

343
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,040
but he gives you all of it.

344
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,110
Which one is more valuable?

345
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,080
How did Her Grace reply?

346
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,720
True love is more valuable.

347
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,990
If you had a true love for her,

348
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:10,720
you wouldn't often come here

349
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,720
and make people understand.

350
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,080
Qing.

351
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,600
I'm here to see if you need any help.

352
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,470
I can cook this dish

353
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:39,720
all by myself.

354
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:41,110
Cuiyan.

355
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,110
Do you think

356
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:43,470
Mr. Chang has been weird lately?

357
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,960
What do you mean?

358
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,320
Wherever Miss Zhu goes,

359
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,110
he will be there

360
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,750
without leaving her side.

361
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,720
Think about it.

362
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:52,680
Does he

363
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,110
want Miss Zhu to give him a pay rise?

364
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,800
This egg

365
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,470
almost had life.

366
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:02,960
Every egg contained

367
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,110
infinite expectations and hope.

368
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,440
Are you saying

369
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,440
it was also alive?

370
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,320
No.

371
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,920
This is just a rosefinch's egg.

372
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,350
The Rosefinch's Spirit Egg

373
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,110
from a couple of rosefinches

374
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,350
can actually hatch.

375
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,750
Since it has no life now,

376
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:23,680
why don't I cook it

377
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,600
and let people taste this fancy dish?

378
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,350
For the Hibiscus Flame,

379
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,320
timing is the most important.

380
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,350
The slightest lapse
could lead to bubbles.

381
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,230
So, I must control it myself.

382
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,040
Such a fancy dish.

383
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,040
The ingredients are rare.

384
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,600
Give one bowl to each of them.

385
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,470
Such a small bowl.

386
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,680
It's too little.

387
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,320
It smells great, though.

388
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:26,960
What's going on?

389
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,150
When I eat this dish,

390
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,990
I think of my childhood.

391
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,350
I couldn't fall asleep

392
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,470
unless my mother fed me

393
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,990
a sweetmeat.

394
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,470
What's wrong?

395
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,390
Diners usually praise

396
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,040
Miss Zhu's dishes.

397
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,840
Now, why do they cry?

398
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,320
I don't know.

399
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,870
Shall I go ask Miss Zhu?

400
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,560
No. Let's keep looking.

401
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,390
Before I passed
the Imperial Examination,

402
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,510
I had a hard time studying.

403
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,750
Back then, a lady

404
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,510
prepared me a midnight snack every night.

405
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,350
Later, she married someone else.

406
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,350
It was merely a pancake.

407
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,720
But I still

408
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,990
can't forget the taste.

409
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,920
It's the best food I've ever had.

410
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,320
I was scared.

411
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,510
I thought Miss Zhu

412
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,990
screwed the dish again.

413
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,040
Everything seems to be fine.

414
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,200
To give it to Wan'er as a present

415
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,630
or eat it now...

416
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,390
The choice is yours.

417
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,680
The taste...

418
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,800
It's such an extraordinary dish.

419
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,840
You used the eggy wash to make

420
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,080
a hibiscus in full bloom.

421
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,230
It looks elegant

422
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,750
and smells great.

423
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,680
Miss Zhu, you cook

424
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,440
really marvelously.

425
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,040
This isn't ordinary egg wash.

426
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,560
Eating this dish

427
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,040
will remind you
of what you can't let go.

428
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:51,960
Son,

429
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,600
this jade pendant can keep you safe.

430
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,270
From now on,

431
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,200
you must always wear it.

432
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,110
Understand?

433
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,040
Does it remind you of anything?

434
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,600
No.

435
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,800
The dish you made

436
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,560
tastes very good.

437
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,270
Then, do you remember

438
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,990
calling me Miss Fifth?

439
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:49,320
I did?

440
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,960
I don't remember.

441
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,750
Did I hear it wrong?

442
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,630
No way.

443
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,680
Over all these years,

444
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,840
no one else has called me

445
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,800
Miss Fifth.

446
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,750
And no one else knows this name.

447
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:10,110
Are you saying

448
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,920
you used to be Miss Fifth?

449
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,680
Yes.

450
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,390
But since that man was gone,

451
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,960
I've never used this name again.

452
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,040
Because it's a name for him.

453
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,040
I guess this man

454
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,110
means a lot to you.

455
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,110
May I ask who he is?

456
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,270
Maybe in this life,

457
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,920
he forgets what happened before.

458
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,240
[Residence of the Prince of Langya]

459
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:03,320
I've said what I have to say.

460
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,470
Why haven't you left Wuxia yet?

461
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:08,150
How dare you come here for me?

462
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,920
If His Highness knows,

463
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,680
you and I will be killed.

464
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,230
Wan'er,

465
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,680
I'm sorry.

466
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,630
I shouldn't have disturbed your life.

467
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,790
But I've got a treasure.

468
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:19,270
Look.

469
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,670
What are you doing?

470
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,510
Glad it's not broken.

471
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:24,880
Wan'er,

472
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,120
I even killed someone

473
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,960
to get this.

474
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,080
Come on. Take a look.

475
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:30,670
Are you insane?

476
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,310
I warn you.

477
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,840
If you don't go,
I'll have the guards arrest you.

478
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,550
Wan'er,

479
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:35,960
don't you remember?

480
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,360
I gave it to you before.

481
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,360
Leave now.

482
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:40,910
Wan'er,

483
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,550
I'll come back.

484
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,310
Go that way.

485
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,120
That way.

486
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,510
Come have a look.

487
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:54,790
Sir,

488
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,790
come have a look.

489
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:01,150
I'm not interested in masks.

490
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,880
But I'm interested in you.

491
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,480
Come on. Give me a hug.

492
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,390
Let go of me!

493
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,360
This man's drunk.

494
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,430
Interesting.

495
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:13,790
Stop running.

496
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:15,430
What are they doing?

497
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:16,310
Let me go.

498
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,720
What's wrong with this man?

499
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,550
It's so hot.

500
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,360
Let go of that girl.

501
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:20,960
It burns.

502
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,310
It's back.

503
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,840
It really is.

504
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,960
I know it's back.

505
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,240
It's back.

506
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,880
It's just back.

507
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,430
I knew it.

508
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:00,430
Look.

509
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:01,960
You have no idea.

510
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,310
A man was burned
on the street last night.

511
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,120
That's him.

512
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,840
Look. How miserable.

513
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,670
Look. He's burned.

514
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:11,480
Yeah.

515
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,510
Did anyone see

516
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,190
how this man died?

517
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,390
- No.
- No.

518
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,720
I... I saw that.

519
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,670
Last night,

520
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,960
he was walking on the street

521
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,360
when he suddenly burned up.

522
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,120
He was yelling something like,

523
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,840
"It's back."

524
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,000
Yeah. That's it.

525
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,910
Two men died.

526
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,840
Go figure out who this man is,

527
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:41,430
who he met last night,

528
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:42,910
and what he did.

529
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,080
Yes.

530
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,190
It's raining harder.

531
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,270
Take his body back.

532
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,120
Yes.

533
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,360
I don't know.

534
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,190
Umbrellas for sale.

535
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:16,600
Mr. Lu.

536
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:17,960
Wait for me.

537
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,360
An umbrella, please.

538
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:22,760
Here.

539
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,510
Here, Mr. Lu.

540
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,550
It's not raining hard.

541
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,190
I don't need an umbrella.

542
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,880
Umbrellas for sale.

543
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,550
Miss Qu.

544
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,430
Wait here for me.

545
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,310
Hey, Mr. Lu.

546
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,190
My umbrella...

547
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,510
Miss Qu.

548
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,430
Mr. Lu?

549
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,030
What a coincidence.

550
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,910
I didn't expect to see you here.

551
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,510
What are you doing here?

552
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,790
We're investigating a case.

553
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,430
Why are you all alone in the rain?

554
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:05,720
Here.

555
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:06,550
Take it.

556
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,150
What about you?

557
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,080
The rain is very little.

558
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,120
Don't worry.

559
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,790
Stop laughing.

560
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,270
Let's go.

561
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:27,190
- No.
- We didn't.

562
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,840
Mr. Lu has good taste.

563
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,640
That's right.

564
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:49,550
Some more.

565
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:49,960
All right.

566
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,310
Done. Where else?

567
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:52,720
There.

568
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:53,790
Here?

569
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:56,000
Up there.

570
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,510
Here?

571
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:58,430
Left.

572
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,270
Paint some more.

573
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,320
[Hibiscus Flame]

574
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,680
Miss Zhu,

575
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:11,640
you're here.

576
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,080
I have something to ask you.

577
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:14,470
What is it?

578
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:16,640
Miss Zhu, have you heard?

579
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:18,230
Yesterday, on the street,

580
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,920
a man self-ignited and died.

581
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,640
He's one of the diners

582
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,950
who had the Hibiscus Flame

583
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,920
in your restaurant.

584
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,920
I want to ask you

585
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,600
if you know what happened.

586
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,270
He self-ignited?

587
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,400
Miss Zhu,

588
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,270
what egg is it

589
00:34:38,990 --> 00:34:39,750
on this painting?

590
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:41,950
Bird egg.

591
00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:43,600
Bird egg?

592
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:45,080
What kind of bird?

593
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:45,790
I don't know.

594
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,710
Cuiyan and Yingtao got this egg

595
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,400
from a suburban bird's nest.

596
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,750
It smelt so good.

597
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,990
So, I made the Hibiscus Flame.

598
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,550
When did they get the egg?

599
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,880
Isn't it the rose...?

600
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,550
Bath chap.

601
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:57,030
Oh no.

602
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,550
We haven't fetched the bath chap

603
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,640
we ordered from Butcher Zhang.

604
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,200
Qing,

605
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,160
go fetch it for me.

606
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,030
Did we order any bath chap?

607
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,280
[Hibiscus Flame]

608
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,640
Look what you've done.

609
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,640
Why do you still have time for tea?

610
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,440
Miss Zhu,

611
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,840
what upsets you?

612
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,920
Have some tea and calm down.

613
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,200
I tried so hard

614
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,510
to offer people delicious food.

615
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,270
No one would taste it twice.

616
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:12,790
What did you do?

617
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,640
You knew someone had eaten it before,

618
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,600
but you didn't tell me.

619
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,990
So, you gave me the egg

620
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,360
because you had an evil plan.

621
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,710
A man who ate the egg twice

622
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,710
deserved death.

623
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,920
You can't imagine how happy I am.

624
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,080
Then, I'll make you unhappy.

625
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:30,880
Go to the Inspection Department with me.

626
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,680
Let's see if you can make me go.

627
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,550
Do you remember what I told you?

628
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,470
When I find the murderer
who killed my husband

629
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,160
and take revenge,

630
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:21,680
I want you not to blame me.

631
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,160
Yes.

632
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,550
Will you let me explain everything?

633
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,400
If you still think I'm guilty,

634
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,680
I will go with you.

635
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:31,710
Miss Zhu,

636
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,950
my late husband and I
lived in the mountain 16 years ago.

637
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,440
We once had some eggs.

638
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,790
We expected them to hatch.

639
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,470
Unexpectedly, they were stolen.

640
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,880
My husband looked for them,

641
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,470
only to find they were eaten.

642
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,470
Only broken shells were left.

643
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,920
When he searched for the murderers,

644
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,640
he was killed by some archers.

645
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,400
I rushed to rescue him.

646
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,160
Yet we were no match for the archers.

647
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,080
To save my life, he died.

648
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,400
So,

649
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:10,400
those who ate the rosefinch's egg before

650
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,310
were the murderers.

651
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,790
These years, I've been thinking.

652
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,920
My eggs were able to sway.

653
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,400
Every day, they swayed and swayed,

654
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,550
trying to break out of the shell.

655
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,030
Before my babies were born,

656
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,710
they were eaten by some humans.

657
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:38,880
I believe

658
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,750
they each had a face, then.

659
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,790
My husband died.

660
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,120
I can never have babies again.

661
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,310
These eggs I had this year...

662
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,080
I knew they wouldn't hatch.

663
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,710
But I kept trying.

664
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,470
I wish I would be blessed

665
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,470
and have new babies.

666
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,510
But again and again, I was disappointed.

667
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,360
I really hate it.

668
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,750
My husband and I
are the last couple of rosefinches

669
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,360
after the Portal was cut off.

670
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:15,640
Without a male rosefinch,

671
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,880
my clan will die out.

672
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,470
Tell me, Miss Zhu.

673
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:27,440
What is the crime of exterminating a clan?

674
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:32,680
Capital crime.

675
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,510
Miss Zhu, you managed

676
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,080
to make such a fancy dish

677
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,550
and I took revenge.

678
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,880
I'll repay you at whatever cost.

679
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,550
I don't need you to repay me.

680
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,680
I just think Lu Ying

681
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,600
really cares for you.

682
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,550
Why don't you...?

683
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,680
He's a human.

684
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,160
I'm a demon.

685
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,120
How could we be together?

686
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,550
Qing,

687
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,990
if a demon

688
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,790
is with a human,

689
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,310
what will happen?

690
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:25,950
Are you

691
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,600
thinking of this because you've heard

692
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:28,920
Miss Qu Yan's story?

693
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,080
I used to think Qu Yan was pretentious.

694
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,640
But today, I got to know

695
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,030
she had the reason for that.

696
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,270
She's been stuck in her past sufferings

697
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,080
and can't get out.

698
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,360
I can tell Lu Ying cares for her.

699
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:46,920
I think his existence

700
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,230
may bring hope to Qu Yan.

701
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:51,880
But the two of them...

702
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,360
One is a demon

703
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:55,750
while the other is a human.

704
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,470
If they're together,

705
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,080
they may have a lot of problems.

706
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,600
They'll worry a lot more, too.

707
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:08,400
People think

708
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,990
humans and demons can't get along.

709
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,680
But true love

710
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,400
can make them

711
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,510
break through everything.

712
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,440
But now, Lu Ying doesn't know

713
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,920
what Qu Yan really is.

714
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,470
He's an archer
at the Inspection Department.

715
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,920
I don't think he'll easily accept her.

716
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,360
People have a lot of biases

717
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,600
against demon beasts.

718
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:38,120
Actually, some demons are good

719
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,880
while some are bad.

720
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,400
Just like humans.

721
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,080
Whoever the girl is,

722
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:54,360
if a man loves her,

723
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,360
he will cherish her

724
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:58,080
and protect her.

725
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:02,920
Just like me.

726
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,680
Even if you're a Taotie,

727
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,270
I'm not scared.

728
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,510
But you aren't very nice to me.

729
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,790
What else do I have to do?

730
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,600
I poured out my soul,
but you didn't feel it.

731
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,360
You did?

732
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:25,510
Before,

733
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,030
you took away
Bai Ze's Supernatural Creatures

734
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,310
and haven't returned it yet.

735
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,510
That's not my fault.

736
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,030
I don't care.

737
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,550
For the sake

738
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,510
you begged Physician Xuan to save me,

739
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,750
I'll let it go for the moment.

740
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:51,270
If someone sacrifices his life for you,

741
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,880
will you promise him one thing?

742
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,550
That depends.

743
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:02,200
If he wants me to sacrifice my life,

744
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:02,920
he would rather not save me.

745
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:05,680
Or when we owe each other,

746
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,160
it will never be over.

747
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,510
We have to stick together for centuries.

748
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,470
If people don't owe each other,

749
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,950
how can they meet in the next life?

750
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:25,680
You're really weird today.

751
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:31,030
If I offer you my life,

752
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,880
what will you offer me?

753
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,200
It depends on what you want.

754
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:37,710
The Lotus Tower is your life.

755
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:44,120
You want the Lotus Tower?

756
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,470
What if I do?

757
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,030
But you can't take it away.

758
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,510
You know what?

759
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:17,990
Qing,

760
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,750
