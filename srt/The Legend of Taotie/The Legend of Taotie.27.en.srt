[The Legend of TAOTIE]

22
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,080
[Episode 27]

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,360
General, I've been guilty to you.

24
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,750
I should give my life to you.

25
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,440
You say you're willing.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:29,960
But what did you do?

27
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,910
You set a trap to kill me.

28
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,080
I think you're not only

29
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,800
a cowardly loser

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,880
but also

31
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,520
a sanctimonious hypocrite.

32
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,520
General,

33
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,830
I didn't set a trap against you.

34
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,910
Stop playing innocent!

35
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,390
General.

36
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:45,880
I...

37
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,550
Don't blame His Lordship.

38
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,550
I did all this.

39
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,720
My Lord,

40
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,960
I did everything
without your permission.

41
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,160
I wanted to suffer for you.

42
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,240
So you could rest.

43
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,110
General, you know what?

44
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,110
You ate him every hundred years.

45
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,110
That's why he's been so weak.

46
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,000
Every time, he endured the pain

47
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,190
of regrowing.

48
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,030
I had to watch my husband

49
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,750
suffer like this

50
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,470
when my heart was broken.

51
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:37,360
I didn't dare to revolt.

52
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,600
Again and again, I accompanied him

53
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,800
when he grew from a crying baby

54
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,520
into an adult.

55
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,550
I never complained.

56
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,800
But this time,

57
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,110
General...

58
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:55,800
You want to kill my husband

59
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,470
and take him away from me.

60
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,080
I really can't stand it.

61
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,520
Do you have to

62
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,670
strip this little hope

63
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,000
from me?

64
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,510
Shut up.

65
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,230
Didn't I ask you

66
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,110
not to interfere with this?

67
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,510
Why did you decide for me?

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,200
You disobeyed me and without my order,

69
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,390
you tried to kill General.

70
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,600
You're making me

71
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,440
a treacherous man.

72
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:43,600
Since all of you are so stubborn,

73
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,670
I would rather not be

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
your lord.

75
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:48,670
My Lord,

76
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,640
I am wrong.

77
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,390
Don't be pissed off.

78
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,230
Otherwise,

79
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,350
I would be so guilty.

80
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,510
General,

81
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,950
I wasn't too strict with them.

82
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,880
They disobeyed me.

83
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,000
When I was in a coma,

84
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,230
they tried to fight you.

85
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
It's only because

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,230
they wanted to protect me.

87
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,880
I should take the blame

88
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,640
for what they did.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,880
Please show some mercy

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and spare them.

91
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,200
I can spare them.

92
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,110
But you and I

93
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,880
should be done.

94
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,920
General, how could you be so cruel?

95
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,040
What wrong did His Lordship do?

96
00:05:59,040 --> 00:05:59,920
How dare you?

97
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,110
Shut up.

98
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:05,150
You love your husband.

99
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,240
You suffered great pain

100
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,830
just to save him
at the risk of your life.

101
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,760
I can spare you.

102
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,150
But I will never

103
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,150
spare him.

104
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,240
Dear,

105
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,960
why are you so stubborn?

106
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:32,110
You know I won't let you.

107
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,520
Send her back to her room.

108
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,550
My Lady.

109
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:46,680
My Lord.

110
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,080
My Lord.

111
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,520
Go, My Lady.

112
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:53,080
My Lord.

113
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,520
My Lord.

114
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,920
My Lord.

115
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:02,800
My Lord.

116
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,590
My Lord.

117
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:10,800
Transform.

118
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,550
My Lord!

119
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,360
- My Lord!
- My Lord!

120
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,110
You think Taotie is innocent
when she kills people.

121
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,830
You're just making a fool of yourself

122
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,870
by showing mercy and caring for people.

123
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,360
Miss Zhu,

124
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,310
stop.

125
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,520
Qing, what are you doing?

126
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,310
Stop doing anything so murderous.

127
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,960
Before, you only tried to persuade me

128
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,960
not to eat demons.

129
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,560
How dare you stop me now?

130
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,750
Out of my way!

131
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,440
Stop killing anyone innocent!

132
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,150
He's innocent?

133
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:48,750
You...

134
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,710
Mr. Chang, no.

135
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,750
Lord Wuchang,

136
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,680
you have one last chance.

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,880
Give me the prayer beads

138
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,590
and cut your throat.

139
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,480
Otherwise,

140
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,880
all the aquatic animals in your region

141
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,710
will die today.

142
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,630
General, you can eat me
a thousand times.

143
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,750
But if you want the beads,

144
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,390
I really can't do anything.

145
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,190
General, you know.

146
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,510
You can't take them away

147
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,150
unless he is here.

148
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,000
Follow me to save His Lordship.

149
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,630
Since you don't give them to me,

150
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,240
I'll have to get them by force.

151
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,040
No, General!

152
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,120
Don't try to break in.

153
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:06,480
Come down.

154
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,120
Or you'll lose all your power

155
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,150
and completely disappear.

156
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,040
Why does she have to eat you

157
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,070
and why do you not revolt?

158
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,360
You have no idea, Mr. Chang.

159
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,630
I feel guilty for Monk Lotus and General.

160
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,150
500 years ago,

161
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,710
the Black Qilin King
tried to reign over the world.

162
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,440
Monk Lotus and General

163
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,830
fought together against him.

164
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,070
In the battle at Songyang Pass,

165
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,750
Qiongqi armies

166
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,070
besieged General,

167
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,800
so she couldn't help Monk Lotus.

168
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:45,360
In the end, she had to watch him

169
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,680
become the Tower.

170
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:52,040
I gave them my promise.

171
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,950
I would bring a hundred thousand soldiers

172
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,070
to help them.

173
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,480
But...

174
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,920
I got cold feet.

175
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,560
So, Monk Lotus sacrificed himself

176
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,190
to suppress the Black Qilin King.

177
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,190
I betrayed them.

178
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,560
I deserve to be General's food.

179
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,630
How did he annoy you?

180
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,480
Why do you have to eat him?

181
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,560
Qing,

182
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,070
before you know the whole story,

183
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,070
don't jump to a conclusion.

184
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,120
If you're such a fighter,

185
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,630
why didn't you fight

186
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,590
against the Black Qilin King?

187
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:49,270
Tell me.

188
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,390
I was wrong about her.

189
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,590
She wanted to eat Lord Wuchang

190
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:07,800
just because

191
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,590
he went back on his word.

192
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,240
She had the right reason.

193
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,510
But I was always wrong about her.

194
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,120
Miss Zhu!

195
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:35,630
Miss Zhu!

196
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,680
General.

197
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:47,880
You...

198
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,120
Mr. Tan,

199
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,710
she's injured.

200
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,800
It's the time.

201
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:53,880
Lord Wuchang,

202
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,150
I really didn't see this coming.

203
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,480
The puppet strings are good.

204
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,190
Why didn't you use them before?

205
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,390
What...

206
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,590
Puppet strings?

207
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,120
Miss Zhu,

208
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,270
he's the thief.

209
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:20,390
He works for His Highness.

210
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:28,950
Your Highness,

211
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,040
what do you want?

212
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:36,680
I told you.

213
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,560
I came here to capture the demon.

214
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,630
I just didn't say

215
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,040
I would capture her.

216
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:49,070
She's mine.

217
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:54,950
You are him.

218
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
But why are you so different?

219
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:57,950
I'm not him!

220
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,120
I'm not anyone you imagine.

221
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,270
I'm the Prince of Langya.

222
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,480
That's not true.

223
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:08,150
When you blend with the beads,

224
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,920
you'll get back the memories

225
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,920
and remember what we experienced.

226
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,320
His Highness is Monk Lotus?

227
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,480
Funny.

228
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,190
You take me for his substitute, huh?

229
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,320
I'm Zhao Heng, the Prince of Langya.

230
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:30,800
I'm never anybody else.

231
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
Nor can you turn me

232
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:35,510
into a substitute

233
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,920
with those beads.

234
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,320
Since you love her,

235
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:48,040
why do you hurt her now?

236
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,750
She never

237
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:53,320
loves me.

238
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,480
Miss Zhu, don't struggle.

239
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:13,710
Or you'll be crushed.

240
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,560
Heng.

241
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,150
Miss Zhu.

242
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:08,710
Get up.

243
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,750
You're injured.

244
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:10,560
What are you doing here?

245
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,710
Are you all right?

246
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,390
Miss Zhu.

247
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,510
How could you be so silly?

248
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,560
Heng,

249
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,320
I had meant to give it to you

250
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:31,510
after you got back your memories.

251
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,190
Your Highness,

252
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:46,070
do you really want to kill her?

253
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,800
My Lord,

254
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,440
don't be deceived anymore.

255
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
I'll say it gain.

256
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,680
Look carefully.

257
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,720
I'm not anyone else!

258
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,560
You're just Taotie.

259
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:28,390
Taotie.

260
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:30,390
The demon!

261
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,150
What did you say?

262
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,470
I'm just Taotie?

263
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,720
You're not him.

264
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,270
You're really not him.

265
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,600
- My Lord.
- My Lord.

266
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,230
Save General!

267
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,110
Monk.

268
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:26,630
My Lady.

269
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,680
Be careful, My Lady.

270
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,080
The shield is inactivated.

271
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,230
It's impossible.

272
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,350
His Lordship activated the shield.

273
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,080
Whoever gets close

274
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:44,800
will be struck by lightning.

275
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:46,230
There's no exception.

276
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,230
Unless...

277
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,270
He is here.

278
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,600
Monk.

279
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,440
Miss Zhu.

280
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:05,870
Qing.

281
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,720
Qing.

282
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,470
Miss Zhu, are you all right?

283
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,200
Qing.

284
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,270
Did you inactivate that?

285
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,110
Brother.

286
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:35,870
Out of my way.

287
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,510
Brother.

288
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,200
Zhao Heng,

289
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,320
from this day on,

290
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,990
we're even.

291
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,080
I mistook you for him.

292
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,560
I'm sorry.

293
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,510
You set a trap against me.

294
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,990
I'll let it go.

295
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,470
But if you hurt me again,

296
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,110
I won't show mercy.

297
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,270
So,

298
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,870
you always mistook me for someone else.

299
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,510
I was wrong about you.

300
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,720
How would a demon love anyone?

301
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:24,270
Who would a demon love?

302
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,750
From this day on,

303
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,040
we're even.

304
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,200
I should have listened to Father.

305
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,110
Demons are merciless.

306
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,390
Miss Zhu,

307
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,870
all these years,

308
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,680
you've been torturing yourself.

309
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,040
You feel bad.

310
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,320
You want to vent it out.

311
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,870
You make them go crazy with you.

312
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,960
You hurt them.

313
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,600
You hurt yourself, too.

314
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,720
If you let them go,

315
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,390
you'll also let go of yourself.

316
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,350
Don't get stuck in past sufferings.

317
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,630
It's time to get out.

318
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,440
Qing,

319
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,200
you're right.

320
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:47,080
Monk.

321
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:02,800
Wuchang,

322
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
it's been centuries.

323
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,600
How are you?

324
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:09,870
I'm all right.

325
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,390
I really am.

326
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,960
But I never thought

327
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,750
I could see you again.

328
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,800
Miss Fifth,

329
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:24,840
you only know
the battle at Songyang Pass

330
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,080
was extremely dangerous.

331
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,840
But only Wuchang and I

332
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,110
knew the truth.

333
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:35,870
That year,

334
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,630
Wuchang actually came.

335
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,080
He wasn't a coward.

336
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:43,920
But...

337
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,200
I stopped him.

338
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:49,560
Soldiers, at my command.

339
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,200
[Yangcheng Prefecture]

340
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,630
Get equipped and we're ready to go.

341
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,600
- Yes!
- Yes!

342
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,230
Report!

343
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:03,840
My Lord,

344
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,800
a letter for you.

345
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:12,870
Wuchang,

346
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,840
everything in this world connects.

347
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,230
It happened because of me

348
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,040
and I have to put an end to it.

349
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,270
Don't get your people involved.

350
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,150
When everything is over,

351
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,390
don't feel sad.

352
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,920
If we're destined to meet,

353
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,840
we will meet again.

354
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,320
Lotus.

355
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,040
You don't need to explain.

356
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,320
I'm willing to be punished.

357
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,630
Amitabha.

358
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,960
I wanted to enlighten Taotie

359
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,390
and save people.

360
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,510
So, I invited Immortal Wuchang

361
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,230
to travel around the world with Taotie.

362
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,110
I wanted her to know

363
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,320
this bustling mortal world

364
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:05,350
was like a fond dream.

365
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,630
But even ants tried to live.

366
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:11,350
With greed and obsession,

367
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,350
humans usually got stuck
in love and hate.

368
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,990
But they shouldn't be eaten

369
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,270
by brutal demons.

370
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,230
That was against ethics.

371
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,350
Unexpectedly, driven by desire,

372
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,040
the Black Qilin King
gathered Qiongqi armies

373
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,350
and fought back fiercely.

374
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,840
My obsession caused that.

375
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:40,110
I had the prayer beads

376
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,390
to see through the whole world.

377
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,230
Once Wuchang traveled sideways,

378
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,110
he could have time travel.

379
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,150
The past and the future

380
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,110
could be connected casually.

381
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,960
If he worked with me,

382
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,600
we could turn back time

383
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,080
and reverse the world.

384
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,080
The world would turn back to a time

385
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,990
when you didn't make trouble.

386
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,800
However,

387
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,040
the world had its own rule.

388
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,750
We couldn't just reverse it.

389
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:16,870
I asked myself.

390
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,560
What kind of world be better,

391
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:24,680
without a Taotie
or with a caring Taotie?

392
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:28,150
You know what happened after that.

393
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:31,200
But I didn't want you
to be stuck in love.

394
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,440
That's why Wuchang

395
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,750
took all the blame on himself.

396
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,870
He was cursed

397
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:40,320
and he suffered every hundred years

398
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,230
for you, for the people,

399
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,470
and for me.

400
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,080
Now,

401
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:56,870
can you let it go?

402
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:06,270
In this world,

403
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,510
I shouldn't have existed.

404
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,750
Why did you sacrifice yourself

405
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,270
to save my life?

406
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:22,270
Say no more.

407
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,630
Miss Fifth,

408
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:28,920
I didn't

409
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,750
only do that for you

410
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,960
but also for all the people.

411
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,750
Everything in this world
has its own destiny.

412
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,270
Since you appeared,

413
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,870
you would be part of this world.

414
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,390
Why would I

415
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:49,960
get rid of you?

416
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,990
I worried about Wuchang.

417
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:57,390
He sacrificed himself for the people.

418
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,870
But I knew your temper.

419
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,600
You wouldn't easily let him go.

420
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,750
So, I gave him the prayer beads

421
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,870
to help him come back to life.

422
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,150
But you know what?

423
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,230
With the prayer beads

424
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,470
and his walking ability,

425
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,750
Wuchang could turn back the clock

426
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,440
and return to the safe world anytime.

427
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,870
But he never...

428
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,110
Amitabha.

429
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:29,270
This is fine.

430
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,920
Master.

431
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,920
Lord Wuchang.

432
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,230
You...

433
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,150
Miss Fifth,

434
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:40,960
it's been centuries.

435
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,990
You must have a deeper understanding

436
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:45,920
of the emotions.

437
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:49,270
I know everything you told me.

438
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:51,840
Including Jiao.

439
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,270
And Ling.

440
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,390
Monk,

441
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,680
do you know how my heart was broken

442
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,680
when I saw Jiao trusted Gao Cong

443
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,230
without hesitation?

444
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:12,560
And Ling...

445
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:15,230
He was like the old me.

446
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:18,630
He was so confused about this world.

447
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,680
And the Dragon.

448
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,270
He waited for centuries.

449
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:28,270
He was as stubborn as me.

450
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,750
And Qu Yan...

451
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,230
She showed me

452
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:36,200
another possibility
between a human and a demon.

453
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,040
But anyway,

454
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:41,600
now,

455
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,870
I can see you again.

456
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,470
I think it's all worth it.

457
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:56,870
When I'm gone now,
I'll worry about nothing.

458
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,040
But I can't help

459
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:01,230
worrying about someone.

460
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,320
She always acts recklessly.

461
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,440
When I'm gone,

462
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,110
she'll be left all alone.

463
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,320
I don't know what trouble she'll make.

464
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:19,840
So, please.

465
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:24,200
Please take care of her.

466
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:54,870
Monk,

467
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,750
farewell.

468
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,990
Farewell forever.

469
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:35,870
General,

470
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,200
don't eat His Lordship anymore.

471
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,920
How about you eat me?

472
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,630
Eat me!

473
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,870
I'm fat, but not greasy.

474
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,270
I taste fresh.

475
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,200
Eat me, please.

476
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,270
Eat me.

477
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,720
General, eat me!

478
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,750
- Eat me.
- Eat me.

479
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,390
General,

480
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:53,990
eat me.

481
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,920
- Eat me.
- Eat me, General.

482
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,680
Eat me, General.

483
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:00,920
- Eat me.
- Eat me.

484
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,230
- Eat me.
- Eat me, General.

485
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:02,750
Eat me.

486
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:04,270
Eat me.

487
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,510
Eat me, General!

488
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,600
Eat me.

489
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:07,440
Be quiet!

490
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:17,960
All these years,

491
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,230
why didn't you tell me the truth?

492
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:27,270
Monk Lotus sacrificed himself.

493
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:30,600
But I was to blame, too.

494
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,990
I didn't save the one
who saved me before.

495
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:33,960
I also broke

496
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,080
my promise to you.

497
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,320
How did I have the face
to tell you the truth?

498
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:41,200
My Lord.

499
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:41,960
Dear.

500
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,320
General, you come every hundred years.

501
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,150
It's painful to open my shell

502
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,080
and pull out the crab meat.

503
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,470
But I deserve this.

504
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,040
Besides,

505
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:05,630
Master asked me to take care of you.

506
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:07,800
How can I do such an important mission?

507
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,950
So, General, every hundred years,

508
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,510
please come and eat me.

509
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,640
Then, you may still want

510
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,670
to stay in this world.

511
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,750
Enough.

512
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,470
In this case,

513
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,190
how can I continue to eat you?

514
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:23,710
Thank you, General.

515
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,600
She won't eat His Highness.

516
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:28,120
Thank you, General.

517
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,800
Thank you for not eating him.

518
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,840
Thank you, General.

519
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:31,990
Thank you, General.

520
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,670
General.

521
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,230
My Lord.

522
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,400
I know I was wrong.

523
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,190
Fengyi,

524
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:44,710
how could you be silly?

525
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:49,320
I could do anything

526
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:52,270
to share your burden.

527
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,840
I just lost my mind.

528
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,400
I hurt General

529
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,230
and lost my crab roe.

530
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,040
Say no more.

531
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,270
General,

532
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,990
I know Fengyi is unforgivable.

533
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,840
For the sake she did everything

534
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,640
just to defend me,

535
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,080
can you punish me instead?

536
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,950
In your eyes,

537
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,270
am I that brutal?

538
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,160
Who are you?

539
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,670
I'm your husband

540
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,360
and your father.

541
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,430
This time,

542
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,430
I'll take good care of you.

543
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,120
Give me a chance

544
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,750
to look after you when you grow up.

545
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,430
Now, the truth is clear.

546
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,560
I no longer need

547
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,600
to keep the beads.

548
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,120
Mr. Chang, you took them.

549
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,510
You're destined to have them.

550
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,320
500 years are gone.

551
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,910
The beads are Lotus's weapon.

552
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:52,950
Someday,

553
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,840
they'll be very useful.

554
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,270
Please keep them carefully.

555
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:05,510
Qing.

556
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:06,910
Qing.

557
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:07,710
Qing!

558
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:17,560
The mark of Yujiang?

559
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,950
When the totem on your chest
completely disappears,

560
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,080
you will die.

561
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,120
Will that illusion

562
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,880
really happen?

563
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,560
[Residence of the Prince of Langya]

564
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:49,880
Don't worry, Brother.

565
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:50,880
When I'm back,

566
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,270
I know what to say to Father.

567
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,190
After I leave,

568
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,710
I don't know when we can meet again.

569
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,950
It's hard for you to come out.

570
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,400
When you have your birthday,

571
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,430
I'll go to Yunlong to celebrate it.

572
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,190
Is that a promise?

573
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,230
Yes.

574
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:32,430
Your Highness,

575
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,840
you haven't recovered.

576
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,750
Go back for some rest.

577
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,270
All right.

578
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,360
When the totem on your chest
completely disappears,

579
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,430
you will die.

580
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,670
The scenery looks quite different.

581
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,190
It's not the way back to Wuxia.

582
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,800
Miss Zhu.

583
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:17,880
We seldom come out.

584
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:18,990
Let's not rush back.

585
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:22,160
Then, where are we going?

586
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,160
To Yaoguang Sea.

587
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,880
It's the biggest lake
near Cangwu Mountain.

588
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,880
Fuyu Inn on Yaoguang Sea

589
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,120
has the prettiest landlady

590
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,360
within a hundred miles.

591
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,950
The rainbow trout soup there

592
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,750
tastes best in the world.

593
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,470
On such cold days,

594
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:38,800
having some soup

595
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,950
would be really great.

596
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,510
It's just some soup.

597
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,560
Do you really want that?

598
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,910
If we go back to Wuxia,

599
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:44,990
we'll have a lot to eat.

600
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,320
You have no idea.

601
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,840
Rainbow trout here

602
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,160
eat glowing seaweeds

603
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,560
in the lake.

604
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,910
It takes each trout totally three years

605
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:54,230
to have a length of half chi.

606
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,040
It's really hard.

607
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,560
And it tastes nice.

608
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,160
It's the late autumn

609
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,040
for mature rainbow trout.

610
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,470
If we miss the soup,

611
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:03,040
we'll have to wait for a year.

612
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:07,990
Fine, then.

613
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:09,950
But we must be quick.

614
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:21,710
Qing,

615
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,080
I'll find a way to save you.

616
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,230
Even puppet strings couldn't stop her.

617
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,750
How can I capture her?

618
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:36,840
Your Highness,

619
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,190
you showed mercy on her.

620
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:46,710
I shouldn't have done that.

621
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,880
I gave others a good laugh.

622
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:04,670
Your Highness,

623
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,670
you're seriously injured.

624
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,880
My priority

625
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,190
is to heal you.

626
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,750
I'm gravely injured.

627
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,670
I don't think I can be healed.

628
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:17,640
I'll try my best.

629
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:18,840
My Lord,

630
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,320
your wish

631
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:21,840
will come true.

632
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,080
Miss Zhu,

633
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,920
here's an inn.

634
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,120
Let's go.

635
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:48,640
Come on.

636
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,550
Anybody?

637
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:00,920
Anybody in?

638
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,440
Open the door, please.

639
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,510
Guests,

640
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,510
do you want food or accommodation?

641
00:42:18,030 --> 00:42:18,750
Sir,

642
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,550
we're passing by

643
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:21,990
and want to stay for one night.

644
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:28,230
Come in, then.

645
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,310
Why is it so dark here?

646
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:45,790
Why isn't there a candle?

647
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:10,230
It's not nightfall yet.

648
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,270
We mustn't use a candle.

649
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:19,640
Sir,

650
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:20,920
is there a boat?

651
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:22,360
We're going to Fuyu Inn.

652
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,790
Don't ask and don't go.

653
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,880
