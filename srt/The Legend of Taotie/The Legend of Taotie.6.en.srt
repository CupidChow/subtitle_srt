192
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,550
No.

193
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,790
His Highness and Miss Zhu

194
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,030
agreed to keep this beast.

195
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,640
Mr. Chang finally admitted it.

196
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,110
Let me tell you.

197
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:02,470
Miss Zhu has backed out.

198
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,880
His Highness ordered me

199
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,880
to capture the beast and bring him to justice.

200
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,710
Mr. Lu.

201
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,590
You can catch the beast.

202
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,080
But don't hurt Xu Ruoxu.

203
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,350
The beast is highly poisonous.

204
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,400
Besides, he has killed many people!

205
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,960
Are you sure you want to protect him?

206
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,640
It's not me,

207
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:44,080
but Mr. Xu

208
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,030
wants to protect him.

209
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,440
Anyway,

210
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,350
if Mr. Xu wants to protect him,

211
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,200
he has to protect him to the end.

212
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I will arrange archers to wait outside the door.

213
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,640
Once he comes up,

214
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,840
he will be killed without mercy.

215
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,710
Are you all right?

216
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,000
Ling is injured.

217
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,880
Please wait here.

218
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,440
I'll get the medicine.

219
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,640
Come on.

220
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,400
Did you think of your brother again?

221
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,400
The relationship between you two

222
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,710
really makes me envy.

223
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,200
Born in the imperial family,

224
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:58,000
how can brothers

225
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,080
treat each other so sincerely?

226
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,320
Others just have wheeling-and-dealing.

227
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,790
It's really rare to have such a good man

228
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,110
as your brother.

229
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,280
Come on.

230
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,150
Here's another toast

231
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,110
to your relationship with your brother.

232
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
But then,

233
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,960
You had been the hostage in Xia before.

234
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,880
You have just returned to Bei Di in two years.

235
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:39,280
It's been a long time.

236
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,230
Don't you know that people's hearts will change?

237
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,350
[Great Heaven]

238
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,880
Don't!

239
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,200
Don't!

240
00:13:59,280 --> 00:13:59,760
Third brother!

241
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,550
Third brother!

242
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,710
Brother, why did you have to
kill the third brother?

243
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,400
It's enough to imprison him.

244
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,840
He didn't do anything harmful to you.

245
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,200
Why did you insist on doing this?

246
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,550
Not doing anything now

247
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,760
doesn't mean he won't do in the future.

248
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,030
I can't let him

249
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,280
become a hidden danger in our future.

250
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,400
Brother,

251
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,790
you seem to have changed a lot.

252
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,640
You just came back from Xia.

253
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,640
You don't know many things.

254
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
I have my own opinion on official affairs.

255
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,590
You don't have to worry.

256
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,230
Look at it.

257
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,670
This is the information from my spy.

258
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,080
Prince of Bei Di wants to

259
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,470
assassinate Prince Nan of Bei Di in Da Liang.

260
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:25,230
Making use of Prince Nan's death,
Prince of Bei Di will unite Xia to attack Liang.

261
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,710
Come here.

262
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:42,470
Bow your head a little.

263
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,230
Let's go.

264
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,470
Let's eat delicious food.

265
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
Cotton candy.

266
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,230
Cotton candy.

267
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,230
I'll buy you cotton candy.

268
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,150
Stand here.

269
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,840
Don't go anywhere else.

270
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,550
Cotton candy.

271
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,880
Freshly made cotton candy.

272
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,470
Fragrant and sweet.

273
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:18,790
Mister.

274
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,640
Take a cotton candy.

275
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:20,590
Yes.

276
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,550
I want this string.

277
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:21,880
Sure.

278
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,030
Come on and get one.

279
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,080
Cotton candy.

280
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,400
Cotton candy.

281
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,640
Freshly made cotton candy.

282
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,320
Ling! Watch out!

283
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,840
Run!

284
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:56,950
Watch out!

285
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:12,800
Ling!

286
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,560
Ling!

287
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,070
Ling!

288
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:15,710
Are you all right, Ling?

289
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:22,950
Mr. Lu.

290
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,110
Long time no see.

291
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,680
This is not the time to greet.

292
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,560
Please step aside.

293
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,070
Although Ling is a beast,

294
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,310
I'm a human.

295
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:38,310
You still protect him now?

296
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,310
Do you know he killed your father?

297
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:43,800
I beg your pardon?

298
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,160
Ruoxu.

299
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,110
Your father has been killed

300
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,310
a few days ago.

301
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,560
It's this beast who did it.

302
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,590
Once his poison needle penetrates people's skin,

303
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:00,430
it can make people lose their spirits in a flash.

304
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,950
Ruoxu, you should never be…

305
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:04,560
Mr. Lu!

306
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,590
Miss Zhu.

307
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,070
We meet again.

308
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,350
Killing in front of the Lotus Tower

309
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,230
is inappropriate, right?

310
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,830
[Lotus Tower]
Why don't you owe me a favor today?

311
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,950
Let me take them back to Tianxiang Restaurant.

312
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,710
After all, the more difficult problem now

313
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,110
should be not just this black bee.

314
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:36,230
And anyway,

315
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,590
I'm sure Mr. Lu can see

316
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:40,830
that this black bee can't live long.

317
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,190
If you want him later,

318
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:44,830
I will hand him in without hesitation.

319
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,070
Miss Zhu.

320
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,590
His Highness asked me to bring you a message.

321
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,310
What?

322
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,160
His Highness said

323
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
if Miss Zhu refuses to hand over the black bee,

324
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,830
then the previous agreement must be counted.

325
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:00,950
What agreement?

326
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,190
According to His Highness,

327
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,520
it's the agreement to help Wuxia out of danger.

328
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,640
Oh, I see.

329
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:22,070
Mr. Lu, please go back and tell His Highness,

330
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:23,560
I agreed.

331
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,310
Thank you, Miss Zhu.

332
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:54,220
[Zhu]

333
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:00,760
I'll get him something to eat.

334
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,350
I've already told you

335
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,040
that if the black bee leaves his group,

336
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,000
he will lose his senses little by little

337
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,190
and die slowly.

338
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,950
He just lost his mobility.

339
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,470
But he still tried his best to protect me.

340
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:33,880
My father…

341
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,070
Did he really die?

342
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:40,470
Yes.

343
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,680
Is it really him

344
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,590
who killed my father?

345
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,520
Yes.

346
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,640
But he is also controlled by someone else.

347
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,400
People tamed them

348
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,760
to kill.

349
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:05,560
Do you

350
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,190
still regard him as your brother?

351
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,190
Well,

352
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,520
in this case,

353
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,190
how about using him

354
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:26,110
to lead the person behind out?

355
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,310
This can help you avenge your father's death

356
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,520
while I…

357
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:33,920
You lied to me.

358
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,310
Where are you going?

359
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,830
Do you hear me? I'm talking to you.

360
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,280
If you think it over,

361
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,400
come back to me anytime!

Have you seen Miss Zhu of Tianxiang Restaurant?

375
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,430
No.

376
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,710
I knew you were naughty.

377
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:31,920
Tell me.

I shouldn't keep it secretly.

00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,520
Beasts eat people.

382
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,430
Miss Zhu!

383
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,640
Open the door, Miss Zhu!

390
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,350
Young mister,

391
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,400
please go back first.

392
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,880
Miss Zhu has fallen asleep.

393
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,040
Come back tomorrow if there's something.

394
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:06,230
I can't wait for tomorrow!

395
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:07,400
It's the most important thing!

396
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,680
I want to say it now!

397
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,470
Please open the door!

398
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:11,950
Miss Zhu!

399
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,040
Miss Zhu, open the door!

400
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,710
Miss Zhu!

401
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,190

402
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:16,880
Please open the door!

403
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,350
Please!

404
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,160
What do you think?

405
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,040
Please open the door!

406
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,000
Open the door, Miss Zhu!

407
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:22,830
Please open the door!

408
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,880
Miss Zhu.

409
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,560
Miss Zhu, I have thought it over.

410
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,880
I want to avenge my father's murder.

411
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,070
Really?

412
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,190
If I don't do that,

413
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,160
what kind of man am I?

414
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,280
I must find the murderer behind!

415
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:40,760
Okay.

416
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,230
In that case,

417
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:45,920
you just…

418
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:36,920
You wake up.

419
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,710
Are you hungry?

420
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,000
Let's go.

421
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,760
Let me take you to find delicious honey.

422
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:58,830
Ling, look.

423
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,680
Is there any honey

424
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,520
in this hive?

425
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:06,640
Come on.

430
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,000
Don't care about anything else.

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,040
Look at me.

433
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,070
Believe me.

434
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,160
You'll be all right.

435
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,190
It's real brotherhood.

Even my bell

437
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,000
doesn't work.

00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:47,760
You.

439
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,280
You are the killer!

to meet your real brothers and sisters.

He's right.

00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,560
Today, I tricked you into coming here

456
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,950
to take revenge!

457
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,110

Painful.

466
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:07,760
So painful.

I feel

468
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,830
what I have done to you before.

469
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,000
I'd rather

470
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,000
never live in this world.

471
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,710
It's me

472

It's me

who killed your father.

477
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,800
She did it anyway.

478
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,280
Watch out!

482
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,280
Speak. What's wrong with you?

483
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,000
Where are you hurt?

My ass.

486
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,190
It's very dangerous.

487
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,400
Why did you suddenly show up here?

488
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,920
I didn't get the old man's bell.

489
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,280
Even Ling was stolen off by him.

490
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:16,520
Look at you!

491
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,040
You do nothing good.

The strong takes all.

497
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,520
The weak will be abandoned.

498
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,040
This is how black bees live.

499
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,680
Every time they catch prey,

500
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,680
they will inevitably

501
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,280
have physical contact with the prey.

502
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,560
And the dying prey

503
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,310
will also send fragmentary memories.

504
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,000

will stay on the bee for a short time.

507

The person's memory will stay on the bee.

508
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,760
Is Ling doing this to me

509
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,160

00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:54,870
Protect Miss Zhu!

574
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:55,150
Yes!

575
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:55,470
Come one!

576
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:55,910
Run!

577
00:41:59,150 --> 00:41:59,800
Run!

578
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,320
Kill the man in black and yellow.

579
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:29,630
Yes.

580
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,560
Ruoxu!

581
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:40,840
Stop, Ling.

582
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,630
You promised me not to kill again.

583
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:53,760
What are you waiting for?

584
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:54,800
Kill him!

585
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:57,840
Kill him now!

586
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,000
You two murderous demons!

587
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,040
It's you

588
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,190
who killed my father!

589
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:09,320
No.

590
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,080
Killing

591
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,320
is not good.

592
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:16,760
I made an appointment with someone.

593
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,230
I won't kill anyone again.

594
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:25,710
Your trash!

595
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,320
Ling!

596
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:43,430
How are you?

597
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:44,840
