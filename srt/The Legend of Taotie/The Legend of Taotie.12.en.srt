It's dangerous when it erupts.

What did you say?

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,000
Cuiyan, Yingtao.

28
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,360
Come with me to get the cauldron.

29
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,160
This is really scary.

30
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:39,880
I never imagined
that the madam was a White Tiger.

31
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,160
But Young Master,

32
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,880
from now on,
you no longer have to worry.

33
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,000
No one will be able to restrain

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,320
or punish you anymore.

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,630
Miss Zhu,

36
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
this cauldron is so big.

37
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,800
Let's call the mister to help move it.

00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,160
It's so magical.

Hurry up and have the servants prepare.

58
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,070
I've already instructed the servants
to prepare everything.

59

accompany you for a while?

No need.

63
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,600
I've caught a cold lately.

64
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,110
I'm afraid it might infect you.

65

doesn't need me to elaborate.

in your heart.

why are you sleeping
while holding a cauldron?

100
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Aren't you afraid it's uncomfortable?

101
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,920
I've told you.

Let's go.

108

Don't you feel

109
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,790
that your heart condition
is different from others?

110
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:57,710
That's because the beastly nature
inside you is about to erupt.

111
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,710
It's dangerous when it erupts.

112

113
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,590
what's wrong?

114
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,550
Young Master,

115
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,840
don't be sad.

116
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:38,910
It's all over now.

117
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,400
So scary.

118
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,200
I'm afraid all of this

119
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,200
might be real.

120
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,590
Liyu,

121
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,440
don't go anywhere.

122
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,470
Don't leave me.

123
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,150
Okay?

124
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:07,840
Young Master,

125
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,030
I'm not going anywhere.

126
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:14,000
I'll stay here with you.

127
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,640
I'll always,

128
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,640
always stay with you.

129
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,320
Your Highness.

130
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,080
How's it going?

131
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,400
I've already interrogated.

132
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,200
The White Tiger
has confessed to everything.

133
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,110
The Xiang embroidery
is her magic instrument,

134
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,760
and she killed the victim.

135
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,350
What should we do now?

136
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,440
Should we

137
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,400
execute her immediately?

138
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:50,790
Wait a bit.

139
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,030
Since her magic instrument
has been destroyed,

140
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,030
she has no more demonic powers.

141
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:56,550
She should no longer be able
to cause harm.

142
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:57,840
But this White Tiger

143
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,200
is no ordinary demon beast.

144
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,670
Lock her up in the prison first.

145
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,440
After I report to the court,

146
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,470
we will make a final decision.

147
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,840
Yes, Your Highness.

148
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,910
My son.

149
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,200
Why didn't you eat it?

150
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,440
It'd be fine after you eat it.

151
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,710
It'd really be fine after you eat it.

152
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,760
Why didn't you eat it?

153
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,110
Why didn't you eat it?

154
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,440
It'd be fine after you eat it.

155
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,910
Parents only want the best
for their kids.

156
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,030
Your Highness.

157
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:52,960
Mrs. Zhou,

158
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,960
I know you were wronged.

159
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,110
Your son killed these people.

160
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,230
You just took the blame for him, right?

161
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,000
Your Highness.

162
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:02,590
Your Highness.

163
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,400
It wasn't my son who killed them.

164
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,710
I killed them all, Your Highness.

165
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,110
It has nothing to do with my son.

166
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,880
Please, save my son.

167
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,000
Please, Your Highness.

168
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,910
I can agree to help you,

169
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,110
but you must tell me one thing.

170
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,000
Your Highness, what is it?

171
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,150
Your Highness.

172
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,790
Mrs. Zhou,

173
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,400
over all these years,

174
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,960
has Zhou Guangping's beastly nature

175
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,400
always been suppressed by the Paw Bead?

176
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,000
No, Your Highness.

177
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,470
It's not like that.

178
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,030
My son only suffers from heart disease.

179
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
It's not like that.

180
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,030
Your Highness, really.

181
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,710
Mrs. Zhou,

182
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,350
I've asked you this.

183
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,350
It means I know something.

184
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,350
Your Highness,

185
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,550
it's not like that.

186
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,840
My son only did this
because of his heart condition.

187
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,320
As far as I know,

188
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,230
the Paw Bead

189
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,110
only treats heart ailments.

190
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,590
And

191
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:02,640
it makes the person
who gives the medicine be cherished,

192
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,960
but it has no other effects,
Your Highness.

193
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,080
Please, save him.

194
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,280
Please, save him, okay?

195
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,400
Your Highness.

196
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,550
Your Highness.

197
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,550
I beg you.

198
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,670
Your Highness.

199
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,840
It seems this medicine

200
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,080
cannot suppress the beastly nature.

201
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,880
Mr. Zhou.

202
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,080
Mr. Zhou.

203
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,350
Mr. Zhou.

204
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:36,960
Mr. Zhou.

205
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:50,590
Miss Zhu.

206
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,470
Have you forgotten?

207
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,910
You have a beast's heart inside you.

208
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,280
You've already become a demon beast.

209
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,110
The demon beast
everyone talks about is you.

210
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,790
Stop it.

211
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,670
You did

212
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:04,670
everything.

213
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,080
Stop it.

214
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,710
You've already become a demon beast.

215
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:10,840
Mother.

216
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,590
You did all those bad things.

217
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,400
Mother, stop it.

218
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,710
You did all that.

219
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,230
I told you to stop.

220
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,640
I told you to stop.

221
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,520
Stop it.

222
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,030
Stop it.

223
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,550
Miss Zhu.

224
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,670
Miss Zhu.

225
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,110
Miss Zhu.

226
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,840
What's going on?

227
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,440
Is Miss Zhu inside?

228
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,350
Miss Zhu is sleeping.

229
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,230
Speak softly.

230
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,400
Such bad timing.

231
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:01,880
I need to talk to her.

232
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,350
Then wait a moment.

233
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,760
Let Miss Zhu rest for a while.

234
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,790
I can't wait.

235
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,110
Today, no matter what,

236
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,030
no matter who demands it,

237
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,230
I won't let you in.

238
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,110
You...

239
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,400
Let him in.

240
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,670
Miss Zhu.

241
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,440
You brat.

242
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,670
Why did you just get back now?

243
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,760
I'm so hungry that I can't sleep.

244
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,910
There's no one at home to cook.

245
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,150
I'll come back later and cook for you.

246
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I have something to ask you.

247
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,710
Is it

248
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,590
about the artist you admire again?

249
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,280
I've been staying
at the Zhou Residence these days.

250
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,150
I've found a lot of things suspicious.

251
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:38,880
Mr. Zhou didn't go

252
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,110
to his wife's crime scene,

253
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,080
yet he could draw her appearance
before she died.

254
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,960
It's really suspicious.

255
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,150
Also,

256
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,470
Zhou Guangping's paintings

257
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,080
have become more and more
ferocious and violent.

258
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,910
From this, I deduce

259
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,590
that the real murderer

260
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,670
isn't the White Tiger,

261
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,960
but Zhou Guangping.

262
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,030
Am I right?

263
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,520
Yeah.

264
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,760
You guessed it all right.

265
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,550
Qing, you're pretty smart.

266
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,470
Turns out you already knew.

267
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,320
Then, what did you whisper

268
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,110
in Zhou Guangping's ear

269
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,960
that made his face look so bad?

270
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,520
Qing,

271
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:10,790
I've been hurt,

272
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,470
and you keep asking me this and that.

273
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:15,520
You don't care about me,

274
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,710
only about your Guangping.

275
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,280
How could I not care about you?

276
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,910
Not only do I care about you,

277
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,440
I'll also heal you.

278
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,760
But this matter is urgent.

279
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,590
That White Tiger might

280
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,470
be executed soon.

281
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,760
Why are you so worried?
That's not necessary.

282
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,350
But based on the way his wife died,

283
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,150
it's obvious that the murderer
was a demon beast.

284
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,790
But Mr. Zhou is a human.

285
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,080
Zhou Guangping is a human,

286
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,790
but he has a beast's heart.

287
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,520
He can't suppress his beastly nature,

288
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,640
which causes his heart disease.

289
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:47,640
When Zhou Guangping's
beastly nature surged,

290
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,590
he killed several of his wives.

291
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,520
Actually, it was the White Tiger

292
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,960
cleaning up the mess for him.

293
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,790
That's why the White Tiger
kept asking me

294
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,280
to make the Paw Bead for him.

295
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,110
It's to treat his heart disease

296
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,760
and also to make him
cherish the White Tiger.

297
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,840
No wonder his paintings

298
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,590
have shown such a state.

299
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:08,680
Since you already knew,

300
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,800
why didn't you say it earlier?

301
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,040
Who are you talking to, you brat?

302
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,680
That White Tiger worked so hard

303
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,640
to save her son.

304
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,640
Of course, I have to support her.

305
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,470
Why would I oppose her?

306
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,470
But this is twisting the truth

307
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,230
and confusing right and wrong.

308
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,720
Not only is the White Tiger wronged,

309
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,560
but so many people have died.

310
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,040
Come with me
to the Inspection Department right now.

311
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:28,150
We'll release that White Tiger.

312
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:28,870
I won't go.

313
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,840
That's her business, not mine.

314
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,470
You...

315
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,470
Forget it.

316
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,800
Just focus on your cauldron.

317
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,230
Then you can focus on your Guangping.

318
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:40,990
Oh, no.

319
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,960
Qing!

320
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,150
I still have something to tell you.

321
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,990
Here, hold this.

322
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:55,800
Okay.

323
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,510
I'm still too late.

324
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,510
Guangping.

325
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,750
Come with me to surrender.

326
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,390
I didn't kill anyone.

327
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,510
I didn't kill anyone.

328
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,840
Guangping, wake up.

329
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,150
I didn't kill anyone.

330
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,870
You have to face reality.

331
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,750
I didn't kill anyone.

332
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,350
Look for yourself.

333
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,600
Not just Liyu,

334
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,920
but also your previous wives.

335
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,630
Don't come near me.

336
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,390
I didn't kill them.

337
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,990
I didn't kill anyone.

338
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,230
I didn't kill them.

339
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,840
Qing,

340
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
I never thought about killing anyone.

341
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,320
I really didn't.

342
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,630
I know.

343
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,470
That's why you need to surrender.

344
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,350
The Inspection Department
will consider you insane

345
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,680
and treat you leniently.

346
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:41,350
If you don't surrender,

347
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,510
I'll have no choice but to expose you.

348
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,960
At that point,
your crime will be even worse.

349
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,470
All of this is your mother

350
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,560
taking the blame for you.

351
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,110
She's been wronged.

352
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,150
Mother.

353
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:00,750
Mother.

354
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:06,390
Okay.

355
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,150
Okay.

356
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,440
I'll surrender.

357
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:12,870
I'll surrender.

358
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,800
I'll go get Mother out.

359
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:20,840
But Qing,

360
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,150
can you give me some more time?

361
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,510
Let me settle things

362
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,390
at home first.

363
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,150
Okay.

364
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,230
I treat you as a friend. I trust you.

365
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,990
You've always said
you'd take responsibility.

366
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,440
Now it's time for you to take it.

367
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,080
How long will you need?

368
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:53,510
Two hours.

369
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,920
I'll wait for you
in front of the Inspection Department.

370
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,350
If you don't show up by then,

371
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,750
I'll inform the Inspection Department.

372
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,630
There's a White Tiger.

373
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,200
I'm telling you.

374
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,110
There really is a White Tiger.

375
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:32,630
I saw it.

376
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:33,320
Dear.

377
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,470
Don't bite me.

378
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,270
There is a White Tiger.

379
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,720
Don't be afraid.

380
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,080
There is a White Tiger.

381
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,600
Juan,

382
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,510
send the madam back to the Wang's place.

383
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,230
Apologize to my in-laws for me.

384
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,230
I didn't take good care
of their daughter.

385
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:46,840
A White Tiger...

386
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,800
Take this money.

387
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920
Find her a good physician

388
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:52,750
and cure her madness.

389
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,600
Yes, Young Master.

390
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,150
Madam, let's go.

391
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:55,750
Let's go.

392
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:56,960
Let's go.

393
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,840
It's okay.

394
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,840
There really is a White Tiger.

395
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,960
[Inspection Department]

396
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,520
[Inspection Department]

397
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:17,750
This way.

398
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,470
Sir.

399
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,630
Is your young master,
Zhou Guangping, at home?

400
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,680
The young master has gone out.

401
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,270
He said he went
to the Inspection Department.

402
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,200
[Jail]

403
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,110
Mrs. Zhou,

404
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,390
we've figured out that you're innocent.

405
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,470
You may leave now.

406
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,200
It was Guangping who did this.

407
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,110
The Inspection Department
has sent people to capture him.

408
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,350
Mr. Chang,

409
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:14,960
I've said it many times.

410
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,440
My son didn't kill anyone.

411
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,720
It wasn't my son's doing.

412
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,840
I killed them all.

413
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,990
Don't wrong him.

414
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,390
You don't need to protect him anymore.

415
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,440
This is all because he has
a beast's heart.

416
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,630
And his semi-beast nature

417
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,560
made him lose control of his madness,

418
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:31,960
so he killed people.

419
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,560
Since he killed someone,

420
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,150
he must take responsibility for it.

421
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,560
Killing requires paying with life.
That's only right.

422
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,230
If you want someone to pay,

423
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,320
then take my life.

424
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,080
My son is more important than me.

425
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,870
His life is more important than mine.

426
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,630
Please don't wrong him, okay?

427
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,040
You're protecting him.
You're covering up for him.

428
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,230
He can't live

429
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,600
like a baby forever.

430
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,320
How long can you protect him?

431
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,600
What's it to you?

432
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:58,560
He's innocent.

433
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,320
Don't blame him.

434
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,510
If you're going to blame someone,
blame me.

435
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,870
Miss Zhu is right.

436
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,630
Why are you so obsessed?

437
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,560
Based on the Inspection Department,

438
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,600
your son has fled to the seaside.

439
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,870
Mr. Chang.

440
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,390
Mr. Chang.

441
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,320
Please.

442
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,680
Please help me.

443
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,470
I need to go save him.

444
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,110
Please.

445
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,990
Please help me.

446
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,230
Mr. Chang.

447
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,230
Please.

448
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,510
He's broken the law now.

449
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:28,800
You can't continue to indulge him.

450
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,470
Mr. Chang,

451
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,350
you're right.

452
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:31,960
My son is innocent.

453
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,920
He doesn't know anything.

454
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,200
But this time,

455
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,840
I have to go

456
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,840
and tell him everything.

457
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,510
I want him to make his own choice.

458
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,720
Please help me.

459
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,630
I must save him.

460
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,080
If anything happens to my son,

461
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,840
I'll never rest in peace.

462
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,800
Please.

463
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,110
Please help me.

464
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,560
Since you insist,

465
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,630
I'll help you.

466
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,320
Thank you, Mr. Chang.

467
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,470
Thank you, Mr. Chang.

468
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,040
Here.

469
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:10,870
But I have a question.

470
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,320
Please ask, Mr. Chang.

471
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:14,270
Why did you possess
the Xiang embroidery?

472
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,470
You don't understand.

473
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,560
The Xiang embroidery
is my magic instrument,

474
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:20,470
and the White Tiger
is my primordial spirit.

475
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,270
This flesh

476
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,230
is just a body I borrowed.

477
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,720
When the primordial spirit
merges with the body,

478
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,230
I must rely on the Xiang embroidery

479
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,470
to perform my wind control technique.

480
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:36,840
So that's how it is.

481
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,840
Let me think about
what the Xiang embroidery looks like.

482
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,720
Thank you, Mr. Chang.

483
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,470
Something's off
with the Xiang embroidery.

484
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:57,350
In the Ancestral Hall.

485
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,350
The Xiang embroidery.

486
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,600
Something's off
with the Xiang embroidery.

487
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,560
In the Ancestral Hall.

488
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:50,680
Mister,

489
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,750
you should drink less.

490
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,870
Look over there.

491
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:26,800
Look.

492
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,390
Not good.

493
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,350
A storm is coming.

494
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:32,920
Everyone, take your positions!

495
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,390
Reef the sails!

496
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:35,990
Reef the sails!

497
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,680
Reef the sails!

498
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,040
Storm!

499
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,600
Hurry, come here!

500
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,750
Come on!

501
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,040
I'm not afraid of you!

502
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,390
Come on!

503
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,800
Come and take me away!

504
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,080
I'm free now!

505
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,600
Change direction! Left front!

506
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:29,870
Left front!

507
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:34,720
Come on!

508
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,560
I'm free now!

509
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:45,990
Come on!

510
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,750
Did I see it wrong?

511
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,230
Come on!

512
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,110
I'm not afraid of you!

513
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,600
Even if I die in the sea,

514
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,080
I won't be caught by you!

515
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,680
Look quickly!

516
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:24,960
Tiger Wind Squad!

517
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,870
The storm is dying down!

518
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,230
The Tiger Wind is here!

519
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:27,870
Go!

520
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:29,150
We're saved!

521
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,230
We're saved!

522
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,110
We're saved!

523
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,680
Yeah!

524
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,960
- We're saved!
- We're saved!

525
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,110
That's great!

526
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:36,990
- That's great!
- Great!

527
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,720
We're saved!

528
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:39,560
Yes.

529
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,870
You still won't let me go.

530
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,040
In the end, I can't escape, can I?

531
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,600
What is that thing?

532
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,600
Look.

533
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,230
What is that?

534
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,510
I don't know.

535
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,080
- It's a demon beast!
- A demon beast!

536
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:23,790
- Run!
- There's a demon beast!

537
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:24,550
Run!

538
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:25,640
Quickly!

539
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,120
My son.

540
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,910
I'm here to save you!

541
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,480
Shut up!

542
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:36,600
I'm not your son!

543
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,510
Even if I die in the storm today,

544
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,670
I don't want you to save me!

545
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,270
You...

546
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,240
Do you hate me so much?

547
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,670
I've raised you all these years.

548
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,150
Do you really hate me so much?

549
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:51,390
Of course, I hate you!

550
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:53,910
All these years,

551
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,190
I've been by your side,

552
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,720
like a kept person,

553
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,030
locked up and controlled by you.

554
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:03,310
I've lived like neither a man
nor a ghost.

555
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:05,910
All these years,

556
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,080
I haven't been happy at all.

557
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,120
Why can't you let me go?

558
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,240
Son.

559
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,960
It's not that I don't want
to let you go.

560
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,190
It's because I love you too much.

561
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,080
I want us to rely on each other.

562
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
You love me?

563
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,270
Then why

564
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,310
did you give me
the heart of a demon beast?

565
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,430
I could have lived well,

566
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:30,600
but you killed my whole family!

567
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,430
Why did you do this to me?

568
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,790
I became like this

569
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,880
because of you!

570
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,390
Because you gave me

571
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,390
a beast's heart!

572
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:39,910
Shut up!

573
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,960
I won't let you say that!

574
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,030
Fine.

575
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,790
I didn't tell you all these years

576
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,550
because I didn't want you to

577
00:33:50,550 --> 00:33:52,190
face this cruel truth.

578
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,880
Since you're saying all this,

579
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,390
then let me

580
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,240
tell you everything.

581
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,150
When you were little,
you had a heart disease,

582
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,480
and you weren't expected to live long.

583
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,790
Your father heard from a physician

584
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,160
that the heart of a White Tiger

585
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,840
could be transplanted into a human

586
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,950
to make you live.

587
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,310
So your father took you,

588
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,750
while I was out hunting,

589
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,440
found my cave,

590
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:21,750
killed my son,

591
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,840
and took its heart

592
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,920
to transplant into you.

593
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,440
When I came back,

594
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,550
my son's heart

595
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,790
was still beating at the cave entrance.

596
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:34,120
Do you know?

597
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,440
I knew you were human.

598
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,230
After the heart was transplanted,

599
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,840
I thought you'd have a better life
in the human world.

600
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,470
All these years,

601
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,880
I pretended to be your mother

602
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,470
and raised you in Sijing Garden.

603
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,440
Son.

604
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:32,400
Don't blame me.

605
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:36,440
Do you know how painful it was for me

606
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,120
to lose my own son?

607
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,880
Then I got you,

608
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,680
and I was so happy.

609
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,510
I couldn't bear to lose a child again.

610
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,440
All these years,

611
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,640
I kept you by my side.

612
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,750
It was wrong of me.

613
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,680
It was my fault.

614
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,550
As long as you don't blame me,

615
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,080
I'll agree to anything.

616
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,550
Okay?

617
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,840
Ping.

618
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,750
So, this is the truth I wanted.

619
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,200
So,

620
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,510
I've been deceived
for over twenty years.

621
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,030
So, all the mistakes...

622
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,510
All the mistakes were because of me!

623
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,440
No.

624
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,680
No.

625
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,550
It's not your fault.

626
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,120
It's all my fault.

627
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:26,360
It's my fault.

628
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,550
You've done everything for me.

629
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:34,230
In the end,

630
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,990
can you promise me one thing?

631
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:38,680
Okay.

632
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,680
I'll agree to everything

633
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:42,120
you say.

634
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,680
I'll agree to everything.

635
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,080
I killed so many people,

636
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,160
and my father did evil things too.

637
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:51,310
It's time to put an end

638
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,550
to all the sins.

639
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:56,680
I beg you.

640
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,120
I beg you.

641
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,790
Take my heart back!

642
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:00,680
No!

643
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,270
No, Ping.

644
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,310
You can't say that to me!

645
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,550
You can't return the heart to me!

646
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,920
You are my only one!

647
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,990
Don't you know?

648
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,360
I was wrong.

649
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,230
Ping,

650
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,440
I promise you.

651
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,680
Except for this,

652
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,550
I'll agree to anything.

653
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,080
I'd rather die.

654
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,230
I can't bear this pain any longer.

655
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,160
I don't want to!

656
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,440
- I don't want to!
- Ping!

657
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,030
Ping!

658
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,310
Ping, don't!

659
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:27,400
Ping!

660
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,230
Ping!

661
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:56,550
Ping!

662
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,440
Ping!

663
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:04,680
Ping!

664
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:09,680
Ping!

665
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:10,750
Ping!

666
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,550
Ping!

667
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:14,680
Ping!

668
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,120
Ping!

669
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,640
Ping!

670
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,880
How pitiful that Guangping's talent

671
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,550
has vanished like smoke.

672
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,360
You don't need to feel guilty.

673
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:14,120
This was his own choice.

674
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,310
Though it extended his life,

675
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,230
his blessings were thin.

676
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,270
Zhou Guangping should have died

677
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,710
in that disaster over 20 years ago.

678
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,200
The glory of his first half of life

679
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,360
was paid back in this storm.

680
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,950
This is only fair.

681
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,710
Why did you keep making the Palm Beads
for the White Tiger,

682
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,990
saving her son?

683
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,750
I promised her

684
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,030
to fulfill her wish of saving her son,

685
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:40,270
so I'd help her.

686
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,270
Though the White Tiger is a demon beast,

687
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,840
she loves her child deeply

688
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,080
and is no different

689
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,470
from humans.

690
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:48,710
She treated him so well,

691
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,790
but he only kept avoiding her.

692
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,790
There are so many unattainable things
in the human world.

693
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:55,440
In this regard,

694
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,950
what's the difference
between a demon beast and a human?

695
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,920
But Guangping has consumed
the Palm Beads.

696
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:03,990
Why did he still treat her like this?

697
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,470
It's the difficulty of love, isn't it?

698
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,310
Changing a person's heart

699
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,440
takes a lot of time.

700
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,950
What should we do with that White Tiger?

701
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,310
Let's leave her for now.

702
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,030
I'll make a Forgetting Pill for her,

703
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,510
so she can forget this painful memory.

704
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,120
Are there really Forgetting Pills?

705
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:34,750
If one could take a Forgetting Pill,

706
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,470
they'd still be happy.

707
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,200
How many people in this world

708
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,360
want to forget something

709
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,400
but can't?

710
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,920
Who do you want to forget?

711
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,640
I don't want to forget anyone yet.

712
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:54,680
Though you rescued the White Tiger

713
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,990
from the prison,

714
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,750
she saw her son die with her own eyes.

715
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,510
That is her lifetime of suffering.

716
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:02,550
You are

717
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,310
too soft-hearted.

718
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,030
I truly worry that one day

719
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,470
you'll end up losing yourself too.

720
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,510
When that happens, I'll...

721
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:15,400
When that happens,

722
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,310
I'll be the one worrying

723
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,360
about not getting my 300 liang back.

724
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,230
Your injuries...

725
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:28,030
I'm fine.

726
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,160
I have a strong life.

727
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,270
Even now,

728
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,230
you're still trying to be tough.

729
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:37,120
You can lean on my shoulder.

730
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,600
Who wants to lean on your shoulder?

731
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,030
I said I didn't need to lean.

732
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:56,950
Fine.

733
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,750
But you can't move.

734
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:00,750
If you wake me up,

735
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,510
I'll hold you accountable.

736
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:02,840
Okay.

737
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:04,400
I won't move.

738
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:06,470
I'll be totally still.

739
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,360
Miss Zhu.

740
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,120
I will definitely heal you.

741
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:22,600
Mingyan.

742
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,400
What happened ahead?

743
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:30,640
Your Highness.

744
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:32,360
A group of disaster victims

745
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,880
has surrounded
the Xunfang Resto's entrance.

746
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:35,680
It seems
there's been some kind of conflict.

747
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,160
Let's go and have a look.

748
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:38,990
Yes.

749
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,360
I'll provide free food
for everyone tomorrow,

750
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:49,790
okay?

751
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:50,400
Please, give us some food.

752
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,750
There's no food left today.

753
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,200
There's really no food left today.

754
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,310
Please, give us some food.

755
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:56,120
Hurry up and leave.

756
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:56,880
Go away.

757
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:58,400
Go beg somewhere else.

758
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:58,950
That's right.

759
00:43:59,230 --> 00:43:59,990
Go beg elsewhere.

760
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:01,470
Manager,

761
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,510
this year there's been
a severe drought around Wuxia,

762
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:04,880
with no harvest at all.

763
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,840
We are suffering from hunger and thirst.

764
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,950
Please, give us some food.

765
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:10,920
There's no food left today. Just go.

766
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,230
Do you think

767
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,640
