We've harvested nothing.

Rise.

119
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,600
Rise, please.

Do us justice, Your Highness.

if we don't set out,

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
we will be late.

132
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,480
When I arrive in Yunlong,

133
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,640
I'll tell His Majesty about the drought.

134
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,880
Don't worry.

137
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,350
This is great, Your Highness.

138
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,640
Let's go.

139
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,670
Smells so good.

140
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:51,720
Who are you, monk?

141
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,320
And who are you, girl?

142
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,830
This is my home.

143
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm a fisherwoman.

144
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,640
Oh, there's a pond.

145
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,320
How does the fish taste?

146
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,920
I've never tasted any before.

147
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,440
Does it taste good?

148
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,600
What's this?

149
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,230
Green dumpling.

150
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,720
It's made of mugwort juice

151
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,390
and glutinous rice flour

152
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,390
after repeated kneading.

153
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,720
It's sticky and soft.

154
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,110
It smells great, too.

155
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,030
Monk,

156
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,150
it's getting dark.

157
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,910
Take this oil lamp.

158
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,400
Thank you, young lady.

159
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,030
They're not steamed.

160
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:12,910
Master.

161
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:14,640
Where are you going?

162
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,590
I've stayed here last night.

163
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,670
Now, I'll continue my journey.

164
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,030
You're going out?

165
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:23,030
Yes, of course.

166
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:24,960
But usually,

167
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,790
people can't get out.

168
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,110
Why?

169
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't know.

170
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,760
My grandfather's grandfather

171
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,520
told us about that.

172
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,320
Then...

173
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,440
Is there a river?

174
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,640
There's only a pond.

175
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,350
Umm...

176
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,200
Any fish in the pond?

177
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
No, never.

178
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,280
Oh, I see.

179
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,150
Can you take me there?

180
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,110
Are you sure?

181
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,030
It's over there.

182
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:58,550
Come, please.

183
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,790
Master,

184
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:19,960
there it is.

185
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,150
Master,

186
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,230
shall we go back?

187
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,590
Hey, Master.

188
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,320
Master,

189
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,520
there's a demon in the water.

190
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,000
There really is.

191
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,200
Don't get too close.

192
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,320
Once you fall,

193
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,710
you'll be gone.

194
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,710
Don't get close.

195
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,110
Our cows and chickens

196
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,470
fell and disappeared,

197
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:39,080
Master.

198
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,670
Yeah. Let's go back.

199
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:41,790
Let's go back, Master.

200
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,470
Master,

201
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,400
don't be surprised.

202
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,200
This place gets frequent earthquakes.

203
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,350
This isn't an earthquake.

204
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:55,080
Something's sleeping soundly

205
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,230
and snoozing.

206
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,590
Snoozing?

207
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,440
But it's too loud.

208
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,550
What is snoozing?

209
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,350
We're inside its body.

210
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
Look. Look up.

211
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:17,840
What...?

212
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,760
What is this?

213
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,350
It's a demon.

214
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,400
Demon,

215
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,400
show yourself.

216
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,840
Oh, no. Demon!

217
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:54,880
Help!

218
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,000
Don't panic.

219
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:04,320
Hold on tightly to my beads.

220
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,400
It's swallowing us.

221
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,350
This pond is its stomach.

222
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,000
Are you alright?

223
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:13,760
You all right?

224
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:14,710
How are you?

225
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:15,910
What happened just now?

226
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,910
Where are we?

227
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,350
What happened?

228
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:18,400
Why are we in the tree?

229
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,670
Yeah. Why are we here?

230
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,520
Monk,

231
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,350
how dare you ruin my plan?

232
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,880
I was sleeping for a long time
and I wanted some food.

233
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,030
But you messed with it.

234
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,520
Demon,

235
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,840
you must've been here for a long time.

236
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,150
These villagers only do farm work here.

237
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,880
They're innocent.

238
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,440
Spit them out.

239
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,230
All right.

240
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,470
Since you have some power,

241
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,440
how about we play a game?

242
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,640
I'm right among you.

243
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,320
Come on.

244
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,440
Come and get me.

245
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,000
Who?

246
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:46,550
Yeah. Who is it?

247
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,880
You. It's you.

248
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,440
He's been staying
by the pond these days.

249
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,080
It's you.

250
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,320
It must be him.

251
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,400
I'm not.

252
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,230
It must be him.

253
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,110
I saw him

254
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,110
sneak around the pond.

255
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:58,550
Yeah, it's him.

256
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,790
No. It's not me.

257
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:00,670
It's him.

258
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,440
I'm sure.

259
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,110
It must be him.

260
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,840
It's not me.

261
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:03,880
Demon.

262
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,910
We're right. It must be him.

263
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,030
After sleeping for centuries,

264
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,080
you must be starving.

265
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:10,710
I...

266
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:11,910
I couldn't help it.

267
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,200
Look.

268
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,710
Taotie!

269
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:16,320
Look.

270
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,840
There you are.

271
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,520
How do you know it's me?

272
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,440
Today,

273
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,550
you conjured such a nice peach orchard.

274
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,320
So, you could also conjure a pretty you.

275
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,280
Such an interesting monk.

276
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:52,520
Since you were born in chaos,

277
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,960
you've been traveling
in the mortal world.

278
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,710
Floods, rocks,

279
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,110
or even the feast
of the Queen Mother of the West...

280
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:01,670
You eat whatever you want to eat.

281
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:03,880
Even so,

282
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,550
you haven't tasted all the delicacies.

283
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,080
Taotie,

284
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,640
you love the peach orchard.

285
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,960
So, you still have a conscience.

286
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,590
Why don't you release these villagers?

287
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,110
Go with me

288
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,470
to travel around the world

289
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:27,110
and taste all the delicacies.

290
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,960
You're a mere human.

291
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,200
How dare you brag like that?

292
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,190
Monk,

293
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,160
your green dumplings

294
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:11,950
tasted bad, actually.

295
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:23,950
Miss Zhu,

296
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,310
what did you say?

297
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,400
Nothing.

298
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,110
You... You cried?

299
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,990
You always lit the incense

300
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,510
and it made me cry.

301
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,560
You're sick.

302
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,840
The incense is very necessary.

303
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,230
It chokes me.

304
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,720
It chokes me.

305
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,390
See?

306
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,230
It may even burn my house.

307
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,630
You need the incense.

308
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,270
It can relieve your symptoms.

309
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,600
But it doesn't work now.

310
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,040
I know.

311
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,510
But I have to do something

312
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,470
to cure you.

313
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,110
I've visited nearby clinics.

314
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,960
None of the physicians can do anything.

315
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,150
Tomorrow, I'll go to another town.

316
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:22,750
Qing,

317
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,470
don't waste your time on my problem.

318
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,840
I have to.

319
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,270
Miss Zhu,

320
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,800
do you know how to cure yourself?

321
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,750
Yes.

322
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,110
All you need to do

323
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:43,960
is make me happy.

324
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,230
Happy?

325
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,840
I'm sick.

326
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:51,350
But if I stay happy every day,

327
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,630
I'll recover soon.

328
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,560
Happy...

329
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,440
Oh,

330
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,750
it's forever since you ate...

331
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,270
Beast?

332
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,080
Pasty in Xunfang Resto, I mean.

333
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,750
I'll go buy some for you.

334
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,230
Qing!

335
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,200
What is he doing?

336
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,600
Mr. Chang.

337
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,110
When you cook something,

338
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:41,080
why do you make such a mess?

339
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:42,390
That's right.

340
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,320
When Miss Zhu wakes up
and sees it, she'll be angry.

341
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,080
Stop mocking me.

342
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,840
Come help me.

343
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,080
I won't. It's dirty.

344
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,630
You...

345
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,680
Cuiyan.

346
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:00,920
Qing,

347
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,630
didn't you say

348
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,680
you would buy me some pastry
from Xunfang Resto?

349
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,230
What are these?

350
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,390
Jujube pastry?

351
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,080
Isn't it just some batter?

352
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,080
And what's this?

353
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,750
A pie?

354
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:14,040
It's just a dough.

355
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,630
I have no appetite.

356
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:16,960
Miss Zhu.

357
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,110
Don't say that.

358
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:18,990
Mr. Qing

359
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,440
made all this for you.

360
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,230
Miss Zhu,

361
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,110
taste it.

362
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,080
Maybe it tastes good.

363
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,600
I didn't say I wouldn't eat.

364
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,320
If you have no appetite, don't eat any.

365
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,200
Qing.

366
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,230
Tell me.

367
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,040
Why did you make it yourself?

368
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,230
Miss Zhu,

369
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,920
he had no choice.

370
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,470
Today, all the pastry in Xunfang Resto

371
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,800
was bought by Prince of Langya.

372
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,350
Heng?

373
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,230
Why does he need so much pastry?

374
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,720
There's a drought around Wuxia.

375
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,110
Refugees flooded in.

376
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,390
His Highness bought a lot of pastry

377
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:01,390
to feed the refugees.

378
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,680
Well, this man

379
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,720
really cares for his people.

380
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,440
He does, indeed.

381
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,200
But I only care for you.

382
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,200
Chunjiu, Xiefen.

383
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,960
Tell me.

384
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:28,750
What is pastry?

385
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,390
People call this kind of cake

386
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:32,110
"pastry".

387
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
But why?

388
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,270
We don't know.

389
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,680
The two of you

390
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,960
have little knowledge.

391
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,630
It is said a general

392
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,990
was touched

393
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:45,800
when he saw his warriors

394
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,600
fought fiercely.

395
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,270
So, he gave out an order,

396
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,110
having tasty pastry
made and delivered to the front line

397
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,200
to express his gratitude.

398
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,230
We can't drink water.

399
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,200
Don't be silly.

400
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,150
Since then,

401
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,270
the name of "pastry"

402
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,080
has been passed on.

403
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,270
For a simple purpose,

404
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,150
a chef can't make

405
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:09,680
the most delicious and meaningful food.

406
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,800
Every chef has to

407
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,270
put a lot of effort.

408
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,440
Don't be so demanding.

409
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,680
You have to make a lot of dishes.

410
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,600
If you put a lot of effort

411
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,800
in every dish,

412
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,630
won't you be exhausted?

413
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,920
Now, I have nothing to eat.

414
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,440
I feel like I'm already dead.

415
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,040
Also,

416
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,600
one must cook wholeheartedly.

417
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:32,920
Fine. You don't eat this.

418
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,110
Tomorrow,

419
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,960
I'll buy some from Fenghe Restaurant.

420
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,470
No.

421
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,440
What will you eat, then?

422
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,680
You know what I want to eat.

423
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,150
No way.

424
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:44,990
Miss Zhu.

425
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,990
Fine. I get it.

426
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:54,680
I'll see what I can do.

427
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,870

440

Dumplings for sale.

441
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:38,920
Sir,

442
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,800
want some dumplings?

443
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,150
Hot dumplings.

444
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:43,040
Excuse me, sir.

445
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,680
Do you sell beasts?

446
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,720
What are you talking about?

447
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,720
I have no idea.

448
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:51,800
Don't slander me.

449
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,680
I'm from Tianxiang Restaurant.

450
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:55,990
Tianxiang Restaurant?

451
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,440
Miss Zhu Chengbi

452
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,630
sent me.

453
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,320
Miss Zhu?

454
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:02,750
Which do you want?

455
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,440
Here. Pick it yourself.

456
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:05,870
Are there beasts

457
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,960
that died of natural causes?

458
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:16,920
Qing.

459
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,440
You look furtive.

460
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:20,990
What did you do?

461
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,920
Qing, didn't you say

462
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,840
you would buy me a beast?

463
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,750
Where is it?

464
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,200
They're dead.

465
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,870
If you eat them, you'll get worse.

466
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,920
You could have bought a living one.

467
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,510
Living beasts were sold out.

468
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,560
You're lying.

469
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:52,990
Shut up.

470
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,920
You just don't want me to eat any.

471
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,630
You think I don't know?

472
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,840
When you're sick,

473
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,800
you deliberately want beasts.

474
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,080
Oh, how daring.

475
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,560
If Prince of Langya...

476
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,350
If he were here,

477
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,870
he would bring me

478
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:09,680
all the beasts.

479
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,840
His Highness is the best.

480
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
Yes. He's the best.

481
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,270
Let's go.

482
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:13,720
You...

483
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,230
Miss Zhu.

484
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:20,800
Miss Zhu, are you alright?

485
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,510
Don't scare me.

486
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,470
I did it wrong.

487
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:23,750
I'll go buy you a beast now.

488
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:24,270
Qing,

489
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,720
if you care for me,

490
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,960
take me out for a walk.

491
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:33,720
Miss Zhu.

492
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,680
Let's go.

493
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,840
I don't want to stay indoors every day.

494
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,840
I must go out and play.

495
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,040
Then, let's not walk.

496
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,150
Let's take a carriage.

497
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,200
Wait. I'll paint one.

498
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:49,680
No.

499
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,510
It's not fun to take a carriage.

500
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,990
Did you bring the Peach Wine?

501
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:56,960
Yes.

502
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,560
Carry me.

503
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,040
Let's go.

504
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:25,720
Look.

505
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,350
She's doing great.

506
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,150
Bravo.

507
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:27,630
Impressive.

508
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,840
She's awesome. Look.

509
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,110
How interesting.

510
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,750
Nice.

511
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,560
Nice.

512
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,600
Bravo.

513
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,600
Impressive.

514
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,440
Let's go.

515
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:38,920
Nice.

516
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,320
Really nice.

517
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,200
Awesome.

518
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:49,840
Great.

519
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,150
Miss Zhu,

520
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:54,760
it's late.

521
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,840
Shall we go back?

522
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,030
No.

523
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,120
Let's go out of town.

524
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,720
What for?

525
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:05,550
Just go.

526
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,190
Fine.

527
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,240
Miss Zhu,

528
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,550
we're far from Wuxia.

529
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:29,910
I'll go up the mountain.

530
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,270
Why?

531
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:32,960
Let's go.

532
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,000
Fine. Whatever you say.

533
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,840
Qing, put me down.

534
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,480
Miss Zhu,

535
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:27,270
it's very cold here.

536
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,240
You're in poor health.

537
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Shall we go back?

538
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:30,480
No.

539
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,390
We'll stay overnight.

540
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,910
Monk, I can't walk any further.

541
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,150
I've been walking the whole night.

542
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:11,790
Come on.

543
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:13,080
Hold on a bit longer.

544
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,390
Go over this mountain

545
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,000
and we'll reach Wuxia.

546
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,240
There's a lot of food in town.

547
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,480
Food?

548
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,030
Let's go.

549
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:22,670
Tasty food.

550
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,480
Wuxia.

551
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,080
But anyway,

552
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:27,150
if you're really tired,

553
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:28,790
we'll take some rest here.

554
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,030
Monk,

555
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,510
you promised to take me
to travel around.

556
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,480
But every day,

557
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,760
you meditate and read scriptures.

558
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,600
How boring.

559
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,310
When we reach Wuxia,

560
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,600
I'll go taste fancy food.

561
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,480
I'll have a drink, too.

562
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,030
I'll go shopping.

563
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,880
I'll taste the best green dumplings

564
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,030
in the city.

565
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,120
Because your green dumplings

566
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,270
taste really bad.

567
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,360
I'll go back with you
to Cangwu Mountain

568
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
and watch the sunrise together.

569
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:16,720
Qing.

570
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,150
Put me down.

571
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,670
Give me the wine.

572
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,790
This is your favorite wine.

573
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,640
Because of you,

574
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,910
there's a drought.

575
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,760
I know you're thirsty.

576
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,840
But the world is dry, too.

577
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,760
I think you understand.

578
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,080
The one you've been waiting for

579
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,670
will never come back.

580
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,550
It's the same with me.

581
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,790
The one I've been waiting for

582
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,240
won't come back, either.

583
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,190
Dragon,

584
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,360
here I am.

585
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,240
Dragon,

586
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,840
I will make the real
Heaven and Earth in Spring

587
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,150
and keep the promise
between you and my ancestor.

588
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,080
Dragon,

589
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:11,920
you must believe

590
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,160
I will succeed.

591
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:14,510
That's why it rains, right?

592
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,550
Miss Zhu.

593
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,080
It's raining.

594
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,440
Let's go back.

595
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,710
What are you waiting for?

596
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,790
Come and hold the umbrella.

597
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:44,710
All right.

598
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,030
What's your name?

599
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,200
I... I'm Shi Yiwu.

600
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,950
My master calls me Stone.

601
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:01,880
Stone?

602
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,310
Stone.

603
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,080
Do you need 300 liang of silver?

604
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,160
Qing,

605
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,640
you go back now.

606
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,400
But...

607
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:35,120
Don't worry.

608
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,470
Fine.

609
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,840
Be very careful.

610
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:40,840
Stone,

611
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,990
if anything happens,

612
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,030
come to Tianxiang Restaurant.

613
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:43,680
I will.

614
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:47,030
Stay safe.

615
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,600
Stone,

616
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,950
are you a Wuxia native?

617
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:00,230
No.

618
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,710
I've just moved in.

619
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,470
No wonder you look unfamiliar.

620
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,550
I saw you dump something

621
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:08,550
off the bridge.

622
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,750
I gave offerings to the Dragon.

623
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,790
I fed him my pastry
Heaven and Earth in Spring.

624
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,400
But again, I failed.

625
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,470
Oh, I see.

626
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,470
Heaven and Earth in Spring.

627
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,440
Then...

628
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,840
Who taught you to make that?

629
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,470
My master.

630
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,750
We're the heir of the Mei's Pastry.

631
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,080
How do you know you failed?

632
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,710
Look.

633
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,160
It's raining.

634
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,510
Because the Dragon didn't eat it.

635
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,470
My master said

636
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,310
our ancestor Mei Sheng
went to the Capital City.

637
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,200
When he was passing by,

638
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,270
he met the Dragon.

639
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:40,550
They had a good time talking.

640
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,080
My ancestor even promised

641
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,790
to make him Heaven and Earth in Spring.

642
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:48,790
This story sounds familiar.

643
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,550
Miss,

644
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,360
are you hungry?

645
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:55,880
If you don't mind,

646
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,030
come to my shop.

647
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,200
I'll make you green dumplings.

648
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,080
Green dumplings?

649
00:36:59,440 --> 00:36:59,840
Yes.

650
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,360
All right.

651
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:01,790
It's over there.

652
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,550
[Pastry]

653
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,710
Miss, here we are.

654
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,840
We have few customers.

655
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,880
Sit here and wait a moment.

656
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:19,640
All right.

657
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,840
There are many kinds of green dumplings.

658
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,550
Those made of ramie leaves taste best.

659
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,840
They're tasty and soft.

660
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,270
The special aroma of ramie leaves

661
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,550
usually keeps people eating.

662
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,230
Stone, are you using green ramie?

663
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:08,310
Yes.

Mei Dongjing,

681
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,990
so this boy

682
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,550
is your heir.

683
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:37,440
Stone,

684
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:38,880
you cook perfectly.

685
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,120
After having your green dumplings,

686
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:42,360
I'm in better spirits.

687
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,470
Your business will prosper.

688
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:45,510

Miss Zhu,

692
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,080
you look much better.

693
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:10,360
Yes.

694
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,310
Earlier today, I ate

695
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,710
some tasty green dumplings.

696
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,030
I feel much better now.

697
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,550
Miss Zhu,

698
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,790
today, I heard about something

699
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,710
very interesting.

700
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,680
Let me say it.

701
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,440
Please.

702
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,310
Don't interrupt.

703
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:24,200
Let me say it.

704
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:24,790
Stop it.

705
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,750
Yingtao.

706
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,510
Here's the thing.

707
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:31,120
When we went vegetable shopping,

708
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:33,230
we heard about a dragon
under the bridge.

709
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,080
That's right.

710
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,270
I heard a silly boy

711
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,880
dumped green dumplings off the bridge

712
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:39,790
these days.

713
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,230
Then, the Dragon appeared.

714
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,440
I guess the green dumplings taste bad

715
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,160
and can't be sold.

716
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,470
That's why he dumped them.

717
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:50,680
It makes sense.

718
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,840
I asked you to study,

719
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,790
but you never listened.

720
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,270
The story of the Dragon

721
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,400
was recorded

722
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,920
in Mei Sheng's Encounter
with an Immortal.

723
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,120
In this case,

724
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,230
it wasn't made up.

725
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,840
It's a true story.

726
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,310
If you say so...

727
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,440
Qing,

728
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:09,840
didn't you say

729
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,200
you would keep me happy?

730
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,640
I want to read the story

731
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,600
of Mei Sheng.

732
00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:17,030
Get me all these books.

733
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,080
You want books?

734
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:19,840
No problem.

735
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,080
That's easier than getting beasts.

736
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,680
