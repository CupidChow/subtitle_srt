00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,520
finding this fish.

195
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,040
You've come to the right place this time.

196
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:28,830
This fish

197
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,310
tastes so delicious.

198
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,110
Cong,

199
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,230
wait a moment please.

200
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,070
Yes.

201
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,000
Sir,

202
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,230
the banquet is already under preparation.

203
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,520
Miss Zhu

204
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,760
is cooking that mermaid.

205
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,880
Okay.

206
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:44,680
This is Gao Cong,

207
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,400
whom I've often told you about.

208
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,000
That mermaid is his sweetheart.

209
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,520
We have to thank him

210
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,680
for catching the mermaid this time.

211
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,070
Gao Cong?

212
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,920
Why do you have to do this?

213
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,760
It'd be better if I had eaten you.

214
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,160
What's done is done.

215
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,590
Miss, Zhu, please save me.

216
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,000
Well, whatever.

217
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,880
It will end soon, anyway.

218
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,760
Time to serve the food.

219
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,920
So you're still going to eat her.

220
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,400
How can you be so inhumane?

221
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,110
Now that you are here,

222
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:43,590
enjoy the show.

223
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,190
The mermaid banquet will start now,

224
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,350
please take your seat!

225
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,520
You're still finding excuses?

226
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,000
You still haven't understood it, have you?

227
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,160
I hid it from you

228
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,160
precisely because I feared
that you'd tell others about it

229
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,190
and ruin my plan.

230
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,400
Now that you're here,

231
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,070
just stay still

232
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,520
without making a sound,

233
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:01,950
understand?

234
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,280
But...

235
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:02,640
Go.

236
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,640
Do as I said.

237
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,230
Do as I said.

238
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,710
No.

239
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,160
I can't let her trick me.

240
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,430
Is she the Miss Zhu of Tianxiang Restaurant?

241
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,830
The mermaid dish is on the golden plate.

242
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,280
Mermaid has cold energy,

243
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,680
so it's better to eat it
with white plum blossoms from last year,

244
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,160
white vinegar frozen in snow,

245
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,470
frosted plum blossoms and pine needles

246
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,190
to complement each other.

247
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,830
The mermaid still needs to be marinated

248
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,680
for a while to be flavorful.

249
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,000
Before you eat it, I have a question.

250
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:24,070
Did you take a bath,

251
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,680
fast, get changed

252
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,000
and burn incense as I told you to?

253
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,110
Did you have perilla,

254
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,400
tawny daylily and mugwort

255
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,350
in your bath water?

256
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:32,800
Yes.

257
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,310
We did all of these before coming.

258
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,430
How could we not listen to you?

259
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,400
Okay then.

260
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,400
Those who won't eat it

261
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,920
and those who didn't take a bath or get changed,

262
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,400
please leave by boat first.

263
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,160
Those who won't eat it, please leave now.

264
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:50,520
Everyone,

265
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,110
the banquet is ready.

266
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:53,430
Please enjoy.

267
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,430
The mermaid is indeed so delicious.

268
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,520
The meat just melts in the mouth

269
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,000
and it has a strong aroma.

270
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,110
Your Highness,

271
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,430
I invited you

272
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:31,760
to my banquet today,

273
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,520
yet

274
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,400
you haven't eaten anything.

275
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,880
This is a bit disappointing, don't you think?

276
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,520
Mr. Jia,

277
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,880
I have nothing against you.

278
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,110
However, I feel unwell today

279
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:50,760
and I'm allergic to fish.

280
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,520
Won't it be worse

281
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,070
if I get sick and ruin

282
00:22:57,190 --> 00:22:59,000
this exquisitely prepared feast?

283
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:00,590
Okay then.

284
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,950
Since you're so weak,

285
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,590
I won't force you to eat.

286
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,680
You do whatever you want.

287
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,400
Although I don't want to eat it,

288
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,470
I'm interested

289
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,430
in what the mermaid looks like.

290
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm ready to show you

291
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,800
what the mermaid looks like.

292
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,280
Here she is.

293
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,590
Look.

294
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:47,950
Jiao?

295
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,190
That's wonderful.

296
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,230
You are all

297
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,000
very lucky to eat it.

298
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,190
Do you know

299
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,000
why the dish today is so special?

300
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,400
Please tell us.

301
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,070
I'm all ears.

302
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,920
There are three special things
about today's mermaid.

303
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,470
First,

304
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,800
the mermaid itself is so precious.

305
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,520
Second,

306
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,830
I managed to invite Miss Zhu

307
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,070
of Tianxiang Restaurant to cook it.

308
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:19,920
Third,

309
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,520
this mermaid is in love with a human.

310
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:25,680
This is a match made in heaven.

311
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,470
So, of course it's delicious

312
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,400
and has a strong aroma.

313
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,000
Mr. Jia,

314
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,950
I understand the first two points.

315
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,350
But

316
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,230
I don't understand

317
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,590
the third one,

318
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,350
so please elaborate on it.

319
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,040
Your Highness,

320
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:51,920
let me explain.

321
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,710
Mr. Jia never eats

322
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,110
ordinary food.

323
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:58,830
Xie Yan,

324
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,000
elaborate on it.

325
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,190
Yes, sir.

326
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,710
I invited Gao Cong to dinner that day.

327
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,680
When a fish dish was served,

328
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,800
Cong burst

329
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,160
into tears.

330
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,230
I asked him about it,

331
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,110
and he told me that a mermaid

332
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,310
had turned into a woman and stayed with him.

333
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,640
Then I came up with an idea

334
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,560
for him to catch the mermaid.

335
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:27,710
The woman the mermaid turned into

336
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,310
was Gao Cong's sweetheart.

337
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,950
To stay with him,

338
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,470
she had to endure the pain

339
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,350
of her skin cracking

340
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:35,640
after being exposed to sunshine on land.

341
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:38,350
And Mr. Gao was still together with her

342
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,400
in spite of disapproval from his family

343
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,430
and prejudice from others.

344
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,470
Such loyal

345
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,760
and touching love is exactly

346
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,000
the best seasoning for the mermaid, isn't it,

347
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:47,920
Mr. Gao?

348
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:48,760
Yes

349
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,230
and no.

350
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,400
Just tell us.

351
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:56,710
Tell us

352
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,350
why we can feel

353
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,280
the love

354
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,160
in this mermaid dish.

355
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,000
It's because...

356
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,560
It's because I proposed to her today

357
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,470
and we had cross-cupped wine.

358
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,000
Then I drugged her

359
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,880
at her happiest moment.

360
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,190
That's why you can feel happy

361
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,800
when you eat it.

362
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,640
Mr. Gao, you took great pains

363
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,800
to get the mermaid.

364
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:32,950
Why don't you taste it yourself?

365
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,350
Does it taste good?

366
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:44,230
The meat just melts in the mouth

367
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,070
and it has a strong aroma.

368
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:48,880
This is the mermaid

369
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,350
nourished by your love.

370
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,160
Did you feel the happiness?

371
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,520
Yes.

372
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,400
Ziyu!

373
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:18,470
Ziyu!

374
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,680
Ziyu...

375
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,520
Ziyu!

376
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,230
Ziyu.

377
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,400
Jiao.

378
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,560
Jiao.

379
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,400
Ziyu.

380
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,470
Yes.

381
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,350
Ziyu!

382
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Ziyu!

383
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,190
Ziyu!

384
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,280
Don't be afraid.

385
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,400
This red rope is specially made.

386
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,950
Unless the buckle is unfastened,

387
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:08,190
the mermaid won't be able to escape.

388
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,110
Gao Cong...

389
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,920
Gao Cong, how despicable you are!

390
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:22,070
I thought you'd turned yourself around

391
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,800
and felt happy for you.

392
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,640
I didn't know that you faked all of this

393
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,160
so you could betray her today!

394
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,680
How dare you?

395
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,000
Who are you?

396
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,190
Come on, catch him!

397
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,000
Yes!

398
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:32,040
Mr. Jia,

399
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,760
this is my accountant.

400
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,430
He loves to poke his nose
into other people's business.

401
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:36,470
It's my bad,

402
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,280
please forgive him.

403
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,470
So he works for Miss Zhu.

404
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,430
Okay then.

405
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,470
I'll spare him this time

406
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,880
for your sake.

407
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:50,640
But he has to

408
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,520
stop making trouble!

409
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:58,430
Qing.

410
00:29:59,070 --> 00:29:59,590
Qing!

411
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,430
Everyone,

412
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,950
please enjoy your food.

413
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,590
Don't let him spoil your night.

414
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,400
Come on.

415
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,350
- Please.
- Please.

416
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,310
Help yourself.

417
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:22,880
A bunch of clowns!

418
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,560
Gao Cong,

419
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,590
you're decisive and ambitious,

420
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,640
you can do great things.

421
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,280
You'll have a great future.

422
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,000
Work for me from now on.

423
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
Thank you so much, Mr. Jia.

424
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
I'll do my best to serve you

425
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,680
and be absolutely loyal.

426
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,350
Everyone,

427
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,520
this is the song of the mermaid.

428
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,470
It's been passed down
by word of mouth among fishermen,

429
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:30,350
becoming the myth of the mermaid now.

430
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:36,110
Wonderful.

431
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,800
Not only did we taste the mermaid dish today,

432
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,830
we also got to hear the mermaid sing.

433
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:44,830
Mr. Jia, you're a gourmet indeed.

434
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:46,400
Your taste is unparalleled

435
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,000
in the world.

436
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,400
I just worry about one thing.

437
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,310
After tasting

438
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,710
the divine mermaid,

439
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:56,710
I'm afraid I won't be used

440
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,920
to the average food

441
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,070
at home.

442
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,760
Tonight, we enjoy the sea breeze,

443
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:02,640
the moon,

444
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,110
the festival

445
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,760
and the mermaid dish with love.

446
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,350
Such a delicacy in the right place

447
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:08,520
and at the right time.

448
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:09,880
Come on,

449
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,280
let's welcome Mr. Jia

450
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,470
to Wuxia.

451
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,760
Mr. Jia, Wuxia is honored by your presence.

452
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,470
Here's to Mr. Jia.

453
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,520
Here's to Mr. Jia.

454
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,350
Let's drink together.

455
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,190
Come on.

456
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:21,430
Please.

457
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,590
Mr. Jia, please.

458
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,000
Your Highness.

459
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,520
Wuxia is undoubtedly honored

460
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,880
by Mr. Jia's presence.

461
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,400
But now I recall one thing.

462
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,280
You're also the one

463
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,680
who killed the white cranes' keeper in Jinan

464
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,310
because you wanted to eat the cranes, aren't you?

465
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,950
It's said that by eating mermaids,
one can keep nightmares away.

466
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:12,920
Mr. Jia, you want to eat mermaids so badly.

467
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Is that because you're unable

468
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,710
to fall asleep at night

469
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,190
after eating so many beasts?

470
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,280
This is venomous slander!

471
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:22,350
I've treated you with kindness.

472
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:22,880
How dare you...

473
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,280
So that's why the Emperor
would rather send you here

474
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,680
than meet you.

475
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,350
Mr. Jia,

476
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,590
I'm looking forward to the day

477
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:50,160
when you confront me in front of my father.

478
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,040
Maybe he'll start to trust me

479
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,000
because of you.

480
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:03,920
You...

481
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:06,830
You...

482
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:23,870
Xiaolian!

483
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,080
Xiaolian!

484
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,910
Help Mr. Jia fix his makeup now.

485
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,080
Go away!

486
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,320
Go away!

487
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,150
Look.

488
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,870
I didn't know

489
00:34:39,870 --> 00:34:41,560
that Mr. Jia likes to wear makeup.

490
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,840
Every year, there will be a lot of people

491
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,080
who fall into the water accidentally
when watching the moon.

492
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,080
Your Highness,

493
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,080
I'm afraid it will be hard for you to get off!

494
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,390
Come on,

495
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,560
go watch the moon with the Prince!

496
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:54,560
Yes!

497
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,840
Xie Yan!

498
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,710
- Sir!
- Sir!

499
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:11,950
- Sir!
- Sir!

500
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,080
What's happening?

501
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:19,520
Mr. Jia,

502
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:21,870
I forgot to tell you

503
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,320
that the dish you had

504
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,910
is not the mermaid dish.

505
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,390
This is just ordinary bass,

506
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,000
the appetizer before the main course.

507
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,470
Also,

508
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,840
the wine I specially made for you

509
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:36,760
is the same as the cross-cupped wine

510
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,950
Gao Cong gave to Jiao.

511
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,520
Now you're feeling tired

512
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:45,120
with weak hands, aren't you?

513
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,150
Mr. Jia,

514
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,390
with the mermaid dish you longed for

515
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,560
and the fabulous mermaid song,

516
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,520
this is the grand funeral

517
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,670
I specially prepared for you.

518
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:52,670
Miss Zhu,

519
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:53,080
are you okay?

520
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:53,520
Yes.

521
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,120
Let's go.

522
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:15,910
In "Records of Beasts in the Continent",

523
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,000
it's described that mermaids and mermen
are beasts from the Southern Sea.

524
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,390
Mermaids are beautiful and mermen are aggressive.

525
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,800
And they are great singers.

526
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,760
Guess that is true.

527
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,670
Such an unusual banquet.

528
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:47,800
Mingyan,

529
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:48,670
protect Miss Zhu

530
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,080
and His Highness!

531
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,000
Run.

532
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:58,800
Qing,

533
00:37:59,230 --> 00:37:59,800
take this.

534
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:03,950
Are you okay, Your Highness?

535
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:04,670
Your Highness.

536
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:05,430
Step aside!

537
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:43,670
Mr. Gao,

538
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,520
Jiao gave you this piece of jade

539
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,150
so the mermen wouldn't get close to hurt you.

540
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,710
However, you gave this to me

541
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,280
when you came to Tianxiang Restaurant today

542
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,320
to ask for my help.

543
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:51,190
If not for that,

544
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
you would be safe now.

545
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:55,000
Do you regret it?

546
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,600
Jiao!

547
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:20,840
Jiao,

548
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,840
it's so great that you're alive.

549
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:23,320
What she said is not true.

550
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,190
She was lying.

551
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,630
Jiao, I'm wrong.

552
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,190
I know you love me the most.

553
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,600
Please save me.

554
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:29,760
Cong,

555
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,040
actually, I was willing to sacrifice myself.

556
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,910
You didn't need to lie to me.

557
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,040
Jiao,

558
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,230
don't let him eat me.

559
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,000
Save me please!

560
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,190
Save me!

561
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,520
Save me!

562
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,950
Jiao...

563
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:18,670
Jiao,

564
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,320
eat him now.

565
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,520
Your grandmother has given you the Spell of Love.

566
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,390
If you eat him,

567
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,760
you can forget him.

568
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,670
I'd rather remember

569
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,430
that you loved me.
