[The Legend of TAOTIE]

22
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,080
[Episode 38]

23
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:28,750
This is the tenderest part
of the beef tenderloin.

24
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,320
The thickness of the meat slices

25
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,960
determines the diner's taste experience.

26
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,270
If the slices are too thick,
they remain undercooked

27
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,270
and are hard to chew.

28
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,470
If too thin, they dissolve in water,

29
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,470
and melt in the mouth,

30
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,550
leaving no aftertaste.

31
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,110
Good, good.

32
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,550
Miss Zhu, your knife skills
are truly impressive.

33
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,360
After boiling, in the pot,

34
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,240
these meat slices
taste fresh and delicious

35
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,320
paired with this broth.

36
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,360
Yes, indeed.

37
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,880
- Come, eat.
- Miss Zhu, great cooking.

38
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:48,190
Who would've thought
these simply prepared dishes

39
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,270
could make everyone so happy?

40
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,240
In the past,

41
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,320
I sought rare demon beasts for cooking,

42
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,550
because I lacked

43
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,320
the sincerest emotions when cooking.

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,910
Now it seems

45
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,030
the most ordinary ingredients

46
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,360
can create dishes

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,960
that bring those who eat

48
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,000
more happiness and joy.

49
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,440
It turns out the true value of dishes

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,030
lies in the emotions.

51
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,670
Whether it's family reunions,

52
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,390
or gatherings with friends,

53
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,390
the mood of the diners

54
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,510
defines the meaning
of the dishes themselves.

55
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,440
This

56
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,720
is the connection
between food and people.

57
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,070
So many things.

58
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,440
When will we finish tidying up?

59
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,350
After so many days of work,

60
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,070
I wanted to have hotpot,

61
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,480
but ended up

62
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,880
benefiting the others.

63
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,070
Qing,

64
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,510
Lu Ying told me

65
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,510
after that great fire,

66
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,070
you and Xiaoli...

67
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,230
Xiaoli disappeared

68
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,510
without a trace.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,790
Now her appearing
at Tianxiang Restaurant

70
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,760
is indeed suspicious.

71
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:19,880
In order to confirm her identity,

72
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:21,800
please find a reason

73
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,360
to have Xiaoli
leave Tianxiang Restaurant,

74
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,920
so I can investigate.

75
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:50,960
Miss Zhu,

76
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,110
when did you come?

77
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,040
Miss Xiaoli,

78
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,760
what are you doing in the kitchen?

79
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,040
I came to see if
there's anything I can help with.

80
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,590
You came to Tianxiang Restaurant

81
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:09,360
not just to
look for your brother, right?

82
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,310
Miss Zhu, what are you saying?

83
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:15,590
I don't understand.

84
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:16,640
I came

85
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,270
just to find my brother, Chang Qing.

86
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,920
But your brother isn't here.

87
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,390
Why not look for him elsewhere?

88
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:26,830
Miss Zhu,

89
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,360
are you trying to drive me away?

90
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,590
I really don't know

91
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,710
when he'll be back.

92
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,040
Why not pack up these days

93
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,990
and look elsewhere?

94
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,080
Benefactor.

95
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,390
Benefactor.

96
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,310
I'm back.

97
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,710
How did things go?

98
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:05,680
I've been looking for

99
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,110
beasts like Flying Serpent
and Jue Ru these days.

100
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,920
They were all very happy to know

101
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,110
they'd soon return home

102
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,960
and are all willing

103
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,640
to follow your arrangements.

104
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,680
However,

105
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:15,870
I still want to ask

106
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,080
how do you plan to send them home.

107
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,960
You don't need
to ask about other matters.

108
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,550
I have my own arrangements.

109
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,550
I have good news to tell you.

110
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,960
Recently at Tianxiang Restaurant,

111
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,270
we found a girl named Chang Xiaoli.

112
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,590
Chang Xiaoli?

113
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,080
Is it

114
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,360
my sister, Xiaoli?

115
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:40,760
That's right.

116
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,080
I saw her with my own eyes

117
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,830
dying in the sea of flames.

118
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,760
How is it possible now?

119
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
I'll return right away
to Tianxiang Restaurant.

120
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,360
Qing.

121
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,270
Qing.

122
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,920
Xiaoli!

123
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,800
Qing.

124
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,590
It's Xiaoli.

125
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:27,190
Xiaoli,

126
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,000
it's really you.

127
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,950
It's me, Qing.

128
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,070
You're really alive.

129
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:39,830
Qing.

130
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,510
Thank you, Miss Zhu,
for kindly taking her in.

131
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,950
My sister has been troubling you
these past few days.

132
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,630
Qing,

133
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:09,830
you've misunderstood.

134
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,800
Actually, Miss Zhu
has always been very kind to me.

135
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,590
She is just

136
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,240
worried I wouldn't find you here,

137
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,270
and told me to look elsewhere for you.

138
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,800
- Mr. Chang Qing.
- Mr. Chang Qing.

139
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,560
- Mr. Chang Qing.
- Mr. Chang Qing.

140
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,150
- You're back, Mr. Chang Qing.
- Finally, you're back.

141
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,510
Mr. Chang Qing, you're finally back.

142
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,440
Mr. Chang Qing, you can't leave again.

143
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,150
Yes, yes, yes.

144
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,070
You can't leave again.

145
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,070
You need to draw new earrings for me.

146
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:37,440
Yes,

147
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,070
and mine too.

148
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,880
Draw me new clothes.

149
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,190
Yes.

150
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,070
I haven't changed my weapon in ages.

151
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:41,880
- Me too.
- It's completely useless.

152
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,480
Look how long I've worn this.

153
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:42,950
Qing,

154
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,750
since you and Xiaoli have reunited,

155
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,680
how about

156
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,800
you two stay here?

157
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,270
It's decided then.

158
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,560
Mr. Chang Qing, are you hungry?

159
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,630
How about Cuiyan and I

160
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,750
go make something for you to eat?

161
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,630
Yeah, it's been so long
since you came back.

162
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,040
- Yeah, we missed you so much.
- You must be very hungry.

163
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,120
Yes, yes.

164
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,070
We've all missed you so much.

165
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:02,590
Xiaoli,

166
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:05,830
then for now, let's...

167
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:07,830
Qing,

168
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,750
as long as I'm with you,

169
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,750
it doesn't matter where we live.

170
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,390
Then it's decided.

171
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:14,830
Let's go, Mr. Chang Qing.

172
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,590
Let's go, go, go.

173
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,480
Let's go, go.

174
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,000
Come.

175
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,270
Let's go.

176
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:18,830
Xiaoli.

177
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,830
I missed you so much.

178
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,510
Let's go.

179
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,120
Please forget about me, Miss Zhu.

180
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,390
We shall

181
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,390
never meet again.

182
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,510
I told you long ago

183
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,070
that we would never meet again.

184
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,830
This meeting

185
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,040
should be the last time.

186
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,270
Qing,

187
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,040
it's been a long time.

188
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,390
I was wrong.

189
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,070
Would you be willing
to make a pact with me?

190
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,120
Benefactor.

191
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,590
I've brought all the items

192
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,590
you wanted.

193
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,840
[Inspection Department]

194
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,950
- Mr. Lu.
- Mr. Lu.

195
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,560
Mr. Lu,

196
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,150
why did you bring your wife too?

197
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,240
Yundun,

198
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,070
since the beasts went missing,

199
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,630
there's been no news at all

200
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,920
about the people
the Inspection Department sent out

201
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,040
to track the beasts' whereabouts.

202
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,710
I really can't stop worrying.

203
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,590
I plan to go and check myself.

204
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,440
So, Mr. Lu,

205
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,710
do you want me to go with you?

206
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:36,240
No need.

207
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:36,950
Time is tight.

208
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,710
I have something more
important to entrust to you.

209
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,360
The Inspection Department
hasn't been very safe lately.

210
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,190
I'm worried that while I'm away,

211
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,040
complications might arise.

212
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,240
Now Yan

213
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,950
has no ability to protect herself.

214
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,880
I thought it over,

215
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,150
and still want to entrust her

216
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:57,680
to Miss Zhu.

217
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,800
Don't worry, Mr. Lu.

218
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:03,950
I will...

219
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,710
I'll head over right away.

220
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,070
Yundun.

221
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,120
Make sure to tell Miss Zhu

222
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,800
that Yan is still very weak.

223
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,510
She needs careful care.

224
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:14,830
In the morning,

225
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:16,480
prepare freshly collected dew for her,

226
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,950
absolutely not well water.

227
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,560
And it's best to clean

228
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,590
this cage daily.

229
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,120
And her food

230
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,440
needs special attention.

231
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,150
It must be fresh

232
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:26,880
and finely crushed to feed her.

233
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,510
Also...

234
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,630
At the Chen hour every day,

235
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,710
we need to take her out for fresh air.

236
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,800
Alright, Mr. Lu.

237
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,070
You don't have to worry.

238
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,390
I've watched you do these every day

239
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,680
and remembered them by heart.

240
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:38,880
You rascal.

241
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,440
Yan,

242
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,710
I'll come back for you in five days.

243
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,480
You'll have to stay

244
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,630
with Miss Zhu for now.

245
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,360
Be good.

246
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,480
Wait for me.

247
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:02,710
Miss Zhu,

248
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,390
Mr. Lu really cares about Qu Yan.

249
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,240
He's just leaving for a few days,

250
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,710
and specifically sent Yundun
to bring her here

251
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,120
instead of leaving her in the highly
guarded Inspection Department.

252
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:15,320
Previously, the beasts went missing
in the Inspection Department.

253
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,750
It shows that place isn't safe.

254
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:19,360
He's right to be cautious.

255
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,920
Miss Zhu,

256
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,800
it's late.

257
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,390
I'll take Qu Yan downstairs,

258
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,440
so as not to disturb your rest.

259
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:27,920
Alright.

260
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,120
Remember to collect some dew
for her tomorrow morning.

261
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,070
Also, remind Yingtao to be careful.

262
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,510
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

263
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,070
Now that Mr. Chang Qing is back,

264
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,070
we can have him redraw her
in the worst case.

265
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,360
Qing,

266
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,920
why are the birds you draw colorless?

267
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,040
They

268
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,560
should have vibrant feathers.

269
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:08,320
I just like brightly colored birds.

270
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,440
Xiaoli,

271
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,880
you're still the same
as when you were a child.

272
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,040
You haven't changed a bit.

273
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,190
You said the same thing
when we were kids.

274
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,630
Cuiyan,

275
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,880
why have you been
so wary of Xiaoli lately?

276
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,560
Ever since Miss Xiaoli arrived,

277
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,560
strange things have been happening
at Tianxiang Restaurant.

278
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,800
I've recently noticed

279
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,270
even the Shennong Tripod
has changed weight,

280
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,270
and the Dragon Bone Spoon

281
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,920
has also gone missing.

282
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,320
I asked Miss Zhu,

283
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,480
but she didn't say anything,

284
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,360
just told Miss Xiaoli

285
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,360
not to touch the ingredients
or clean anymore.

286
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,710
Mr. Chang Qing,

287
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,950
after all these years,

288
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,560
you're finally reunited
with Miss Xiaoli.

289
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:44,150
Don't you think

290
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,800
Miss Xiaoli's origins are unclear?

291
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,440
Cuiyan,

292
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,360
Xiaoli is indeed my sister.

293
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,750
She has a unique birthmark on her hand.

294
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,510
I wouldn't mistake it.

295
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,360
Where have you been

296
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,800
all these years?

297
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,040
What have you gone through?

298
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,480
On the day of the fire,

299
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,630
a kind man saved me.

300
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,510
He's been healing my injuries
all this time.

301
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,510
So for a long period,

302
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,920
I stayed in one place,

303
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,110
unable to get out of bed.

304
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,080
Until a few years ago,

305
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,680
my injuries were finally healed.

306
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,040
Then I decided

307
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,390
to come find you, Qing.

308
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,800
You must have suffered a lot.

309
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,870
But it's okay.

310
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,920
Now that you've returned to my side,

311
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,680
I will make up for

312
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,920
the happiness you've lost.

313
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,440
Qing,

314
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,320
do you really know your sister?

315
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:57,560
Miss Zhu.

316
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,270
Miss Zhu.

317
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,600
Miss Zhu, something bad happened.

318
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,230
Miss Zhu.

319
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,510
The rosefinch has disappeared.

320
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,680
Look.

321
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,200
I went out to collect dew this morning,

322
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,800
and when I went
to the backyard to feed her,

323
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,960
she was gone.

324
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,990
Only the cage was left.

325
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,390
She's Mr. Lu's treasure.

326
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,920
How could she just disappear?

327
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,510
After Qu Yan's rebirth,

328
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,200
she doesn't have the ability
to open the cage.

329
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,750
It must because

330
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,680
either the cage wasn't closed properly

331
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,320
or someone deliberately let her out.

332
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,680
How is that possible?

333
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,350
I checked the cage yesterday,

334
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,350
and it was locked tightly.

335
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,510
Unless someone silently

336
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,600
entered Tianxiang Restaurant

337
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,470
and let the rosefinch go.

338
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,630
Cuiyan,

339
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,600
Xiaoli is my sister.

340
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,750
I won't allow you to accuse her

341
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,630
without any evidence.

342
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:45,920
I'm not accusing her unfairly.

343
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,320
You...

344
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,510
Qing,

345
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,440
don't be angry.

346
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,870
Cuiyan

347
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,320
is just worried
because the rosefinch is missing.

348
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:54,390
Xiaoli,

349
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,630
if you're upset, you should say so.

350
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,680
With me here,

351
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,870
I won't let anyone
wrong you for no reason.

352
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,230
I didn't accuse her, it's just...

353
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:01,600
Cuiyan.

354
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:02,470
Enough.

355
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,750
Stop arguing.

356
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,200
Qing,

357
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,040
come with me.

358
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,440
Xiaoli,

359
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,990
don't be upset for now.

360
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,150
Go back and rest for a while.

361
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,350
I'll come find you soon.

362
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:56,960
Qing,

363
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,390
I've never seen

364
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,560
you get so angry with them.

365
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,560
Miss Zhu,

366
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,800
you should understand

367
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,080
how happy I am to see Xiaoli again.

368
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,560
From a young age,
Xiaoli always followed me.

369
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,320
When someone bullied her,

370
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,200
I always stood up for her.

371
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,630
Now I absolutely can't

372
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,230
let her suffer any grievances again.

373
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,630
In this world,

374
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,270
I'm the only family she has

375
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,110
who can protect her.

376
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,320
Qing,

377
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:25,750
I understand what you're saying.

378
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,920
Miss Zhu,

379
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,560
I don't need to tell you much

380
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,350
about Xiaoli's situation.

381
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,630
Why can't you trust her

382
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,470
like I do?

383
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,800
I know you care about Xiaoli.

384
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,230
But right now, Qu Yan

385
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,680
has no ability to protect herself.

386
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,440
We must find her as soon as possible.

387
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,040
You seem to have changed.

388
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,080
You can understand others' feelings now.

389
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,920
People all change

390
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,150
over time.

391
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:13,870
Xiaoli,

392
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,720
sorry you've been wronged.

393
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,200
Miss Zhu.

394
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,600
Miss Zhu.

395
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,110
Have you found a way
to locate the rosefinch?

396
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,230
What way, Miss Zhu?

397
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:29,800
Do you know

398
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,870
where Qu Yan is now?

399
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,600
I don't know.

400
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,200
But the one who let her go

401
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,230
must know.

402
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,230
You're still doubting Xiaoli?

403
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,870
I'm not doubting Xiaoli.

404
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,630
There are only five people
in Tianxiang Restaurant.

405
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,990
I'm suspecting everyone now.

406
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:48,720
Then

407
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,040
Miss Zhu,

408
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,470
what is the method you just mentioned?

409
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,990
I once learned to make
Truth-revealing Soup in Penglai

410
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,920
which makes people confess everything.

411
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:58,990
After drinking it,

412
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,080
people will reveal everything

413
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,270
without holding back.

414
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,390
Xiaoli,

415
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
are you willing to try it?

416
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:09,840
Miss Zhu,

417
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,390
isn't it like

418
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:12,040
interrogating Xiaoli
as she's a criminal?

419
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:12,800
Time is urgent.

420
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,080
I have no other choice.

421
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,920
Do you want to watch Qu Yan

422
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,440
just leave us like this?

423
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,320
And when Lu Ying returns
from his investigation,

424
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,080
how will we explain it to him?

425
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,510
Even so,

426
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,150
what does this have to do with Xiaoli?

427
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,040
If you trust her so much,

428
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,080
why not let us try?

429
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,990
It's just a Truth-revealing Soup.

430
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,150
It won't harm her.

431
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:34,840
That's right, Mr. Chang Qing.

432
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,510
Let's trust Miss Zhu.

433
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,870
After all, Miss Zhu
wouldn't harm Xiaoli.

434
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,600
Miss Xiaoli, isn't it right?

435
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:41,470
Yes.

436
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,150
Let Miss Xiaoli decide for herself.

437
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:52,840
Then I'll try it.

438
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,080
I believe

439
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,840
Miss Zhu is doing this
to find the rosefinch.

440
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,150
But for something I haven't done,

441
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,150
no matter how you try,
there won't be a result.

442
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:00,720
Xiaoli,

443
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,440
I'm with you.

444
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,320
If you don't want to do it,

445
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,600
I absolutely won't let anyone force you.

446
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:06,750
Qing,

447
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,720
it's okay.

448
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,230
I've made up my mind.

449
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,390
Alright.

450
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,110
Come with me.

451
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:17,920
Xiaoli.

452
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:19,630
Qing,

453
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:20,990
don't worry.

454
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:35,560
Xiaoli,

455
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:38,040
I'm here.

456
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:38,960
Don't be afraid.

457
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:45,870
This soup

458
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:46,960
smells so good.

459
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,800
It has a hint of fennel.

460
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,600
This is a herb that grows
on Kunlun Mountain.

461
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,440
It does resemble fennel.

462
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,840
If you're ready,

463
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,230
drink it.

464
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,040
Xiaoli.

465
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,200
Miss Zhu,

466
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,720
what should we do now?

467
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,350
Should we start asking her?

468
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:50,960
Xiaoli,

469
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,200
what's on your mind right now?

470
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,110
I...

471
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,510
What's happening to me?

472
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,600
It's okay.

473
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:13,110
You're just recalling

474
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,230
some important things.

475
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,680
Is the rosefinch's disappearance

476
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,200
related to you?

477
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,320
I...

478
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,600
Xiaoli.

479
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,560
Xiaoli, what's wrong?

480
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:29,960
Miss Zhu,

481
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,600
what exactly did you make me drink?

482
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,750
Why do I feel so unwell

483
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,720
and can't catch my breath?

484
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:50,840
Xiaoli.

485
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:52,800
Xiaoli.

486
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,560
This soup is fine.

487
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:55,470
Qing,

488
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
this soup is perfectly fine.

489
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,840
Don't say anything more.

490
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,990
Miss Xiaoli,

491
00:25:59,200 --> 00:25:59,920
quickly, tell us.

492
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,320
What are you thinking?

493
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:02,600
I'm thinking

494
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:04,750
that seeing my brother again

495
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,990
makes me so happy.

496
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,040
Anything else?

497
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,750
My head hurts.

498
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,230
It hurts so much.

499
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,200
Xiaoli.

500
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,320
Xiaoli!

501
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:19,680
Miss Zhu,

502
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,560
Miss Xiaoli drank
the Truth-revealing Soup.

503
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,720
Why didn't she answer

504
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,990
the question about
the rosefinch's disappearance?

505
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,720
Actually, whether she speaks or not

506
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:28,720
doesn't matter much anymore.

507
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,600
Now things have gotten worse.

508
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,750
The misunderstanding between you
and Mr. Chang Qing has deepened.

509
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,840
I believe he already understands.

510
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,080
This soup is fine.

511
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,200
Qing,

512
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,350
this soup is perfectly fine.

513
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,680
The Truth-revealing Soup didn't work

514
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,750
because at that time,

515
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:49,840
Xiaoli used a sharp object
to hurt herself.

516
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,200
I believe Qing saw it too.

517
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,350
Then

518
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:57,600
she deliberately knocked herself out.

519
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,110
Cuiyan,

520
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,040
you can leave now.

521
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,510
I've already calmed Xiaoli down.

522
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,440
Once she recovers,

523
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,350
I'll take her away.

524
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,750
Take her away?

525
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,750
I promise you.

526
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,800
After I take her back to our hometown,

527
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,560
I'll come back

528
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,440
to look for Qu Yan with you.

529
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,150
I can also ask Xu Ruoxu and Yuan

530
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:54,110
for help.

531
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,600
Qing,

532
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,040
some things are inevitable.

533
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,470
The deeper the needle pierces,
the more it hurts.

534
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,750
Even if it bleeds when pulled out,

535
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,840
it will eventually heal.

536
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,750
I understand.

537
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,720
But Xiaoli is still my sister.

538
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:24,200
I'm her only family in this world.

539
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,600
Xiaoli,

540
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,840
you're awake.

541
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,270
Qing.

542
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,470
What...

543
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,150
What happened to me?

544
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,350
Xiaoli,

545
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,960
don't be afraid.

546
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,440
You just got a little hurt.

547
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,150
From now on,

548
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,040
no one will force you
to reveal the truth anymore.

549
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,560
Don't worry.

550
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,560
I'll always take care of you.

551
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,560
But

552
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,110
in the future,

553
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,080
we can't stay here anymore.

554
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,470
Once you recover,

555
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:04,320
I'll take you back
to our hometown, alright?

556
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,720
Do you still remember

557
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,440
the little river I used
to take you to as a child?

558
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,440
I'll take you there again.

559
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,040
Qing,

560
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,040
it's all my fault.

561
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:17,630
I made you sad.

562
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,320
It's all my fault.

563
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,800
I didn't take good care of you.

564
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:25,470
When you get better,

565
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,270
I'll take you away from here.

566
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,270
Get some good rest.

567
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,350
I'll stay here
and count the stars for you.

568
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,680
One star.

569
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,990
Two stars.

570
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,270
Three stars.

571
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,720
Four stars.

572
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,470
Five stars.

573
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,350
Six stars.

574
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,440
Seven stars.

575
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,840
Eight stars.

576
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,960
I will always remember

577
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,440
when others threw stones at me,

578
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,350
you stood in front of me.

579
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,040
And I'll never forget

580
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,110
when I couldn't sleep,

581
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,390
you counted stars for me.

582
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,630
Qing,

583
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:31,750
do you still remember?

584
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,080
You said

585
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,270
you would always protect me.

586
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:39,960
I remember.

587
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,110
99 stars.

588
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:49,630
100 stars.

589
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,720
Xiaoli,

590
00:32:58,630 --> 00:32:59,390
you also know

591
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,390
I rescued you and Chang Qing

592
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,920
to have you both

593
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,440
help me open the Portal.

594
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,800
But Chang Qing is a human after all.

595
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,150
He can't to truly understand

596
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,270
the deepest pain in our beasts' hearts.

597
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,510
Moreover,

598
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,320
that Taotie has now bewitched him,

599
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,440
making him forget his original intent.

600
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,040
So

601
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,750
we can only rely on you now.

602
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,510
You must complete your final mission.

603
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,510
Whether the stray beasts can return home

604
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,990
depends entirely on you.

605
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,270
Yes.

606
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,230
Qing,

607
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:58,230
I suddenly want some pastries
from Xunfang Resto.

608
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:59,800
Could you buy some for me?

609
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,230
Sure.

610
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,390
I'll go get them for you now.

611
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,470
Wait for me here.

612
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,470
Qing.

613
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,430
What is it?

614
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,320
Do you want anything else?

615
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:13,600
Well,

616
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,710
buy more

617
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:16,560
of my favorite rose cakes.

618
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,430
Of course.

619
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,750
Wait for me here.

620
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:21,840
I'll be right back.

621
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:22,840
Don't wander off.

622
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,320
Xiaoli.

623
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,160
Miss Zhu.

624
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,440
Why did you ask me to come here?

625
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:56,230
And to such a remote place.

626
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,400
Tomorrow at noon
at the countryside pavilion,

627
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,840
I have something important to tell you.

628
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,120
There will be no return.

629
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,310
I hope you will come.

630
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,200
Xiaoli.

631
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,680
I just want to bid farewell to you.

632
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,400
A farewell at Tianxiang Restaurant
would suffice.

633
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,920
Why does it have to be here?

634
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,270
If you have nothing to say,

635
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,750
I'll be leaving now.

636
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,120
Miss Zhu.

637
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,790
You've thought of what to say?

638
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,990
Actually, I told you to come today

639
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,120
to kill you.

640
00:35:38,990 --> 00:35:39,510
Kill me?

641
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,840
The only one in this world
who wants to kill me is Bai Ze.

642
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,440
He was the one who saved you
back then, wasn't he?

643
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,270
Now that you know,
it doesn't matter anymore.

644
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,160
Taotie,

645
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,400
you wicked beast.

646
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,510
You used the Portal

647
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,030
to block the beasts' way home.

648
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,470
My brother is just too indecisive.

649
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,360
He's forgotten why he came here.

650
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:55,790
Xiaoli,

651
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:57,030
you've been deceived by Bai Ze.

652
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:58,680
He's blinded you.

653
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,750
Your brother has already seen
his true nature.

654
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:01,840
I will never believe you.

655
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,600
Enough talking!

656
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:26,710
Xiaoli!

657
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,230
Xiaoli.

658
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:36,920
Xiaoli.

659
00:36:41,470 --> 00:36:42,270
Zhu Chengbi,

660
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,790
what did you do?

661
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:44,920
Qing.

662
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,230
Qing.

663
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:47,310
It wasn't me, Qing.

664
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:48,200
It was her.

665
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:49,840
It wasn't me, Qing.

666
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:50,790
Xiaoli.

667
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,680
Don't cry.

668
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,950
And don't blame Miss Zhu.

669
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:58,680
Xiaoli.

670
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,510
I think she must have her reasons.

671
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:04,840
Qing,

672
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,710
my eyes are full of stars now.

673
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:12,680
Could you count them for me
one more time?

674
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,400
Don't slack off this time.

675
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:18,400
But I'm afraid

676
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,310
I won't make it to 100 this time.

677
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:27,920
One star.

678
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,230
Two stars.

679
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,400
Three stars.

680
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,990
Four stars.

681
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,200
Five stars.

682
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,840
Six stars.

683
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:43,440
Seven...

684
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,750
100 stars.

685
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,360
No.

686
00:37:59,470 --> 00:37:59,990
No.

687
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,270
No!

688
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,160
No!

689
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,230
Don't leave me!

690
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,710
Don't abandon me!

691
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,030
Don't leave me.

692
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,510
Don't abandon me.

693
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,160
Qing.

694
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,710
Xiaoli,

695
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,640
don't leave me.

696
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,080
Qing.

697
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,790
I was going to send her away.

698
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,510
Why couldn't you let her go

699
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,600
and had to kill her?

700
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,510
Why?

701
00:38:57,310 --> 00:38:57,880
Qing.

702
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,230
Forget it.

703
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,030
A beast is always a beast.

704
00:39:09,950 --> 00:39:11,840
I thought you'd be different.

705
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,710
I was wrong.

706
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:17,880
Nature

707
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,950
is something that can never change.

708
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,230
From now on,

709
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,950
we'll go our separate ways.

710
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:34,990
We're done,

711
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,120
finished.

712
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,230
Benefactor.

713
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,230
Benefactor!

714
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,230
Are you there?

715
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,710
Benefactor.

716
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,400
Benefactor.

717
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:17,230
Benefactor!

718
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,710
Benefactor!

719
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,160
Benefactor!

720
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,470
Do you know that Taotie

721
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,640
killed my sister Xiaoli?

722
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,120
I want to kill her,

723
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,160
but I can't find her whereabouts.

724
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,160
I beg you to help me!

725
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,080
Benefactor!

726
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,510
If only I had listened to you earlier,

727
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,840
how could I have made
today's grave mistake?

728
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,640
I must avenge her.

729
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:43,920
Benefactor!

730
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,440
Benefactor!

731
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,440
Benefactor!

732
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,440
If you are unwilling to help me,

733
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,990
I will kneel here forever.

734
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:39,640
How long do you plan to kneel here?

735
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:43,510
Benefactor.

736
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:45,470
What?

737
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,470
Have you really made up your mind
to kill Taotie?

738
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:49,600
Benefactor,

739
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,680
I truly realize my mistake.

740
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,710
I was deceived by her before.

741
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,200
Now I know your words were true.

742
00:42:57,550 --> 00:42:58,440
You've told me many times

743
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,950
about Taotie's beastly nature.

744
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,080
And now she has turned

745
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,950
against my sister cruelly.

746
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:05,230
I'm completely disappointed in her.

747
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,120
Benefactor,

748
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,600
if she stays in this world,

749
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,550
she will only harm more innocents.

750
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,230
Good that you understand.

751
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,080
Now it's not too late for you

752
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,840
to understand my intentions.

753
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,440
But have you truly made up your mind?

754
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,230
You didn't just save me,

755
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:26,230
but also saved my sister.

756
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,640
I've only come to realize this now.

757
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:30,880
In this world,

758
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,080
