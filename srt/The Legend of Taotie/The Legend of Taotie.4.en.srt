00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,590
Flesh crawls.

195
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,590
Fever and vomiting.

196
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,760
Immediate death.

197
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,230
At that time,

198
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,030
who will take care of our Miss Zhu?

199
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:29,320
Exactly.

200
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,840
Then let Qing

201
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,640
draw you out.

202
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:35,760
Good. Good!

203
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,110
If you ate to death,

204
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,200
I wouldn't save you.

205
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,230
I don't know what the person

206
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,110
who sent these highly toxic things was thinking.

207
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,150
Since there is the history of taste,

208
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,200
there are dead ghosts of taste.

209
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,030
Qing.

210
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,200
Cuiyan, Yingtao.

211
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:04,350
Catch her

212
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,590
and pull out the poisonous mushroom!

213
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:09,350
Don't chase me.

214
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:09,960
Don't run!

215
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:11,960
Don't run!

216
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:13,790
Miss Zhu!

217
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,030
Stop!

218
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,030
Miss Zhu!

219
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,400
Don't run! Miss Zhu!

220
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,280
Don't chase me!

221
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,710
Qing!

222
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,710
Got it!

223
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,790
Quick!

224
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,030
Spit out!

225
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,760
Catch her!

226
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,350
Miss Zhu!

227
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,080
Catch her!

228
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,710
Cuiyan, Yingtao!

229
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,470
Hold her tight!

230
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:36,710
Official Xu.

231
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,710
Official Xu.

232
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,470
Official Xu.

233
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,910
Official Xu, who's famous
from the Inspection Department.

234
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,320
Why are you coming to Tianxiang Restaurant?

235
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,470
Cuiyan, Yingtao.

236
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,470
Bring my best Biluochun.

237
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,640
Serve a cup of tea to Official Xu.

238
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,030
Go.

239
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,400
Yes.

240
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,080
I dare not drink your tea.

241
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,280
Since my first day in Wuxia City,

242
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,670
I have heard that Miss Zhu is a legend.

243
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,150
Because no one knows

244
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,030
when you came,

245
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,400
let alone

246
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,280
how old you are.

247
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,910
The memory of the people in the street

248
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,670
seems to be blurred as soon as here is mentioned.

249
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,640
Everyone said that since their birth,

250
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,960
Tianxiang Restaurant has been standing
in front of Lotus Tower

251
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,440
for many years.

252
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,400
Even from grandfather,

253
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,350
to great-grandfather,

254
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,470
to generations,

255
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,200
no one can't tell clearly.

256
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,110
Just know my name is Zhu Chengbi.

257
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,030
Besides, the Inspection Department and I

258
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,000
have always gone on our own ways.

259
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,280
Why do you have to come here
to find something out?

260
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,640
I'm good for nothing.

261
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,400
Although I know a little about beasts,

262
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,080
I know very few

263
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,320
about the origin of Tianxiang Restaurant.

264
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,640
Only because there is a rumor that

265
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,550
Miss Zhu is the thousand-year-old beast Taotie,

266
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,280
who once worked with the Monk Lotus
to resist the Black Qilin King,

267
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,080
and has been guarding the Wuxia City

268
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,320
since the completion

269
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,760
of the Lotus Tower.

270
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,080
Rumor is rumor.

271
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,710
Why take it seriously?

272
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,590
I come here this time

273
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:17,760
just want to ask if

274
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,470
Miss Zhu knows that

275
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,150
the auspicious beast Bai Ze once drew a

276
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,960
“Bai Ze's Supernatural Creatures”.

277
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:46,960
Official Xu.

278
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,760
How do you become so small?

279
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,110
Cuiyan, Yingtao.

280
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:52,710
Why are you two so small?

281
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:55,790
Qing.

282
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,880
Qing.

283
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,670
Are you from Lilliput?

284
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,440
This…

285
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,080
Why is Tianxiang Restaurant so small?

286
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,000
Mister,

287
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,910
what happened to Miss Zhu?

288
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,520
Miss Zhu!

289
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,590
Tianxiang Restaurant is so beautiful!

290
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:08,590
Oh, no.

291
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,000
It's the poisonous mushroom she ate.

292
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,880
Cuiyan, Yingtao.

293
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,520
Get her.

294
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,400
Spit it out.

295
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,350
Miss Zhu. Spit it out.

296
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,960
Spit it out.

297
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,280
- Spit it out.
- Spit it out.

298
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,150
- Spit it out.
- Miss Zhu!

299
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,000
Spit it out.

300
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,960
How rude it is!

301
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,550
I shouldn't come to Tianxiang Restaurant
to ask you today.

302
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,440
I will never

303
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,790
step into Tianxiang Restaurant again!

304
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,550
Spit it out quickly, Miss Zhu.

305
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:30,640
Spit it out.

306
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,440
Miss Zhu, spit it out.

307
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,150
Come on!

308
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,960
Spit it out.

309
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,200
Spit it out.

310
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,230
A group of freaks.

311
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,910
- Spit it out.
- Spit it out.

312
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:39,880
Spit it out.

313
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:40,710
Spit it out.

314
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,110
Official.

315
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,680
What's happening?

316
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,470
Official,

317
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,070
we didn't wait for the contact.

318
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,230
We searched along the way

319
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,950
and found the body.

320
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,310
The body has no trauma.

321
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,830
We scraped it

322
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,590
off that body.

323
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,070
Have you searched around carefully?

324
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:22,590
Around?

325
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,470
This matter is very serious.

326
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,880
Send the evidence to His Highness immediately.

327
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:28,760
Yes.

328
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,280
Let's go to the scene quickly.

329
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:31,710
Let's go.

330
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:31,950
Yes.

331
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,350
Yingtao.

332
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,110
How are you?

333
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,470
Oh my.

334
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,110
Cuiyan.

335
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,470
You are so small, Cuiyan.

336
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:52,350
Okay. Okay.

337
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,070
What's the matter again?

338
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,310
Tianxiang Restaurant is so small.

339
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,190
I didn't do it.

340
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:00,950
It was Yingtao who didn't believe that

341
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,520
Miss Zhu laughed all day

342
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
because she ate poisonous mushroom.

343
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,760
Then she tasted it herself.

344
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,280
You…

345
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,430
Not enough for you, huh?

346
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,230
What can we do?

347
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,000
What else can we do?

348
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,070
Cover your ears.

349
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,070
We'll have a sleepless night today.

350
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,590
Cuiyan, come here.

351
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,280
What are you doing?

352
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,520
Stop.

353
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,070
What are you doing?

354
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,350
It smells good.

355
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,880
I just want to ask Miss Zhu

356
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,070
what it is on the knife.

357
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,310
This bee venom…

358
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,590
Be careful to hurt yourself.

359
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:50,280
Is really fresh and tasty.

360
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,280
You are addicted to toxic things.

361
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,430
Is the bee venom fresh and tasty?

362
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,310
This is a rare delicacy.

363
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,110
This kind of black bee lives in deep mountains.

364
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,590
Heng.

365
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,000
Where did you get it?

366
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,830
From a murdered spy,

367
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,560
I got it.

368
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,280
People from Bei Di should have done it.

369
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,710
There are black bees in Bei Di?

370
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:07,800
Let's go.

371
00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:09,800
Are you enjoying poisonous mushrooms?

372
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
It's not over yet, is it?

373
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,190
Going to Bei Di,

374
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:12,950
do you have enough clothes?

375
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:14,230
Is there anything delicious on the way?

376
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:15,560
Are you going to walk or take a carriage?

377
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,430
None of this is well thought out.

378
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:17,070
How can you go there?

379
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:17,590
Just half way,

380
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:18,880
you'll be hungry to cry on the way.

381
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,040
In order to eat the best

382
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,760
delicacy,

383
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,310
it's worth it no matter how hard or tired.

384
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,560
Even after you get to Bei Di,

385
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,830
how can you find the black bees?

386
00:20:30,070 --> 00:20:31,830
I can smell.

387
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,800
The spy was killed by the black bee.

388
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,400
I think people in Bei Di have now trained

389
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,000
the black bees to kill.

390
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,800
How can it be easily obtained?

391
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,000
That makes sense.

392
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,000
Now that we know

393
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,040
it's Bei Di people's plot,

394
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,830
one day after I solve this case,

395
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,590
I will give you the black bees.

396
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,190
Heng.

397
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,190
You treat me the best.

398
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:19,880
Miss Zhu.

399
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,190
Where are we going?

400
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,000
Market Dong.

401
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,760
Buy a beast to satisfy my appetite.

402
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,560
Market Dong?

403
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,230
Aren't there all sellers of poultry?

404
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:28,280
How can there be any beast?

405
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,880
That place looks like selling groceries.

406
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,830
But as long as you understand
the secret language,

407
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:33,470
you can buy

408
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,110
many strange things.

409
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,110
It's just that they're expensive.

410
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,000
So cute.

411
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,230
Miss Zhu.

412
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,520
You are just in time.

413
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,400
Please wait for me.

414
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,560
Don't we have to say the secret language

415
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,950
to buy the beasts?

416
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:00,680
Who am I?

417
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,070
Can I be treated the same as others?

418
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,000
But we don't have enough money.

419
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,350
Miss Zhu.

420
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,000
Just leave some soup for me.

421
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,350
That's easy.

422
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:12,680
Please take it.

423
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,350
Let's go.

424
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,280
Miss Zhu, you lied to me again.

425
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:17,830
It seems that we have no money

426
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:19,000
because you are too lazy.

427
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,680
What do you buy a beast for?

428
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,560
For cooking.

429
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,640
Cooking?

430
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,160
No way.

431
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,800
No.

432
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:32,640
Why not?

433
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:34,760
It's none of your business.

434
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,400
You can't cook the beasts.

435
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:38,110
You can't kill animals at will.

436
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,430
If you like it,

437
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:40,310
take more money

438
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,280
to buy it back.

439
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:43,400
I…

440
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,430
None of your business.

441
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,350
None of my business?

442
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,160
Now

443
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,000
I have bought it.

444
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,160
So it belongs to me.

445
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,160
Do you understand?

446
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,070
Yes.

447
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:53,520
Move out of my way.

448
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:54,800
Go aside.

449
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,640
Go aside!

450
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,280
Miss Zhu, let's go.

451
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:06,230
Another nerd

452
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,880
who has an inexplicable liking for beasts.

453
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,880
Fish!

454
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,040
Fresh mandarin fish.

455
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,430
Ladies, have some fish.

456
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:14,760
Hey.

457
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,710
Your mandarin fish is from Songhua River.

458
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,800
You are really discerning.

459
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,430
You're right.

460
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,350
This is the authentic mandarin fish
from Songhua River.

461
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,000
I just smuggled them out of Bei Di.

462
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:23,190
They're all fresh.

463
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,950
How much is it?

464
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:25,710
Four taels of silver for one.

465
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,760
Four taels of silver?

466
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,230
It's too expensive.

467
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,680
One tael.

468
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,340
One tael.

469
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,880
Lady, you are too good at bargaining.

470
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:36,110
Look, the fin is white and transparent.

471
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,430
The fins of real mandarin fish from Songhua River

472
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:38,680
are golden.

473
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,710
Haven't you seen them?

474
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,880
My offer is quite good.

475
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,310
You…

476
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,680
Do you sell it or not?

477
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,430
Okay. Okay.

478
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,160
Deal. Deal.

479
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:49,470
Come.

480
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,040
Take it.

481
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,560
Come again next time.

482
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,470
Thank you.

483
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:54,830
Fish. Fresh mandarin fish.

484
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,040
Fish.

485
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,590
Buddie, take a look at the fish.

486
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,710
It doesn't move, Miss Zhu.

487
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:01,880
Doesn't move?

488
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:02,680
Open it.

489
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,040
Why is this a mooli?

490
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,950
That jerk.

491
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:16,710
Stop!

492
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,880
Jerk, stop!

493
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,070
Miss Zhu, wait for me!

494
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:29,520
Excuse me.

495
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,520
Stop!

496
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,310
Move out of my way!

499
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,000
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

500
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,590
Stop, you jerk!

00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,800
Miss Zhu, wait for me!

502
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,880
Miss Zhu, who is he?

503
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:42,920
Go for him.

504

[Xu Residence]

505
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:05,950
Your…

506
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,110
Your Highness.

507
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,640
I don‘t know if Your Highness is coming.

508
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:22,470
I went out to handle cases

509
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,830
and let Your Highness wait here for a long time.

510
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,040
Please forgive me.

511
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,470
Forget it.

512
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,040
The murder of the spy is really strange.

513
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,350
This matter is of great significance.

514
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,710
I am going to discuss it with you.

515
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:37,760
What else did you find

516
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,950
at the scene?

517
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,760
Your Highness,

518
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,640
I have found the information left by the spy.

519
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,640
I was about to hand it in.

520
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,710
Your Highness.

521
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:51,230
All the spies who went to Bei Di to spy

522
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,230
have been killed.

523
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,640
Fortunately, the information is still available.

524
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,400
Destroyer of Bei Di in ten years

525
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,160
has three stars in the palm.

526
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,280
Three stars in the palm?

527
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:07,920
Yes?

528
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,830
Official Xu knows such person?

529
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,070
I…

530
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,000
I know nothing.

531
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:17,830
It seems that Bei Di is ready

532
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,040
for war.

533
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,190
If it happened to be predicted,

534
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,350
the person who can destroy Bei Di was killed,

535
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,830
their army

536
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,400
would be more reckless.

537
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:29,920
Look at this.

538
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,000
Although Prince Nan and I

539
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,590
were both hostages in Xia at that time,

540
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,280
the relationship between Da Liang and Bei Di

541
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,230
is very tense.

542
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,230
[Prince Nan of Bei Di will visit the Prince of Langya in Wuxia recently.]
Why would he come

543
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,560
to visit Wuxia at this time?

544
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,000
Please forgive my rudeness.

545
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,280
Your Highness suspects

546
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,310
that the murder of the spy is related to
the Prince Nan?

547
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,640
That's why I'm looking for you.

548
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:56,190
I have confirmed to Miss Zhu of Tianxiang Restaurant

549
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,350
that the mucus on this dagger

550
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,430
is the poison of black bees.

551
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,350
Black bees?

552
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,920
I think Bei Di has tamed the black bees.

553
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,230
Now it is imperative

554
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,560
to find the person with three stars in the palm.

555
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:10,470
Also,

556
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,430
this time Prince Nan comes here.

557
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:13,880
If there was an accident,

558
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,300
it would be an excuse for them to make war.

559
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,920
We have to be cautious.

560
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:23,560

00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:26,160

went in through this door.

not climbing over the wall?

575
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,040
Yes.

576
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,470
Then you must hold it steadily.

577
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,000
Don't let me fly away.

578
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,920
Don't worry. I hold it tight.

579
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,160
Xu Ruoxu!

580
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:21,920
Father.

581
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,470
What's up?

582
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,110
Stand up!

583
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,040
I knew you were naughty.

584
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,230
Tell me.

585
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Did you go to the market again today?

586
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,430
I didn't.

587
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,430
You're lying!

588
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,350
How many times have I told you?

589
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:40,040
Don't make trouble for me outside!

590
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,190
Don't make trouble!

591
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,520
But you just don't listen to me!

592
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,470
Sure.

593
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,280
Today I

594
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,520
must teach you a lesson!

595
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:49,560
Give me your hand.

596
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,400
Father!

597
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,760
Miss Zhu!

598
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,400
Put me down!

599
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,280
Come on! Come on!

600
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,040
Miss Zhu.

601
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,160
Oh, no.

602
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:21,070
Official Xu is so cruel!

603
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:21,680
He…

604
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,400
What?

605
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,000
He burned Xu Ruoxu's palm

606
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,280
with a burning candle.

607
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,160
It's too bad for me to watch.

608
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,190
I can hear screams without watching.

609
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,400
I think it is the jerk

610
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,760
secretly playing with beast behind his father's back.

611
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,520
He deserves to be punished.

612
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:42,560
His father is a beast hunter.

613
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,040
His son is a beast protector.

614
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,470
That's interesting.

615
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,590
Then I will…

616
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:53,520
How will you do?

617
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,590
Miss Zhu, wait for me!

618
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,110
Prince Nan and I are old friends.

619
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,470
After years of separation,

620
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,000
we are far apart,

621
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,110
and it's rare for us to meet.

622
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,000
It's very touching to meet you again today.

623
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,400
Prince Nan of Bei Di, welcome

624
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,560
to Wuxia.

625
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,830
Thank you for your courtesy.

626
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:38,760
Come on.

627
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:39,760
Father.

628
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,400
Why should I go with you?

629
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,230
Before,

630
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,280
have you seen Miss Zhu of Tianxiang Restaurant?

631
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,160
No.

632
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:48,800
Never.

633
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:49,950
Strange.

634
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,070
Why did she suddenly

635
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,880
invite you to the banquet today?

636
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,590
Invite me?

637
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,800
She must have known that I was injured

638
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,160
and want to make a fool of me in public.

639
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,160
Come on.

640
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
Greetings, Your Highness.

641
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,160
Your Highness.

642
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,040
Only because my son has just burned his hand,

643
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,640
we are late.

644
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,070
Please forgive us.

645
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,680
Is your son's injury

646
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:25,950
okay?

647
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:29,680
Please have a seat.

648
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

649
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,640
In order to entertain my brother,

650
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,950
I specially invited the first chef of Da Liang,

651
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,040
Miss Zhu,

652
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,710
to arrange the banquet.

653
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,590
Hard work for you today, Miss Zhu.

654
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,710
Your Highness, you are welcome.

655
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,070
So this is

656
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,430
the legendary Miss Zhu.

657
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:55,680
I'm pleased to meet you.

658
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,470
I didn't expect such exquisite dishes

659
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,000
made by such a beautiful woman.

660
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,280
Why don't you join us?

661
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,430
Thank you.

662
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,760
Today's main dish

663
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
is a beast

664
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,560
that I specially selected in Market Dong.

665
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,160
This beast's

666
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,760
meat is fresh and pleasantly chewy.

667
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,880
Please enjoy it.

668
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,280
So everyone,

669
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:19,920
please get started.

670
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,160
The mandarin fish made by Miss Zhu…

671
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:32,230
Why did you kill the three-eyed lynx

672
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,400
so cruelly?

673
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,230
The mandarin fish

674
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,350
is really delicious.

675
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,430
Sit down.

676
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:47,110
What nonsense?

677
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,680
How many times have I told you?

678
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,680
Don't stay with the beasts!

679
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,560
I'm going out to get some air.

680
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,000
It's really Miss Zhu's skill.

681
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,800
The meat melts in the mouth

682
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,280
but it's still pleasantly chewy.

683
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,430
The two tastes are

684
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,710
well integrated.

685
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,400
It's really rare.

686
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,680
Absolutely.

687
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:18,000
Miss Zhu can be said to be the best chef
in the world.

688
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,310
Besides, making food with beasts

689
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,310
can also prevent evil beasts
from harming the world.

690
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,880
If the beasts can be tamed

691
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,350
and used by people,

692
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,830
they will be formed into a strong army.

693
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,280
Oh, really?

694
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,680
Please be more specific.

695
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:41,680
Have you ever heard of the black bees?

696
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,350
Where are the black bees?

697
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,000
The black bees are delicious!

698
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,230
Please enjoy it.

699
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:54,760
Please enjoy it, everyone.

700
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:56,560
You go ahead.

701
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,110
My dear brother,

702
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,710
did you mean training the black bees into an army?

703
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,040
Interesting.

704
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,710
That's interesting.

705
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,040
I would like to know the details.

706
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,040
Maybe I drank too much.

707
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,360
It's just a slip of tongue.

708
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:19,840
About the matter of the black bees,

709
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,080
I just heard of it.

710
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,760
After all, it matters.

711
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,560
I am not very clear.

712
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,520
When I go back to ask my brother carefully,

713
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,120
I will share it with Your Highness.

714
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:36,840
Anyway,

715
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:38,280
it seems that

716
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,800
you and I

717
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,800
are too old to talk about anything.

718
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,120
Oh, no.

719
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,150
Oh, no!

720
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,080
Oh, no!

721
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,710
Cuiyan.

722
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,760
How can you be so flustered

723
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,870
in front of guests?

724
00:34:56,870 --> 00:34:57,470
What's up?

725
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,360
Miss Zhu.

726
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,760
It's not mandarin fish

727
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,000
that was served to the guests just now,

728
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,190
but puffer fish!

729
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,360
I made a mistake!

730
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,150
Puffer fish?

731
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,360
How dare you!

732
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,040
How dare you let His Highness
and Prince Nan of Bei Di

733
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,140
eat such a poisonous thing?

734
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:08,800
Don't move.

735
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,670
No wonder it tastes so delicious.

736
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,870
So it's puffer fish.

737
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,320
Your Highness.

738
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,950
Although the puffer fish is delicious,

739
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,280
it is highly toxic.

740
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,630
If the food is not properly prepared,

741
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,630
it will cause vomiting

742
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,520
and general paralysis,

743
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,360
and five or six out of ten victims
will be poisoned to death.

744
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,520
Miss Zhu!

745
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,520
I once warned you

746
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,150
not to eat these poisons.

747
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,840
But why don't you listen?

748
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,360
Official Xu.

749
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,800
You said before

750
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,710
that you would never step into
our Tianxiang Restaurant again.

751
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,670
How many steps have been taken today?

752
00:35:48,670 --> 00:35:49,150
You!

753
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,040
What's wrong?

754
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,280
Don't panic.

755
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,670
The poison of puffer fish

756
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:55,670
can be cured

757
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,430
by using bee venom.

758
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,190
Prince Nan of Bei Di.

759
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,470
Have you brought any bee venom?

760
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,040
Prince Nan.

761
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,120
It's important to save lives.

762
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,040
Didn't you bring any?

763
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,760
Did you do it intentionally?

764
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,120
Not at all.

765
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,600
No?

766
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,120
In order to get the bee venom,

767
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,040
you don't hesitate to let Prince Nan of Bei Di
eat puffer fish.

768
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,360
It's ridiculous!

769
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,190
I thought we had a deal.

770
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,600
Have we discussed the puffer fish?

771
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,840
Don't panic.

772
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:35,950
You just ate mandarin fish.

773
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,230
It's not the poison of puffer fish.

774
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,280
Please rest assured.

775
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,600
This is puffer fish.

776
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:44,840
What you eat

777
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,560
was really mandarin fish from Songhua River.

778
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,120
But why do I have stomach-ache?

779
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,840
You don't drink, do you?

780
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,230
This is the bamboo leaf-green liqueur I brewed.

781
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,840
It may be like poisoning after drinking.

782
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,360
That's ridiculous!

783
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,560
Idiot.

784
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:02,840
Let's go back.

785
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:06,670
I won't see you off!

786
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,000
Brother.

787
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm really sorry.

788
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,470
This is really not my intention.

789
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:11,950
Go back and have a good rest.

790
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,360
Come on.

791
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,950
Idiot!

792
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,040
Miss Zhu.

793
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,190
Miss Zhu.

794
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,120
Official Xu?

795
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,230
Miss Zhu.

796
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,390
I have something important to ask you.

797
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,630
How can I know so much?

798
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:44,710
I'm just a cook.

799
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:47,870
I just want to ask that

800
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,150
if the black bee is trained as a killer,

801
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,280
and the person who's assassinated

802
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:54,560
has some mark,

803
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,430
is there any way

804
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,390
to escape the assassination of the black bee?

805
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,390
It depends on what the mark looks like.

806
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,120
Is the mark big or small?

807
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:04,870
Is it pretty?

808
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,760
Miss Zhu.

809
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,360
Don't be joking.

810
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,760
How can I answer you

811
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,950
if you don't make yourself clear?

812
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,040
Let's put it this way.

813
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,520
The person to be assassinated by the black bee

814
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:17,950
has

815
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,600
three moles in his palm.

816
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,710
Looking for such a small mark

817
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,670
is like looking for a needle in a haystack.

818
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,230
Can it be found?

819
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,950
In less than three days.

820
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,360
Really?

821
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,470
Yes, of course.

822
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,750
The black bees have

823
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,670
thousands of small eyes.

824
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,280
In other words,

825
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,910
it can see thousands of people at the same time.

826
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:38,150
If there is a man with three moles in his palm

827
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,430
in Wuxia,

828
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,280
then the black bee

829
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,190
will find him in three days

830
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,360
and kill him.

831
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:51,950
I see.

832
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,190
Goodbye then.

833
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,630
Thank you very much.

834
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,080
[Xu Residence]

835
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,430
Father, don't kill it.

836
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,230
I beg you not to kill it.

837
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:27,910
I know I was wrong.

838
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,280
I shouldn't keep it secretly.

839
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,470
Beasts eat people.

840
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:33,710
I do this

841
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,910
for your good.

842
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,280
But the beasts

843
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,000
are made into dishes for humans now.

844
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,120
What is the difference

845
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,120
between human and beast?

846
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,000
Nonsense.

847
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,280
There are different ways for people and beasts.

848
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
How can we be taken as the same?

849
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,430
People value personal feelings.

850
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,360
And the beasts

851
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,360
will hurt you after all.

852
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,430
Beasts also have feelings.

853
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,230
I can feel it!

854
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,080
If the beast had feelings,

855
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,150
that would be more dangerous!

856
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:56,910
Five hundred years ago,

857
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,080
it is because the king of beasts, Taotie,

858
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,320
lingered in the world,

859
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,760
the Portal opened

860
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,630
and the beasts rushed in,

861
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,150
which almost led to calamity.

862
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,870
It's not the beast that is hurting me.

863
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,040
It's you who's hurting me!

864
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,470
The beast is so innocent.

865
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,000
Human desire

866
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,470
is a hundred times crueler than the beast!

867
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,120
You!

868
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,800
Stop!

869
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,360
If you go out today,

870
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,430
don't come back again!

871
00:40:25,710 --> 00:40:26,360
You want to kill it!

872
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,320
Of course I won't come back!

873
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:41,710
Chunjiu, Xiefen.

874
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:42,870
Let them take all these things

875
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,040
back to Langya Prefecture.

876
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,520
Yes, Miss Zhu.

877
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,360
Got it.

878
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,950
You went too far.

879
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,430
I just want the delicacy,

880
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,670
so I played a joke on them.

881
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,120
They're so stingy.

882
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:08,080
I'm not talking about that.

883
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,760
You deliberately invited Xu Ruoxu

884
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,800
to expose the fact that
he has been keeping beasts.

885
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:13,470
When going back,

886
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,600
he must be scolded by his father again.

887
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,470
He stole my three-eyed lynx.

888
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,710
Of course I would teach him a lesson.

889
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:22,600
So,

890
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:24,910
how's that jerk?

891
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,800
Later, he was much calmer.

892
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,120
But when it came to the three-eyed lynx,

893
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,470
he's still in the wrong mood.

894
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,320
I guess he's still angry with you.

895
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:36,670
Look at you.

896
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,560
This joke is not funny.

897
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,120
I was just angry that

898
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,390
he stole my ingredients.

899
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:42,230
Besides, I haven't

900
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,950
done anything to that three-eyed lynx.

901
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:45,120
Didn't you find it?

902
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,840
Actually, he was afraid of

903
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:48,040
exposing himself in front of his father.

904
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,230
I guess

905
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,040
there's something on his mind.

906
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,800
By the way, Qing.

907
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:56,870
Just now,

908
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,390
Official Xu also came back specially

909
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,950
to ask me about the black bees.

910
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,000
I think something big

911
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,710
is going to happen in Wuxia.

912
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:07,420
[Market Dong]

913
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:11,710
Take a look at the fish. Fresh mandarin fish.

914
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,040
Fish owner.

915
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,390
Have you ever seen such a child

916
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,230
with this height,

917
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,470
wearing a blue cloth hat?

918
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,000
Blue cloth hat?

919
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:21,470
No.

920
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,520
Have a fish.

921
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,190
This fish is especially fresh.

922
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:24,910
No need.

923
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:25,870
Stuffed buns.

924
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:27,560
Fish!

925
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:28,390
Hello, Official Xu.

926
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,590
Xu Ruoxu is my son.

927
00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:33,910
Have you ever seen him?

928
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,710
No.

929
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,120
Really?

930
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,950
I haven't seen him for days.

931
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:43,040
Stuffed buns. Stuffed buns.

932
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:44,910
Hot stuffed buns.
