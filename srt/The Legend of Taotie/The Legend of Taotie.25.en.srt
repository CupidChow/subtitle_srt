00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,320
when you traveled around,

195
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,360
you could meet such a wonderful friend.

196
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,120
Taotie has come to this world,

197
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:09,270
but she doesn't have emotions.

198
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,270
What a pity.

199
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,750
All creatures are born

200
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,830
with emotions.

201
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,120
Without emotions, nothing survives.

202
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,040
With emotions,

203
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,390
all creatures live.

204
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,920
I guess we're destined to have emotions.

205
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,590
It's been so many years.

206
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,950
You haven't changed your mind

207
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,880
to lecture people.

208
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:36,710
Monk,

209
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,070
what are the emotions

210
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:39,680
you often talk about?

211
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,270
Are they eatable?

212
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,830
General,

213
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,000
you're used to a carefree life.

214
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,750
Emotions aren't food.

215
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,880
But actually, they are

216
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,150
nearly the same as food.

217
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,120
Joy, anger, sorrow,
fear, love, hatred, and disgust.

218
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,150
These seven emotions

219
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,950
are like sour, sweet, bitter,
spicy, and salty flavors.

220
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,320
You have to taste them personally

221
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,800
and experienced them.

222
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,240
This is also the biggest difference

223
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,440
between beasts and humans.

224
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,800
Tasting all the food

225
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,880
is like experiencing all the emotions.

226
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,510
Someone won't be truly alive

227
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,710
unless he goes through everything.

228
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,040
That's right.

229
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,440
We stand, sit, and go around.

230
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,360
Little moves like this

231
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,830
contain emotions.

232
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,320
Miss Fifth.

233
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,590
You need to experience them.

234
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:35,830
This one tastes good.

235
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,240
When I eat it, I feel happy.

236
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,190
So, do I like it?

237
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,240
Over the centuries,

238
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,510
you've been suffering too much.

239
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,000
How about I kill you fast

240
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,040
and end all this?

241
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:51,680
General,

242
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,360
why can't you

243
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,320
let go of His Lordship?

244
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,120
Taotie!

245
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:56,560
Don't go too far!

246
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,920
End all this?

247
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,240
General,

248
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,920
have you finally seen

249
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,320
who you've been waiting for?

250
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,560
None of your business.

251
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,710
I'm here

252
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,120
to take back what belongs to him.

253
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,190
It's lucky for you

254
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,510
to die fast.

255
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,560
General, will you...?

256
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,240
Come in.

257
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:53,590
Miss Zhu,

258
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,440
why are you sharpening it?

259
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,830
The corals here are gorgeous.

260
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,360
They sent messages from far away, too.

261
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,000
When two close guys have the corals,

262
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,320
even if they stay far away,

263
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,750
they'll be able to communicate.

264
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,080
Tomorrow,

265
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,510
I'll go get some corals.

266
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,110
Who will you get them for?

267
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:11,920
Guess.

268
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,110
Miss Zhu,

269
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,350
why do you have to eat Lord Wuchang?

270
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,560
I will not only eat him

271
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,680
but also

272
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,510
get back something.

273
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:28,320
What is it?

274
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,350
I won't tell you.

275
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,230
How did he annoy you?

276
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,040
Why do you have to eat him?

277
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,470
Qing,

278
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,840
before you know the whole story,

279
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,960
don't jump to a conclusion.

280
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,920
Is it right to kill

281
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,680
someone innocent?

282
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,440
I just will. So what?

283
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,200
Why do you push me like this?

284
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,350
If she takes back the prayer beads,

285
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
His Lordship won't be reborn.

286
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,390
So, this time,

287
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,230
we must protect His Lordship.

288
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,750
If we have to fight,

289
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,680
the two of us can't stop Taotie.

290
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,110
Besides, His Lordship

291
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:16,870
doesn't allow us

292
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:18,390
to hurt Taotie.

293
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,800
The Prince of Langya is working with me.

294
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,510
We have to stop Taotie.

295
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,200
As for His Lordship,

296
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,440
I've had a plan.

297
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,200
Isn't the Prince of Langya

298
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,350
on Taotie's side?

299
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,110
Please come in, Your Highness.

300
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,920
His Highness

301
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,440
came here to capture Taotie

302
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,200
at the command of His Majesty.

303
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,600
Now, can you tell me

304
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,440
about your great plan?

305
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,960
You tell them.

306
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,800
My Lord, why are you up so early?

307
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,390
The feast will be held today.

308
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,320
I somehow feel restless.

309
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,350
It's so early.

310
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,270
Where have you been?

311
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,350
I was brewing the decoction for you.

312
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,960
I know

313
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,200
I can't do anything for you.

314
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,110
I just want you

315
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,560
to take better of yourself.

316
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,080
Dear,

317
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,630
you had hard days

318
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,040
over all these years.

319
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,440
Don't say that, My Lord.

320
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,680
It is my duty

321
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,270
to take care of you.

322
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,990
I'm not an ordinary man.

323
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,840
Every hundred years,

324
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,750
I can only talk normally like this

325
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:27,800
for one or two years.

326
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,510
But after today...

327
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:31,870
My Lord,

328
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,680
why does General have to be so cruel?

329
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:35,870
Dear,

330
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,840
don't blame her.

331
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,270
I made a mistake.

332
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,840
Sorry to get you involved.

333
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,720
My Lord, say no more.

334
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:47,920
It's cold.

335
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:50,230
I'll go get you a robe.

336
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,440
Fengyi,

337
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,560
I know.

338
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:43,320
You've always wanted a baby.

339
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,720
Because of me,

340
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,040
we can't have a baby.

341
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,270
No.

342
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,270
My Lord,

343
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,680
don't blame yourself.

344
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,390
It's not your fault.

345
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,040
And the bellyband...

346
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,150
It's actually yours.

347
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:06,870
Mine?

348
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,270
Every hundred years,

349
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,990
you can be reborn
with the help of the prayer beads.

350
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,350
But you have to go

351
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,270
through the slow growth.

352
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:22,320
I've accompanied you all the time.

353
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:23,920
You grew from a baby

354
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,800
who learned to walk

355
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,040
into the great young man

356
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,750
who made me feel secure.

357
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:33,470
I'm satisfied enough.

358
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,350
I've been taking you

359
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,630
as my own baby.

360
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,680
I don't need other babies.

361
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,600
Does it taste good?

362
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:42,720
Yes.

363
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,110
Pretty lady,

364
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,960
when I grow up,

365
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,630
can I marry you?

366
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,080
I've been your wife
since a long time ago.

367
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:55,800
Come on.

368
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:21,870
My Lord,

369
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,350
it's still early.

370
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,510
Go back to sleep.

371
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,230
All right.

372
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,800
My Lord,

373
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,800
I made the decoction for you.

374
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,800
Give it to me.

375
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,080
The decoction...

376
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:27,630
Fengyi,

377
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,110
don't do anything rash.

378
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,560
Bachong Ying,

379
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,560
how dare you attack me?

380
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,150
Your Grace,

381
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,600
do you have to do this?

382
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:52,600
Let go of the crushing pain,

383
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,230
once you lose the crab roe,

384
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,920
you can't have babies.

385
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,600
Let me do it.

386
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,350
I'll do it.

387
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,320
I'm a male crab.

388
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,390
It's easier for me.

389
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:07,720
No.

390
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,630
I've made up my mind.

391
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,600
Only I can do this

392
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,270
on behalf of His Lordship.

393
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,150
Without him,

394
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:20,560
what do I need the roe for?

395
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:31,150
I'd like to thank you
on behalf of His Highness.

396
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,870
- Your Grace.
- Don't.

397
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:37,470
Your Grace,

398
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,750
His Lordship has been
an incredible mentor to us.

399
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,470
We're willing

400
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:42,840
to help His Lordship.

401
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,320
Yes.

402
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,390
I sent Bachong to hold back General.

403
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,800
But time is running out.

404
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,470
We must be very quick.

405
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,720
Your Grace.

406
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,510
Miss Zhu.

407
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:35,840
Miss Zhu,

408
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,960
I'll go get her back.

409
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,470
Qing.

410
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,630
Miss Zhu,

411
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,680
she ran away so fast.

412
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,510
Thanks to you.

413
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,230
You helped her.

414
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:06,840
Miss Zhu, I...

415
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,320
Qing,

416
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,870
go find the corals for me.

417
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,470
The feast is about to begin.

418
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,680
Where are the corals

419
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,800
Miss Zhu wants?

420
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:34,720
I have a present for you.

421
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,470
Such an interesting monk.

422
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,840
Let's work together
to fight the Black Qilin King.

423
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,990
Who's there?

424
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,720
How dare you intrude?

425
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,470
Aren't you the young man

426
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:44,150
who came with General Taotie?

427
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:45,720
Right here

428
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,800
and now,

429
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,840
what are you doing?

430
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,200
I'm just walking by.

431
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,990
I'm not here to steal the prayer beads.

432
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:53,630
What did he say?

433
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,440
Prayer beads.

434
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:55,750
Prayer beads.

435
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,510
Steal prayer beads?

436
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:00,150
Funny.

437
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:00,750
You?

438
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,920
You think you can steal them?

439
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,200
They were left by Monk Lotus.

440
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:05,870
Right.

441
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:06,840
They were sealed

442
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,960
by His Lordship.

443
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:08,750
Right.

444
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,040
Lotus?

445
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,840
As long as you get one step closer...

446
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,230
One step.

447
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,560
You'll trigger the thunder.

448
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,390
Thunder.

449
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,840
Then, you'll die.

450
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,800
You'll die.

451
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,150
Even General Taotie
can't take them away.

452
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:19,920
She can't.

453
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,720
Stop daydreaming.

454
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:22,960
Stop it.

455
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,800
Give up.

456
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:24,720
Let's go.

457
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,270
Come on.

458
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,390
The prayer beads left by Lotus...

459
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,440
Does Miss Zhu want to get them back?

460
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,600
A lot of dishes, indeed.

461
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,310
Show yourself.

462
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,720
Ask Lord Wuchang to come out.

463
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,390
General,

464
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,550
His Lordship was tortured
by the terrible pain

465
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,550
for centuries.

466
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,080
General,

467
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,510
I beg you.

468
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:42,840
Let go of His Lordship.

469
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,880
Let me suffer this

470
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,640
on his behalf.

471
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,310
General, why can't you let me do it?

472
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:01,550
Whoever suffers for him

473
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,190
means nothing to me.

474
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,600
Lord Wuchang,

475
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,310
when I find you,

476
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,550
I'll give you terrible pain.

477
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,600
Ask Lord Wuchang to see me.

478
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,550
You can't see His Lordship

479
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,360
unless you step over me!

480
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:19,990
If you're such a fighter,

481
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,120
why didn't you fight

482
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,030
against the Black Qilin King?

483
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:23,790
Tell me.

484
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,510
General, do you like the weeds

485
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,550
you had yesterday?

486
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,030
In my censer,

487
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,920
the weed fume is lit.

488
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:48,790
The weed is nontoxic.

489
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,680
But if someone eats some weeds,

490
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,030
the weed fume

491
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:54,840
will benumb him.

492
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,680
General, I guess

493
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,030
you feel weak all over now.

494
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,600
General,

495
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,550
we didn't mean to hurt you.

496
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,550
But all these years,

497
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,640
His Lordship

498
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,790
has been humiliated and tortured.

499
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,310
If you promise

500
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:31,920
to stop screwing

501
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,790
with His Lordship,

502
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,440
we will send you

503
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,790
and your friends away safely.

504
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,310
Will you show mercy, General?

505
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,880
So, you're behind all this.

506
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:51,840
Bring it on.

507
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,360
Fight me if you dare!

508
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,160
Oh no.

509
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:19,440
Miss Zhu.

510
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,200
Miss Zhu

511
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,510
Miss Zhu.

512
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,230
Qing.

513
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:25,840
Are you all right?

514
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:27,270
Qing,

515
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,080
go break the censer.

516
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,470
How dare losers like you

517
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,640
try to kill me?

518
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:03,880
Miss Zhu.

519
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,470
Qing, why do you stop me?

520
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,640
You haven't totally recovered.

521
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,160
If you chase them, you'll be in danger.

522
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:08,710
But...

523
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,440
Let's go somewhere to heal.

524
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:10,840
Come on.

525
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,440
- Go with me.
- Qing.

526
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,030
Come on.

527
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,470
Qing.

528
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,440
I've heard

529
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,600
your maternal clansmen
are good at illusion.

530
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,310
I didn't know you could

531
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,440
do this so perfectly.

532
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:38,790
In this battle,

533
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,920
we will capture Taotie.

534
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:58,920
Miss Zhu,

535
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:00,270
I don't think they've found us.

536
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,510
Let's hide here.

537
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,080
Miss Zhu,

538
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,600
where are you going?

539
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,990
I'm going to cook them.

540
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,470
Do you want them
to be steamed or braised?

541
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,510
Hey, Miss Zhu.

542
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,200
Miss Zhu.

543
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,230
Miss Zhu.

544
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:28,790
Miss Zhu.

545
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:34,950
Miss Zhu.

546
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:35,440
Qing.

547
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,270
Miss Zhu.

548
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,200
Miss Zhu.

549
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,200
Qing,

550
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,840
can you hear me?

551
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,550
Miss Zhu, what did you say?

552
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,270
I can't hear you.

553
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,640
With this shield,

554
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,030
he can't hear me.
