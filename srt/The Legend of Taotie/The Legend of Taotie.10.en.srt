00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,710
Your Highness.

192
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,790
No need for formalities.

193
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,030
Mr. Lu, you're reading the case file.

194
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,760
Your Highness,

195
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:39,440
today I went to the Zhou family's residence

196
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,470
to investigate as per your instruction,

197
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,670
and as expected,

198
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,350
something is wrong there.

199
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,230
Say it.

200
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,110
Mr. Zhou

201
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,640
has had quite a few wives.

202
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,710
Before this one,

203
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,880
he had had three.

204
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,790
His first wife Wang Sufen

205
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:58,280
disappeared without a trace
and the case is now a mystery.

206
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,590
His second and third wives

207
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,200
and Gao Ruifang

208
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,910
all died mysteriously.

209
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,840
What's happening in Sijing Garden
is indeed strange.

210
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,840
Guess there are a lot of secrets.

211
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,150
However, it's not a coincidence
if it happens often.

212
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,670
Anything else?

213
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,000
I've sorted out the relevant case files.

214
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,960
Please take a look at them.

215
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,000
There is a case that happened over 20 years ago.

216
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,840
Zhou Shuyou, the former family head,

217
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,230
took his family to visit his wife's family.

218
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,960
When they traveled past Wuxia,
it seemed that they were attacked by beasts.

219
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,440
Zhou Shuyou died

220
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,150
and his wife and son survived.

221
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,030
They're the older Mrs. Zhou and Mr. Zhou today.

222
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,440
It says

223
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,080
that there was a female corpse in gorgeous clothes
but with a disfigured face.

224
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,400
Have you seen it?

225
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,440
I'm very confused too.

226
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,520
Because at that time, all the other bodies

227
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,670
were claimed by their families.

228
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,200
Yet somehow, no one came to claim this body.

229
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,230
It seemed that it was unwanted.

230
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,230
Also, the body of this woman

231
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,520
was the only one with a disfigured face.

232
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,150
What happens in the Zhou Residence

233
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,960
has always been puzzling.

234
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,590
Indeed, Your Highness.

235
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,550
It's puzzling indeed.

236
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,960
I've arranged archers

237
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,230
to wait near the Zhou Residence.

238
00:16:17,590 --> 00:16:18,760
If something happens,

239
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,710
they will tell us immediately.

240
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,220
[Sijing Garden]

241
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:33,960
Father,

242
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,640
why do I have to live like this?

243
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,790
I've been trapped in this garden

244
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,440
for 20 years.

245
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,030
Every person who was with me

246
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,280
ended up dying.

247
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,710
I can't escape, and I can't die either.

248
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,470
Father,

249
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,040
why does mother have to control me like this?

250
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:56,110
This wedding will be held
according to the standard of Ruifang's.

251
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,160
Liyu has no family

252
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,470
who can prepare a dowry for her.

253
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:02,640
Although she's a maid,

254
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,310
she's marrying into the Zhou family,

255
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,680
so she has to look respectable.

256
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,830
This is urgent,

257
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:09,350
so pay more attention to it.

258
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:10,880
Madam,

259
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm afraid it's inappropriate

260
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,280
to hold a wedding right after a funeral.

261
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,800
I don't care.

262
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,590
I just want my son

263
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:23,040
to be happy and healthy.

264
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,710
Do it now,

265
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,520
the sooner, the better.

266
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,280
Yes, madam.

267
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,070
Madam,

268
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,430
Miss Zhu of Tianxiang Restaurant asks to meet you.

269
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:37,920
Let her in now.

270
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:38,430
Yes.

271
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:41,800
This way please.

272
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,680
Welcome.

273
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,310
Miss Zhu, have you changed your mind?

274
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,190
Qing,

275
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,110
you idolize Mr. Zhou and want to meet him,

276
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,310
don't you?

277
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,520
Mrs. Zhou,

278
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,680
I heard that Mr. Zhou is grieving
over the death of his wife recently.

279
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,110
Can I visit him?

280
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,190
Sure.

281
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:12,710
Guangping is in the courtyard inside.

282
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,590
Ding,

283
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,230
take Mr. Chang there.

284
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,680
Sir.

285
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,190
Thank you so much.

286
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,680
This way.

287
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Leave us alone.

288
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,800
Yes.

289
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,710
Have you forgotten

290
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,000
what I've told you?

291
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:02,040
How dare you

292
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,880
run wild on my turf?

293
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,110
I'm sorry.

294
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,760
Someone hurt me.

295
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,800
Miss Zhu,

296
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,310
can you let me raise him?

297
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,880
I promise,

298
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,920
when I find a shelter for him

299
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:16,710
in this world,

300
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,880
I'll leave with you.

301
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:19,590
Don't you have anything new?

302
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:21,350
You've said this to me so many times.

303
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,680
Okay then.

304
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,680
I'll let you bring him up.

305
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:36,710
Also,

306
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,560
neither of you can leave Wuxia

307
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,070
and you're not allowed to hurt the innocent.

308
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,800
I will find you

309
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:43,920
when he grows up.

310
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,430
Okay.

311
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,710
Thank you so much, Miss Zhu.

312
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,470
Now,

313
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:57,230
your son should be an adult now.

314
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,920
It's time for you to fulfill your promise.

315
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:07,160
Miss Zhu,

316
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,760
this is not the right time.

317
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:12,040
I have to be here to look after Guangping.

318
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,000
What if

319
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,680
I have to take you with me today?

320
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,950
I didn't mean to offend you

321
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,760
in Tianxiang Restaurant last time.

322
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,400
This way, Mr. Chang.

323
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,070
Thanks a lot.

324
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:51,470
Hello, Guangping.

325
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,950
There's even more freedom

326
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,710
in your paintings now.

327
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,520
I'm really in awe.

328
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,310
Miss Zhu, you don't come to Sijing Garden often.

329
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,110
Now that you're here,
how about you consider my request?

330
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,190
If Miss Zhu agrees

331
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,310
to cook the Tiger's Paw for me this time,

332
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,830
I will leave with you for sure.

333
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,880
Although you give me

334
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,920
the ingredients of this dish willingly,

335
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,430
the one who cooks it
still needs to sacrifice their life.

336
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,640
I won't grow old

337
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,640
but I'm not immortal.

338
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,640
So why do I have to do it?

339
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,190
Miss Zhu,

340
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:48,110
I'll never forget your kindness.

341
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,710
I just want my son to be safe.

342
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,000
Don't cry.

343
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,350
I hate to see people cry.

344
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:54,880
Get up now.

345
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,560
Miss Zhu,

346
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,470
are you interested in the Shennong Tripod?

347
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:12,800
Yeah.

348
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,710
I've been looking for it for so many years,

349
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,160
I didn't expect to see it here.

350
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,830
This is the perfect container

351
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,710
for hotpot.

352
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,520
Since you like it,

353
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,110
it is yours now.

354
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,350
This tripod is so important to the Zhou family.

355
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,350
Are you really willing to give it to me?

356
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,760
So,

357
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,230
you've granted my request?

358
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,280
Of course.

359
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,590
I'll cook for you here tomorrow.

360
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:36,470
However, there are things
you have to prepare for me.

361
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,710
Remember to get them ready.

362
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,000
I understand.

363
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,560
I can help you,

364
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,310
but this will be the last time.

365
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,520
If another person dies,

366
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,230
I won't spare you.

367
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,350
I'm willing to atone for my sins,

368
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,310
even if that means I'll be cut into pieces.

369
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,680
I know

370
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,560
you're still grieving for your wife,

371
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,880
but you need to pull yourself together

372
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,950
so that Mrs. Zhou

373
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,350
can rest in peace.

374
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,430
Now the murderer

375
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,280
is still at large.

376
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,350
We have to find out

377
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,800
the truth about her death.

378
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,400
Guangping,

379
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,760
take care of yourself.

380
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,160
Exactly.

381
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:31,800
My wife Ruifang

382
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,070
died mysteriously.

383
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,280
I will find the murderer,

384
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,800
even if it's not a human being.

385
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,800
Guangping, did you see anything?

386
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,470
I'm not sure either.

387
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:01,950
Don't worry, Guangping.

388
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,560
I think we will find out soon.

389
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:30,760
Good.

390
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:31,760
Sir.

391
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:32,760
Tell the worker

392
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,000
that I want to cook here.

393
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:34,800
Yes.

394
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:36,000
Yingtao.

395
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,520
I want black roosters

396
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,680
that are exactly three years old.

397
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,950
Each and every feather should be black.

398
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:45,950
And I want

399
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,950
free-range ewes

400
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,710
that are on the sunny hillside all day long.

401
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,470
And I only want the stalks

402
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:51,070
of spring onions.

403
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,160
Clear?

404
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,230
Yes.

405
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,000
Go.

406
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,430
Yes.

407
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,470
Qing,

408
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,710
to make this Tiger's Paw,

409
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,230
I'll transform three times

410
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,920
from 11 PM to 1 AM, and 11 AM to 1 PM.

411
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,110
So, ask others

412
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,430
not to interrupt me during that time.

413
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,160
Otherwise,

414
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,280
things will be difficult for me.

415
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,800
You will transform?

416
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,310
After being injured in the war 500 years ago,

417
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,920
you should keep recuperating.

418
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,950
Such rash transformations

419
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,350
may cause a relapse.

420
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,350
I don't care,

421
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,430
I just want the Shennong Tripod.

422
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,560
What's the use of it?

423
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,710
To eat hotpot.

424
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:07,380
[Sijing Garden]

425
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,710
Who's there?

426
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,430
Madam, are you inside?

427
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:32,800
Come in.

428
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:39,710
Madam,

429
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:40,560
bad news.

430
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,520
The Prince of Langya is now in Sijing Garden

431
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,710
with Lu Ying of the Inspection Department

432
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,830
and some archers.

433
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,680
They said they were here to find the suspect
in the murder of Ruifang.

434
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,000
I see.

435
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,470
Leave now

436
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,830
and ask Liyu to come.

437
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,350
Yes, madam.

438
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,470
Greetings, Your Highness.

439
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:15,880
No need for formalities.

440
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

441
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,760
I wonder

442
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,590
why you are here.

443
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,160
The Inspection Department has just received a clue

444
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,520
saying that someone in the residence

445
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,160
knows the key information
of the murder of the younger Mrs. Zhou.

446
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:30,880
Who?

447
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,560
This is the job

448
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,880
of the Inspection Department.

449
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,680
I don't think I have to tell you.

450
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,160
Search now.

451
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,000
Yes!

452
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,800
You two, go over there.

453
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:08,680
Yes!

454
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,310
Pay close attention.

455
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:13,880
Sir,

456
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,350
there's a guarded room

457
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,040
and we can't get in.

458
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,310
Have you told them

459
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,640
that you are working
for the Inspection Department on a case?

460
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,830
They just ignored us.

461
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:23,880
Take me there.

462
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,350
Yes.

463
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,350
Hello, Mr. Chang.

464
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:46,350
I didn't expect to see you again so soon.

465
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,880
Yeah, Mr. Lu.

466
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,590
I didn't expect to see you here.

467
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,470
We are here to find the key witness.

468
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,880
We have to search your place too,

469
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,040
there's no exception.

470
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,110
But Miss Zhu is cooking now.

471
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,160
She told me

472
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,280
that nobody could interrupt her.

473
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,310
Why can't I see it then?

474
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,110
What's so mysterious

475
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:08,590
about cooking?

476
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,760
Sorry, no comment.

477
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:13,710
Then I'm even more curious

478
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,350
about what dish it is.

479
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,350
The Prince is here!

480
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,680
Your Highness.

481
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,760
I've long heard that Miss Zhu is here too.

482
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:33,880
Mr. Lu,

483
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,640
take them to search other places.

484
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,520
Leave Miss Zhu to cook in peace.

485
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,070
Yes.

486
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:42,590
Let's go!

487
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,920
Your Highness, how are you doing?

488
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,590
I really didn't expect

489
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,880
that you're also here

490
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,070
with her.

491
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,350
I follow Miss Zhu

492
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,680
wherever she goes.

493
00:30:59,160 --> 00:30:59,880
I see.

494
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,640
Then, I have to thank you

495
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,830
for doing your best

496
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,040
to help Miss Zhu.

497
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,560
She's my boss.

498
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,310
Why do you have to thank me?

499
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,350
Why isn't she

500
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,880
making any sound inside?

501
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,830
I'm afraid something is wrong.

502
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:27,520
Will she...

503
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:27,880
Sir.

504
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,190
Before going inside,
Miss Zhu told me several times

505
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,070
that nobody could interrupt her

506
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,520
when she cooks this dish.

507
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,310
Otherwise, all the work will be in vain.

508
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,350
Now that you care

509
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,830
so much about her,

510
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:41,160
why don't you wait here patiently?

511
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,230
Okay then.

512
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,680
I'll wait here.

513
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,160
What are you worrying about, Your Highness?

514
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:52,710
Miss Zhu,

515
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,680
are you okay?

516
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:54,590
Yes.

517
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,160
It's just that it takes more effort

518
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,590
to cook this dish.

519
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,000
What on earth is this dish?

520
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,830
I can smell the sweetness
and richness of lamb soup

521
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,560
and the freshness
and savory taste of chicken soup.

522
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:14,470
This dish is both delicious and useful.

523
00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:16,350
It's called Tiger's Paw.

524
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,310
Tiger's Paw?

525
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:21,800
I wonder

526
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,520
when you can cook this for me.

527
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:25,880
This dish is hard to cook.

528
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,560
The ingredients are rare,

529
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,070
and both the eater and the cook

530
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:32,070
will have to endure terrible suffering.

531
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,190
It will be better if you don't eat it.

532
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,590
Such an unusual dish.

533
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,190
Miss Zhu,

534
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,470
how many days does it take?

535
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,590
You must feel lonely.

536
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,160
It takes a few more days.

537
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:46,520
Everything else is fine,

538
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,560
however, the food here

539
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,040
is really awful.

540
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,710
That's easy.

541
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:52,880
I will prepare

542
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,280
great ingredients for you.

543
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,710
You won't be disappointed.

544
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,430
Search more carefully.

545
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,640
Yes.

546
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:18,230
There's a mad woman!

547
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,430
- Hurry up! Go outside!
- There's a mad woman!

548
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,590
- Stop!
- Freeze!

549
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:22,590
Stop!

550
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,520
Why is she here?

551
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:23,830
How did she...

552
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,350
Stop!

553
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,350
There's a white tiger...

554
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,590
Don't run!

555
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,280
Stop!

556
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,680
White tiger, there's a white tiger...

557
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:32,760
Stop!

558
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,160
Freeze!

559
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,070
Stop!

560
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,560
Freeze!

561
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,640
Freeze!

562
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,160
The mad woman?

563
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:41,920
There's a white tiger...

564
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:43,830
White tiger...

565
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:45,520
There's a white tiger...

566
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,000
Where is the white tiger?

567
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:48,920
Here...

568
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,560
Mr. Lu,

569
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,350
she's the first wife

570
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,430
of Guangping.

571
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,230
After a miscarriage, she became a bit crazy

572
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,470
because of grave sadness.

573
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:05,520
There's a white tiger.

574
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:06,920
White tiger...

575
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,910
Why does she keep saying there's a white tiger?

576
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,390
She probably thinks

577
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,630
that the white tiger embroidery is real.

578
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,320
She's a mad woman. Mr. Lu, I don't think

579
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,000
you'll take what she says seriously, right?

580
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,190
She was listed

581
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,230
as a missing person.

582
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:30,760
It turns out that you've locked her up.

583
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,000
Why didn't you

584
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
tell the truth?

585
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,000
We don't lock her up.

586
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,150
We just keep her inside.

587
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
She's crazy

588
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,000
so we don't want her
to go outside and hurt others.

589
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,520
She's a member of our family after all.

590
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,230
I think

591
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,230
I can take care of this myself.

596

597
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,280
this is not your business either, Mr. Lu.

598
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,120
Mr. Lu,

599
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,560

604
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,320
There's a mad woman indeed

605
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,000
and she keeps saying there's a white tiger.

606
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:50,230
In that temple, there's a piece of embroidery

607
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,910
of a white tiger with only one paw.

608
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,190
You mean, the tiger on the embroidery

609
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,230
only has one paw too?

610
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:01,280
Exactly.

611
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,120
Mrs. Zhou only has one hand too, doesn't she?

612
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,520
She has a prosthetic hand made of shiny silver.

613
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,150
Sir, do you mean...

614
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,150
Maybe Mrs. Zhou

615
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,630

Who let her out?

619
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,080
Her door was locked

620
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,840
and I've told you nobody is allowed to get close.

621
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,190
Who let her out?

622
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,120
Okay, since nobody wants to admit to it,

623
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,710

I just saw Mr. Zhou there.

626
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,870

636
