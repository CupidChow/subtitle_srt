[Episode 36]

23
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,390
I must fulfill

24
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,720
my duty as the eldest brother.

25
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,670
I understand.

26
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,240
But until now,

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,800
there are still things
I can't be sure of.

28
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,080
I remember you once said

29
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:42,000
your mother was from the Yujiang clan.

30
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,830
That's right.

31
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,550
Do you remember how she passed away?

32
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,190
It was too long ago.

33
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,630
I was very young at the time.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,670
Tell me,

35
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,670
do you have any other requests?

36
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,030
I only ask

37
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,110
that I can be buried with him.

38
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,320
Your Majesty,

39
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,390
please spare Zhao...

Don't cry.

59
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,110
Why?

60
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:37,200
Why do you want Mother dead?

61
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,270
Your mother

62
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,160
has been deceiving us all along.

63
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,110
She is the demon beast Yujiang.

64
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,830
A demon beast!

65
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,070
She entered the palace to deceive me

66
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,200
and to give birth to you,

67
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,950
then use you to cultivate dark magic.

68
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,110
You never truly had such a mother.

69
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,070
My mother is a demon beast?

70
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,790
Yes.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,390
I have no mother?

72
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:05,830
Yes.

73
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,790
So you've endured so much.

74
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,200
This is why

75
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,000
you hate demon beasts so much, isn't it?

76
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,950
You just said

77
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,110
your mother pleaded with your father

78
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,320
to let her be buried with him.

79
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,320
Who is he?

80
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,720
So many years have passed.

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,230
Mother's Qionghua Palace
is long abandoned.

82
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,230
No matter how much I think about it,

83
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,550
I can't remember
who she was talking about.

84
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,070
Do you still remember

85
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,000
where your mother is buried?

86
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,230
Be careful.

87
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,440
Go.

88
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,000
Be careful!

89
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,350
A consort's tomb

90
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,920
actually has so many traps.

91
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,640
There truly are untold secrets.

92
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:19,950
Mother,

93
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,320
are you well?

94
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,670
Should we open it?

95
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,400
Mother, wake up.

96
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Mother!

97
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,110
Mother.

98
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,880
Mother.

99
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,670
Mother.

100
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,520
Mother.

101
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,670
My child.

102
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,150
It's been so many years.

103
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,840
I almost forgot her face.

104
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,000
This child is...

105
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,550
Supposedly your elder brother.

106
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,640
My brother?

107
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,670
Why did I know nothing about this?

108
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,400
It seems your father

109
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,670
deliberately concealed it.

110
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:00,960
Indeed.

111
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:02,790
Over 20 years ago,

112
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,880
your father already tried once.

113
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,790
But unfortunately,

114
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,150
it didn't achieve the desired result.

115
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,110
Father has already made
the Heart Skewer once?

116
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,230
Think about how your father

117
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,910
treated you all these years

118
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,840
and how he treated Zhao Ai and Zhao Qu.

119
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
This Heart Skewer

120
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,550
can even summon the dragon
to unify the world.

121
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,400
And to achieve this,

122
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,200
it requires someone with great power.

123
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:55,960
The Yujiang clan excels
in profound magic,

124
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:58,110
that's why your father
married your mother.

125
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,960
All these years,

126
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,710
it's your father who's been using you

127
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,200
for dark magic.

128
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,350
If all this is true,

129
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,080
then my mother's death...

130
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,080
You already have the answer,

131
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,030
don't you?

132
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,320
Ms. Fangxi.

133
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:01,950
Greetings,

134
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
Your Highness.

135
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,150
Please rise, Ms. Fangxi.

136
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,560
Ms. Fangxi,

137
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:12,680
I must ask you to tell me

138
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,040
what was the truth back then.

139
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,320
Why was my mother killed?

140
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,590
Her Highness left a letter

141
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,150
before her death.

142
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,830
She said

143
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,040
if one day you learned the truth,

144
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,150
she wanted me to personally
hand it to you.

145
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:53,600
[To my son, Heng]

146
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,520
[To my son, Heng]

147
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,510
My son,

148
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,630
as your mother, I am sorry

149
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,950
that I cannot stay with you.

150
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,560
My heart will always be with you.

151
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,480
Your father made me bear a prince

152
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,040
and demanded I make Heart Skewer

153
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,270
to bless Da Liang.

154
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,150
I didn't want to,

155
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,560
but Yue died because of it.

156
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,070
My heart was in agony,

157
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,750
so I destroyed it deliberately.

158
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:38,880
I failed Yue

159
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,560
and I failed my clan.

160
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,000
I have no face to live on.

161
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,560
I only wish for your safety.

162
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,800
Heng, remember,

163
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,120
your father cannot be trusted.

164
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,240
Your mother, Yuxi.

165
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,710
All these years,

166
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,320
he has always been deceiving me.

167
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,680
I, on the other hand,
have been consumed by guilt

168
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,390
because of my

169
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,950
half-demon identity,

170
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,710
even sought his affection.

171
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,680
The Emperors are unpredictable.

172
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,590
Once one sits in a high position,

173
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,510
their desires grow endlessly.

174
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,000
Miss Zhu, let me ask you.

175
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,830
If completing the Heart Skewer,

176
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,560
will it truly bring peace
and prosperity to Da Liang

177
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,150
and unity between ruler and ministers?

178
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,240
You still won't give up?

179
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,240
You're still thinking
of helping him make it?

180
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,710
I am not only Father's son,

181
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,190
but also the Prince of Langya
for Da Liang.

182
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,560
The soldiers at the border

183
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,040
are suffering from hunger and war.

184
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,510
The people are displaced.

185
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,630
General Yao gave his own life

186
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,830
to protect Da Liang.

187
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,630
I cannot sit idly by.

188
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,750
Bei Di has ambitious,
predatory intentions.

189
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,440
The flames of war won't cease,

190
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,920
and it's the people
who'll suffer in the end.

191
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,360
But this is not your burden alone.

192
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,320
Whether it's Zhao Ai or Zhao Qu,

193
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,320
they can also accomplish it.

194
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,040
No one else

195
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,040
is more suitable than me.

196
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,120
Your Highness,

197
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,190
this is the only route.

198
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:47,000
Once we bypass here,
we'll see the Bei Di Army.

199
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,680
And this place is...

200
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:50,560
Your Highness,

201
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,070
what's wrong?

202
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,440
Nothing.

203
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,590
Recently, my arm
occasionally hurts sharply.

204
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:56,510
I'll bear with it.

205
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,510
Should we get the military physician?

206
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:03,510
Your Highness,

207
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,560
may I take a look?

208
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,320
Well...

209
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:07,920
Fine.

210
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,560
I've been troubled by this.

211
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,320
Thank you.

212
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,040
All right.

213
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:21,440
Scales.

214
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,190
I deserve punishment.

215
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,190
Do not let this spread.

216
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,270
We must avoid unsettling the troops.

217
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:29,950
Understood.

218
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
[Soaring Aspirations]

219
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,390
Your Highness.

220
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,190
Your Highness,

221
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,950
all elite troops
in the residence are ready,

222
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,920
awaiting your orders.

223
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,320
Today's Exorcising Ceremony

224
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,070
is of great importance.

225
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,320
I hope everyone gives your all.

226
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,630
With all our might!

227
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:55,680
Mingyan,

228
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:56,800
split into two teams.

229
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,590
Set out.

230
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:01,950
Set out!

231
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,470
Cuiyan,

232
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,040
let's go.

233
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Long live the Emperor!

234
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,800
Long live the Emperor!

235
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,840
Long live the Emperor!

236
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,600
Long live the Emperor!

237
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,680
Long live the Emperor!

238
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,870
Long live the Emperor!

239
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,840
Long live the Emperor!

240
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,510
Miss Zhu,

241
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,270
the Prince of Langya is thoughtful.

242
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,600
He knows you love crowds,

243
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,800
and prepared a donkey cart for us

244
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,600
so you wouldn't get too tired.

245
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,040
Miss Zhu.

246
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,840
You clearly can't let go
of Mr. Chang Qing.

247
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,390
Why don't we go find him?

248
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,840
He doesn't want to see me.

249
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,040
I can't force him.

250
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,440
At least his injuries are healed now.

251
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:22,560
Long live the Emperor!

252
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,840
Long live the Emperor!

253
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,960
Long live the Emperor!

254
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,200
Long live the Emperor!

255
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,510
Long live the Emperor!

256
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,040
Run!

257
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:57,840
Protect the Emperor!

258
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,800
Yes!

259
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,470
Wu Ruofu,

260
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,840
are you planning regicide?

261
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,680
I wouldn't dare.

262
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,720
I'm nearing the end of my days.

263
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:17,440
My only daughter married you years ago.

264
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,800
I have only one grandson, Qu.

265
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:23,270
Please spare his life, Your Majesty.

266
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,470
At this point,

267
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,870
I'll speak plainly.

268
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,920
For the sake of the world,

269
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,630
what's the harm in sacrificing

270
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,920
a prince, Zhao Qu?

271
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,150
No one can threaten me.

272
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:40,990
Not today, either!

273
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,510
Your past actions

274
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:45,680
have long tried my patience.

275
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,320
Today,

276
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,080
you dare plot rebellion.

277
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,040
Don't forget your grandson

278
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,440
is still in my hands.

279
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,870
With one command from me,

280
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:00,800
your Wu family

281
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,270
will lose everything.

282
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,870
Every one of your family
will be exterminated.

283
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:13,870
If you sacrifice my grandson for a dish,

284
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,390
what's left of the Wu family then?

285
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,960
Now Qu is imprisoned
in the dungeon of the imperial palace.

286
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,630
I only ask you to issue a decree

287
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:25,920
to spare his life.

288
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,560
I am willing to commit suicide
as atonement.

289
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:30,800
If not,

290
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,440
don't blame me for being ruthless.

291
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:36,750
What do you want?

292
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,720
Soldiers,

293
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,560
release the arrows!

294
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,150
Father!

295
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:04,440
Father!

296
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,390
Traitor!

297
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,720
He must be executed!

298
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,440
Father!

299
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:21,750
Quick,

300
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,750
escort His Majesty back to the palace!

301
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,150
Yes.

302
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,630
Your Majesty, hurry.

303
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,150
If I'm not mistaken,

304
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,200
the soldiers you lead

305
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,390
are the elite Shence Army
that once heroically defended Bianjing.

306
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,960
So what if they are?

307
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,720
If so,

308
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,560
each of you likely has family

309
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,390
left behind in your homeland.

310
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,680
To protect Da Liang,

311
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,200
you left your mothers and wives

312
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
on lost territory.

313
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,320
Are they also eagerly awaiting

314
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,870
your return

315
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,200
to reclaim your land?

316
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,750
Men of valor,

317
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,560
would you not rather
die for your country

318
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,920
than spill your blood

319
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,630
in endless infighting?

320
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:26,630
This...

321
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,440
You abandoned your families

322
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,720
to protect Da Liang.

323
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,390
But those behind you

324
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
are engaged in grain smuggling

325
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,200
within the military.

326
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,270
Is this the general you vowed
to follow to the death?

327
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,110
You all

328
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,720
shed blood and tears

329
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,960
to protect Da Liang,

330
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,560
but do you know that your general

331
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,110
sees your lives

332
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,270
and Da Liang as a game?

333
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,390
Don't let him escape!

334
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,080
Mingyan,

335
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
this place is yours to handle.

336
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,350
I'll return to the palace.

337
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,110
I'll take care of it.

338
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,440
Don't worry, Your Highness.

339
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,470
Prince of Langya has arrived!

340
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,270
I am sorry.

341
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,080
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

342
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:07,680
All of you,

343
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,560
leave us.

344
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,200
Everyone, get out!

345
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:16,800
Go!

346
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:17,440
Quickly, move!

347
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:17,990
Go, go!

348
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,750
I imagined countless times

349
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,320
what it would be like
to be this close to you.

350
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:05,110
But not once did I envision this scene.

351
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:07,320
Father,

352
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,750
I have a question for you.

353
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,080
Back then,

354
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,840
what exactly did you do

355
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,750
to my mother and elder brother?

356
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,200
When I was little, you told me

357
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,870
Mother tried to use me
to perform demonic power

358
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,720
and you executed her.

359
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,990
After all these years,

360
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,470
is that really the truth?

361
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,040
And my elder brother,

362
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,720
why have you never mentioned him?

363
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,960
Why does no one in the palace

364
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,040
know of his existence?

365
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,720
Why?

366
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,110
How

367
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,840
did you find out?

368
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,080
At this point,

369
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,470
you're still asking how I know?

370
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,720
We are all sacrifices to you.

371
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,840
Was I born

372
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:22,230
to be consumed by you?

373
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:25,630
And Zhao Ai and Zhao Qu.

374
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,350
Did you favor them differently

375
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,350
only to choose

376
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:31,200
who would be suitable
to make the Heart Skewer?

377
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,390
Are we just pawns

378
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:37,270
for your empire's stability?

379
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,510
Did you ever consider

380
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,840
how much pain Mother was in

381
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,080
watching her own child

382
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,470
die before her eyes?

383
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,390
Mother wrote me a letter.

384
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,350
I've read it.

385
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,600
20 years ago, you tricked her
into the palace,

386
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,470
had her bear two princes for you,

387
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,990
and deceived her
into making the Heart Skewer.

388
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,870
Even though

389
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,200
her heart broke,

390
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,630
for the sake of your empire

391
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,080
and your people,

392
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,350
she hardened her resolve.

393
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:12,750
Was all of this

394
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:15,870
really true?

395
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,630
Why?

396
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:23,870
Father,

397
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,990
why did you deceive me
for so many years?

398
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,840
I understand now.

399
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:42,350
We are all just food on your plate.

400
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,630
You killed my brother

401
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,750
to be the dragon in disguise.

402
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,920
And by killing me,

403
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,870
Da Liang can achieve unity
between ruler and ministers

404
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,470
and the empire will be secure.

405
00:28:55,630 --> 00:28:56,270
Father,

406
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:00,080
I have one last question for you.

407
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:04,390
Did you ever truly love me?

408
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:15,960
My

409
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,040
greatest regret

410
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,990
is that over the years,

411
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,390
I exiled you to the outskirts.

412
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,080
It was because I

413
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,630
didn't want to establish
an emotional bond with you.

414
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,840
Every time I see you,

415
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,270
I'm reminded
of so many things from the past.

416
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,040
I'm afraid that one day,

417
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,870
I might hurt you again.

418
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,960
When I first ascended the throne,

419
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,040
I faced internal and external crises.

420
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,750
The situation

421
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,200
was unstable.

422
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,080
Thus, I had no choice

423
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,630
but to sacrifice your mother

424
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,630
and your elder brother.

425
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,390
Were it not for

426
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,110
this crisis with Bei Di,

427
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,320
I would never

428
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,870
want to sacrifice anyone else.

429
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:57,840
I

430
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:05,200
truly loved your mother.

431
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:10,390
It wasn't because
she was from the Yujiang clan.

432
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:13,680
It was because she...

433
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:15,750
She...

434
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:20,080
She was the woman I loved most.

435
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,110
But she was too stubborn by nature

436
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:34,200
and refused to forgive
what happened back then.

437
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,750
Heng.

438
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,840
Heng.

439
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,320
Father.

440
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,440
Heng.

441
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,560
Heng...

442
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,230
Father.

443
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:01,510
Father!

444
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,440
Father!

445
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,040
Father!

446
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,920
Father!

447
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:15,200
Father!

448
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,080
The vanguard force passed through here,

449
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,990
then looped back to this location.

450
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,600
Report!

451
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,040
Your Highness,

452
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,960
a secret letter
from the Prince of Langya.

453
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,670
Father has passed away.

454
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,240
It's still kept a secret.

455
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:38,550
Ai, take care.

456
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,120
I'll wait for your triumphant return.

457
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,510
Prince of Langya.

458
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:50,790
Bad news!

459
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,550
Your Highness!

460
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,390
Bad news!

461
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,390
Why are you panicking?

462
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,080
Your Highness,

463
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,000
report from the frontline

464
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,840
that Bei Di is launching
a massive attack.

465
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:01,310
The Second Prince led the troops

466
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,550
defend Garuda Pass desperately,

467
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,960
and got severely injured.

468
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,360
And...

469
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,150
And what?

470
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,960
And for some reason,

471
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,550
scales have appeared on his body.

472
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,080
It seems to be an ominous sign.

473
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,080
What omen?

474
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:17,790
Your Highness.

475
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,310
Miss Zhu,

476
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,840
Zhao Ai is gravely injured,

477
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:22,360
and his body is covered in scales.

478
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,150
Is it the result of an attack
by a beast?

479
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,790
Your Highness, don't worry too much.

480
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,600
Before the Portal was severed,

481
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,480
many beasts and humans

482
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,360
coexisted on this continent.

483
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,880
Some of them intermarried,

484
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,030
and bore descendants.

485
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,510
Most of these descendants
have human forms,

486
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,150
but lack the powers of beasts.

487
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,550
Among them,

488
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,880
one lineage carries dragon blood.

489
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,000
Whenever war erupts again

490
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,670
on this continent,

491
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,720
the dragon will awaken again

492
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:48,670
through the bloodline
of its descendants.

493
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:50,030
He

494
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,000
is a dragon.

495
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,360
So that means,

496
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,760
Zhao Ai is the dragon of this era?

497
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:06,190
But how can he be awakened?

498
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:12,470
Miss Zhu,

499
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:13,310
please, say something.

500
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,030
Could it be related
to the Heart Skewer?

501
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,920
I refused your father's request before

502
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,310
was because it was too evil,

503
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,510
I didn't want to do it.

504
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,200
The second reason

505
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,080
is that awakening the dragon

506
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,640
entails risks.

507
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,750
The dragon has slept for centuries.

508
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,160
Its power long uncontrollable.

509
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,120
And humans

510
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,550
have indulged in decadence
for centuries,

511
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,510
with physiques far weaker

512
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,880
than ancient times.

513
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,120
I fear they cannot
bear the dragon's power.

514
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,750
If awakened forcibly now,

515
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:51,160
it might bring devastating harm

516
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,400
to the human world.

517
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,600
But since the Heart Skewer
hasn't been made,

518
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:57,990
why does Zhao Ai

519
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,950
show signs of the dragon?

520
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:02,360
This indicates that Zhao Ai

521
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:04,750
can control the dragon's power

522
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,880
like Fuxi and Dayu.

523
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,440
So,

524
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,600
the Heart Skewer

525
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:17,710
can unite ruler and people in Da Liang

526
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,230
and let brothers be in harmony,

527
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,470
as well as awaken the dragon
within Zhao Ai,

528
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,360
making him

529
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,360
a merciful, calm, unparalleled monarch?

530
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,120
Your Highness.

531
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,440
Your Highness,

532
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,200
you mustn't!

533
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,400
Don't do this.

534
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,470
Am I dead?

535
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,160
We meet again,

536
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,160
the dragon of this era.

537
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,400
In this era,

538
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,470
you face a fractured world.

539
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:21,920
With your strength alone,

540
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,310
I wonder how long can you endure.

541
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,080
Even so,

542
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,310
you still choose to awaken?

543
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,400
What happened to me just now?

544
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,080
How did I awaken?

545
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,600
Mother,

546
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,470
Brother,

547
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,440
the two of you must feel so cold

548
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,230
in this coffin.

549
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,120
Don't worry,

550
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,550
I will join you.

551
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:24,950
Does this golden silk dress

552
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,790
suit your taste?

553
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:27,470
It does.

554
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,510
Perfectly so.

555
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,470
Your Highness, please look.

556
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:48,230
What a great beauty

557
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,400
with exquisite elegance.

558
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,600
What a great beauty

559
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,270
with exquisite elegance.

560
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,360
The most precious thing in this world

561
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,400
is a pure heart.

562
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,120
If you are reluctant,

563
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:22,920
there's still time.

564
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:23,790
No.

565
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,790
To become a dragon

566
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,030
is no easy task.

567
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,360
As his elder brother,

568
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,840
my broken body
can finally be of use to him.

569
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:41,640
If I awaken him,

570
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,710
tomorrow,

571
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,550
he will forget everything about you.

572
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:48,710
In this world,

573
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,710
only you will remember him.

574
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:52,470
And he

575
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,400
will never call you Brother again.

576
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:00,990
Look at this.

577
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:01,880
Eat quickly.

578
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,710
I took it from the Imperial Kitchen.

579
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:08,310
Remember,

580
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,550
as long as I have food to eat,

581
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,310
you will have your share.

582
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:13,920
This

583
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,030
is brotherhood.

584
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,710
Even if only I remember, so be it.

585
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:32,600
Moreover,

586
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,990
I won't remember for long.

587
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,790
How about I promise you something?

588
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,400
I promise you,

589
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:53,440
when he reaches the end of this life,

590
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,360
I'll return his heart to him

591
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,270
in his final moments,

592
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,640
so he will remember you.

593
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:05,440
Thank you.

594
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:08,680
Miss Zhu,

595
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:11,710
dying before you

596
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,360
makes me happy.

597
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:27,840
Living on in Zhao Ai's body

598
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:36,360
makes me have no regrets.

599
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:08,590
In this life,

600
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:12,480
I once longed desperately
for Father's love.

601
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:14,960
And hated my mother.

602
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,880
In the end, it was all a deception.

603
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,590
Right and wrong were inverted.

604
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,680
There was a woman who loved me,

605
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,480
but I did not love her,

606
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,070
and the woman I loved

607
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:34,830
did not love me.

608
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:37,880
Now Zhao Ai

609
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,160
has become the dragon,
and the son of heaven.

610
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:43,480
And he will forget me.

611
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:45,830
In the end,

612
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,350
I am left alone in this world.
