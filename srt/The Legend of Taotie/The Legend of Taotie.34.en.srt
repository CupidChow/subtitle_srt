[Episode 34]

23
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,750
What are you doing?

24
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,240
I'm making noodles for General Yao.

25
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,390
It will warm him up a bit.

26
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,390
Your Highness,

27
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:15,720
you've suffered.

28
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:16,830
It's nothing.

29
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:19,630
Come with me to see General Yao.

30
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:20,550
Okay.

31
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,030
Miss Zhu.

32
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,270
It's Garuda.

33
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,880
Why has it returned?

34
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,630
Where did this noodle come from?

35
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,030
I just went to the kitchen.

36
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,390
I don't know who left it there.

37
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,030
It looks good,

38
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,000
so I brought it to you.

39
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,000
This should be made
by the old jailer for General Yao.

40
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,190
Then don't eat it, Miss Zhu.

41
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,160
It's unlucky.

42
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,960
This should be made for General Yao
before his execution.

43
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,830
I heard from customers
at Tianxiang Restaurant before

44
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,190
that death row inmates

45
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,550

48
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,240
go bring Qing to the main hall.

Mr. Chang Qing doesn't want to see you.

00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:17,670
Since when did you learn to talk back?

51
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,390
Just go tell Qing

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,200
Garuda has returned

53
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,440
and I have found a way
to stabilize the morale.

54
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,720
Let him come quickly to see me.

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,110
You've found a way to stabilize morale?

56
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,440
Hurry up and go.

57
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,790
Okay, okay, okay.

58
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,550
I'll go right now.

59
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,270
General.

60
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,510
This is the wine

61
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,230
His Majesty gave you.

62
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:30,950
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

63
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,950
General Yao, wait.

64
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,200
Your Highness.

65
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,670
I know

66
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,390
this imperial decree from my father

67
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,270
really chills the hearts
of the soldiers.

68
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,550
Your Highness,

69
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,830
I don't fear death.

70
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,110
But as the commander of the Yao's Army,

71
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,230
I cannot die in this dark prison cell

72
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,160
from a cup of poisoned wine.

73
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,480
A man

74
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,440
should die honorably

75
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,720
on the battlefield.

76
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,160
General, you have great ambition.

77
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,390
I truly admire you.

78
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,230
Now, at this critical moment,

79
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,390
the army cannot be
without a leader for a single day.

80
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,480
Release General Yao from prison.

81
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,640
Your Highness,

82
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:56,960
you can't!

83
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,310
You are currently a criminal.

84
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,240
If you release General Yao recklessly,

85
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,360
His Majesty might blame you
if he finds out.

86
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,080
I've made up my mind.

87
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,360
In such a critical situation,

88
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,830
there's no harm in sacrificing myself.

89
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,270
Release him.

90
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:15,430
Yes.

91
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

92
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:42,270
Qing,

93
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:42,830
you've come.

94
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,920
Miss Zhu,

95
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,550
have you thought of a way

96
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,480
to stabilize the morale?

97
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,710
I think

98
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,640
only if Garuda regains its power

99
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,920
can we protect Garuda Pass.

100
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,040
But, Yao

101
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,960
has already let Garuda go.

102
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,270
Garuda is just a symbol.

103
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,520
What matters most now

104
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,430
is to unite the Yao's Army.

105
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,310
But Yao is about to be executed.

106
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,150
The Yao's Army is without a leader now.

107
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:04,920
Your Highness.

108
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,590
Miss Zhu,

109
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,920
you don't need to worry
about General Yao.

110
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,640
I have already
sent him back to the camp.

111
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,390
But now Bei Di

112
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
is gathering their troops.

113
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,680
There will probably be
a great battle in the next few days.

114
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,390
Our troops' morale is low.

115
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,760
What should we do about this?

116
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:26,800
Your Highness,

117
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,110
I want you to send someone

118
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:31,080
to set up a tent
at the city gate for me.

119
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,120
At this time?

120
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,680
That's right.

121
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,560
I'll take care of it right away.

122
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,320
Qing,

123
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,120
I have one more thing to tell you.

124
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:50,800
Garuda has returned.

125
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,270
What?

126
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,590
Yao Pengju's guess was correct.

127
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,240
Even though their contract was broken,

128
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,240
Garuda still cares about him.

129
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,120
After General Yao was thrown into jail,

130
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,510
it flew back.

131
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,510
I was afraid something might happen,

132
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,000
so I kept it in my room.

133
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:09,920
Miss Zhu,

134
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,510
do you have any way to treat Garuda?

135
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,510
This is Yao's final wish.

136
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,630
I assure you

137
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:17,190
after I restore the soldiers' confidence,

138
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,390
I will do my best to treat Garuda.

139
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,150
Slow down.

140
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:26,920
Place it here.

141
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,190
Slow down, slow down.

142
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,070
Come.

143
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,190
Place it here.

144
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,320
Qing,

145
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,270
let's begin.

146
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,480
[Wine]

147
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,590
Miss Zhu,

148
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,630
what are you going to do with the wine?

149
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:54,800
Knead a dough.

150
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,040
Knead a dough?

151
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,070
Yes.

152
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,510
Now the water supply is cut off.

153
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,120
There is only this much flour left.

154
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,320
But it's no problem.

155
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,150
Even if there is only this much,

156
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,480
we can still make a meal

157
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,510
the soldiers are most familiar with.

158
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:19,120
The wine is aged.

159
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,040
It's the most common Erguotou
in the streets of Da Liang.

160
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,750
The flour is fresh.

161
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,240
It's freshly harvested wheat
from the farmers' autumn harvest.

162
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,190
The scallions are fresh.

163
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:09,120
They are grown by the soldiers
in their own farm fields.

164
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,070
Unfortunately, there aren't many.

165
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,680
I can only use this method
for flavoring.

166
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,680
The vegetables are pickled.

167
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,830
They are a mixture of the soldiers'

168
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,590
home-made pickled vegetables

169
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,680
and the most precious.

170
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,830
What's this smell?

171
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,070
It smells so good!

172
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,240
Let's go take a look.

173
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:36,630
Do you smell it?

174
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,040
Smells good.

175
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,630
Where's it from?

176
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,120
This smell

177
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,590
seems to be coming from over there.

178
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,240
Is that so?

179
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,440
- Let's go, take a look.
- Go take a look.

180
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:44,920
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

181
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,360
It smells so good!

182
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,630
Officers and soldiers,

183
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,270
try this noodles

184
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,630
and see how it tastes.

185
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:15,920
Here.

186
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:17,560
Thank you.

187
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,040
Thank you.

188
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:20,750
Here you go.

189
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,630
This makeshift method

190
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,880
still doesn't work.

191
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,710
Keep watching.

192
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,070
This taste

193
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,150
reminds me of the Dandan noodles
my mother used to make.

194
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,800
Except for my mother,

195
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,000
no one else

196
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:03,950
has made this

197
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,800
oil-splashing noodles so authentically.

198
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,390
Delicious.

199
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,040
Mother.

200
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,750
What's going on here?

201
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,830
Miss Zhu,

202
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,950
what exactly did you make?

203
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:33,590
It's home sickness.

204
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,360
Aged wine, fresh noodles,

205
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,040
raw scallions, pickled vegetables.

206
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,480
Each one

207
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,480
is a daily food
of the people of Da Liang.

208
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,070
Now, combined into one pot,

209
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,070
one becomes four,
and four becomes a thousand.

210
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,120
It reminds them

211
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,590
of home.

212
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,750
Delicious.

213
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,680
Delicious!

214
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,630
All of the soldiers

215
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,270
have already prepared
for the possibility

216
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,920
of dying in the wilderness.

217
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,950
After many battles,

218
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,560
people inevitably become numb.

219
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,710
But the one thing they can't forget

220
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,190
is this homesickness.

221
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,190
Only it

222
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,830
can reignite

223
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,710
the soldiers' fighting spirit and hope

224
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,150
and make them fight desperately.

225
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,390
General,

226
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,590
all the soldiers
have eaten a bowl of this noodles

227
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,920
to prepare for today's battle.

228
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,510
This bowl is for you.

229
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,390
The supplies are almost gone.

230
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,880
Even the wells
are buried under yellow sand.

231
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,360
Where did this noodles come from?

232
00:14:59,480 --> 00:14:59,950
General,

233
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,590
this noodles

234
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:02,630
was just made by Miss Zhu for us.

235
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,190
It's a bowl of noodles
with the flavor of home.

236
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,190
Please try it.

237
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,680
After eating it,

238
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,120
we will return

239
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,390
victorious from the battlefield today.

240
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,390
That's right, General.

241
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,920
My mother is waiting for me to return.

242
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,710
I will definitely wipe out
these Bei Di people.

243
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,070
Good.

244
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,680
Soldiers,

245
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,070
after finishing this bowl of noodles,

246
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,750
we will fight to the death

247
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,270
against the Bei Di people.

248
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:49,950
Soldiers,

249
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,190
we have no water or supplies left.

250
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,950
Only by repelling the enemy

251
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,270
can we have a chance to survive.

252
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,920
We swear to defend Garuda Pass

253
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,480
and the state to the death!

254
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,440
We swear to defend Garuda Pass

255
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,390
and the state to the death!

256
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,920
We swear to defend Garuda Pass!

257
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,120
Homesickness

258
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,390
is integrated into the noodles.

259
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:09,040
I name it Qianji Noodles.

260
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,710
Soldiers far from home

261
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,950
fight bravely,

262
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,710
pledging loyal to Da Liang

263
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,320
for the happiness and health

264
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,360
of their loved ones at home.

265
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,680
But they

266
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,320
will never understand
how His Majesty thinks.

267
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,680
No matter how the dynasties change,

268
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,190
they are unsung heroes.

269
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,150
Only homesickness and the taste of home

270
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,480
are their eternal concerns.

271
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,000
Kill!

272
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,830
Kill them all!

273
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,750
Charge!

274
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,390
You said

275
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,200
there's a way to save Garuda.

276
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,870
Is it to open the Portal

277
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,150
to send Garuda home?

278
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,800
How did you know

279
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,840
opening the Portal

280
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,630
would restore Garuda's strength?

281
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,270
I...

282
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,800
I just overheard

283
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,110
that General Yao mentioned it.

284
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,680
I will do my best to save Garuda.

285
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,680
But I absolutely cannot open the Portal.

286
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,960
But Garuda is already
on the brink of death.

287
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,080
Report!

288
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:32,840
Your Highness.

289
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,920
How is the situation on the battlefield?

290
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,040
Your Highness,

291
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,320
five days after our great victory

292
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,080
at the Battle of Changcheng,

293
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,680
General Yao led the Garuda Army

294
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,560
to invade Linying County,

295
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,640
and 300 cavalry
to the front at the Sishui River,

296
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,240
but met the 120,000 troops of Bei Di

297
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,190
head on.

298
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,880
And countless archers of Bei Di

299
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,120
appeared suddenly,

300
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,030
launching a massive attack.

301
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,510
Reinforcements cannot rescue us.

302
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,640
The soldiers were caught off guard.

303
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,310
The casualties were heavy.

304
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,760
Even...

305
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,600
Even General Yao...

306
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,430
Even General Yao is missing.

307
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,760
It's feared that

308
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,240
chances of survival are slim.

309
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,240
Your Highness,

310
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,720
if Bei Di strikes with full force,

311
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,640
I'm afraid

312
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,720
we might face total destruction.

313
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,910
You may leave now.

314
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:24,840
Yes.

315
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:34,960
Miss Zhu.

316
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,720
The Prince of Langya
wants to see you now.

317
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,550
What you want with me...

318
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,000
Please, Miss Zhu, lend us your help.

319
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,960
How do you know I'll help?

320
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,270
The 300 cavalry from Da Liang

321
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,030
are trapped by the enemy
at the Sishui River.

322
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,430
Bei Di has sent out many archers

323
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,480
secretly assassinating us.

324
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,000
Anyone who comes near

325
00:19:58,550 --> 00:19:59,310
has not survived.

326
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,720
In battle,

327
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,550
the hardest to resist for infantry

328
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,510
are arrows shot from above.

329
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,720
Now Garuda can no longer fight.

330
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,910
Therefore, I must ask you for help.

331
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,760
What does this have to do with me?

332
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,000
We are in a time of crisis.

333
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,080
I admit my mistakes earlier.

334
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,080
But please, Miss Zhu,
prioritize the national affair.

335
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,510
I am not Garuda.

336
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:28,030
I have not made a pact with any human

337
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,360
and I have no reason
to fight for anyone.

338
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,760
Miss Zhu.

339
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,360
Are you asking me to help?

340
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:42,150
Yes.

341
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,190
For 500 years,

342
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,760
I have not participated
in any human wars

343
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,550
and I have not helped any side.

344
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,600
Is this your wish?

345
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,360
Please, Miss Zhu,

346
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,510
help the soldiers
and people of Da Liang.

347
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:21,840
Okay.

348
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,790
She is only willing to do what he asks.

349
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,150
General!

350
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,080
Thanks to your help,

351
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,720
we had a chance to defeat Bei Di Army.

352
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,030
They probably won't

353
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,640
invade again in the short term.

354
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,270
No need for thanks.

355
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,000
Deputy General Zhang,

356
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,120
although Bei Di Army

357
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,190
has stopped attacking,

358
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,720
we must stay vigilant.

359
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,510
I have ordered my men to stand ready

360
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,310
for Bei Di Army at any time.

361
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,270
General.

362
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,310
General!

363
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,600
This is General Yao's sword.

364
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:02,510
Before he died, he entrusted me
to deliver it to you.

365
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,840
General.

366
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,640
General Yao fought for all his life.

367
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,880
Dying in battle

368
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,960
is the best end for him.

369
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,150
Gentlemen,

370
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,840
do not grieve too much.

371
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,360
Having brothers in arms

372
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,120
who went trough fire and water together,

373
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,880
and Garuda with whom
he shared his heart,

374
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:35,430
that is enough.

375
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,640
Have they all returned?

376
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:47,960
Your Highness,

377
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,390
they have returned.

378
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,240
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

379
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,760
No need for formalities.

380
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,030
Miss Zhu,

381
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,000
how is it?

382
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,190
Are you okay?

383
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,240
Thank you for your hard work.

384
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,030
I've already sent news of our victory

385
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,910
and General Yao's death back to Yunlong.

386
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,030
Everyone, rest well.

387
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,760
- Yes.
- Yes.

388
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:46,960
Miss Zhu.

389
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,190
Miss Zhu, you've finally returned.

390
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,310
How is it?

391
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,030
It's been lethargic

392
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,190
and won't eat or drink.

393
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:58,790
I don't know how much longer

394
00:25:58,790 --> 00:25:59,670
it can hold on.

395
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,310
I will save it.

396
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:05,960
How do you plan to save it?

397
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:08,910
Don't forget

398
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,910
Nine-Section Dragon Marrow

399
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,670
is the marrow of an ancient beast.

400
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,030
And I am a thousand-year-old Taotie.

401
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,000
I naturally can

402
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,390
use my vital energy to save it.

403
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,510
You were injured 500 years ago

404
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,000
and have not yet fully recovered.

405
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,670
After experiencing the fierce battle,

406
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,840
I'm not sure if using
your vital energy recklessly

407
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,760
will bring danger.

408
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,150
Cuiyan,

409
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,720
go get some dry grass for me.

410
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,360
Hurry.

411
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:41,550
There's

412
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,910
no other way?

413
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:48,550
I knew

414
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,120
that you still care about me.

415
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:52,240
Don't worry, I'm fine.

416
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,670
You haven't forgiven me yet.

417
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,150
You're not sorry for me,

418
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,640
and I'm not qualified to forgive you.

419
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,240
I just...

420
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:02,790
I know.

421
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,390
You just can't forgive yourself.

422
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,480
Qing,

423
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,030
the Chen hour every day

424
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:15,150
is when I have
the strongest spiritual connection

425
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,510
with Garuda.

426
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,960
But I must transform

427
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,720
to use my vital energy to heal it.

428
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,960
At that time,

429
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,360
no one can interrupt.

430
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,510
So, you and Cuiyan

431
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:24,840
must guard me together.

432
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,880
Will healing Garuda

433
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,880
really not affect your body?

434
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,270
Although I hope Garuda recovers,

435
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,080
I don't want you

436
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,910
to sacrifice yourself for me.

437
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:38,510
This time, I truly didn't think

438
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,720
that you would be willing
to help Da Liang,

439
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,240
and help these soldiers.

440
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,000
I'm very grateful.

441
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,720
Firstly,

442
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,150
I'm afraid that Bei Di
will break through Da Liang,

443
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,360
and the Lotus Tower will be lost.

444
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,360
Secondly, it's for Garuda.

445
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:54,910
Thirdly...

446
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,030
Thirdly, what?

447
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:10,000
Qing,

448
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:13,880
would you be willing
to make a pact with me?

449
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,390
Like what Garuda and General Yao did.

450
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,030
Now, in this great battle,

451
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,510
I don't know how many people
and demon beasts have perished.

452
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,240
And all of this

453
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,550
is my fault.

454
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,960
If I had obtained
the Dragon's blood earlier,

455
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,430
and opened the Portal

456
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,430
releasing the demon beasts
back to the spirit realm,

457
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,390
humans

458
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:42,240
or demon beasts

459
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,120
wouldn't have died in vain.

460
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,600
I should've made my decision earlier.

461
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,960
What is the pact for?

462
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,790
Once you are tied to me,

463
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,360
you will have to follow my command.

464
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,310
I have already caused her harm once.

465
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,670
Should I hurt her again

466
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,960
like Garuda?

467
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,600
Moreover,

468
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,030
the Dragon's blood...

469
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,080
It's late.

470
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,000
Rest early.

471
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,270
Miss Zhu.

472
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,510
Qing.

473
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,510
How is it?

474
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,550
Does it hurt?

475
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,760
Why not

476
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,390
give me the Dragon's blood?

477
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,310
Chang Qing's appearance
really worked for you.

478
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,310
Bai Ze,

479
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,960
I didn't expect that you actually
have a physical body now.

480
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,640
Chang Qing, Cuiyan

481
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,550
were also led away by you, right?

482
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:32,880
Cuiyan.

483
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,550
You already prepared
the dry grass yesterday.

484
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,150
Why do you still need to get it today?

485
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,390
Mr. Chang Qing,

486
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,600
you clearly said

487
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,310
that I should accompany you
to get the dry grass.

488
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,840
What did you say?

489
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:49,190
You said it.

490
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,190
Mr. Chang Qing.

491
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,190
Mr. Chang Qing.

492
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:56,670
No matter what,

493
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,840
we haven't seen each other
for a long time,

494
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,360
Taotie.

495
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,120
If I remember correctly,

496
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,670
500 years ago,

497
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,790
it was here that you were injured.

498
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,600
Now, I stabbed you once again.

499
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:13,080
Do you feel the cold,
bone-chilling sensation

500
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,960
as your body is pierced through?

501
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,840
But it doesn't matter.

502
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:19,600
As long as you hand over
the Dragon's blood,

503
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,390
this pain can be ended immediately.

504
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,840
Never!

505
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:27,670
Taotie,

506
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,080
you traitor.

507
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,390
You, a beast, are siding with humans.

508
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,120
If not for you,

509
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,790
how could we still be in this world

510
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,120
instead of returning to the spirit realm?

511
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,960
Stop talking.

512
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,670
- Taotie.
- Miss Zhu!

513
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,840
This isn't over between us.

514
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,430
I'll see just how long you can last.

515
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,670
Miss Zhu!

516
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,550
Miss Zhu!

517
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,640
The Lotus Tower cannot fall.

518
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,360
If Black Qilin King comes out,

519
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,310
there will be rivers of blood.

520
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,430
Unless I die,

521
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,760
no one

522
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,190
can take the Dragon's blood.

523
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:31,190
- Miss Zhu.
- Miss Zhu.

524
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:32,550
- Miss Zhu.
- Miss Zhu.

525
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,550
Qing,

526
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,840
please forgive me.

527
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,510
Miss Zhu.

528
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:47,880
Don't get up yet.

529
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,310
Your injuries are serious.

530
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,550
Rest well.

531
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,510
Where are we going?

532
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:55,030
Father has ordered me

533
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,120
to take you to the palace.

534
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,310
Zhao Ai is in charge of
the Garuda Army on the front line.

535
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,360
He is young and brave.

536
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,270
You can rest assured.

537
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:05,990
What about Qing?

538
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,200
This isn't over between us.

539
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,310
I'll see just how long you can last.

540
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:13,710
- Miss Zhu.
- Miss Zhu.

541
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,750
- Miss Zhu.
- Miss Zhu.

542
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,270
Where is Qing?

543
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:17,640
Miss Zhu.

544
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,360
- Where is Qing?
- Calm down.

545
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:18,990
Don't panic.

546
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,360
Tell me.

547
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,470
Did Qing leave alone again?

548
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,600
While you were unconscious,

549
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,440
Garuda grew weaker.

550
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,230
Mr. Chang had no choice
but to take Garuda

551
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,080
and head to Bei Di

552
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,080
to find the real
Nine-section Dragon Marrow.

553
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,880
You let him go to Bei Di alone?

554
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:40,440
Don't worry.

555
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,920
I sent Xu Ruoxu and Yuan along with him.

556
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,840
They know the situation in Bei Di better.

557
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:46,950
No.

558
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,710
I still have to go find him.

559
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,230
Miss Zhu.

560
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,750
I don't know

561
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,030
what happened between you two,

562
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,360
but since Mr. Chang

563
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,920
chose to leave
while you were unconscious,

564
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,790
he must have his reasons.

565
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,640
He must have his reasons?

566
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:11,790
Don't worry about it.

567
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,510
Come with me back to Yunlong

568
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,790
and rest well.

569
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,070
After you've recovered,
if you want to find him,

570
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,270
I won't stop you.

571
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,480
He must have his reasons.

572
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,310
He must have his reasons.

573
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:59,120
[General's Residence]

574
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,200
Yuan has been inside for an hour, right?

575
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,030
Don't worry.

576
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,590
Yuan just went in to scout.

577
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,350
He'll be fine.

578
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:18,310
Your Highness,

579
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,830
at the current speed,

580
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,400
we'll reach Yunlong by tomorrow.

581
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,310
I wonder how things are
on Xu Ruoxu's side.

582
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,440
Your Highness,

583
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,590
there's been no news yet.

584
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,240
I hope everything goes smoothly.

585
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:36,640
Your Highness,

586
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:37,640
regarding Garuda,

587
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:38,750
His Majesty's anger hasn't dissipated.

588
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,160
He urgently summoned you
and Miss Zhu to the palace.

589
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,070
I wonder what it's for.

590
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,310
I'm really worried about you.

591
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,240
I'm worried too.

592
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:50,790
Your Highness,

593
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,550
your health also worries me greatly.

594
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:53,480
The Second Prince is not here.

595
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,310
You must be extra careful

596
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,510
in the palace tomorrow.

597
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:11,200
Your Highness,

598
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,350
you are still young,

599
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,550
and your health is fragile.

600
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,590
Standing here in the cold wind
may make you sick.

601
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,200
If His Majesty finds out,

602
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,440
he will blame me.

603
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,550
You should return to the palace with me.

604
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,200
No.

605
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,960
I want to wait for my brother here.

606
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,720
The Second Prince
is not returning today.

607
00:38:26,830 --> 00:38:29,550
The Prince of Langya
is summoned back to the palace.

608
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:31,030
Prince of Langya?

609
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,400
Is he the elder brother
that Ai often mentions?

610
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:36,070
Look,

611
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,590
your brother is here.

612
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,480
Greetings, Your Highness.

613
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:15,400
Stand up.

614
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

615
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,960
Are you also my elder brother?

616
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,550
Will you play with me and protect me

617
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,750
like Ai does?

618
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,400
Zhao Ai,

619
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:30,680
look at this.

620
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:32,480
Eat quickly.

621
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,790
I took it from the Imperial Kitchen.

622
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:41,880
As a prince

623
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,720
born in this luxurious palace,

624
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,830
are you afraid?

625
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,440
Remember,

626
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,350
don't let anyone see your tears.

627
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:06,590
But today is an exception.

628
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:11,440
Because today, I will take care of you.

629
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,400
As long as I have food to eat,

630
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:16,990
you will have your share.

631
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,440
This

632
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,550
is brotherhood.

633
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:23,400
You haven't said yet

634
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,680
whether you'll play with me.

635
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,920
Be good.

636
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,160
Don't worry.

637
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,960
I will take care of you.

638
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,480
Thank you, Brother.

639
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,510
Prince of Langya has arrived.

640
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:46,640
Come.

641
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,160
Okay.

642
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,200
Qu.

643
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,030
Father.

644
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,030
Qu.

645
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:53,480
Come here, come here.

646
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:53,960
Father.

647
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,480
Father, hold me.

648
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,920
Come here, Qu.

649
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,480
I missed you so much.

650
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:02,590
Come here.

651
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:04,720
Let me hold you.

652
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,160
Let me see.

653
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,160
Good.

654
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:09,310
Good.

655
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,480
Tell me,

656
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,480
how did you come here with him?

657
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:15,680
Father,

658
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:18,720
I heard that my brother has arrived.

659
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,270
I went to greet him.

660
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,120
You are truly my good child.

661
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,440
You know the etiquette.

662
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,120
I will reward you well.

663
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,440
Say it,

664
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,200
what do you want?

665
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,270
At the previous parade,

666
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,070
your carriage had a dragon.

667
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:36,350
It was so fun.

668
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:38,030
I also want to ride it.

669
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,030
Okay.

670
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,270
Then in the future,

671
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,350
you will ride
in the same carriage with me.

672
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,720
Thank you, Father.

673
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,120
Good child.

674
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:47,880
But now you

675
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,120
must honestly tell me

676
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,120
if you've been listening to the teacher

677
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,480
and studying well.

678
00:41:55,510 --> 00:41:57,400
Qu's been very good lately.

679
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,030
He goes to study with the teacher
on time every day.

680
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,270
Even the teacher said

681
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,510
he does his homework well.

682
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,350
Good.

683
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,120
You're my good boy.

684
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:13,350
Your Majesty, you really
dote on the Third Prince.

685
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,400
Even the people praise you're

686
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:18,750
a wise ruler who loves the people
as your own children.

687
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,120
I have business to attend to.

688
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,070
Will you go play by yourself?

689
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,920
Father, thank you.

690
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,120
Go.

691
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:27,960
Let's go.

692
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,350
Step back.

693
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,240
Yes.

694
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,270
Zhao Heng,

695
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:41,680
you stay.

696
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:45,350
Congratulations, Mr. Wu.

697
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,070
The Third Prince
is intelligent and wise.

698
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:48,590
He is deeply favored by His Majesty.

699
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,830
In the harem,

700
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,960
Noble Consort Wu is the most favored.

701
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:53,720
I believe your grandson

702
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:55,440
will soon be named the Crown Prince.

703
00:42:56,030 --> 00:42:57,880
I agree.

704
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,480
Riding in the dragon carriage
with His Majesty

705
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,480
is a great reward.

706
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,590
No, no.

707
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,830
Do not speak such reckless words,

708
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:08,640
sirs.

709
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:10,680
Yes.

710
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:14,070
However, His Majesty
has never liked Prince of Langya.

711
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,920
But this time,
he has summoned him alone.

712
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,720
I wonder what that means.

713
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:21,200
Father.

714
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,240
Ai is overseeing the battlefront.

715
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:24,350
The war is stable.

716
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,960
Please rest assured, Father.

717
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:28,880
Rise.

718
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,400
Thank you, Father.

719
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:38,960
I heard you have brought
the world's number one chef,

720
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,720
Miss Zhu from Tianxiang Restaurant,

721
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,960
back to Yunlong.

722
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,550
Why didn't you come with her?

723
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,400
Father, forgive me.

724
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:48,750
Miss Zhu is unwell,

725
00:43:48,990 --> 00:43:50,310
so I took it upon myself

726
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:52,070
to send her back to rest.

727
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:54,830
I heard

728
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:58,240
she is the incarnation
of the demon beast Taotie.

729
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:03,880
Father,

730
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:05,160
though she is a demon beast,

731
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,920
she saved all the people

732
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:08,790
of Wuxia City from flooding.

733
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:10,880
She also fought bravely
on the battlefield this time.

734
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:12,990
I hope you will show mercy

735
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,680
and don't hold her identity against her.

736
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:15,960
Rest assured.

737
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,310
Not only will I not punish her,

738
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:19,750
on the contrary,

739
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,120
I will reward her generously.
