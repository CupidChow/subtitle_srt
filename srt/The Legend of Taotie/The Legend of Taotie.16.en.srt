Greetings, Your Highness.

69
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,270
Have you found out who did it?

70
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,320
Your Highness,

71
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:26,110
there's no need to investigate.

72
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,880
What do you mean?

73
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,550
Your Highness, forgive me.

74
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,440
It was I who did it.

75
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,790
You?

76
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:58,950
I acknowledge my crime.

77
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,320
What are you doing with this umbrella?

78
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,920
I learned that

79
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,670
to find the recipe

80
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:08,440
of Heaven and Earth in Spring,

81
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,320
Mei Sheng died far from home.

82
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,550
He spat blood on this umbrella,

83
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,000
which formed a plum blossom shape.

84
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Then, his soul

85
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
gathered in this Red Plum Umbrella.

86
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,760
I don't want to hear you
talk about Mei Sheng.

87
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,390
Tell me.

88
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,760
Why did you attack Miss Zhu?

89
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,270
I consulted ancient texts

90
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,760
and found this umbrella
is an extraordinary

91
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,550
magical artifact from ancient times.

92
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,480
That's why it could gather
Mei Sheng's soul.

93
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,640
Miss Zhu's illness

94
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,550
is because of the war 500 years ago.

95
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,640
That caused her soul to scatter.

96
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,920
So tonight,
I went to Tianxiang Restaurant

97
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,720
to use this Red Plum Umbrella

98
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,040
to gather Miss Zhu's soul

99
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,830
so that she can recover.

100
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,270
Is this true?

101
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,950
Absolutely true.

102
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,640
Why didn't you report to me

103
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,830
and act on your own?

104
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,040
Because I wasn't sure

105
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,670
how effective this Red Plum Umbrella is.

106
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,230
I dared not report to Your Highness

107
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,790
and could only try it out.

108
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,070
But Miss Zhu had already prepared for it

109
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,790
and was waiting for me to show up.

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,790
To protect myself,

111
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,720
I had no choice but to resist.

112
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:23,830
What about the Dragon Scale Arrow?

She is still very weak.

129
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,280
Be sure to close the doors

00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,400
Buy some marinated quail she likes,

134

phoenix pastry, duck soaked in dew,

135

00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:12,590
Let's go.

192
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:13,760
Alright.

193
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,110
We still can't find it.

194
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:33,080
I'm exhausted.

195
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:21,520
Where is Qing?

196
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,440
I've been awake for so long.

197
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,320
Why haven't I seen him?

198
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,400
Well...

199
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,400
Young Master.

200
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,350
Young Master has...

201
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,590
Young Master has gone home.

202
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,520
Yes, yes, yes.

203
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,440
Young Master has gone home.

204
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,960
He said his sister Li is sick.

205
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,760
He went home to check on her.

206
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,110
Yes.

207
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,000
Li again.

208
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,640
Why do you have to mention Li?

209
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:50,760
Your Highness.

210
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,230
Wan'er.

211
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:07,790
Your Highness.

212
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,640
You're back.

213
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:10,670
Why are you here?

214
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,350
Why aren't you resting at Yunlong?

215
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,440
I'm worried about you,

216
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,150
so I came here.

217
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,080
You don't blame me, right?

218
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,200
I left Yunlong in a hurry

219
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,400
and didn't tell you.

220
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,880
I thought you'd be angry with me.

221
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,640
You traveled day and night
back to Wuxia.

222
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,080
There must be more important matters

223
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,110
than me.

224
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,230
How could I be angry?

225
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,080
Recently, the areas around Wuxia
has been severely affected by disaster.

226
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,230
I'm really worried.

227
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,640
But you

228
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,790
didn't have to travel like this.

229
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,550
You need to rest and recover properly.

230
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,790
A few days ago,
His Majesty went to see me

231
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,110
and asked about the imperial edict
brought back from Wuxia.

232
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,230
I'm not sure

233
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,400
when do you plan
to hold the grand ceremony.

234
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,110
I didn't know how to answer,

235
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,000
so I requested from His Majesty

236
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,590
to come to Wuxia

237
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,880
to discuss this matter with you.

238
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,590
Right now, inside the city,

239
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,040
the disaster is serious

240
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,560
and the people are suffering.

241
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,640
It's inappropriate to talk about

242
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,830
my marriage at this time.

243
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,830
I understand.

244
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,470
I don't know if Miss Zhu

245
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,070
can help you

246
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,640
resolve the drought issue.

247
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,430
As for the disaster,

248
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,350
I will make the decision.

249
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,160
Maid.

250
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,310
Your Highness.

251
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,830
Take good care of Her Grace

252
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,280
and make sure she rests well.

253
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,000
Yes.

254
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,280
Your Highness.

255
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,400
Your Highness.

256
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,680
Her Grace has arrived.

257
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:08,040
Go.

258
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,950
Your Highness.

259
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,640
Didn't I tell you

260
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,110
to rest well at the residence?

261
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,350
Why are you here?

262
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:38,950
I'm fine now.

263
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,400
I thought it was time for lunch,

264
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,000
so I made some food and brought it.

265
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,400
You must be hungry too.

266
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,640
It's all your favorite food.

267
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,230
Smells so good.

268
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,710
What's that, smells so good?

269
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,520
Miss Zhu.

270
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,230
Did you make all this?

271
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:12,760
You...

272
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,680
Are you the Princess
Mingyan often mentions?

273
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,070
Miss Zhu,

274
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,800
just call me Wan'er.

275
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,880
Wan'er.

276
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,310
You're truly beautiful

277
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,470
and your name is also lovely.

278
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,110
Miss Zhu.

279
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,280
How about

280
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,070
you join us for the meal?

281
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:33,470
No.

282
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,590
I want to do it myself.

283
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,310
Your sense haven't fully recovered.

284
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,000
You still need time to recuperate.

285
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,230
Rest well.

286
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:42,710
Heng.

287
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:43,880
Why are you

288
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,400
acting more like Qing now?

289
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,350
So naggy.

290
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,070
I'm doing it myself today.

291
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,040
No one can stop me.

292
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:50,830
Fine.

293
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:51,950
I won't stop you.

294
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,400
Can I at least help you?

295
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,070
No.

296
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:55,590
If you help me in the wrong way,

297
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,710
I won't be able to eat.

298
00:20:59,070 --> 00:20:59,760
Miss Zhu.

299
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:01,520
If you don't mind,

300
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,400
why not let me help you?

301
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:08,950
Sure.

302
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,590
Stone.

303
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:47,920
Miss.

304
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,070
How come you're down here?

305
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,160
I just finished
making the green dumplings.

306
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,190
I was going to bring them to you.

307
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,640
I'm much better.

308
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:53,520
How about you?

309
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,560
How's your health?

310
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,280
I'm all good now.

311
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,040
Miss,

312
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,760
I'd like to discuss something with you.

313
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,950
I want to go back to live in my own shop.

314
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,680
Is there something wrong

315
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,110
with my Tianxiang Restaurant?

316
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:06,710
No, no, no.

317
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,000
Everything here is great.

318
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,560
But my master's memorial tablet

319
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,590
is still in the shop.

320
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,230
I miss my master.

321
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,590
Alright.

322
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,190
Go back if you want to.

323
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,400
But remember,

324
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,880
you need to make green dumplings
for me every day.

325
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,000
No slacking off.

326
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,640
Thank you, Miss.

327
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,400
Thank you, Miss.

328
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:23,830
Then

329
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,710
I'll go back now.

330
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,830
Wan'er, right?

331
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,800
I've heard His Highness mention

332
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,520
your cooking is outstanding.

333
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,190
Everything you make is delicious.

334
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:41,710
His Highness especially likes it.

335
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,070
So this time,

336
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,160
I want to ask you
to teach me a few tricks.

337
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,470
Since you sincerely want to learn,

338
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,640
I'll teach you a few tricks.

339
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,400
[Residence of the Prince of Langya]

340
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,350
It smells so good.

341
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:04,040
The fresh flavor
of the pigeon is coming through.

342
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,310
It really smells good.

343
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:07,760
Her Grace's cooking skills
are really good.

344
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,400
Yes.

345
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:17,800
It's definitely good.

346
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,280
The taste is not bad.

347
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,520
Lian, Lian.

348
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,760
Come try it quickly.

349
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:28,830
It really tastes good.

350
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,640
Hope His Highness likes it too

351
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,760
[Residence of the Prince of Langya]

352
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,430
Your Highness.

353
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,000
Your Highness.

354
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,230
You're back so late.

355
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:08,760
You must be tired.

356
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,560
Why haven't you rested yet?

357
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,710
You've been waiting until now?

358
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:13,640
It's fine.

359
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,880
Your Highness,

360
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,830
it's so late.

361
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:16,950
Are you hungry?

362
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,470
Today I specially made you

363
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,560
bird's nest and pigeon soup.

364
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,800
Try it.

365
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,000
Lian.

366
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,230
Try it.

367
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,160
Not bad.

368
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,830
Thank you, Your Grace.

369
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,110
I'm glad you like it.

370
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,280
Maybe my cooking

371
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,310
is not as good as Miss Zhu's.

372
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,880
I'm tired.

373
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,160
You've been busy all day too.

374
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
It's better to rest early.

375
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,230
Okay.

376
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,800
I'll take my leave.

377
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,310
You should rest early too.

378
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,310
I told you to rest properly

379
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,960
and don't cook by yourself.

380
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,760
Why didn't you listen?

381
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,360
How many days have I rested?

382
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,190
It's time to move my muscles a bit.

383
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,150
Alright.

384
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,550
Miss Zhu worked hard to cook.

385
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:38,000
I'll enjoy the food.

386
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,030
Wan'er.

387
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,520
Wan'er, you're here.

388
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:50,390
Yingtao,

389
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,240
add another pair of chopsticks.

390
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:51,670
Yes.

391
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:56,790
Your Grace.

392
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,480
You came just in time.

393
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,430
We can eat together.

394
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,430
These past few days,

395
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,760
I don't know what's wrong with them.

396
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,880
They just don't like my cooking.

397
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,720
I thought my cooking skills
were the problem.

398
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:06,960
You try it.

399
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,070
Thank you, Miss Zhu.

400
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:20,880
Try it and see how's the taste.

401
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:22,430
Okay.

402
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:37,360
The taste of this dish

403
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,550
tastes so strange.

404
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,150
How is it?

405
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,360
Miss Zhu,

406
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,000
this dish tastes great.

407
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,150
Look.

408
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,190
I told you my cooking skills are fine.

409
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:16,960
If it's delicious, eat more.

410
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:18,120
Heng, eat more.

411
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,070
Okay.

412
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,640
Heng.

413
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:23,600
Look,

414
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,480
I've been eating

415
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,840
the green dumplings made by Stone.

416
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,070
My health has improved a lot.

417
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:27,600
Can I

418
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,430
stop using that?

419
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:30,880
Of course not.

420
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,270
Your priority now

421
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:35,070
is to take care of your health.

422
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,000
But I'm already feeling much better.

423
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,960
Hurry up and eat more.

424
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,760
Your Grace.

425
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:07,720
Your Grace.

426
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:10,360
Your Grace.

427
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,240
What's wrong with you?

428
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:14,790
Why are you crying?

429
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,720
Why are you sitting on the floor?

430
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,270
Lian.

431
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,310
Tell me.

432
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,240
What should I do?

433
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,390
What should I really do?

434
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,670
Lian.

435
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,120
What should I do?

436
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,960
I really want to leave here.

437
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,240
Your Grace.

438
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,840
No matter where you go,

439
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,670
I will be with you.

440
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:50,120
But

441
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,310
after leaving here,

442
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:55,830
can you really let go of His Highness?

443
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,310
Now my time is almost up.

444
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,230
But don't worry.

445
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,280
About this tower

446
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:41,880
and this city,

447
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,280
I will keep my promise to you

448
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,950
and protect them well.

449
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,430
The dragon's blood you entrusted to me

450
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,430
will also dissipate

451
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:57,400
with my soul.

452
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,640
This Portal

453
00:31:01,350 --> 00:31:03,040
will never be opened by anyone again.

454
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,590
But why didn't you fulfill

455
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:11,760
all the promises you made me?

456
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,560
We've agreed

457
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:19,680
to travel and enjoy the world together.

458
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,310
Now

459
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,830
I've trapped in this Lotus Tower alone

460
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,520
for 500 years.

461
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,280
Lotus,

462
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,830
do you want to see me again?

463
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,920
You've been lying to me.

464
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,640
I clearly got the prescription,

465
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,950
why can't I still make
Heaven and Earth in Spring?

466
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,830
Miss Ji,

467
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,710
what's wrong with you?

468
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,590
Disciple,

469
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,070
it's not about the prescription.

470
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,190
It's about the person.

471
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:02,830
I've said it before

472
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,430
only your junior brother

473
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,710
can make Heaven and Earth in Spring.

474
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,230
The hands.

475
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,400
It must be those hands.

476
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,880
It must be the hands.

477
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:20,710
I will chop off those hands.

478
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,560
I will chop off those hands.

479
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,280
He can't have what I don't have.

480
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,000
Miss Ji, calm down.

481
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,230
I've been in the martial world
for many years.

482
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:32,560
Maybe

483
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,470
I might help you fulfill your wish.

484
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,080
[Tablet of Master Min]

485
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,280
Stone.

486
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,160
If you lose your hands,

487
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,160
I'll see how you can surpass me.

488
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,720
[Pastry]

489
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,350
This should be the place.

490
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:42,950
Look.

491
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,310
Young boy,

492
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,470
His Highness asked us
to take the green dumplings.

493
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:47,830
Young boy.

494
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,430
Young boy.

495
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,560
Young boy.

496
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:51,640
Young boy.

497
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:02,160
[Residence of the Prince of Langya]

498
00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:27,430
How are you, Stone?

499
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:29,430
Without my hands,

500
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,670
I can't make
Heaven and Earth in Spring anymore.

501
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,390
Don't worry.

502
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,080
I'll take care of everything.

503
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,520
I'll find a way

504
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,080
to make you get better.

505
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,430
Really?

506
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,840
Rest well

507
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:51,910
and relax.

508
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,560
I don't care what method you use,

509
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,230
you must get it done for me.

510
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,120
Don't worry, Your Highness.

511
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,190
Otherwise, I'll hold you accountable.

512
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,520
Everyone,

513
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,190
I have something to ask.

514
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,230
You can speak beast language?

515
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,360
You are Mr. Chang Qing?

516
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,040
It's me.

517
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,080
Mr. Chang Qing,

518
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,950
did you perhaps
find the way back home for us?

519
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,040
I...

520
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,430
I haven't found it yet.

521
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,430
I came

522
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,280
to ask for your help.

523
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:06,950
I wonder if you're willing.

524
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,800
Please speak, Mr. Chang.

525
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,360
I have a friend whose life is in danger.

526
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,800
Only...

527
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,390
Only by making your horn into medicine

528
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,320
can she survive.

529
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,430
Do you know

530
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:25,470
if I lose a horn, I will die?

531
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,190
My friend is in imminent danger.

532
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,000
If I don't save her,

533
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,910
I won't be able to get the Portal.

534
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,840
Take it, Mr. Chang.

535
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,910
Please keep your promise.

536
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,120
I lied.

537
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,390
Even if I save her,

538
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:18,600
I may still not be able to do it.

539
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:25,950
I'm sorry.

540
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,710
Father, Mother.

Help!

00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,950
- Brother!
- Son!

00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,080
Bai Ze.

550
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:11,470
I promise you

551
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,760
I will take them home.

552
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,430
Take them home.

553
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,760
Go to Tianxiang Restaurant
to find Taotie

554
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,630

Eat.

556
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,320
Is it delicious?

please keep your promise.

560
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,950
Even if there's a glimmer of hope,

561
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,800
I'm willing to try.

562
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,760
