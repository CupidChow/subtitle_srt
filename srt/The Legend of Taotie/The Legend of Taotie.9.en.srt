[The Legend of TAOTIE]

25
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,100
[Episode 9]

26
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,880
Your Highness.

27
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,240
Over ten pearlers searched in the deep ocean

28
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,550
for a half year

29
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,660
and find this precious pearl.

30
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,880
With this jewelry,

31
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,240
it looks nobler.

32
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,470
Not bad.

33
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,320
What a big pearl.

34
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,520
It looks like a rare thing

35
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,550
in the deep sea.

36
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,600
It must be delicious.

37
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,360
Heng.

38
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,830
Do you remember last time I told you

39
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,830
that I wanted to make a good dish,

40
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:56,960
and I needed to grind a deep-sea pearl
into powder.

41
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,550
You're considerate.

42
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,190
Miss Zhu.

43
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,910
This is what His Highness wants to…

44
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,470
Mingyan!

45
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,160
Sorry, Miss Zhu.

46
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,110
I will have this pearl.

47
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,520
You don't want to give it to me?

48
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,190
Then let me buy it.

49
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,160
Yes.

50
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,520
Wrap it up for us.

51
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,670
This is the only one.

52
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,470
His Highness arrives first.

53
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:29,520
Miss Zhu.

54
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:31,190
I wanted to sell it to you.

55
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:31,910
But…

56
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,550
Miss Zhu.

57
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,000
If you want to cook with pearl powder,

58
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,240
I can find you good pearl from Southern Sea.

59
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,030
No.

60
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:40,750
I just like this one.

61
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,440
This one must be delicious.

62
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,000
Miss Zhu.

63
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,520
Anyway, you are going to use it for grinding.

64
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,390
What's the difference?

65
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,360
This is a gift prepared by His Highness.

66
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,110
Mingyan!

67
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,390
Prepared by His Highness?

68
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,750
That must be a very important person.

69
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,830
The Prince of Langya chooses the gift by himself.

70
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:58,390
Is it

71
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,470
for your sweetheart?

72
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,520
Zhao.

73
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,360
In the future,

74
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,630
don't come to my Tianxiang Restaurant
for food anymore!

75
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,520
Let's go.

76
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,270
The same to you!

77
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:15,910
I…

78
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,720
Look.

79
00:04:59,110 --> 00:04:59,760
Look at this sedan chair.

80
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,640
How extraordinary!

81
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,760
What a beautiful sedan chair.

82
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,270
It must be from a rich family.

83
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,670
Lian.

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,920
Are we arrived?

85
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,720
We have arrived at Wuxia.

86
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,510
So,

87
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,480
this is his city.

88
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,760
Your Highness.

89
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,760
Your Grace, it must be a tiring trip.

90
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,350
Hard work for you.

91
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,320
Thank you for your concern, Your Highness.

92
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,390
What are you looking at, Your Highness?

93
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,830
I thought there was the honor guard
of the father behind.

94
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:30,550
Did you come alone?

95
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,040
The emperor has recently…

96
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,640
Forget it.

97
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,270
Come in and let's talk later.

98
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,270
Your Highness…

99
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,070
Your Grace.

100
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,270
Come in, please.

101
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:02,830
Your Grace.

102
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,350
Did you tell my father about the birthday banquet?

103
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,920
His Majesty…

104
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,040
He still doesn't want to come to Wuxia.

105
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,510
You're new to Wuxia.

106
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,110
His Majesty certainly doesn't want

107
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,760
you to work too hard.

108
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,760
In a few days,

109
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,600
we can go back to Yunlong together

110
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,670
to congratulate His Majesty on his birthday.

111
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,350
Isn't it also good?

112
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,040
Mingyan.

113
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,070
Thank you this time, Your Grace.

114
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,830
This gift is too expensive.

115
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,440
I dare not accept it.

116
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,480
Never mind.

117
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,950
About my father…

118
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,670
Please do me a favor.

119
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:54,920
By the way,

120
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,510
His Majesty also let me give you

121
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:57,670
a handwritten order.

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,880
A handwritten order?

123
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,070
Your Highness.

124
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,760
His Majesty said

125
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,920
this is a letter from a father.

126
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,040
You don't have to kneel down to receive the order.

127
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:20,880
Heng.

128
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,600
You and the Princess were engaged
when you were little.

129
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,200
This time she came to Wuxia,

130
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,270
you need to discuss the marriage date with her

131
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,830
and finish it.

132
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,350
The end.

133
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,470
Your Highness.

134
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,790
His Majesty asked me to…

135
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:38,280
Your Grace.

136
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,590
You must feel tired all the way here.

137
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,200
Have a good rest first.

138
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,110
I have to deal with the official business
of the Inspection Department.

139
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,590
Your Highness.

140
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,710
Yes, Your Highness.

141
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,420
[Langya Prefecture]

142
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,840
Your Highness,

143
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,030
why are you drinking alone here?

144
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,230
It's so late.

145
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,640
Why haven't you rested yet?

146
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,080
I haven't seen you for a long time.

147
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,840
I am very worried.

148
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,400
Your Highness is so upset tonight.

149
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,710
Let me accompany you.

150
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,910
This is the good sandalwood I brought from Yunlong.

151
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,280
It soothes body, nourishes spirit

152
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,080
calms the nerves and helps sleep.

153
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,440
Your Highness.

154
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,440
What day is it today?

155
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:13,470
Today's 14th.

156
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,710
It's 15th tomorrow.

157
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,080
Your Highness!

158
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,080
If Your Grace is tired,

159
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:34,790
take a rest first.

160
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,080
Your Highness.

161
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,790
Are you still trying to help him escape?

162
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,470
Can't I escape myself?

163
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,880
Okay, Qing.

164
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,670
You still owe me 300 taels of silver.

165
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,960
Give me my “Bai Ze's Supernatural Creatures”.

166
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,080
These are two different things.

167
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,230
How can you say so?

168
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,960
Cuiyan, Yingtao!

169
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:23,030
Catch the thief!

170
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:24,350
Catch the thief?

171
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,000
Thief?

172
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,470
Catch the thief?

173
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,000
Where's the thief?

174
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,550
Come out!

175
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,320
Where's the thief?

176
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:31,760
Miss Zhu?

177
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,750
Where's the thief?

178
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,550
Where? Where?

179
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,230
Here.

180
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,670
It's Mister.

181
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,550
What's wrong

182
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,230
with your disappointed expression?

183
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:45,840
Miss Zhu.

184
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,000
Come on. Such an important thing was stolen.

185
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,080
The thief must be strong, capable…

186
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,710
- and…
- Yeah.

187
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,080
He must be a strong man!

188
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,470
As tall as a tower!

189
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:54,150
Exactly.

190
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,710
Am I so indecent

191
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:57,520
and weak in your heart?

192
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,790
Not even qualified to be a thief?

193
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,840
It's you!

194
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,110
You admitted it!

195
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:04,840
No!

196
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
I was tricked by you.

197
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,760
I didn't steal

198
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,760
the “Bai Ze's Supernatural Creatures” at all.

199
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,080
He just admitted it, right?

200
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,960
Yes.

201
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,000
He just said it was him.

202
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,080
Mister said it himself.

203
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,400
I have no reason for you.

204
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,840
What's so exciting?

205
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,550
Isn't this the Prince of Langya?

206
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,960
I told you not to come to my Tianxiang Restaurant for food anymore.

207
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,080
I'm here not for food.

208
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,840
It's like many years have passed away

209
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,110
when separating from Miss Zhu.

210
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,640
Unconsciously, I came to Tianxiang Restaurant.

211
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,320
Please don't mind it.

212
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,670
Why hasn't His Highness stayed up so late?

213
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,710
Miss Zhu is still angry about the pearl,

214
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,470
right?

215
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,320
See?

216
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,320
I am here to apologize.

217
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,590
Apologize?

218
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,590
Is it Fenghe Restaurant's plum wine?

219
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,200
This plum wine is strong.

220
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,080
You should drink less.

221
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,320
He didn't invite you to drink.

222
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,640
Only knowing each other from childhood

223
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,230
can have such a taste.

224
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,960
Your Highness, did you bring this pot of wine

225
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,710
just for

226
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,150
the sweetheart that you want to give the pearl to?

227
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,710
Although Miss Zhu is clever,

228
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,230
this time you guess wrong.

229
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,000
In the afternoon, you were still stingy
to argue with me.

230
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,550
Now at night,

231
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,840
why do you deliver it to me yourself?

232
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,470
What you like

233
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:49,280
will be given to you by myself only.

234
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,000
It's just not at the market

235
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,400
and in front of those vulgar people.

236
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,080
Now, here

237
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,910
with this view,

238
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,840
I think it's the best.

239
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,550
Heng, you are good at sweet-talking.

240
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,670
However,

241
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,110
you came to Tianxiang Restaurant
in the middle of the night.

242
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,520
It should be more than just sending the pearl.

243
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,590
All right.

244
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,470
Let me ask you.

245
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,440
What if you have a person you love deeply,

246
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,470
in order to gain his love,

247
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,590
you have to pay everything,

248
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,200
even by all means.

249
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:35,440
Do you think it's worth it?

250
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,590
Maybe everyone

251
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,760
has such a person in his heart

252
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
that it's worthwhile.

253
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,400
When drinking with a bosom friend,
a thousand cups are not enough.

254
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:06,880
Come on.

255
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,680
Your Highness.

256
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,750
Don't be distracted by these trivial matters.

257
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,880
You look so haggard.

258
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,830
I'm afraid you think too much

259
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,520
and don't sleep well.

260
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,590
Are you drunk?

261
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,950
Your eyes are so blurred.

262
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:19,040
I…

263
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,920
I have drunk countless good wines.

264
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,000
Unexpectedly,

265
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,710
I was drunk in the aroma of plum wine.

266
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,040
This is the good sandalwood I brought

267
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,590
from Yunlong.

268
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,880
Plum wine is good.

269
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,520
But

270
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,350
it's far inferior to my peach blossom wine.

271
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,470
I'm a little drunk.

272
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,110
I won't bother you anymore.

273
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:00,800
Good bye.

274
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,350
Were you drinking?

275
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,230
Mr. Chang is also sleepy.

276
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,680
You leaned against the door and fell asleep.

277
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:34,830
Good bye.

278
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,110
I don't know what the Prince of Langya
is thinking.

279
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,110
He came to give you the pearl
in the middle of the night.

280
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,280
You said you didn't eavesdrop at the door.

281
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,230
I was afraid…

282
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,400
What?

283
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,640
There are only a few left.

284
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,230
I don't know what happened

285
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,040
to Xu Ruoxu.

286
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,310
I quite miss him.

287
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,280
Don't divert my attention.

288
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,350
You drank wine.

289
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,310
You can't sleep well when you are hungry.

290
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:15,070
That's why I cooked some small wonton for you.

291
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm talking about eavesdropping.

292
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,310
I heard that the Princess arrived in Wuxia today

293
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,470
and lived in Langya Prefecture.

294
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,350
He came to drink with you

295
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:31,230
at this time.

296
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,920
I always think it's a little strange.

297
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,110
What's strange?

298
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,760
I'm also worried about you being cheated by him.

299
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,310
He is not only noble and brave,

300
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,800
but also willing to condescend
to give you the pearl.

301
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,040
But I always feel uneasy.

302
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,350
Last time at Merman Feast,

303
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:46,310
He disappeared without reason,

304
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,230
and the bodyguard around him died strangely.

305
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,710
What's so strange?

306
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:50,950
Are you afraid

307
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,710
that a Prince

308
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,590
would kill the bodyguard?

309
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,040
It's possible.

310
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,350
You're getting ridiculous.

311
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,470
Qing.

312
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,640
It's all your own speculation.

313
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,000
And anyway,

314
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,920
if anyone dared to cheat me,

315
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,160
I would swallow him in one gulp.

316
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,880
You've been here for a long time.

317
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,160
Year after year, day after day.

318
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,310
Life is like this every day.

319
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,230
Being lonely for a long time,

320
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,760
even if someone comes to cheat you,

321
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,590
it may feel good.

322
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:19,800
I'm afraid

323
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,640
you are bored because of loneliness

324
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,070
and willing to be cheated by others.

325
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,040
Maybe it will be more interesting

326
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,920
and better at the moment,

327
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,400
but it's you

328
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,640
who will get hurt in the end.

329
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,000
And what about you?

330
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,000
Are you also coming to cheat me?

331
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,560
Guess

332
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,190
if I'm willing to be cheated by you?

333
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,280
You know I know

334
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,950
you know I'm not lying to you.

335
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,950
Qing, what are you talking about?

336
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:00,640
It's burnt!

337
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,110
Oh no.

338
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,310
How can I have a different feeling

339
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,430
for Qing?

340
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,190
Very familiar.

341
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,110
And very uneasy.

342
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,560
What happened?

343
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,160
Mother.

344
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:54,190
Ping.

345
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,560
Why is Ruifang not home today?

346
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:57,680
She…

347
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,830
She may have gone shopping.

348
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,070
Did she instigate you to leave me?

349
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,110
Mother.

350
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,800
I won't leave.

351
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,350
Please don't punish her.

352
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,430
Ping.

353
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,680
You are my lifeblood.

354
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,400
I can't eat or sleep

355
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:24,920
until I see you.

356
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,760
The world is so dangerous.

357
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,110
How can I let you go out?

358
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,520
Mother.

359
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,350
Are you really caring about my safety

360
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,430
so that you don't let me go out?

361
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,040
Kneel down.

362
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,640
You are the head of the Zhou family.

363
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,430
How can you be so wayward?

364
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,760
It seems that you have grown up.

365
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:05,280
You're able to do things independently.

366
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,000
How dare you disobey your mother like this!

367
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,800
I dare not.

368
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:08,920
I dare not.

369
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,400
In front of your father,

370
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,230
tell me.

371
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,400
Who used this hand

372
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,230
to save you from the tiger?

373
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:18,920
Say it!

374
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,280
It's you.

375
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,640
Ping. I know

376
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,070
Sufen's going

377
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:32,310
made you unhappy all the time.

378
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,560
You can't let these things go.

379
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,590
But even if you run away,

00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,360
can use such things.

571
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,190
Maybe there is no such person in Wuxia.

572
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,080
I wonder if Mr. Lu

573
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:17,190
can let me check the file

574
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,840
about this ice silk.

575
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:19,560
I want to know more about…

576
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,470
This is the secret file
of the Inspection Department.

577
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,800
Outsiders have no right to check.

578
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,000
Then can I…

579
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,840
I can't help you.

580
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,040
Mr. Chang, please go back.

581
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:30,390
Report!

582
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:32,360
Mr. Lu.

583
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:32,800
What happened?

584
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,040
The archer reported that

585
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,760
there was a dead woman in the city.

586
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,560
The body looks terrible.

587
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,950
According to observers,

588
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,120
it looks like Gao Ruifang, the Young Lady of the Zhou family.

589
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,560
The coroner has checked the corpse.

590
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:43,390
It's said that it was both like the attack of raptor

591
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,390
and the act of beast.

592
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,120
Beast?

593
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,950
Young Lady of Zhou Family?

594
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:51,840
Show me the way.

595
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,320
Yes!

596
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,040
Let's go!

597
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,840
Everyone, assemble!

598
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,080
What's the matter?

599
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,710
I don't know.

600
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,190
It is said that it is Young Lady of the Zhou family.

601
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:01,840
Zhou Family?

602
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:04,190
Look.

603
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,840
It's too bad.

604
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,230
When did the woman die?

605
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:10,120
According to the autopsy results from the coroner,

606
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,360
she was attacked around midnight last night.

607
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,950
Look at her. How miserable.

608
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:21,120
Yeah.

609
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,800
I know her.

610
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,390
She is the Young Lady of the Zhou family.

611
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,470
Young Lady of Zhou Family?

612
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,840
Miss Zhu.

613
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,320
Miss Zhu!

614
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,360
Miss Zhu!

615
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,800
How many times have I told you?

616
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,560
Don't try to help Zhou Guangping escape.

617
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,120
Look.

618
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,910
It happened.

619
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,910
I went to Sijing Garden yesterday
to find Mr. Zhou.

620
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,320
But I didn't see him.

621
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,120
I also thought about your words

622
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,630
and tried to persuade him to take a long-term view.

623
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:04,000
You are doing the opposite.

624
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,520
Persuasion failed but trouble is made.

625
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,560
You mean that

626
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,430
the death of the Young Lady of Zhou family was not an accident?

627
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,000
How can there be

628
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,360
so many coincidences

629
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,760
and accidents in the world?

630
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,760
Just now, I saw that the blood marks on the body

631
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,800
seemed to be left by wild animals.

632
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,120
What kind of animal do you think?

633
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,670
Maybe it's a wild leopard,

634
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,040
a leopard cat, or a mandrill?

635
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,190
Do you think it's like a white tiger?

636
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,430
White tiger?

637
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,320
Yeah.

638
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:33,430
That's

639
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,950
a bit like a tiger's paw.

640
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,630
But where did the white tiger come from?

641
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,280
What's the relationship between this white tiger

642
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,710
and Mr. Zhou?

643
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,430
Miss Zhu, where are you going?

644
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,120
Sijing Garden.

645
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:45,320
Sijing Garden?

646
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,670
Can you tell me clearly before leaving?

647
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,080
Let me go.

648
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,710
Where are you going?

649
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:55,760
Sijing Garden is over there.

650
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,710
Go back to Tianxiang Restaurant.

651
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,600
After this kind of thing happened,

652
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,360
she would come to me if I don't.

653
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,950
Come and have a look.

654
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,540
[Zhu]

655
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,080
You do come.

656
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,320
Excuse me.

657
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,560
Who's this madam?

658
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,120
Mr. Zhou's mother.

659
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,280
Madam Zhou.

660
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,120
You are Mister Chang.

661
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,150
My son came to see you a few days ago.

662
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:57,470
We drank some wine,

663
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,760
talked about painting and we were happy.

664
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,080
Is it just as simple as painting?

665
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,760
He's just my accountant.

666
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,800
He likes painting in daily life.

667
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,520
It is rare to meet like-minded people.

668
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:10,470
Madam Zhou.

669
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,560
Is there anything wrong with it?

670
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,430
I have long heard that

671
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,120
a good pen makes Mr. Chang a beautiful boy.

672
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,000
A kind and simple person like my son,

673
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,520
if he makes friends with you,

674
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:25,040
I'm afraid he will catch some bad habits.

675
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,840
Sounds like we teach people something bad.

676
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:31,670
Can we also

677
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,320
instigate Mr. Zhou to kill people

678
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,600
in the downtown area?

679
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:40,600
Of course not.

680
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,390
Madam Zhou.

681
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,230
Today the Inspection Department

682
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,150
found a dead woman in the downtown area.

683
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,710
It is said that it is Young Lady from Sijing Garden.

684
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,430
Madam Zhou, do you know this?

685
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,320
Ruifang is dead?

686
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,600
Your daughter-in-law was dead

687
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,150
and Madam Zhou is not moved at all.

688
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:17,040
It's really against nature and human relations.

689
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,040
I wonder

690
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,670
if you have already known it all.

691
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,910
No matter I have already known it or not,

692
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:31,150
she's dead.

693
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,590
No matter how I cry

694
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:34,840
and feel pain,

695
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,560
there's nothing I can do.

696
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,080
Don't go too far in everything.

697
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,430
After all,

698
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,390
it is a human life.

699
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:51,840
Miss Zhu.

700
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:53,710
Can we go inside and talk?

701
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,080
Please.

702
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,710
The last time I helped you cook this dish,

703
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,230
because I felt excited

704
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,630
and the ingredients were rare.

705
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:21,630
But I can't help you

706
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:23,630
for free all the time.

707
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,040
After all, my Tianxiang Restaurant

708
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:27,560
is not a charity house.

709
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,080
This time is different from last time.

710
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:30,950
If Miss Zhu doesn't help,

711
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:33,560
the Zhou family may be doomed.

712
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,230
What's the matter with me?

713
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,320
Miss Zhu, are you sure not to help me?

714
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:54,360
What do you think of Tianxiang Restaurant?

715
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:56,950
How dare you be so rude to me.
