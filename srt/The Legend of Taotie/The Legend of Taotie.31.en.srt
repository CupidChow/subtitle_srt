[Episode 31]

23
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,190
I had to...

24
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,440
I...

25
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,800
Hairu,

26
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,880
save me.

27
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,470
Hairu.

28
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,360
I thought after I killed her,

29
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,360
you would be with me.

30
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,080
But in the end,

31
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,110
you still dumped me.

32
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,270
Hairu,

33
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,160
I had meant to grow old with you.

34
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,470
But I realized

35
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,670
I couldn't look at your face.

36
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,520
So, I ran away.

37
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,270
These years,

38
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,360
I was staying

39
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,750
with Jiuniang who was your substitute.

40
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,520
But I realized

41
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,240
I couldn't feel as amazed

42
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,470
as how I felt
when your sister chanted a poem.

43
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,270
So, I accepted your invitation.

44
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
I'm back here.

45
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,270
I want to see you again

46
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,830
and see this sea.

47
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,190
No.

48
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,520
Now, I finally understand.

49
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,240
You don't love me,

50
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,390
Hairong,

51
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,600
or Jiuniang.

52
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,240
You love yourself.

53
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,880
You're not here to see me.

54
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,720
You're here for some peace of mind!

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,520
Hairu,

56
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,440
you can hate me.

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,950
I don't care.

58
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,880
These years, I've been living

59
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,950
with the fame.

60
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,230
Guilt has devoured

61
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,760
my soul.

62
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,760
Only when I came back
did I realize something.

63
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,670
When I'm guilty,

64
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,670
no poems sound great,

65
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,200
however beautiful they are.

66
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,160
Actually, I died earlier than them.

67
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,320
I've long been a walking corpse.

68
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,270
Hairong,

69
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,160
come and eat me.

70
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,920
All I have now is the guilt

71
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,640
to be your meal.

72
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,160
Hurry, Ms. Ji!

73
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,440
Hairu,

74
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,720
will you kill me again?

75
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,670
Hairong.

76
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,720
Oh, I see.

77
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,440
I wondered why Heng Gong fish converted.

78
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,480
So, it ate your sister.

79
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,790
Ms. Ji,

80
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,640
it attacked guests at Fuyu Inn.

81
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,160
You did that on purpose, huh?

82
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,640
Who's the last victim

83
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,070
in your plan?

84
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,070
I knew this day would come.

85
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,110
Its appetite would grow.

86
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,110
One day, it would eat me, too.

87
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,350
I always thought
it was Liu Zhongxian's fault.

88
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,270
He deceived us.

89
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,600
I was wrong.

90
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,320
I harmed myself.

91
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,760
I killed Hairong, too.

92
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,830
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,720
I was wrong.

94
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,000
I was so impulsive

95
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,440
that I pushed you into the sea.

96
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,670
I was just so sad.

97
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,350
Two people who loved me most

98
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,920
would leave me together.

99
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,760
I was wrong.

100
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,760
I was so wrong.

101
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,160
Please forgive me.

102
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,760
I'm sorry.

103
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,510
Forgive me, please.

104
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:40,950
Forgive me.

105
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,160
Hairong,

106
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,270
forgive me.

107
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,560
Miss Zhu.

108
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,440
Miss Zhu,

109
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:17,630
please hand me the Twin Mushroom.

110
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,160
Oh, you finally remember.

111
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,070
So, you got back your memories

112
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,400
by wearing

113
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,630
this funny mask again.

114
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,880
You sacrificed everything
for that merciless man.

115
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:29,840
Is it worth it?

116
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,560
Mr. Tan.

117
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,070
Miss Zhu,

118
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,280
you did the same thing.

119
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,630
I haven't dealt with you

120
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,750
for what happened in Yangcheng.

121
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,190
Now, you've brought yourself to me.

122
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,070
Oh.

123
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,070
Hasn't anyone ever told you?

124
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,430
Nobody can

125
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,040
snatch food from me.

126
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,920
Well, I can't snatch it.

127
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:50,990
But...

128
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,240
I can exchange
your dear accountant for it.

129
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,800
In Yangcheng,

130
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,920
when I caught him,

131
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,310
I planted puppet strings

132
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:00,670
on his back.

133
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,280
If I activate them,

134
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,400
he will become my puppet

135
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,360
just like that old man.

136
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,190
Nonsense.

137
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,960
Miss Zhu, if you don't believe me,

138
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,800
try it.

139
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,310
Qing.

140
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,670
Qing.

141
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:57,920
Qing.

142
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:03,920
Taotie,

143
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,840
even if you get the Twin Mushroom,

144
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,750
you'll have to pay the price.

145
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:08,960
Chang Qing

146
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,070
will live with the guilt
for these people.

147
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,920
He will even

148
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,920
hate you and stay away from you.

149
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,400
Qing.

150
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:20,800
He ran away.

151
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,360
Don't worry.

152
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,400
When I see him again,

153
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,600
I won't let him go.

154
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:28,240
Qing.

155
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,040
Chang Qing

156
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,480
will live with the guilt

157
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,110
for these people.

158
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,920
He will even

159
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,550
hate you and stay away from you.

160
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,310
The guilt I have,

161
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,310
compared to yours,

162
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,600
is just nothing.

163
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,720
The Twin Mushroom

164
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:45,990
only inhabits a demon

165
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,720
to absorb the energy of the world.

166
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,430
It takes sixty years to grow mature.

167
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,400
To make it grow faster, Mr. Tan

168
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:53,400
helped Heng Gong fish

169
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,990
find more victims.

170
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,990
Instead, they helped me.

171
00:11:58,430 --> 00:11:59,480
I chopped it and cooked it

172
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,840
with the Phoenix's egg

173
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,040
and the Mirage Shell.

174
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,240
I used the ginger from Sichuan

175
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,990
to remove its bloody smell.

176
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,310
It was simmered for eight hours.

177
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,870
Ten blows of water

178
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,480
ended up like this.

179
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,070
Qing,

180
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,670
eat it when it's hot.

181
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,600
This time,

182
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,190
you're also injured.

183
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,670
I'm sorry.

184
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,510
It won't happen again.

185
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,480
When we were in Yangcheng,

186
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,310
what on earth did you see

187
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,960
in the Slim Waist Woman's illusion?

188
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,400
You cried so sadly.

189
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,920
Like you said,

190
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,920
it was just an illusion.

191
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,240
It wasn't real.

192
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,040
You knew it.

193
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:06,720
Be careful.

194
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,550
From the very beginning,

195
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,600
you wanted the Twin Mushroom.

196
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,280
You knew the Fish in Yaoguang Sea

197
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:24,480
ate humans to feed the Twin Mushroom.

198
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,670
You remained indifferent

199
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,280
and waited until the Mushroom grew.

200
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,160
You didn't do anything when people died.

201
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,310
To stop me from interfering,

202
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,510
you didn't tell me anything.

203
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,990
I wanted the Twin Mushroom to grow.

204
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,110
I didn't know Mr. Tan set a trap

205
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,750
to get so many guilty guys.

206
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,070
Even if they were guilty,

207
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,510
they had started to repent.

208
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,670
They should be forgiven.

209
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,430
But for me,

210
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,430
you stood by and did nothing.

211
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,440
Don't you feel guilty?

212
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,640
Now,

213
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,790
you offer me this soup.

214
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,640
So many lives

215
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,150
are just nothing in your eyes.

216
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,640
I thought you would change

217
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,230
over so many years.

218
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,640
But you're different.

219
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,960
Just because I'm different,

220
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,880
you ignored other people?

221
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,280
Then, Miss Zhu, tell me.

222
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,200
If a mortal eats this soup,

223
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,030
what will happen?

224
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,550
He'll live 60 years longer.

225
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,110
Oh, I see.

226
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,910
So, I'm to blame

227
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,400
for so many lives.

228
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,640
No.

229
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:29,960
Qing.

230
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,110
Thank you for caring so much for me.

231
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,670
I can't help panicking.

232
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,670
But I'm a mere human.

233
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,280
I don't deserve this.

234
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,880
I won't eat

235
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,230
this soup.

236
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,280
If you don't,

237
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,960
in sixty years,

238
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,710
where can I find you?

239
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:24,960
In the next life,

240
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:28,960
if we're destined to meet,

241
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,790
we will meet.

242
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,760
But I lost

243
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,400
an important friend.

244
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,080
Qing,

245
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:55,440
I won't let it happen again.

246
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,470
You can hate me

247
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
or complain about me.

248
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,560
But today,

249
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,350
you have to eat this.

250
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,190
I want you to live.

251
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,760
I'll take the blame

252
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,830
for all the sins.

253
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,560
Even if they're catastrophic.

254
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,430
This is the best solution now.

255
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:35,710
Qing.

256
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:36,800
Oh, great.

257
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,230
The totem is gone.

258
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,880
Zhu Chengbi,

259
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,880
you're so fierce.

260
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,110
You really are!

261
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,230
Qing.

262
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:04,070
Miss Zhu,

263
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,310
I won't complain even if I have to

264
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,000
die for you.

265
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,560
But I don't want to see you

266
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,800
become a merciless monster.

267
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,760
It's my fault.

268
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,070
You end up like this because of me.

269
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,070
Under such circumstances,

270
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,560
I'm too ashamed to face you.

271
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,800
From this day on,

272
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:31,310
please forget me.

273
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,400
You and I

274
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:40,000
will never

275
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,040
see each other.

276
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:51,950
Qing.

277
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,190
You can't take away the brush.

278
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,310
If you take it away,

279
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,920
we'll really finish.

280
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,560
Fine.

281
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,350
Mr. Chang.

282
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:25,680
Mr. Chang.

283
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:28,950
Mr. Chang.

284
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,000
Mr. Chang, I heard your conversation.

285
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,880
Are you really leaving?

286
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,190
Cuiyan.

287
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,710
Yingtao is away.

288
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,560
You should take good care of Miss Zhu.

289
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,470
You can't cry now.

290
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,560
My brush doesn't work.

291
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,070
You must always remember

292
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,880
you can't get wet.

293
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,680
Don't leave us alone.

294
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:46,880
Take care.

295
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,430
Mr. Chang.

296
00:22:58,830 --> 00:22:59,680
Mr. Chang!

297
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,160
Mr. Chang!

298
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,710
Mr. Chang.

299
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,520
[Residence of the Prince of Langya]

300
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,430
Sorry, Your Highness.

301
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,800
I didn't bring back the Twin Mushroom.

302
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,110
I wish death upon myself.

303
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,640
Please kill me.

304
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:56,920
Father gave me

305
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,470
this dagger.

306
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,560
You keep it carefully.

307
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:14,590
Thanks for sparing me, Your Highness.

308
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,470
I swear, Your Highness.

309
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,350
I'll find another way to save you.

310
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:21,640
Also,

311
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,430
I'll make Taotie pay the price.

312
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,310
The frontier is in danger.

313
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,190
The west battalion of the Yao's Army...

314
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,640
There are fights at the frontier.

315
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,160
The Garuda is badly injured.

316
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,950
The Yao's Army can't do
without the Garuda.

317
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,590
Mr. Chang, please come here

318
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,920
and heal the Garuda

319
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,110
with your magic brush

320
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,160
and help us win the war.

321
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,000
Miss Zhu,

322
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,590
it's been a few days

323
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:14,920
since you didn't eat or drink.

324
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,230
If it goes on like this,

325
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,160
you'll be too weak.

326
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,830
Miss Zhu,

327
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,110
Mr. Chang must have left

328
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,920
for some reason.

329
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,110
What on earth

330
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,800
did you do?

331
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:37,560
Miss Zhu.

332
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,280
Miss Zhu.

333
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:51,070
I don't know how everything
is going with Mr. Chang

334
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,160
or where he is.

335
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,350
Miss Zhu keeps the brush.

336
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,160
Mr. Chang can't even

337
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,160
paint out a maid to take care of him.

338
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,710
So pathetic.

339
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,000
Miss Zhu must have done

340
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
something outrageous,

341
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,350
really outrageous.

342
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,560
Mr. Chang cares so much for you.

343
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,350
Or he wouldn't have left you.

344
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,920
Go hang up the white curtain.

345
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,520
We're going out.

346
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,400
Miss Zhu,

347
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,800
are they enough?

348
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:26,950
Yes.

349
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,800
372 rats.

350
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,040
I can fix Qing's brush.

351
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,950
But the world is so big.

352
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:42,680
Where can I find you?

353
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,470
Sorry, Your Highness.

354
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,590
I failed to find a way to heal you.

355
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,830
Help me out for a walk.

356
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:35,920
Wait, Your Highness.

357
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,040
It's cold out there.

358
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,920
You should keep warm.

359
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,110
Also,

360
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:43,880
you can hide yourself.

361
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:54,310
Now, an exiled prince like me

362
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:57,000
has to hide myself.

363
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,590
Your Highness,

364
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,470
I shouldn't have said that.

365
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,190
Your Highness,

366
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,190
His Majesty sent
Eunuch Wu with an edict.

367
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,590
He has arrived at the door.

368
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,590
Eunuch Wu came personally?

369
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,110
Mingyan,

370
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,520
go get him in.

371
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,110
Yes.

372
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,830
Sir,

373
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,880
give us some privacy.

374
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:23,590
This way.

375
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,150
Edict for the Prince of Langya,
mayor of Wuxia.

376
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,040
At the behest

377
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,510
[Imperial Edict]
of His Majesty,

378
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,800
Bei Di Army is invading us.

379
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:51,600
Yao Peng is fighting them
with the Garuda.

380
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,040
His army has been victorious.

381
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,600
To reward the warriors,

382
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,390
the Prince of Langya Zhao Heng

383
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,390
will go to the Garuda Pass
for supervision on behalf of His Majesty.

384
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,390
Respect this.

385
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:04,920
I will go,

386
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,150
Father.

387
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,350
Thank you, Eunuch Wu.

388
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,870
Your Highness,

389
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,680
His Majesty asked you
to set off right now

390
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,150
without delay.

391
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,270
But your health condition...

392
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,270
I'm fine.

393
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:29,990
I just caught a cold.

394
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,150
Oh, good.

395
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,920
Good.

396
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,110
I'm going back to Yunlong
to report on completion.

397
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:36,800
Mingyan.

398
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:37,630
Here.

399
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,630
Walk Eunuch Wu out.

400
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,350
Yes.

401
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:56,800
Eventually,

402
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,720
I can't let you go.

403
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,840
At this time of day,

404
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,750
you usually came back

405
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,390
with my favorite rose pastry.

406
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,200
Even when I didn't want any,

407
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,080
you forced me to eat.

408
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,720
I'm so hungry.

409
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,870
Then eat something.

410
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,110
There's nothing to eat.

411
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:16,800
Qing,

412
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,750
I'm so hungry.

413
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,230
This is the rose pastry
from Xunfang Resto.

414
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,800
Only 12 pieces are sold every day.

415
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,150
One liang of silver for each.

416
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:26,960
You're fooled.

417
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,270
The rose used in the stuffing

418
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:31,150
wasn't plucked at the Zi hour.

419
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,320
It doesn't taste fresh enough.

420
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,040
Miss Zhu,

421
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:34,630
taste it.

422
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:35,720
Go away.

423
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:40,960
Come on.

424
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,870
Don't be so willful.

425
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,470
I've told you many times.

426
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,230
Eating

427
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,680
is the most important thing

428
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:50,510
in this mortal world.

429
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,350
We can't be perfunctory
with one single meal.

430
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:53,680
I must eat the unique food

431
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,750
I'm destined to eat.

432
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,110
Without delicious food,

433
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,440
I would rather starve to death.

434
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,510
Fine.

435
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:02,800
I knew

436
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,470
you were kind and proud.

437
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,230
But I still did that.

438
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,150
I deserve this bad ending.

439
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,920
I just don't know

440
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,870
how you're doing.

441
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,880
[Garuda Pass]

442
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,600
Recently, there have been battles.

443
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,360
Bei Di gathered a lot of soldiers

444
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,190
and they're bearing down on us.

445
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,240
Everybody,

446
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,720
we must be precautious.

447
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,080
Yes.

448
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,480
Report!

449
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:55,670
General,

450
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,720
someone's knocking at the gate.

451
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,080
We had a battle
the day before yesterday.

452
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:01,510
Today, they came again.

453
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:04,120
Our soldiers are resting.

454
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,720
How can we fight them?

455
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,880
How many soldiers have come?

456
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:08,950
One.

457
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:41,270
Mr. Chang.

458
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,230
Mr. Yao,

459
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,310
I was held up on my way here.

460
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,080
So, I arrived today.

461
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,160
I'm sorry.

462
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,200
Don't blame yourself.

463
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,230
I can't thank you enough

464
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,440
for coming here.

465
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:51,550
Come on.

466
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,840
Let's get in and talk.

467
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,470
All right.

468
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,080
Leave it to me.

469
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:55,880
Thank you.

470
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,750
Here, Mr. Chang.

471
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,270
Thank you.

472
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:12,400
When I received your letter,

473
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,790
I was really worried.

474
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,950
How's everything going here?

475
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:19,080
The war is fierce.

476
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,510
We lack food.

477
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,120
I've reported it to His Majesty.

478
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,750
The Prince of Langya
is coming with army provisions.

479
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,230
But...

480
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,790
But Bei Di Army may invade us

481
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,200
at any time.

482
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,360
Our soldiers

483
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,600
have to fight bravely.

484
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:35,950
When I came in here,

485
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:36,840
I noticed

486
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:37,990
the soldiers were demolished.

487
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,680
Because of food shortage, right?

488
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:43,440
Mr. Chang, you're so perceptive

489
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,360
and subtle.

490
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:45,880
To be honest,

491
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,270
I invited you here

492
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:48,920
so you could paint some food

493
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,600
for my soldiers.

494
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,080
I'm sorry, Mr. Yao.

495
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,680
What I paint can't get wet.

496
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,400
Or it will disappear.

497
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:00,880
Most importantly,

498
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,640
I don't have the brush now.

499
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,680
I really can't do anything.

500
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:07,680
You don't have it?

501
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,880
Why?

502
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,950
Previously, it didn't work.

503
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,990
It's not fixed yet.

504
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,080
So, I left it in Wuxia.

505
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,470
But with the Garuda,

506
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:17,270
whatever happens,

507
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:19,710
we can last until His Highness comes.

508
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,270
If only the Garuda was all right!

509
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,030
My soldiers are united

510
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,950
and fierce fighters,

511
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,030
we would win.

512
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,310
Sadly,

513
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,270
the Garuda can't fight anymore.

514
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,950
Can't fight?

515
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,840
Mr. Yao, in your letter,

516
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,200
you said it was badly injured.

517
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,360
But it's the strongest bird of our state.

518
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,550
How come it's exhausted

519
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,750
within only a few days?

520
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
Mr. Chang, go check it and you'll know.

521
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:02,680
Mr. Chang.

522
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:04,470
Look.

523
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:54,950
Mr. Yao,

524
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,160
what happened?

525
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:01,270
The Garuda's spiritual energy is fading.

526
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:03,160
In the last battle,

527
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,510
it repelled Bei Di Army
with all its energy.

528
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,750
But it fell from the sky.

529
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,600
Now, it's dying.

530
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,510
Since soldiers saw this,

531
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,840
they've been demoralized.

532
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,990
And we don't have enough food.

533
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,510
There are even rumors

534
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,120
that Da Liang will be destroyed.

535
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:21,230
The Garuda has been

536
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,710
guarding the frontier of Da Liang.

537
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:24,310
Under such circumstances,

538
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,510
soldiers can't help worrying.

539
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,230
Besides,

540
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,600
Bei Di will invade us anytime.

541
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,880
The Garuda Pass is in grave danger.

542
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,710
As I expected,

543
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,510
you think

544
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:39,230
the Garuda Pass was peaceful

545
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,920
due to the Garuda.

546
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,880
What do you mean, Mr. Yao?

547
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:51,310
Don't worry, buddy.

548
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,750
I won't let Bei Di Army

549
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,400
break into the Garuda Pass.

550
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:57,950
It's doing its best

551
00:38:57,950 --> 00:38:58,710
to protect us.

552
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:11,080
The screech.

553
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,400
Mr. Yao,

554
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,600
I have an idea.

555
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:16,990
Let's hurry up

556
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:17,920
and get ready.

557
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:18,840
All right.

558
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,080
Be careful.

559
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,080
Slow down.

560
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:35,440
Put it there.

561
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,400
We'll have to travel tomorrow.

562
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,120
Your Highness, get some rest.

563
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,440
I also want to fight a war

564
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,990
as a red-blooded warrior.

565
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,470
But my body...

566
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:05,950
Don't worry.

567
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,750
It's cold and you wear thick clothes.

568
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,470
Be careful

569
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:10,990
and you won't be exposed.

570
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,710
I actually worry about your health.

571
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,840
The Garuda Pass isn't like your home.

572
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,200
When you're there,

573
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,510
you'll have to do what the soldiers do.

574
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,360
I fear you may physically collapse.

575
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,750
I'm a prince.

576
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:29,440
I should serve my state.

577
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,880
But I'm so weak.

578
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,750
Such a useless man.

579
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,120
Your Highness,

580
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,710
I have an idea.

581
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,080
Every day, I can give you some energy

582
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,600
and you'll be stronger the next day.

583
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,310
But...

584
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,080
But what?

585
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,750
Feel free to talk.

586
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,400
No offense,

587
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:58,680
but you may have to suffer

588
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,920
some unbearable pain.

589
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,120
It doesn't matter.

590
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:13,120
As long as I can get better

591
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,880
and be a normal man,

592
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,120
I can bear anything.

593
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:25,750
Your Highness.

594
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,470
When can I see you again?

595
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:29,550
Yuhu,

596
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,080
how much food do we have now?

597
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,790
General,

598
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:34,360
there isn't

599
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:36,440
too much food.

600
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:37,400
Give out my order.

601
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,600
Make steamed buns

602
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,160
and share them with all the soldiers.

603
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:40,920
Yes.

604
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:14,200
Soldiers,

605
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,470
I invited a man from Wuxia

606
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:16,950
to heal the Garuda.

607
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,080
When the sun rises,

608
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:21,550
it will be as healthy as before.

609
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,360
Now, eat the food

610
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:27,790
and fight against Bei Di with me.

611
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,790
- Fight against Bei Di!
- Fight against Bei Di!
