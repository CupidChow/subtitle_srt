192
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,400
You wouldn't feel pain, would you?

193
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:58,670
Lotus.

194
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,550
Are you doing well there?

195
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,320
Recently, a bookkeeper
came to Tianxiang Restaurant

196
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,080
and even painted two maids for me.

197
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,550
For the first time, I felt

198
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,710
not so lonely.

199
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,840
But I don't know when

200
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,790
I can see you again.

201
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,080
She looks so carefree.

202
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,150
I thought

203
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,590
she didn't care about anything.

204
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,710
Unexpectedly, deep in her heart,

205
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,840
she hides someone deeply.

206
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:34,110
I told you to hang out the bedding.

207
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,400
We just wanted to see

208
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,880
if Miss Zhu will wake up.

209
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,670
Miss Zhu has been asleep for ten days

210
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,150
without eating anything.

211
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,320
Ten days is nothing.

212
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,840
Sometimes it takes one or two months.

213
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,470
One or two months?

214
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,320
When I first came,

215
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,710
I was also startled.

216
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,960
But soon I got used to it.

217
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,440
What's the first thing Miss Zhu does

218
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,350
upon waking?

219
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,710
She goes to the Lotus Tower.

220
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,000
Isn't the tower right under her eyes?

221
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,350
Seeing it every day is still not enough?

222
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:09,350
Exactly.

223
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,560
No wonder over these hundreds of years,

224
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,070
she has stayed here.

225
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,070
Forget it.

226
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:25,000
Since her heart has someone else,

227
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,640
I won't force her anymore.

228
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,070
- Mr. Lu.
- Mr. Lu.

229
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,800
How's the investigation going?

230
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,350
Mr. Lu,

231
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,310
I've found something.

232
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,000
The person who was burned to death
is named Li Jiuzeng.

233
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:48,880
He lived on Xingshan Street.

234
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,230
This Li Jiuzeng is not a local.

235
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,990
He moved here ten years ago.

236
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,270
He idles all day
and does no proper work,

237
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,040
bullying men and harassing women.

238
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,440
Around Xingshan Street,

239
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,750
he's a famous scoundrel.

240
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,440
Since he is a scoundrel,

241
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:02,920
then there should be many

242
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,750
who bear grudges against him.

243
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,630
Follow this lead and investigate

244
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,800
those who bore grudges against him.

245
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,320
Yes!

246
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:08,750
Also,

247
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,230
where is he from?

248
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,600
Does he have other family members?

249
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,080
According to his neighbors,

250
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,390
Li Jiuzeng is from Yumen Village.

251
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,750
But strangely,

252
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,720
over ten years ago

253
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,920
when he came to Wuxia City,

254
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,080
he was all alone

255
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,320
and had no parents either.

256
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,630
I think he might be an orphan.

257
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:27,750
By the way, Mr. Lu,

258
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,470
before Li Jiuzeng was burned,

259
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,840
he went to Tianxiang Restaurant

260
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,960
to eat Hibiscus Flame.

261
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,680
Tianxiang Restaurant?

262
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,840
I said I won't go.

263
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,110
The whole Wuxia City knows

264
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,870
that you are the hardest to invite.

265
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:50,840
So,

266
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,960
name your terms.

267
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,840
As long as you organize
Her Grace's birthday banquet,

268
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:56,230
I'll agree to anything.

269
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:58,800
I've already given my gift to her,

270
00:18:59,150 --> 00:18:59,800
Hibiscus Flame.

271
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,320
Remember?

272
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,510
Didn't you eat it?

273
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,270
Hibiscus Flame is indeed irresistible.

274
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:05,560
I really couldn't help it.

275
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,720
Irresistible or not,
you can't eat too much.

276
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,110
Although Hibiscus Flame is delicious,

277
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,150
if the same person eats it twice,

278
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,440
he will combust and die.

279
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,110
If you can't resist such a dish,

280
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,470
how can you talk about sincerity?

281
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,440
If a man is wealthy beyond measure,

282
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,920
yet he is willing
to spend thousands for you.

283
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,720
While another man has only ten coins,

284
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,080
but he's willing to spend it all on you.

285
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,800
Which do you think is more precious?

286
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,230
To host Her Grace's birthday banquet,

287
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,040
I have a thousand coins.

288
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,510
But for you,

289
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,680
I have only ten coins.

290
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,920
In all my life,

291
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,470
it's the first time someone
dares to treat me like this.

292
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,680
You are the Prince of Langya.

293
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,390
With just a wave of yours,

294
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,470
you could have beauties

295
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,560
in your arms.

296
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,270
Why come to my Tianxiang Restaurant

297
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,150
to make things hard for yourself?

298
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,270
Even if there are

299
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,470
numerous beauties,

300
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,040
I want none of them.

301
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,560
The person I want

302
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,110
is only you.

303
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,510
Only me?

304
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,040
Then why did you ask me

305
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,110
to prepare a birthday banquet
for your beloved girl?

306
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,440
She's not my beloved girl.

307
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,800
I just owe her a little.

308
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,470
Is it related to the Paw Bead?

309
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:57,440
My father misunderstood

310
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,800
my heartfelt efforts
when I presented the Paw Bead.

311
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:02,600
He imprisoned me.

312
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,630
Her Grace used her own body

313
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,470
to shield my father
from an assassination

314
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,390
and cleared my name.

315
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,320
But I've been too cold to her

316
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,840
and ignored her feelings for me.

317
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:19,440
So I ask you
to prepare her birthday banquet

318
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,630
just so she can feel

319
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,680
a little better after eating it.

320
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,440
Then you won't ask

321
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,840
how I feel?

322
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,350
Good day.

323
00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:47,150
Qing.

324
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,440
Why are you still sleeping in?

325
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:50,870
Get up.

326
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,870
Come out and play with me.

327
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,150
Are you afraid Prince of Langya
will ask you to prepare a banquet,

328
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,960
so you're trying to avoid him?

329
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,350
You know, yet you still ask.

330
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,840
Let's go.

331
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,080
I'm not going.

332
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:08,600
I'll go by myself then.

333
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,200
Are you sure you have to do this?

334
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,150
Once you sacrifice your life,

335
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,080
you'll only have
six months left to live.

336
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,470
Think it through carefully.

337
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,440
Don't regret it later.

338
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,270
After you go back,
try to use your energy sparingly

339
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,040
and rest as much as possible.

340
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,990
Your magic brush

341
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,990
consumes a lot of your energy
especially

342
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,750
and will accelerate your death.

343
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,350
Did you remember

344
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:33,510
what I just told you?

345
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,470
Yes.

346
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,350
That's good.

347
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,320
By the way,

348
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,630
she's such a foodie.

349
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,200
Her stomach often feels unwell.

350
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,720
Remember to let her
take this medicine.

351
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:49,840
Some of it has been stored for too long.

352
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,600
You need to replace it on time

353
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,720
to avoid harming her health.

354
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,510
Also,

355
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,040
when she's in a bad mood

356
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,110
and isn't preparing a banquet,

357
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:57,920
remember to

358
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,390
hang the white curtains.

359
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,720
After opening,

360
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,230
hang the lanterns
with the character "Zhu" on it.

361
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,680
I'll teach you
how to do the accounting later.

362
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:05,840
But Mr. Chang Qing,

363
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,040
aren't these

364
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,560
things you usually do?

365
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,350
Yes, Mr. Chang Qing.

366
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,510
Are you leaving Tianxiang Restaurant

367
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,440
to go somewhere?

368
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,110
I've been out for so long.

369
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,080
I miss home a bit.

370
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,720
I plan to return for a visit soon.

371
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,270
While I'm away,

372
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,560
take good care of Miss Zhu

373
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,470
and Tianxiang Restaurant.

374
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,040
But Mr. Chang Qing,

375
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,560
you've returned home before.

376
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,470
Why didn't you mentioned these before?

377
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,270
Will you be away
for a long time this time?

378
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:37,840
I'll be staying for a while.

379
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,600
Not sure how long yet.

380
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,150
But Mr. Chang Qing,

381
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,630
why didn't you tell us earlier?

382
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,720
Why are you leaving so suddenly?

383
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:45,990
Yes, Mr. Chang Qing.

384
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,470
What's been going on with you lately?

385
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,270
Prince of Langya comes
to Tianxiang Restaurant every day.

386
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,800
Are you at ease
leaving Miss Zhu alone here?

387
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,040
Exactly.

388
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,560
What are you doing?

389
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,630
Miss Zhu.

390
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,270
Is it because you went

391
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,230
to Pingyue House last time

392
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,350
and now you're itching for more?

393
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,150
No.

394
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,630
Here to see the ladies?

395
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,680
No, no.

396
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,150
I'm here to find Miss Qu Yan.

397
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,560
Isn't that still to see a lady?

398
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,990
I'm here to find Miss Qu Yan

399
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,270
and ask her about
the rosefinch feathers.

400
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:48,350
Are you talking about the feather

401
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,800
that caused the explosion
at the Inspection Department?

402
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,040
I think a recent case

403
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,680
is related to the rosefinch feather.

404
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,390
Didn't Mr. Lu take it back?

405
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,750
If anyone should ask, it should be him.

406
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,920
I think so too.

407
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,440
But every time I ask him,

408
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,630
he always tells me

409
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,990
the golden rosefinch feathers

410
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,200
was brought by one of
Miss Qu Yan's guests

411
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,560
from Market Dong.

412
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,560
Since he said so,

413
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,680
why do you still want to ask?

414
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,040
Anyway, I feel

415
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,150
this thing isn't that simple.

416
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,350
Well, well,

417
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,230
you seem simple-sminded,

418
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:20,870
but you're quite sharp
at critical moments.

419
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,510
Follow me.

420
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,040
Miss Zhu,

421
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,200
I haven't decided yet.

422
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,200
You're being contradictory.

423
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:29,750
Let's go.

424
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,510
Miss Qu Yan

425
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,990
has already explained to you clearly

426
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,040
about the feather.

427
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,800
Why are you still hesitating?

428
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,040
Could it be

429
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,350
that you've found new clues?

430
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,150
It's alright.

431
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,870
Your name is Yundun, right?

432
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,990
Are your parents also in Wuxia City?

433
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,390
I grew up in Weiyi Mountain

434
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,270
with my grandfather, a hunter.

435
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,680
I've never met my parents.

436
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,800
Another pitiful child.

437
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
How old are you this year?

438
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,200
16.

439
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,680
16?

440
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:56,920
So,

441
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,150
I won't keep you.

442
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:01,920
Sorry for disturbing.

443
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,350
I just want to say one thing.

444
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,630
Mr. Lu is my master.

445
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,440
I hope that one day

446
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:08,350
I can call you Mrs. Lu.

447
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:08,920
Farewell.

448
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,270
If my son were alive,

449
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,560
he'd be about his age.

Mr. Lu.

452
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,150
A while ago, we went

453
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,040
to Li Jiuzeng's hometown,
Yumen Village, to ask around.

454
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:46,680
Guess what?

455
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,040
The people in Yumen Village said

456
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,630
that in their village,

457
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,390
there's never been
anyone named Li Jiuzeng.

458
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,270
His household registration
clearly states

459
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,440
that he's from Yumen Village.

460
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:58,920
Well...

461
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:07,750
Mr. Lu,

462
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,470
we've brought over those

463
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,870
who recently had grudges
with Li Jiuzeng.

464
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,560
You're the one who had
a grudge with Li Jiuzeng?

465
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,040
We found out

466
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,680
a few days ago, you fought with him

467
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,470
over territory.

468
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:23,680
Not long after, he died.

469
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,270
That's too much of a coincidence,
isn't it?

470
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,720
Tell us,

471
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,440
did you kill him or not?

472
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,150
I really didn't kill him.

473
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,150
Sir,

474
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,680
although I didn't get along with him,

475
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,110
I wouldn't go as far as killing him.

476
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,270
Besides,

477
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,560
I was with my brothers that day.

478
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,960
You can check if you don't believe me.

479
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,990
You say you didn't kill him,

480
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:42,630
then why did you run?

481
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:44,270
I... I...

482
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,560
I was afraid you'd

483
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,110
blame this on me.

484
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:48,800
And besides, you said I killed him,

485
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:49,920
but you don't know

486
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,110
that he always said
he wanted to burn me to death.

487
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,920
He said he wanted to burn you?

488
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:54,840
Yes.

489
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:55,870
At the time, he said

490
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:57,040
he would burn me sooner or later

491
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,600
and that many people in the village

492
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
died this way.

493
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,750
Their deaths were gruesome.

494
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,470
He said I should taste it too.

495
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,600
I was so angry at the time,

496
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,840
so I beat him up badly.

00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,510
As per the norm,

500
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,510
such a large fire

501
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,440
should be recorded in the county annals.

502
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,270
Why the archives of Yumen Village

503
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,270
have no records at all?

504
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:45,840
Mr. Lu.

505
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,670
I carefully inquired in Yumen Village.

506
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,390
There was no such major fire.

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,670

00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:56,840
this Li Jiuzeng

509
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,510
clearly isn't from here.

510
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,430
Why would he lie
about his place of origin?

511
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,390

00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,190

For a scoundrel like Li Jiuzeng,

00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,670
he's likely to exaggerate

00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,030

you're always like this.

565
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,150
Do you think I don't know?

566
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,270
It's all just excuses.

567
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,120
Do you really hate me that much?

568
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,790
I don't want much,

569
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,510
just your love, Your Highness.

570
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,600
Can't you see

571
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,750
my love for you?

572
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,360
You've loved the wrong person.

573
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:22,200
I'm not worth your love.

574
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,550
I've already given you all I can.

575
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,310
I gave you the dignity
of being a princess

576
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,310
and maintained your reputation.

577
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,640
You should also mind your status

578
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,440
and fulfil your duties properly.

579
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,160
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

580
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,710
I've behaved improperly.

581
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,840
Rest well, Your Grace.

582
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,200
Your birthday is in a few days.

583
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,750
Take good care of yourself.

584
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:11,080
Yes.

585
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,550
Why?

586
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:40,600
Why must you be so cruel to me?

587
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:46,470
There is always one person

588
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,160
who makes you willing
to sacrifice everything for her.

589
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,680
And you

590
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,230
are the person I'm willing to do so for.

591
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,640
Why can't you

592
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:00,440
love me like he does?

593
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,920
Wuxia has been turbulent lately.

594
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,880
I heard this morning that

595
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,990
a person was walking on the street

596
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:20,270
and suddenly burst into flames.

597
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,950
This person was fine,

598
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:23,030
how could he suddenly die?

599
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,080
It's truly unpredictable.

600
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,510
What's the big deal about that?

601
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,120
Don't you always say

602
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,360
everyone has to die someday?

603
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,080
The dead can't come back to life.

604
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,270
It's nothing serious.

605
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,400
How can you say something
so heartless?

606
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,950
If the one who combusted
was someone close to you,

607
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,030
would you still think this way?

608
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,270
They were troublemakers anyway.

609
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,270
If there were such people around me,

610
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,750
even if they died,

611
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,080
I wouldn't feel sad.

612
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:49,710
You...

613
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,160
What about me?

614
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,080
Forget it, forget it.

615
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,120
You don't care
about others' lives anyway.

616
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,510
Who said I don't care?

617
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,920
I do care about you.

618
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:01,920
Really?

619
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:02,920
Yes!

620
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,160
If the two of them are gone,

621
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,230
no one will play with me.

622
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,470
If you're gone,

623
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:08,750
no one will help me with the accounts.

624
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,120
I knew you'd say that.

625
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,120
So you're still so heartless.

626
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:16,200
It's okay.

627
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,270
If I'm gone,

628
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,550
you can just spend money
to get new people.

629
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,680
Exactly!

630
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,950
Out with the old,

631
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,640
in with the new.

632
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,360
Miss Zhu,

633
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,880
how can you say that?

634
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,990
I'm heartbroken.

635
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,030
Cuiyan and I

636
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:36,160
will always stay by you
and Mr. Chang Qing's side.

637
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,230
Miss Zhu is right.

638
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,360
But

639
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,360
since it's been said, it must be done.

640
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,920
When the old leave,

641
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,160
new people will come.

642
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,550
But some people

643
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,360
just can't let it go

644
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,990
even when the people around them
have been gone for so long,

645
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,790
and keep immersing themselves
in pain.

646
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,710
I think,

647
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,360
it's better to open up
and accept new people.

648
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,640
You're absolutely right.

649
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,360
When the old leave,

650
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:01,790
we should welcome the new.

651
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:04,710
You...

652
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,880
You figured it out just like that?

653
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:09,990
Mr. Chang Qing,

654
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,950
Mr. Lu is here to visit.

655
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,680
I just thought of him,
and here he comes.

656
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,470
What absolute nonsense!

657
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,200
Are you telling me

658
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,790
that the man combusted in Wuxia

659
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:28,600
because he ate a dish
from Tianxiang Restaurant?

660
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,080
I had people investigate.

661
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,550
Before Ge Liang died,

662
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,600
he was preparing to eat
Hibiscus Flame here.

663
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,880
Li Jiuzeng had eaten
Hibiscus Flame that day.

664
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,230
One was beaten to death,

665
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,680
and another combusted.

666
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,400
How can it be such a coincidence?

667
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,230
What does this prove?

668
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:43,710
Mr. Lu,

669
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,440
as the instructor
of the Inspection Department,

670
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,160
do you base your cases
on mere coincidences?

671
00:38:53,790 --> 00:38:54,710
Each stick here

672
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,640
is worth a hundred liang of silver.

673
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,030
Only those who can afford this price

674
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:00,160
are qualified to have their name
written on the stick.

675
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,230
The banquet participants are drawn
personally by Miss Zhu.

676
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,840
Only the selected can attend.

677
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:06,600
We don't even know those people.

678
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,790
Why would we harm them?

679
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,600
That's exactly why I'm here.

680
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,440
Your Hibiscus Flame is extraordinary.

681
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,160
I heard this dish leaves people craving

682
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,400
after just one bite.

683
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:18,270
Can a single dish

684
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,310
have such enticing power?

685
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:24,840
Could there be
something strange about it?

686
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,120
Haven't you already identified

687
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,950
who has eaten this dish?

688
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,550
Why not directly ask them?

689
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,640
Apologies.

690
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,640
We can't host you today.

691
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:35,360
Please leave.

692
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,270
Wait a moment.

693
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:38,550
Mr. Chang,

694
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,750
when is the next draw
for Hibiscus Flame?

695
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,400
You're just in time, Mr. Lu.

696
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,990
It's today.

697
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,440
I want to participate in the draw.

698
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,510
A hundred taels of silver.

699
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:57,680
Judging by your expression,

700
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,030
it seems you're short on money.

701
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,200
Better go back and save up first.

702
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:04,920
I'm placing it here.

703
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,120
Could it be that you're afraid?

704
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:10,750
How could that be?

705
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,160
Anyway,

706
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,440
the one who almost got
their eye poked out wasn't you.

707
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,640
Just almost, not actually blinded.

708
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,440
I'm suddenly regretting this.

709
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,120
It's fine to sell
Hibiscus Flame to others,

710
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,270
just not to you.

711
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,310
Mr. Lu, please leave.

712
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,440
Congratulations, Mr. Lu.

713
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:04,990
You were selected this time.

714
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,710
When did his name get on here?

715
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:08,920
If I say it's there, then it's there.

716
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,160
Miss Zhu,

717
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,160
what exactly are you trying to do?

718
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,160
You'll see a good show in a moment.

719
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:16,880
Yingtao,

720
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:17,710
serve the dish.

721
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,640
I thought

722
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,600
it was an unusual dish.

723
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,950
Turns out it's just
a mere baked custard.

724
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:49,710
Mere?

725
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:55,310
You haven't even tasted it,

726
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,510
and you're already criticizing it.

727
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:05,030
Eating it would burn me to death.

728
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,840
Do you take me for a fool?

729
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,310
Qing,

730
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,600
bring me the "mere" Hibiscus Flame.

731
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:58,990
Mr. Lu,

732
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,470
this isn't a free meal.

733
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,640
You have to pay for it.

734
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,600
Otherwise, our accountant

735
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,710
will have a hard time explaining.
