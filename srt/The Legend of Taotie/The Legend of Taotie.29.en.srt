00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,240
have disappeared in your inn.

193
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,950
I can't let such things

194
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,040
happen again.

195
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:16,480
Mr. Yang,

196
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,360
the Fish Demon has been killed.

197
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,040
Mr. Liu will also hold
a poetic gathering.

198
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,270
It indicates

199
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,750
a ray of hope

200
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:25,880
for Yaoguang Sea

201
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,000
and Fuyu Inn.

202
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,070
Hairu,

203
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:31,750
stop being so stubborn, will you?

204
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,120
I've been adoring you for a long time.

205
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,320
Close down the inn and marry me.

206
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,070
You can only be a concubine.

207
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,440
But soon,

208
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,320
I'll have the assessment
at the end of the year.

209
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,510
If I can solve the case

210
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,830
where people were missing
on Yaoguang Sea,

211
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,680
maybe I can get promoted.

212
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,710
By then,

213
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,920
you can enjoy a wealthy life.

214
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,240
Isn't it great?

215
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,070
Behave yourself, Mr. Yang.

216
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:57,880
Mr. Yang,

217
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,830
guests are out there.

218
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,150
If you misbehave,

219
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,040
isn't it inappropriate?

220
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,520
[Fuyu Inn]

221
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,070
How time flies!

222
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,190
Even if pretty girls were still there,

223
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,270
everything had changed.

224
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,480
Liu,

225
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,920
come over here.

226
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,360
Liu,

227
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,150
come over.

228
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,190
Anyway,

229
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,510
in my territory,

230
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,590
nothing shall go wrong now.

231
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,150
Mr. Yang,

232
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,710
you indeed only care
for your work performance.

233
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,880
But don't forget

234
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,440
how you became

235
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,680
an official.

236
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,000
Don't be ridiculous.

237
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:45,000
You know exactly

238
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,590
if this is ridiculous.

239
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,150
Don't you remember
how your mother died?

240
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,360
Do you think no one else

241
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,270
knows the truth?

242
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:56,510
As the magistrate,

243
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,920
you've been reckless.

244
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,950
Don't you feel guilty?

245
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,630
In the dead of night,

246
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,190
aren't you scared?

247
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,510
Ji Hairu,

248
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,560
what are you talking about?

249
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,750
It's not my fault.

250
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,270
It's just not.

251
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,440
I didn't know you were so badly sick.

252
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,190
I thought I could delay
for a few more days

253
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,390
and make more money.

254
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,800
Take it back.

255
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,880
Take everything back.

256
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:38,750
Take it back.

257
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,120
Someone's dead.

258
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,950
Someone's dead!

259
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,150
Someone's dead!

260
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:49,920
Someone's dead.

261
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,000
Go. Save him.

262
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,630
Hurry.

263
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,680
Save him.

264
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,710
Hurry up.

265
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,320
One more guy died.

266
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,000
It's almost time.

[100 liang]

268
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:34,390
How...?

269
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,510
How did he die?

270
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,040
No idea.

271
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,750
Jiuniang is still in her room.

272
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,590
Miss Zhu, what's wrong?

273
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:56,590
Are you feeling unwell?

274
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,590
Qing,

275
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,800
he looks terrible.

276
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:00,830
Let's not look at him.

277
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,680
You've never been scared of this stuff.

278
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,110
What's wrong?

279
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,350
I don't want to look.

280
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Then, go back to your room.

281
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,040
When I walked out of my room,

282
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,510
I saw this man

283
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,960
keep yelling,

284
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,320
"It's not my fault."

285
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,840
He was also scattering the band notes.

286
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:31,390
I thought he was insane.

287
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:31,960
But...

288
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,270
But unexpectedly,

289
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:34,560
he suddenly died.

290
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,600
It's late.

291
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:36,720
Mr. Yang,

292
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,040

293

294
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:41,350
I...

295
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,870
I'm hungry.

296
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,560
I'm here for some food.
What's the problem?

297
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,920
What did he yell?

298
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,680
He...

299
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:53,990
He was yelling...

300
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,720
"It's all my fault."

301
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,350
"I didn't know you were so badly sick."

302
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,470
"I wanted to delay "

303
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,870
"I thought I could delay
for a few more days"

304
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,080
"Take it. Take everything back."

305
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,230
That's all.

306
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,440
Today, if you promise,

307
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,200
you can never

308
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,150
hurt people again.

309
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,320
What if...

310
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,150
What if I can't bear it?

311
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,720
If you do it again,

312
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,350
I won't let you go.

313
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:37,870
Then, you stop traveling with me.

314
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,350
This man

315
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,800
killed the Fish Demon.

00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,920
Now,

317
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,630
is its companion here for revenge?

318
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,560
I don't agree.

319
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:02,390
Mr. Yang,

320
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,960
no one is

321
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:05,750
your witness.

322
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,750
So, you're very likely

323
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,470
to have killed him,

324
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,440
scattered the bank notes,

325
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,600
and framed the Fish Demon.

326
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,560
Don't be ridiculous.

327
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,680
I'm the magistrate.

328
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,560
Why would I kill him?

329
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,320
Mr. Tan has a point.

330
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,390
Mr. Yang has always wanted
to seal the lake

331
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,560
in the name of the Fish Demon.

332
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,680
When this man killed the Fish Demon,

333
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,960
you hated him.

334
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,320
Earlier today,

335
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,150
you kept clashing with him.

336
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,630
And you were the first to find his body.

337
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,870
You're quite suspicious.

338
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:39,720
Ms. Ji,

339
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,080
you have a point.

340
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,720
Don't be ridiculous.

341
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,440
Otherwise, I will...

342
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,080

343
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,680
Stop it!

344
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,920
His forehead was bitten.

345
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:51,040
The wound is small,

346
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:51,870
but it's fatal.

347
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,510
And he's all wet.

348
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,150
The Fish Demon killed him.

349
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:19,320
Such a terrible inn.

350
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,080
I can't stay here.

351
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:22,870
I just can't.

352
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:24,960

361
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,870
Miss Zhu, what's wrong?

362
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,680
Do you remember
under Yangcheng Prefecture,

363
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,840
the Slim Waist Woman used a mirror

364
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,510
to evoke your deepest fear

365
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,470
and get you stuck in an illusion?

366
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,350
Can the Fish Demon do the same?

367
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,150
I'm not sure.

368
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,270
Maybe...

369
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,720
Maybe it's the guilt.

370
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,750
It can lure out your thoughts

371
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,150
and your promises

372
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,350
so that you don't know what to do.

373
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,600

00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,390
see some illusion?

Someone cut it with something sharp.

384
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,080
Mr. Yang, how are you?

385
00:21:59,150 --> 00:21:59,600
We're doomed.

386
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,310
Are you all right?

387
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:01,790
Who are you?

388
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,240
Who are you? Leave me alone.

389
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,150
I'm Hairu.

390
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,030
How could you be Hairu?

391
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:06,310
You...

392
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,960
You're here to kill me
for that old woman.

393
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:09,720
I...

394
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,390
What are you talking about?

395
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,190
It can't be.

396
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,150
It just can't.

397
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,480
What's wrong with Mr. Yang?

398
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,670
My mother killed herself.

399
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,550
I'm not to blame.

400
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,310
What happened here
has nothing to do with me!

401
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:29,790
If anyone bothers me tonight,

402
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,600
I'll kill him!

403
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:36,760
Mr. Yang.

404
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:42,120
Ms. Ji,

405
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,790
can you explain it?

406
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:47,790
Actually, I've heard a little

407
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:49,510
about Mr. Yang.

408
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,190
Do you mean a bad son like him

409
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,550
killed his own mother

410
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,880
just for promotion?

411
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I didn't know Mr. Yang had
done something like that.

412
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,150
But Mr. Tan,

413
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,150
how do you know?

414
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,030
I'm a traveling merchant.

415
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,310
I meet a lot of people

416
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,080
and I hear many stories.

417
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,000
It makes sense.

418
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,480
But I'm still confused about something.

419
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,880
Mr. Tan,

420
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:17,880
can you do martial arts?

421
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,720
You look very strong

422
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,720
and you're agile.

423
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,840
You don't look like a mere merchant.

424
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:30,190
What do you mean, Mr. Chang?

425
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,120
I mean

426
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,480
not a lot of people among us

427
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,550
can cut it off.

428
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,880
Mr. Tan, what do you think?

429
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,360
So, you still suspect me.

430
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,720
A lot of people in Wuxia know me.

431
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,640
But only dozens of people

432
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:00,550
have met Miss Zhu

433
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,120
and they're our acquaintances.

434
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,600
But you recognized her at first sight.

435
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,720
This is the first reason.

436
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,670
Second,

437
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,880
you're a traveling merchant.

438
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,510
When you saw someone
die a suspicious death,

439
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,840
you didn't worry about your goods,

440
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,270
but analyzed the case logically.

441
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,080
Even if I was an idiot,

442
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,000
I would suspect you.

443
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,880
Am I right,

444
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,720
Mr. Archer?

445
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,160
[Archery]

446
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,790
Miss Zhu and I are familiar
with all the archers

447
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,880
at the Inspection Department.

448
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:38,880
But you look unfamiliar.

449
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,120
I guess

450
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,670
you're a dark archer
working for the Prince of Langya.

451
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,000
It's wise of you, Mr. Chang.

452
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,550
That's right.

453
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,880
Since I left my sect,

454
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,360
I've been an archer
at the Inspection Department.

455
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,670
Today, I'm sent here

456
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,120
to investigate recent murder cases

457
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,600
on Yaoguang Sea.

458
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,000
In this case,

459
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,000
can you please

460
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
give me back my brush

461
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,310
I just mortgaged?

462
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,720
The inn is away from the trestle.

463
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:14,360
We're alone and helpless on the sea.

464
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,120
Let me paint a boat

465
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,880
to take you guys and Miss Zhu

466
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:20,880
back to the shore.

467
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:24,840
I'm afraid

468
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,670
I can't return it.

469
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,240
I need it for something else.

470
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,720
What do you need it for?

471
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,760
Mr. Tan,

472
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,480
will you deny your promise?

473
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,190
You know I'm close to His Highness.

474
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,360
If you keep my thing by force

475
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,310
instead of returning it,

476
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,030
His Highness will kill you.

477
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,190
His Highness...

478
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,880
You...

479
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,720
Qing.

480
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,080
Weird.

481
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,510
What's wrong with it?

482
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:21,840
Yeah.

483
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,240
It doesn't work very well.

484
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,670
Before I gave it to Mr. Tan,

485
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,080
only you touched it.

486
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,480
What exactly happened?

487
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,880
The other day,

488
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,880
I put it near the furnace.

489
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,480
Was it burned?

490
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,880
Can it be fixed now?

491
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
Now,

492
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,080
the Rat Demons are hibernating.

493
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,150
There's no other animal hair.

494
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,880
It can't be fixed now.

495
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,480
Qing,

496
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,720
we talked all night. Aren't you tired?

497
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,190
Let's go.

498
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,760
Don't worry, Ms. Ji.

499
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,550
I'll sleep in the hobby tonight.

500
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,030
You go back for some rest.

501
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:16,880
Uncle Li usually keeps watch at night.

502
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,150
Mr. Tan, you're an archer.

503
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,000
But you had a long day.

504
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,150
Go to bed early.

505
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:24,790
Fine, then.

506
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:46,280
[Ziyu Room]

507
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,390
Honey.

508
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:32,510
It's late. Where are you going?

509
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,840
I feel suffocated.

510
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:34,840
I want some fresh air.

511
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:35,840
Sweetheart,

512
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,760
you go back to sleep.

513
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:37,720
All right.

514
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,000
Come back early.

515
00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:29,030
Hairu.

516
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,430
Liu.

517
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,760
What are you doing here so late?

518
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,000
I couldn't fall asleep

519
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,480
and came down for a walk.

520
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,480
A lot of things happened today.

521
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:46,960
You must be scared.

522
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,600
Actually,

523
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,000
I'm fine.

524
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,030
But you're stuck here because of me.

525
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,080
It's my fault.

526
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,360
Hairu,

527
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,080
don't say that.

528
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,550
Yaoguang Sea

529
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,150
carries too many memories for me.

530
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:13,080
I don't want it to disappear.

531
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,600
But I guess

532
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,000
this poetic gathering can't be held.

533
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,430
That's not too bad.

534
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,120
We can watch the lake

535
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,150
and write poems

536
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,760
just like what we did

537
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,270
when Hairong was still here.

538
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,030
Liu,

539
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,360
this is for you.

540
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,080
Thank you, Hairu.

541
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,080
Is it here?

542
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:08,150
Right ahead.

543
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,640
Let me introduce her.

544
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,000
This is my sister Hairong.

545
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
Does she look like me?

546
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,670
When the sea waves,

547
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:22,910
the moon shines over it.

548
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,080
Waves move one after another

549
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,720
and the moon is everywhere.

550
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,310
You're my soulmate.

551
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,480
You really are.

552
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:41,390
With the bright moon and pretty ladies,

553
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,240
life is so wonderful.

554
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,310
Wonderful, indeed.

555
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,150
Hairu,

556
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,480
in my dreams,

557
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,960
I often thought about the past.

558
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,310
I thought of your pretty face

559
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,120
and beautiful dance.

560
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:24,390
When you pretended to be angry,

561
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,430
I felt restless.

562
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:32,760
Hairu,

563
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,240
I missed you so much.

564
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:40,760
Liu,

565
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,390
I missed you, too.

566
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,790
After that accident,

567
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,670
you left this place.

568
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,790
I thought you would come back.

569
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,480
But I only heard

570
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,510
that you would get married.

571
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,430
I was so sad for a long time.

572
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,310
It's my fault.

573
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:10,000
I betrayed you.

574
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:12,790
Then...

575
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:15,550
Jiuniang...

576
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,190
Now.

577
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,880
Right now,

578
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,670
let's not talk about anyone else.

579
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,910
Such a beautiful view

580
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,720
is pleasing to the eye.

581
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,360
Sadly,

582
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:03,670
you and I weren't here before.

583
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,480
There are many more places

584
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,760
we haven't been to.

585
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,920
But luckily,

586
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,510
I've let it go.

587
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:14,880
Miss Fifth,

588
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,840
have you really let it go?

589
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,230
Then, have let you go of yourself?

590
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,400
In the past 500 years,

591
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,230
you've influenced countless demons.

592
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,990
You're no longer a fierce demon.

593
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,640
Instead, you're a righteous

594
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,750
and caring Taotie.

595
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:36,550
Can you bear to see

596
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:38,030
someone die in front of you

597
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,550
when he doesn't deserve to die?

598
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,080
You didn't kill those people.

599
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,790
But you shouldn't have stood by.

600
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,510
For the man you care,
you don't help them.

601
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:53,950
This makes you

602
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,310
an accomplice.

603
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,200
Monk.

604
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:04,680
Qing.

605
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,030
Qing!

606
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:11,510
Qing.

607
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,510
Qing...

608
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,710
I don't care

609
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,230
what kind of demon I am.

610
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,230
He risked his limited life

611
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,550
for me.

612
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,710
How shall I repay him?

613
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:25,030
Qing,

614
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,200
you will be all right.

615
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,950
You haven't given back

616
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,680
the money you owe me.

617
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,080
You'll have to pay for a lifetime.

618
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:48,950
Miss Zhu,

619
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,710
I don't think

620
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,600
I can pay you back.

621
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,990
I'll have to

622
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,080
go back on my word.

623
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,550
Hairu,

624
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,200
I wanted to ask you yesterday.

625
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,920
You have a willow boat for me,

626
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,600
but why is it gone?

627
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,880
I looked for it.

628
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,360
Every day, I parked it by the river,

629
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,990
thinking you may

630
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,920
come back one day.

631
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,840
Yesterday, Miss Zhu used it by mistake.

632
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:50,470
Hairu,

633
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:52,640
you look gorgeous today.

634
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,310
Different from what you used to be.

635
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,200
How am I different?

636
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,920
Green, green the reed,

637
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,230
frost and dew gleam.

638
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:09,270
Beyond the stream,

639
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,030
upstream I go.

640
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,920
You loved to wear
brightly colored clothes.

641
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:17,310
You're seldom in this light color.

642
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,680
The color of my dress

643
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:23,950
and my hairstyle...

644
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,080
Do they remind you of someone?

645
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,600
Indeed, red suits you best.

646
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,230
You look enthusiastic and bright.

647
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,920
You're so charming.

648
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
You're always honey-lipped.

649
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,640
What about Hairong?

650
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:45,440
She's gorgeous in a different way.

651
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,230
Hairong is always quiet.

652
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,790
In this color,

653
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,030
she looks cute,

654
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,440
elegant, and extraordinary.

655
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:08,310
It's been so many years.

656
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,710
Why do you bring her up?

657
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:10,600
What?

658
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,270
You forgot her?

659
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:13,950
You know what?

660
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,710
I often dreamed about her.

661
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:21,990
The day is breaking.

662
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,360
I should go back.

663
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,750
I thought you would ask me

664
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,200
what I dreamed about her.

665
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,270
Even if you don't ask,

666
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:34,950
I will tell you.

667
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,200
I often dreamed about my sister.

668
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,920
She kept repeating

669
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,270
one thing.

670
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,640
"A good article isn't made up.

671
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,710
It's natural."

672
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:50,310
"A good article isn't made up.

673
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,270
It's natural."

674
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,640
It's natural.

675
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,030
It's natural.

676
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,640
Do you also think

677
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,790
we're destined

678
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,470
to be stuck here?

679
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,680
Someone doesn't want you to leave.

680
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,990
You didn't really forget her, did you?

681
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,360
I would never forget her.

682
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:34,710
Qing,

683
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,600
you look great.

684
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,510
I don't know why,

685
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,360
but I had a great sleep last night.

686
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,080
It doesn't make sense.

687
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,120
He shouldn't have known.

688
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,270
Did you sleep poorly, Ms. Ji?

689
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,440
I...

690
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,990
I guess no one
slept very well last night.

691
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,470
Even my husband was upset.

692
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,440
Ms. Ji is as brave as a man.

693
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,440
But she must have also been scared.

694
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:43,710
Weird.

695
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,030
Why isn't Mr. Yang here?

696
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,470
Did anything happen?

697
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:10,790
Oh no.

698
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:12,400
Mr. Tan,

699
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:14,790
I'm afraid Mr. Yang is dead, huh?

700
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:18,640
The water traces

701
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,470
will lead us to him.

702
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:35,230
Walk behind me.
