Mr. Lu.

Let's meet again in the next life.

25
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,110
Look, look, look!

26
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,190
What is it?

27
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,080
Quick, look!

28
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,030
Look, look!

29
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,520
What is it?

30
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,470
What's going on?

31
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,880
Yan!

32
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,190
Yan.

33
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:06,390

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,600
Yundun.

41
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:35,760
Well done,

42
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,880
you saved Ms. Li's granddaughter.

43
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
Praise if you must,

44
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,110
but stop patting my shoulder.

45
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,350
My shoulder's about
to be dislocated by your pats.

46
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,110
Let me tell you,

47
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,160
I

48
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,160
grew a pair of wings.

49
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,950
It's true.

50
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,350
Grew a pair of wings?

51
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,350
Yes, yes, yes.

52
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:54,720
You've said it
eight or ten times already

53
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,670
in the entire Inspection Department.

54
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,550
So do you believe me or not?

55
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,440
You still

56
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,000
don't believe me, do you?

57
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,270
Yundun,

58
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,070
I think you're still in a dream.

59
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
What nonsense are you talking?

60
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,550
This kid

61
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,790
must have burned his brain.

62
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,320
I'm telling the truth.

63
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,830
Okay, okay, it's true, it's true.

64
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,760
Let's go, let's keep practicing.

65
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,200
You two,

66
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,110
do you believe it?

67
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,550
Yeah, yeah.

68
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,790
It's true.

69
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,720
I want to eat hotpot.

70
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,550
I want to eat hotpot.

71
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,550
I want to eat hotpot!

72
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,550
Qing,

73
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,600
I want to eat hotpot.

74
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,200
Didn't you just eat?

75
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,320
Why do you want hotpot again?

76
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,200
Did eating the rosefinch

77
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,640
make your condition worse?

78
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,720
You don't understand.

79
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,550
This fiery energy

80
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:02,230
stirred up my appetite.

81
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,000
Qu Yan transformed into the rosefinch

82
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,270
and entered my mouth

83
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,640
to help me heal.

84
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,230
Or I'd feel uncomfortably stuffed

85
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,480
after eating through dozens of streets.

86
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,880
You're still talking about it.

87
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,230
It's important to save people,

88
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,160
but you should also check

89
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,040
if your stomach can take it.

90
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,790
You ate from Qingyu Street
all the way to Fushou City,

91
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,320
and even Anning Workshop wasn't spared.

92
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,830
That's a fireworks workshop.

93
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,350
I was worried you wouldn't make it back.

94
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,550
But you came back,

95
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,160
and Yingtao is gone.

96
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:26,920
Why worry if Yingtao is gone?

97
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,720
Just draw her out again.

98
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,480
I'm talking about Qu Yan now.

99
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,040
She is the most infuriating.

100
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,070
She promised to let me eat,

101
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,510
but ran off to reincarnate again.

102
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,670
The delicious rosefinch meat.

103
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,110
Is the rosefinch really that tasty?

104
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,830
You even ate one who was reincarnating.

105
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,270
In the end, it burned your throat

106
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:43,950
and you spat it out.

107
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,160
The rosefinch is indeed delicious.

108
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,320
Even its eggs are incredibly tasty.

109
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,270
But sadly, you can only eat it once.

110
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,040
Speaking of which,

111
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,950
it's also
Lu Ying's first time eating it.

112
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,600
Why does he also feel

113
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,790
like he's about to ignite?

114
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,510
He's different.

115
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,640
I added a little bit

116
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,320
into his portion.

117
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,110
Otherwise,

118
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,160
how would the two of them realize

119
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,350
each other's feelings?

120
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,480
But Lu Ying is really foolish.

121
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,320
Last time, he came here
to eat Hibiscus Flame

122
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,230
and almost ignited.

123
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,110
And this time,

124
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,230
he's jumping into the tower
with Qu Yan again.

125
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,160
So that's how it is.

126
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Why are you laughing now?

127
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,470
I'm laughing at fate.

128
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,880
The heavens never close all doors.

129
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:36,470
Think about it,

130
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,880
the rosefinch's nest has five eggs.

131
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,440
Four were eaten.

132
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,790
What about the last one?

133
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,520
Yeah.

134
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,760
Where did the last one go?

135
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,320
Unexpectedly,

136
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,550
it was raised into that kind

137
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,880
of clumsy human form.

138
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,000
Quite clumsy indeed,

139
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,000
but also quite cute.

140
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:57,670
So,

141
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,960
Qu Yan thought she was at a dead end.

142
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,030
Unexpectedly,

143
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:03,000
fate arranged a glimmer of hope for her.

144
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,320
Just like her and Lu Ying,

145
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,520
it's not entirely impossible

146
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,880
between humans and beasts.

147
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,470
Who are you thinking of now?

148
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,670
You.

149
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,320
I'm thinking of Lu Ying.

150
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,080
His performance this time

151
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,440
really surprised me.

152
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:44,030
It also made me think
that though humans and beasts

153
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,960
are separated by a great chasm,

154
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,550
if there's a will,

155
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,710
take one leap forward

156
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,670
and they'll eventually meet.

157
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:05,670
Qing,

158
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,710
last time when you ate Hibiscus Flame,

159
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,030
what nostalgic thing
were you thinking about?

160
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,670
I'll eventually have to leave.

161
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,960
At that time,

162
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,190
who will remind you to eat less?

163
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:31,920
Mr. Lu.

164
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:33,590
Mr. Lu.

165
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:34,950
Have you eaten?

166
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,320
Yundun.

167
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:24,560
Where did you buy

168
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,150
this bird of yours?

169
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,070
This bird wasn't bought.

170
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
It was picked up
during the fire that day.

171
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,000
Yundun.

172
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,270
This bird is very rare now.

173
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,800
They lay eggs once every 16 years,

174
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:44,950
and in 50 years,

175
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,680
they can be reborn in flames

176
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,270
and become fledglings again.

177
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,320
Mr. Lu,

178
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,510
when did you start understanding birds?

179
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,150
Of course.

180
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,120
Yundun,

181
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,750
this water won't do.

182
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,150
Quick, get some spring water.

183
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:06,800
Hurry up.

184
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,680
Alright.

185
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,240
Yan.

186
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,040
From now on,

187
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,480
there's you and me,

188
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,360
is that okay?

189
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,320
Wuxia.

190
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:41,880
Go to Tianxiang Restaurant

191
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:43,560
and find Taotie

192
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,950
to open the Portal.

193
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,150
Eat.

194
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,830
Mr. Chang Qing.

195
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,560
When will you open the Portal?

196
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,440
Mr. Chang Qing.

197
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,510
Mr. Chang Qing.

198
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,480
- Mr. Chang Qing.
- Mr. Chang Qing.

199
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:38,630
Mr. Chang Qing.

200
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,510
When will you open the Portal?

201
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,680
We want to go home, Mr. Chang Qing.

202
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,590
Mr. Chang Qing, quickly open the Portal.

203
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:46,270
Mr. Chang Qing,

204
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,040
I am in so much pain.

205
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,590
Save us, please.

206
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,190
Save us.

207
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:52,920
Save me.

208
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,150
Mr. Chang Qing.

209
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,150
Mr. Chang Qing.

210
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:03,630
Miss Zhu.

211
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,360
What exactly is going on?

212
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,480
Since I promised

213
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,190
to open the Portal for the beasts,

214
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,480
how can I keep you safe
at the same time?

215
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,710
I was too greedy.

216
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,000
I was far too greedy.

217
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,720
Greetings, benefactor.

218
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,750
You remember everything now?

219
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,560
Yes, Mr. Bai Ze.

220
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:07,350
Since you saved me from that fire,

221
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:09,080
I've been deeply grateful.

222
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,150
But I don't know why,

223
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,390
after arriving at Tianxiang Restaurant.

224
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,150
I couldn't recall

225
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,350
any of the past.

226
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,560
I intentionally sealed your memories.

227
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,470
Taotie is a fierce beast
that's thousands of years old.

228
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,600
If you kept thinking about those

229
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
memories about me,

230
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,990
she would easily sense it.

231
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:27,990
However,

232
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,750
when it's time for you to remember,

233
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,110
I will let you recall.

234
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,920
Why do you bear the Yujiang mark?

235
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,560
Did you trade your lifespan
with Physician Xuan?

236
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,150
Why did you do this?

237
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,440
Don't you know

238
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,200
that once a human bears this mark,

239
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,920
when the mark disappears,

240
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,350
it'll be the day they lose their life?

241
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,750
Have you forgotten your mission?

242
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:00,110
Since the battle 500 years ago,

243
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,150
I struck Taotie with a Soul Hook.

244
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,600
The Soul Hook has been
taking effect in her body.

245
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,110
To this day,

246
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,110
her spiritual power has been weakening.

247
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:10,150
And now,

248
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,560
she deeply trusts you.

249
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,200
Isn't this the best time for you to act?

250
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:15,630
Yes.

251
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,680
But I am a human.

252
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,600
I also have feelings.

253
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,960
I promised
to help the beasts return home.

254
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,720
But I don't want to hurt Miss Zhu.

255
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,470
Chang Qing,

256
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,840
you've understood the beast language
since childhood.

257
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,720
Since you were young,

258
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,960
beasts have been telling you

259
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,920
how they became homeless

260
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,390
and suffered from human oppression.

261
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,040
You swore

262
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,600
to take the Dragon's blood

263
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,390
and open the Portal

264
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:38,920
for them.

265
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,720
Have you forgotten?

266
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,390
I haven't.

267
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,680
I will never forget.

268
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,960
But taking the Dragon's blood

269
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,150
will harm Miss Zhu's life.

270
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,230
I can't bear it.

271
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,470
You can't bear it?

272
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,960
You're still to soft

273
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,150
on that Taotie

274
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,470
and have been deceived by her.

275
00:19:59,510 --> 00:19:59,960
No.

276
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,270
I just...

277
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,630
I just don't want to harm the innocent.

278
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,320
Don't want to harm the innocent?

279
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:11,800
Are you saying that

280
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,960
the Taotie who kills indiscriminately
is innocent?

281
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,630
She is a beast,

282
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,680
yet she fought her kind for humans

283
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,920
and helped Lotus

284
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,920
resist Qiong Qi's troops
at Songyang Pass,

285
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,720
which caused Black Qilin King

286
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,270
to lose his army's support

287
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,750
and be locked under Lotus Tower
for 500 years.

288
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:29,750
From then on,

289
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,630
the Portal was closed

290
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,800
and the beasts were forced
to wander the human world,

291
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,080
suffering oppression.

292
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,560
All of this was her doing.

293
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,200
Do you still think

294
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,150
that she is innocent?

295
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,680
In her daily life, Miss Zhu likes

296
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,350
to cook beasts into delicacies.

297
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,440
But she also bears

298
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,960
the sins of those beasts.

299
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,600
She is redeeming them.

300
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,470
She isn't cold-blooded as you say.

301
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,750
She's always been kind-hearted,

302
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,150
quietly helping others.

303
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,840
It seems leaving you by her side

304
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,470
is really not the best choice.

305
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,350
Because you are too naive and foolish

306
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:05,680
and too easily deceived.

307
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,510
She's never hidden anything from me

308
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,720
and has never deceived me.

309
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,390
Chang Qing,

310
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,080
you are kind and benevolent.

311
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,390
Doing good is benevolent.

312
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,750
But forsaking all living beings

313
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:16,680
to do little good

314
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,510
is not benevolence.

315
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,750
Don't you understand this?

316
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:19,870
I understand,

317
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,230
but she is different.

318
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,080
Different?

319
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,080
Alright.

320
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,390
Just wait a few more days.

321
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:26,870
She will take you to a place

322
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,960
and everything will become clear.

323
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,870
Her so-called compassion and kind heart

324
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,320
is just a disguise.

325
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,680
[Residence of the Prince of Langya]

326
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,320
[Memorial Tablet of Princess Wan'er]

327
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:07,840
Wan'er.

328
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,510
I really don't deserve

329
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,110
what you've done for me.

330
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,350
If there is a next life,

331
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,600
I am willing to repay you.

332
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:22,440
The imperial edict has arrived.

333
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:57,990
Brother.

334
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:58,990
Listen to the edict first.

335
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,630
[Imperial Edict]

336
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,600
I bear the divine mandate of Heaven.

337
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,990
Because the Prince of Langya
failed to guard Wuxia properly,

338
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,470
beasts caused chaos

339
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,680
and the entire city
was engulfed by fire.

340
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,440
The citizens suffered heavy losses,

341
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,720
and even the Princess
met an unfortunate death.

342
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,870
I am deeply grieved.

343
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,440
Therefore, I expropriate him
from his fiefdom in Wuxia City

344
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:31,720
and order him to capture
the beast Taotie with in a month.

345
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,080
Hereby ordered.

346
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,750
I accept the edict.

347
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:49,750
Zhao Ai.

348
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:51,440
Brother.

349
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,630
It's been a long time.

350
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,390
Your Highness.

351
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,630
You've arrived.

352
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,350
My brother told me

353
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,510
he has a trusted officer
in his residence,

354
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,470
who is knowledgeable about
beasts and paranormal things.

355
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,510
It must be you, sir.

356
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,510
You flatter me.

357
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,110
I only know a little
about the Taotie matter.

358
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,720
I'm willing to serve you.

359
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,320
Please speak, sir.

360
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:25,840
There have long been rumors

361
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,350
that Miss Zhu of Tianxiang Restaurant

362
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,680
is a Taotie.

363
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:30,510
Now it seems the rumors are true.

364
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,510
But Taotie's power is extraordinary.

365
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,200
500 years ago, she was hurt by Bai Ze.

366
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,600
And this time, she got hurt
by the rosefinch's flames.

367
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,200
She appears strong

368
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,200
but is internally weak,

369
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,350
still, ordinary people
are no match for her.

370
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,080
Thus, to capture the Taotie,

371
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,600
we must plan carefully.

372
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,320
Do you have a good strategy?

373
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,750
According to
the Records of Beasts in the Continent

374
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,600
written by Official Xu,

375
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,470
every 100 years,

376
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,390
Taotie creates havoc
in Yangcheng Prefecture,

377
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,990
disturbing the peace
of the shrimp and crab soldiers.

378
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,350
The time is about right now.

379
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,920
We can wait and see

380
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
whether there will be an opportunity

381
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,150
to reap the benefits
while she's in a battle

382
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,960
with the immortal Wuchang.

383
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:15,750
Your Highness,

384
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,080
beasts are affectionless.

385
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,990
Don't be deceived by her anymore.

386
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,680
Have you forgotten how Her Grace died?

387
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:23,920
Her Grace was burned alive

388
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,390
because she ate the Hibiscus Flame

389
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,600
made by the Taotie.

390
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
To her, human lives
are as insignificant as grass.

391
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,920
How could she have even
a trace of true feelings for you?

392
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,560
Brother.

393
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:40,510
Since you've already
sealed Tianxiang Restaurant,

394
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,600
I'm sure you've made a decision.

395
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,560
You need not worry
about what happens next.

396
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,510
If we brothers join forces,

397
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,840
together with Mr. Tan's strategy,

398
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,560
we can surely
achieve success in one strike.

399
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:49,750
By then,

400
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,840
you'll regain Father's trust.

401
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,230
Forget it.

402
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,350
Mr. Tan,

403
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,200
observe carefully from the outside.

404
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,040
Remember

405
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,390
do not alert the enemy.

406
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,200
Miss Zhu.

407
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,470
Miss Zhu.

408
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,680
How long will
Tianxiang Restaurant remain closed?

409
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,230
Everyone is waiting for us to reopen.

410
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,110
Keep your voice down.

411
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,720
Let it be closed.

412
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,230
Finally there's a chance
for me to relax.

413
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:34,870
Miss Zhu,

414
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:37,600
if Tianxiang Restaurant
remains closed like this,

415
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,270
I'm going to get bored and moldy.

416
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,440
That's easy to fix.

417
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,840
I'll throw you outside to sunbathe

418
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,750
to get rid of the moldy feeling.

419
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,440
How about that?

420
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,200
Miss Zhu.

421
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,510
Why don't you ask
the Prince of Langya for a favor?

422
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,350
Doesn't he usually try to please you?

423
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
If you ask him,

424
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,470
he will surely agree

425
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,470
to lift the seal
on Tianxiang Restaurant.

426
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,600
Why bring him up for no reason?

427
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,470
At this moment,

428
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,150
he's probably
still grieving for Her Grace.

429
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,200
It's sunny outside.

430
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:20,870
Cuiyan,

431
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,040
if you have nothing else to do,

432
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,990
go dry the bedding.

433
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,920
Don't disturb Miss Zhu's rest.

434
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,350
If you're thinking about it,

435
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,390
why not tell him clearly?

436
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,990
What's there for me to think about?

437
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,560
I'm just worried that if this goes on,

438
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,470
Tianxiang Restaurant
won't be able to carry on.

439
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,920
The maple trees below Songyang Pass

440
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,270
should have turned red by now.

441
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,920
Last time you mentioned it early on,

442
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:46,080
I even went specifically to see them.

443
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,720
Looking at the days,

444
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,230
they should have turned red.

445
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:11,960
Miss Zhu.

446
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,750
Miss Zhu.

447
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,080
Miss Cuiyan.

448
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,270
Mingyan.

449
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,040
Greetings, Miss Zhu.

450
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:41,800
Mr. Chang.

451
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,600
Are you here to lift the seal
on Tianxiang Restaurant?

452
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,150
No, I am not.

453
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,750
It's late autumn now.

454
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,960
His Highness asked me to bring some

455
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,040
fresh river delicacies.

456
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:50,870
His Highness

457
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,080
really has a peculiar temper.

458
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,720
Sealing Tianxiang Restaurant

459
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,200
and still sending us food.

460
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,560
Truly hard to believe.

461
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,080
Where is he?

462
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,270
Why hasn't he come?

463
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:03,680
I don't know.

464
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:04,870
His Highness only asked me

465
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:05,920
to bring these things.

466
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,150
So you mean

467
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,200
you also don't know when

468
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,270
Tianxiang Restaurant will be unsealed?

469
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,320
It doesn't matter.

470
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,320
I'll be going on a trip soon.

471
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,390
Go back and ask His Highness

472
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,440
to accept his grief and move on.

473
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,270
And when I return,

474
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:22,510
I will personally visit to thank him

475
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:24,560
for the fresh river delicacies he sent.

476
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,200
Alright, I will take my leave now.

477
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,110
Qing,

478
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,750
have you

479
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,200
felt bored lately?

480
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:55,960
No.

481
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,200
Don't disturb me while I tidy up.

482
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,680
Fresh goods easily attract bugs.

483
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,200
Didn't you always say

484
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,150
that you wanted to go out?

485
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,840
I'll take you to see the maple leaves.
How about that?

486
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:10,750
You're going out

487
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,960
just to see maple leaves?

488
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:14,720
Yeah.

489
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,960
Since Tianxiang Restaurant

490
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,840
is closed now,

491
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:21,230
we might as well go to Songyang Pass
to see the maple leaves

492
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,150
as a way to relax.

493
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,320
What's so great about maple leaves?

494
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:28,750
I'm not going.

495
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,510
Then I'll take you to eat something.

496
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,870
I'm sure it's ten thousand times
better than this.

497
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:33,200
Eat maple leaves?

498
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,800
Just come with me.

499
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,110
If it's not good, hold me accountable.

500
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,150
Just wait a few more days.

501
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,990
She will take you to a place.

502
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,200
Then you'll see how cruel she is

503
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,470
and everything will become clear.

504
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,510
Her so-called compassion and kind heart

505
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,080
is just a disguise.

506
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,110
No time like the present.

507
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,040
Let's set off now.

508
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,470
Let's go.

509
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,870
I haven't finished tidying up yet.

510
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,750
Cuiyan will do it later.

511
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:02,270
Let's go.

512
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,200
- Come on.
- Wait.

513
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,440
- No.
- Quick, quick.

514
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:18,160
[Residence of the Prince of Langya]

515
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:33,320
[Taotie]

516
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,040
Your Highness.

517
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,110
Come in and speak.

518
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,320
Is there anything unusual
at Tianxiang Restaurant?

519
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,630
Your Highness,

520
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,390
Tianxiang Restaurant is as usual.

521
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:52,560
But recently, Miss Zhu

522
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,680
might be going on a trip.

523
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,840
Did she say where she'd be going?

524
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,990
I don't know the specifics.

525
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,440
Brother.

526
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,600
Could Miss Zhu's trip

527
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,040
be related to Yangcheng Prefecture

528
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,990
that Mr. Tan previously mentioned?

529
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,350
But we don't know

530
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,230
the exact location
of Yangcheng Prefecture.

531
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,990
Yuanhe Town of Songyang Pass

532
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,510
is the only road
to Yangcheng Prefecture.

533
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,110
If she's heading there,

534
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:23,150
she will definitely pass through here.

535
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:23,990
In that case,

536
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,840
why don't we set off to investigate

537
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,270
and also look into the Taotie matter?

538
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,720
Sounds good.

539
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,840
Just at this time of the year,

540
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,080
you can enjoy the red maple forests.

541
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,150
I'll go make preparations.

542
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:43,640
Wait.

543
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,510
This time,

544
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,310
you don't need to accompany us.

545
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,190
Stay in the residence

546
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,390
to handle the affairs.

547
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:50,510
Yes.

548
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:51,240
By the way,

549
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,510
prepare a set of guard uniforms.

550
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,190
Yes.

551
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,150
Ai,

552
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:00,960
this time,

553
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,150
you are representing Father
to read the imperial edict.

554
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,550
Your identity's too high profile.

555
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,670
So, I have to trouble you

556
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:07,190
to disguise yourself as a guard.

557
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,950
Absolutely.

558
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,400
[Taotie]

559
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,030
Sachet pendants.

560
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,550
Take a look.

561
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:26,990
Buy one.

562
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,230
Miss Zhu.

563
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,640
Are your eyes uncomfortable?

564
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,710
It seems someone is following us.

565
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:46,920
Let's go the other way.

566
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,840
There's only one way out of town.

567
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:49,640
It will be fine.

568
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,310
The maple leaves here

569
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,310
are truly marvelous.

570
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,680
Qing,

571
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:31,920
do you like it here?

572
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,360
The fallen leaves are heartless.

573
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,120
Once,

574
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,990
I was also moved by this place.

575
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:12,360
Miss Zhu,

576
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,510
we've seen all the maple leaves.

577
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,550
Should we head back
to Tianxiang Restaurant?

578
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:22,510
It's rare for us to go out.

579
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,440
Why do you keep insisting on going back?

580
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,200
I...

581
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,160
It's getting late.

582
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,440
We should head back.

583
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,840
There's a delicacy
you haven't tried yet.

584
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,550
It doesn't make sense
to turn back halfway.

585
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,790
What kind of delicacy is it

586
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,920
that makes you think about it so much?

587
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:39,510
You'll know when we get there.

588
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,470
Let's go.

589
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,030
Miss Zhu,

590
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,880
this town is so eerie.

591
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,510
Are you scared?

592
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:20,840
I'm not scared.

593
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:22,600
It's just that the fog
is affecting visibility.

594
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,270
It's better for us to be cautious.

595
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,880
Don't worry, I'm here.

596
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,160
Miss Zhu.

597
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,400
There seems to be someone behind us.

598
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,750
Who could be out here
in the middle of the night?

599
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:37,750
Don't scare yourself.

600
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,200
Let's go.

601
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,360
When did Yangcheng Prefecture

602
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,230
learn the art of Qi Men Dun Jia?

603
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,990
But it hasn't mastered it.

604
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:08,880
Miss Zhu.

605
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,270
What is this?

606
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,840
These are the eight doors laid out
according to the Eight diagrams.

607
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,990
Among them, the Open Door,
Life Door, and Rest Door

608
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:15,840
are the three auspicious doors.

609
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,750
The Harm Door, Death Door,
and Fear Door

610
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,750
are the three dangerous doors.

611
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:20,750
The Delusion Door and Scenery Door
are neutral doors.

612
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,400
Miss Zhu,

613
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,680
are you alright?

614
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,400
I'm fine.

615
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,680
This giant crab claw

616
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,680
tastes a lot worse than Wuchang.

617
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,200
You said there are
dangerous and auspicious doors.

618
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,640
Why did you casually
push this door open?

619
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,400
This Eight Trigrams Formation
is just for show.

620
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:49,550
The only road to Yangcheng Prefecture

621
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,990
is through Yuanhe Town.

622
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,400
There's no need to waste time here.

623
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:53,880
This place is so dangerous.

624
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,080
We'd better go back quickly.

625
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,510
Let's go.

626
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:57,200
I'm not going back.

627
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,400
If you want to go back, go by yourself.

628
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:01,680
Who?

629
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:03,880
Heng.

630
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,400
Why are you here?

631
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,030
I heard

632
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:09,840
the red maple forest
is stunning in this season.

633
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:10,880
I came specifically to admire it.

634
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,400
I wonder why Miss Zhu and Mr. Chang

635
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
are also here.

636
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,030
I brought Qing here
to eat something tasty.

637
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,790
Since we've run into each other,

638
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:16,400
let's go together.

639
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,510
The door you opened

640
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:20,310
is probably the Fear Door,

641
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,230
located in the west,
associated with Metal.

642
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:24,270
Now during the Frost Descent season,

643
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,600
the autumn chill is severe.

644
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,880
It's better to be cautious.

645
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,750
This guard by your side

646
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,640
seems unfamiliar.

647
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,840
May I ask your name?

648
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,750
This is my second brother, Zhao Ai.

649
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,030
To avoid attracting attention,

650
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,510
he is disguised as a guard.

651
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,030
I am Chang Qing.

652
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,550
This is my manager, Miss Zhu.

653
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,080
Another Zhao family member.

654
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,840
Well, since you said the Fear Door
is associated with Metal,

655
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,790
among the Five Elements,

656
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,200
Fire overcomes Metal.

657
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,510
Qing,

658
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,510
draw some fire.

659
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,710
Draw fire?

660
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:15,750
